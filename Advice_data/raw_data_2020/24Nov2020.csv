0,"I’m in such a dilemma. On one hand I think this is such a stupid thing to worry about but on the other hand I am just so fucking mad at myself, at the world, for being born ugly. I cannot help but blame my huge nose for not even having a first kiss yet and I’m 18. Who would want to kiss a girl with a big nose? 
Another dilemma - nose job? On one hand I think it’s such a stupid thing to do, at the end of the day everyone looks the same... People with bigger noses have more unique faces and are more memorable... Nose job, what a superficial thing to do. Honestly I just want to embrace it, be confident and live a life free of any judgement from others, be happy because looks are not important anyway. I want to embrace my face and show to others that having a big nose is not something to be ashamed of. 
But on the other hand I cannot help but hate myself because of my face. Sight of me in the mirror often just makes me mad and it makes me wanna cry. Usually I just hit myself because I don’t know what to do. And I cannot help but think about how much easier my life would be with a smaller nose... I’m not saying I would be suddenly pretty but not having a big nose sounds nice. 
But actually getting a nose job opposes to my values. 
I just want to live in a world where looks are not important and people can actually live fulfilling lives doing things that make them happy... But with all these social media these days. I hate these apps and want to delete them because I cannot even process how stupid It is to post selfies on the internet. I think it’s so weird. The solution is obvious here - to delete all social media but at the same time I would have a fear of missing out.
That’s kind of messy but yeah, I don’t feel like that all the time but when I do it fucking sucks. 
I just wrote everything down, to let it out ig.
 (Also I don’t want to be mean in anyway to people with bigger noses or those with a nose job, these are just thoughts that are running trough my mind on a daily basis)",24Nov2020,1
1,"I'm 17, and this is my first job so I'm not entirely sure if i am or not. Also my step-mom works here too and is in charge of schedualing and hireing new employees. Also the owner is an idiot and doesnt do anything. I work at a restuarant, and I first started here as a cleaner/dishwasher then they needed another cook and so i started cooking and all the servers liked me and so did the owner. Everyone who ate my food said it was good too.  Nobody has even complained about me, and then one day my step-mom told me that she didn't need 3 cooks for the winter, and i live in wisconsin so i can understand that, but then the next day she had a new female cook to take my place.  I used to work everyday and now I'm down to 5 days a week, which isn't terrible but I'm being paid $8.00 to do just about everything here.  Also if something goes wrong while I'm at work it usually gets blamed on me. So am i being mistreated? and if so should i get a new job? or stay and hope it gets better? I'm honestly at a loss for what i should do considering its my first job and all.",24Nov2020,1
2,"Ive never worked with an agent so please bear with me!

I had contacted a travel agent today who emailed me a total of 3 times to inquire about what I’m looking for etc. She then said she’ll contact me again in 2 days once she’s put together some options.

I ended up being able to research and put together an itinerary myself, so I’d like to tell her I chose the hotel already and found a flight etc. The thing is that I still would like to see if she can get a lower rate, or even if she could just offer her insight on a few things (airport transfer, any aspects I may have overlooked). Is this rude of me? 

I’m not sure how it works, but I was hoping I could send her my desired hotel and flight but have her book it so she can still get a commission or something? 

Thanks for any insight",24Nov2020,1

5,"I'll try to be as concise as I can with this. Apologies in advance if this gets long-winded.
I was never a good student. I had a hard time getting engaged in it. I didn't make the grades to get involved in any extra curricular activities. I didn't really make any friends. At the end of my senior year, I didn't have enough credits to graduate, so I dropped out and got my GED. I did manage to get an AA degree after chipping away lite by little for about 6 years. I haven't pursued anything further, because failure in college can be pretty damn expensive, and it's a pretty big gamble for someone like me.
I work as a mental health tech. For anyone who doesn't know what that is, think back to all the movies you saw about mental hospitals. You may remember the men in white suits who maintain order on the units. They're often referred to as ""orderlies"". In the real world, those are Mental Health Techs. The pay is pretty meager, between 10 and 13 dollars. But, I get medical, dental, and a 401k. There really isn't any room for advancement without more education, like nursing. As stated above, school was never my thing.
The job has taken a pretty significant physical and mental/emotional toll.
I'm coming to a point where I've accepted it's too late to start a family. I'll never be able to buy a house. If my car breaks down, or have a medical emergency, I'm screwed. My father died when I was 17, and my mother has alzheimer's. I'm afraid I'll be alone soon.
I'll be 35 in 3 months. Is there any way for someone like me to flip the script this late in the game.

Thanks in advance",24Nov2020,1
6,"So, some background information first. I am an 18 year old male from the UK, and just started my first year of University this September. I haven't moved into accommodation (still live with parents, which is quite common at my uni apparently) and though I know some people who also went to the same one, I don't know anyone on my course very well beforehand, and with covid etc., there is little chance to meet in person.

Anyway, about a week or so before I started, I met someone from my course. He replied to my comment in a freshers Facebook group, and messaged me. He appeared similar age to me, and so we started a conversation on messenger. First thing I noticed was that he always messaged in lower case, and in a slightly incorrect version of English (sorta halfway between English and how Yoda talks), which I personally find annoying, but I let it pass as he could still be decent in person. He ends pretty mush everything he says with ""and that"". He also used really long messages, but I assumed it was as we just met each other and he wanted to tell me about himself.

So through the first couple of days I found we had similar interests, and he also told me that he has autism and dyspraxia, which may explain how he types? Coincidentally I also have autism, but not very severe- I did tell him that. He said that he doesn't always know if he's offended people because of that, fair enough, that is a symptom of autism. He also emphasized that he is EXSEMPT (always spelt like that in capitals, unlike the rest of his messages) from wearing masks.

Before I saw him for the first time in person at uni, he had been messaging quite a bit, loads more than anyone else I've known, and still messaged, even if I don't respond initially. He sent a message, which was the first time I thought something weird was going on, which said that he ""had a dream last night that we weren't friends anymore"". This was weird, given that we hadn't actually met in person at all yet, and had only known each other for 2 weeks. He also asked me to promise I wouldn't ditch him as other people had in the past apparently. I half expected him to be quieter/more normal in person, or a bit hard to talk to. How wrong I would be. On the first day, he talked to me like he messaged me, and in lectures turned to me while the lecturer was talking and would whisper things to me, usually that things were ""repeats for him"" as he's already been there for a foundation year. I just nodded and gestured that I was trying to pay attention to the lecturer. On that first day, he decided to go home for lunch, and I ended up going with a girl I'd just met for lunch. As soon as he'd left us 2, I got a text from him saying something along the lines of ""please don't ditch me, you can make other friends as long as you don't leave me, like I said, others have done in the past"". Okayyy.

So between then and now, he's continued to message me multiple times a day. I decided to ignore his messages for slightly longer each time to give him a hint. Bad idea. As soon as a few hours had passed, the messages would switch from the usual updates on what he's doing, to ""did i upset you sorry if i have"" and then to ""are we still friends and that didnt mean to annoy you"" and the same sort of thing every 10-30 minutes until I respond. Once I sent him the last message at midday one day, left him until evening the day after, and when I checked, there were 44 messages from him in just over a day, all saying the usual ""sorry if i upset you"" stuff. No that's not a typo. I tell him every time that he hasn't, but he just says that he doesn't always know if he has.

Also, he seems to complain about EVERYTHING, be it the weather, or people if the weather is perfect. Never stops going on about people not following the lockdown rules, and if anyone does even something minor, he messages me like, I just saw someone who was 1.999 metres away from someone, so I don't like them anymore (exaggeration but you get the gist). With how much he gets annoyed at everyone, I'm not surprised people have ditched him in the past. I'm genuinely confused how he hasn't gone off me, found me boring, or found something to be annoyed at me for yet.

Currently, I generally receive a message every day saying something along the lines of:
""morning how are you and that what u doing today and that horrible weather and that""
And the same around midday and in the evening, regardless of whether I respond. I've told him multiple times that he messages A LOT, and he acknowledged and slightly reduced how much he messages, but still at the very least 3 a day. What should I do about the situation. Ideally I'd want to stay on good terms obviously, but if I leave him, I don't know anyone else on my course- I have other friends but he's the only person I know from my course, and there's no opportunities to meet others as we never go in person now with the covid situation, and when we do, he sticks to me like a magnet. Honestly I have no clue what to do about him now, message him too much and obviously I end up in a long conversation with him, but message him less and he asks if he's upset or annoyed me every few minutes. I've told him loads now, and there don't seem like any other options.

TL;DR- Met a clingy guy with autism at uni, he gets annoyed at everything and everyone except me for some reason, and never stops messaging me, but he's the only person I know from my course.",24Nov2020,1
7,"I’m 17 year old female. I just moved from California to South Carolina in a small city. I finished High school early online so I could get it over with. I started working and I work about 28 hours per weeks and it’s exhausting with the pay being half what I would get in California. I’m on my feet for 5 hours minimum and the costumers are somewhat decent with the occasional horrible ones. I share a room with my disrespectful and messy sister who I always have to clean up after. I live with my parents and other sisters and the other older one is rude and disrespectful as well. I don’t know why my parents don’t kick them out. I miss my friends I have none here and I lost many connections and my phone barely has any texts or calls. Work is stressful and confusing at times as I work the register and don’t quite get everything and I also eat very little. I want to buy a car and move out ASAP which is why I got the job but I constantly think about quitting. I have some good qualities as I’m pretty, skinny and can be quite fun but lately I haven’t been feeling my best. I miss my old high school and friends and how I had a somewhat stress free life I would do anything to go back to that time in my life. I plan on going back to California for college but that’s not until I save up enough money which might take at least several months to a year.

8,"I (22f) just put the pieces together and I am absolutely fucking crushed. My mother (50f) has anorexia and has had it in all 22 years of my life. 

I grew up with it thinking thats just how she is. Constantly worrying about her weight, talking horribly about herself, and barely eating a thing. 

Eh, thats her. No worries.

She always made the best food for me but never would eat it herself. She has made up lies and excuses to not eat and that did not click in till right now. 

I moved out when I was 18 and just finished spending 4 days with her to be with my mum. She now ""has"" gluten problem and is now lactose intolerant. 

How could I have not seen it? 

She drinks heavily and smokes a lot. Jeeze, she gets wasted pretty easily and often. Not only does she not eat but she numbs the hurt. 

How did I miss this? 

She eats half a banana and one cracker a day. 

How did I not see this?

Everytime we have supper she made it look like she was eating. Until I finally noticed the signs and watched her more carefully.. everytime I'd look away shes feeding her food to the dogs. 

How did I not catch that?

Everytime we talk about how beautiful a lady is on TV or talk body positive, my mother excuses herself to the bathroom. This time I noticed she was getting upset, she goes to the bathroom and comes back with glossy cheeks and eyes. 

How. Did. I. Not. See. This.

She is physically and mentally destroyed and I doubt she wants to change her ways or ever receive help. Even if she did, I know she would lie about it.

11,"I was kicked out of college 2019-2020 for one semester (summer semester) due to chronic migraines. I filed an SAP appeal due to extenuating medical circumstances, because I was a minor an unable to receive medical care without parent permission, and I didn’t have that permission.

I came back, now with migraine medication, and as an 18 year old. Migraine free. 

After talking with 3 therapists, my ER team, my pediatrician, and a cardiologist (and having tests done with said cardiologist), the general consensus is that I have Panic Disorder due to abuse from my parents. 

After more doctor visits and therapy sessions: I also have dyslexia, Comorbid PTSD, and I was going to be evaluated for autism, ADHD, and schizophrenia. 

In trying to get a disability plan with the school, I had to submit to a hearing exam (not the ones you get for school, the kind that audiologists give you), and found out I have mild to moderate hearing loss. I now wear hearing aids. I am depressed about losing my hearing, someday not being able to hear my kids properly. I was given 5-8 years before I am profoundly deaf. 

I want to take this year to: learn ASL, get my drivers license, get an evaluation (for autism, ADHD, etc), continue therapy, and try anxiety medication.

I also can’t sit around and do nothing (then my parents would really have a fit). My only work experience is working part time at a restaurant for 6 months (had to quit because it’s inside the dorm). I never had issues at work except did occasionally charging the customer less (due to the dyslexia) and forgetting tasks (which I solved by taking notes on my phone).

Where do I go from here? I do want to go back to college someday. What can I do for work? I only made 3,000 a year at my first job. Should I go for part time so I have more freedom and time to do therapy, driving lessons, and learn ASL? 

Should I start working soon, or wait until January? And take these two months as a break? I won’t be able to go to therapy for these two months tho.

12,"So a bit of background.

My father has always been quite an asshole about money. When I graduated high school he threw a lawsuit at my mother trying to make her pay for a bunch of of expenses that he never communicated with her he was going to buy. He’s not rich but he’s definitely upper middle class wealthy. And he’s very stuck on image. When I got my license he bought me an older Mercedes and then a couple months later my brother a BMW, and that was one of the expenses he tried to make her pay half for when she has no where near the income he does. He also took my college savings and then when I fought him on the matter through court he disowned me. When it was all said and done court order said while I was in college he was required to pay a 1/3 my tuition and 1/2 of any medical bills since we don’t actually know how much savings I had prior to him clearing out the account.

Fast forward to today. Over the past three years I’ve had to fight to get out of his grasp whenever he tries to screw me over. He once hacked into my college services account and changed the password on me so I had to set up all kinds of barriers for him not to get in again. Another time my brother had an allergic reaction that he couldn’t breathe, he called my mother told her so and then hung up, ignoring our calls when we were panicking not knowing if he was alright or not. And due to COVID we weren’t allowed to go to the hospital so we were stuck at home worrying for hours.

And currently we are fighting him on paying a medical bill that he’s required by court order to pay. I don’t know how many times we’ve had to do this now. Here’s the kicker to him not paying the $131 bill, he’s currently buying a vacation home, most likely a large house with 4+ bedrooms in Florida but can’t afford to pay less than $150.

So what could I get him arrested for you may ask, he hasn’t done anything illegal albeit shitty. Well my father owns his own business but on the books he makes $40,000. He owns multiple vehicles, a boat, motorcycles, and on average goes on ~8 international vacations a year to all inclusive resorts. His fiancée works for him (she has two kids herself, one in college one recently graduated and I’m pretty sure their expenses were paid for though that is speculation) and they’re able to afford living in a very nice single family home in a community in a higher end neighborhood, go out to nice dinners and trips to New York, bars and banquets. Now does that sound like the lifestyle of someone who makes less than $800 a week? I’m not sure if I have enough evidence to do anything but I desperately want to report him to the IRS for tax evasion, he’s hurt me so much and I want to hurt him back in a legal way.

Am I the asshole if I try to report him for this? I mean my guess is that his income is closer to $200,000 a year, I’m not sure if the IRS even cares about someone that’s not a millionaire, nor do I have anything more than speculation so I cannot say if it would even do anything, but should I try?",24Nov2020,1

15,"Tl;dr - should i preemptively warn my club about a racist guy who may try to join? Is there a way to do this while being sensitive to his current fragile state?

I’m a mid-20s white gay man living in a big city in the USA. In normal times, I play sports with a local LGBTQ sports club; this is my main social circle as well. It’s a fairly diverse club (in gender, race, body type, age) and while there’s occasional instances of bigotry it’s largely a respectful and tolerant group. 

This past week, someone I didn’t know messaged me on social media; we had a bunch of mutual connections from my sports club, but it became clear that he didn’t actually know them. I’ve mostly ignored him but made a few token responses. Today, he made a post asking people whether they agreed with him that (tw virulent racism + fatphobia) “dirty dark skinned people, fatties, and curry-smelling Arabs” were all ugly and not worth dating. He then sent me a copy of the post. 

I responded trying to make it clear that I disagreed with him and found it upsetting that he’d shoved the language he did in people’s faces (some of our mutual connections are Black, Arab, and/or fat friends of mine). We ended up having a long, mostly frustrating conversation about this. It became clear that he’s new to my city and doesn’t know anyone, but is also gay and interested in my sport so he is trying to make connections that way. He also revealed that he’s been having a lot of panic attacks recently, experienced a lot of childhood abuse and trauma, and is a recent survivor of sexual assault. 

From a lot of what he said, i could tell he was in a lot of pain, and likely some of the vitriol he was spewing was lashing out in pain more than anything. That said, what he said was appalling (and got much worse than the initial post). I’d like to make sure that he doesn’t have free reign to continue spouting this harmful rhetoric in public spaces where it can hurt me and my friends, but I’m also worried that stirring up a group to ostracize him will drive him to harm himself (which he’s heavily implied) or people around him. 

What do I do? I’m trying to “do the work” of pushing back against racism while remaining compassionate, but I feel like he’s putting me in an impossible situation where either I push him away (and risk him harming himself) or I try to bring him in (and virtually guarantee he says or does something harmful to people in my community).

I’m curious though, What happens if I ask the bank to roll a payment to the back of the loan and instead save the money so I can make a double payment the following month?

Got pretty friendly with a coworker on a summer job, and really wanted to keep the friendship going when we both stopped work last month. So I reached out to her and we set up plans to get a couple beers the next day. 
The morning of though, she canceled, having found out one of her other friends had died the night before. I was of course very understanding and I let her know that I would be there for her if she needed anything, and then I basically decided to give her some space considering our friendship is semi new, and I know that she has lots of friends better suited to console her during this time.
My question though, is: when and how do I reach out to her? Do I even, or do I wait for her to? I really don't know how close she was to this friend so I'm not sure if I'm supposed to address it if I write her or if I should just attempt to make casual conversation..
My other dilemma is that, though I believe that our friendship is pretty good, it is also pretty new and I'm not sure that we're in a place where she'd even want to talk to me about it at all?

25,"So I am 17 male. My mom and step dad are extremely angry with each other and my mom said and also from what I see may be an impossible situation to recover from. I am falling apart. My mom divorced my father around when I was 11 because of his severe drug addictions. That one was not as bad as my mom mainly raised me anyway. Lately I have noticed I am in the worst point of my life, for the first time I started to have my gpa which is normally great slow down a bit. Among other issues I am starting to be myself again. This came out of nowhere. Last night they argued for 3 hours and my step dad wants to move out of state and crap and wants to go to the desert for thanksgiving. My mom is saying to him that he needs to understand how much family means to us and how we cannot miss thanksgiving nor move out of state for them. It is the next day and my mom said they both have no trust for each other. Personally he knows I am very modern and has criticized me many a times. But he tells my mom also that her decisions are dictated by me as he knows I am heavily against significant change at the moment with all the chaos going on. I do not fully trust him. Mainly since he has shown to be shaky. For example when things started getting better we went camping and he went crazy drunk one time and it got to the point where I was being held back as he pushed me and was cursing out my mom and throwing things everywhere.

26,"Hey everyone!

I have a friend who lives in the Vegas area who is very at risk when it comes to coronavirus, if they get it, it's highly probable they would die. This means they are required to take quarantine very seriously.

Her mother is inviting strangers over for Xmas (which also happens to be my friend's birthday). She has no place to go for Christmas, since these people will be getting off of a plane to come visit, which makes them a danger, so she is being forced out of her house.

I'm trying to figure out a way to help her. I offered to have her come home with me for Xmas, but I live in Michigan and she can't take planes. She doesn't really know that many people in the area she's at right now. This is my first time on this subreddit. Any ideas would be super helpful! 

Thank You!",24Nov2020,1

28,"This is my first reddit post so I apologize ahead of time for format. 

I (22f) finally put the pieces together after spending a weekend with my (50f) mother that she has anorexia. 

When I was young, mom made the best food but would never eat any of it herself. If she did, it was the smallest portion and she wouldn't even finish that. I never thought anything of it because I never seen her eat or behave any different. I didn't know that it wasn't normal. She would always tear herself apart, constantly pick on her own weight, try new extreme diets, and was incredibly harsh on herself. She hated pictures and herself. My mother also had ""special"" chocolate stashed away that she would never allow me to eat no matter how much I begged. 

How did I not notice this? 

Fast forward to over the recent weekend, I finally caught the signs and paid attention. 

Why did I take so long to hear my mother's quiet desperate cry? 

She only ever eats to the equivalent of half of a banana and a couple crackers a day.

How did I miss this? 

She cooks great food and even serves herself some. Takes one bite and says it's too salty and refuses to eat it. We thought she was just being irrational.

How did I not clue in? 

When eating supper, it appeared she ate. When I started to notice, I paid more attention. Whenever I looked away, she would feed her meal to the dog. Or she would go up to someone and say ""I'm stuffed! Have the rest of this, would hate to see it go to waste"" 

How did I not see the patterns? 

Whenever we start discussing actresses or body positive related conversations, she politely excuses herself to the washroom. When I finally clued in, her sister was going on a ""I don't care what anyone thinks of me anymore, I'll eat whatever I want!"" mantra, I noticed my mother was visibly uncomfortable. She politely excuses herself to the washroom and comes back in a flash with no sounds of a sink running or a toilet flushing. She comes out putting on her mask as I see the gloss in her eyes and on her cheek.

How the fuck have I not noticed this?

In the last year, she is suddenly allergic to gluten and dairy. 

Subtle but how did I not see around the lies?

On top of it all, she smokes and she drinks heavily. Huh, she sure gets wasted pretty quick. 

How did I not piece it all together? 

I cannot believe it slipped by me as ""oh, thats how she is"" all these years. All those silent arguments or snippy comments made by my father towards her. People making fun of her for eating like a bird. There was a close family friend that passed away when she was 57 due to eating disorder. However, that family friend did not smoke or drink on top of her disorder. After finally realizing it and remembering the sad passing, I am crushed. My mother is now 50 years old, deep in her ways, mentally and physically messed up, and there is most likely no way to help her. 

How the fuck did I fuck up looking out for my mother? Is it too late? What do I even do about this?",24Nov2020,1

31,"Sorry this is sort of a long post but there's a lot to explain. I could really use your help.

Okay so pretty much, I'm a 20 year old non binary person (biologically female), and I have been struggling through a lot of different things throughout my life.

I have been diagnosed with general anxiety and moderate depression, as well as mild atypical autism (which my psychiatrist is not 100% sure about, because there are a lot of different symptoms that point to different things, and I was going off to uni before they had a chance to explore the other possibilities.)(also have gender dysphoria but that's a less pressing issue)

I'm 5'1 and have had a shitty metabolism by chance due to genetics, so I've always been kinda chubby and self conscious about it all my life because I was bullied a lot in my school years, I am currently around 75kg. I don't have a lot of friends at all because I've been through enough of people's bullshit in my life to stay in toxic 'friendships' out of insecurity, I'd rather be alone. Long story short, I was done with putting up with shit like that and started standing up for myself a long time ago. The one thing I have always stood by is being myself and not letting anyone make me into some kind of socially acceptable clone because that's never really been me. (So edgy, I know..) And I've never made things simple for myself by just going along with stuff. (For example, it's not my choice to be non-binary, i just am, and don't know why either, and I wish I wasn't, as life would just be so much fucking easier. But I can't live my life pretending to be something I'm not, something I've never been).

Sorry that kinda got deep. Anyway, I also have iron deficiency anemia (diagnosed before I became pescatarian so it's not that) and I've been on several different iron tablets to try and solve it and it didn't seem to work, I don't know if I'm super tired because of that, or just because of the mental health problems (a lot of things kind of confusingly overlap like this.) 

I've never eaten /particularly/ badly, just most of the time I can't be bothered to make proper full balanced meals every day, so I end up just kind of not eating much at all but probably not being very balanced, getting things that are easy and quick because of the complete lack of motivation. I probably don't drink enough water either but I don't really get thirsty a lot. 

As I mentioned before, I'm tired much of the time and I really really want to be able to just go out and exercise and do things to keep me active, but I just find all of this so dull and activities are extremely difficult to stick to as everything I have ever been interested in sort of sizzles out after a short while, resulting in me just giving up. I kind of have mild agoraphobia too so I prefer to stay indoors but even then I find it difficult to stay active with home workouts, without ending up crying on the floor from how unfit I am physically.

I have had a shit delay of gratification for a long while and I can never stick to anything or concentrate unless it's something I truly enjoy, which because of the depression, is pretty short lived and rare. I'm on sertraline (SSRI depression meds) which help stop me from being overly emotionally irrational, however they make me fuzzy and I don't really get much of a sense of urgency for anything. So in my opinion and experience, it's the lesser of two evils. (Yes, I have tried different ones)

I have a very BAD relationship with motivation, and I NEED to be able to pull my shit together and work out at least a little and eat better so I feel better within myself. I NEED to be able to work well on my Philosophy degree, and I want to be able to keep an organised and tidy space for myself. 

I've tried a lot of different things, asking family members to help me stay on the ball, downloading motivation apps, meditating. I went to counselling every week for a year (free, courtesy of the beautiful but sadly underfunded NHS). I've tried to force myself to stick to routines, I've created timetables and lists and nothing at all seems to work for more than a day or two max.

I'm at a complete loss guys I don't know what to do any more, I want to have a better life and I have no idea where to start or how to keep it up. My parents haven't really ever been a good example either, (Not a bad example, just an unmotivated one) and they've never really forced anything on me and always been generally lovely people.(except my biological dad but I haven't seen him in years and he's an asshole, so let's just move on)

To anyone still even here, thank you so much for sparing your time to read through this. I just don't know what else to do.

If anyone has any advice or questions, or have been through/are going through similar things themselves, please share the things that help you, or the things you might think will be able to help me, I welcome any suggestions. (Except the obvious ""just be happy""/""think how lucky you are to be alive""/look from a different perspective"".

33,"Hey, 17 M from England. Me and my recent ex girlfriend were just talking about her issues with her life rn, since we've had alot of complicaitons between us recently with our relationship, and we are still talking and are both on the same page of trying to make things work. I let her know that I just want to be there for her and help her however I can, and I make a joke about suicide (yes ik dumb of me) and she says ""At least you haven't tried it,"" and I ignore it since I didn't wanna start talking about it to her, I didn't want her to feel as if she was forced to talk about it to me. After I ignore it, she then repeats herself, with the exact phrase again. I replied with ""I heard you say it the first time, just didn't think you wanted to talk about it, what happened?"" So then im thinking, maybe she wants to talk to me about it.  


When we get to talking about it she starts saying, ""I don't wanna talk about it,"" and I say to her, ""Well you brought it up twice so you wanna talk about it don't you?"" And then I ask her how long ago it was, and she says  it was almost 2 years ago that she attempted, and it was failed. Then I asked her why she felt like that, and she said ""I just wanted to die."" So I asked her what was happening around that time to make her feel like that and she said she doesn't wanna talk about it.   


If she is being serious about the way she felt and that she is still not okay to this day, then I want to help her as much as I can. I want to trust her but people faking mental illness is a common thing that people do my age, and I just found it suspicious that she repeats herself about mentioning it as if she wants me to talk about it, and then once I bring it up she doesn't wanna talk about it. She's even made jokes about her ""crazy ex"" who used to threaten to kill himself if they broke up, and surely if suicide was a touchy topic to her then she wouldn't have made little jokes about it to me?  


Im not saying that mental health problems don't exist, I just don't wanna put my work into someone that is just doing it for attention. I would normally trust her, but since going on the break she has been doing things to get my attention, like asking me what a good device for playing a game that she has never been interested in, that I happen to be addicted to. I go to my friends about this and they are telling me that it means that she just wants to be able to talk to me, and I can see that. Im just unsure of how she feels mentally right now and I don't want to mess up and take this all the wrong way.   


Any advice would be appreciated, really in need of it rn! Thanks :)",24Nov2020,1

36,"I am 18 year old female who got kicked out. Long story short, my ma went through my journal and found out I some things. The situation took a bad turn and we ended up fighting physically. To give some more detail, I used to get abused by my dad who would hit me out of anger and when my mom has come at me, she has that same look and I know she just hits to get her anger out on me. I can't go back, please don't suggest that. I'm not ready yet.

Before all this, my best friend and her sister and I wanted to move into an RV. That's still the dream. We're soul family and we're the only ones who understand each other.  See I'm an awakened soul along with them. We are open-minded and yes we may be into the spiritual aspect of life but there are no bad intentions. Our parents don't understand because they are more religious. Which is okay, but it's tiring living in a home where hiding your true self is the only way to keep the peace.

I am trying to still get to that dream but at the moment I am currently at my best friends parents who made it clear that I either move out or go home but that I'm not welcomed for a long time which I understand. I am trying to look for a temporary home where I can stay.

I feel scared and I feel alone. I feel like everyone looks at this awful person who hit her mom but that isn't true. I hate violence, I would never touch another person. I only was in that fight because I don't like being some one's punching bag. My mom isn't a bad person, I know that and I love her but I can't go back.

I am in Vaughan, Canada. I am also a full-time student with a part-time job. If you have any helpful advice, I would love it. If not, then that's okay too. If you're someone going through something similar, I'm sorry. I'm sorry you're going through that and I really hope things work out for you. If you need to talk, I would love to.

37,"Hi Reddit, 

I have a younger cognitively disabled brother in his twenties. He's a very decent trusting person, and able to hold a steady factory job, live semi-independently in his own home, drive a car, and do most day to day things with a little prompting. But he is also seriously and unmistakably mentally deficient. 

Unfortunately, a much older woman has been sleeping with him and giving him emotional intimacy in exchange for his paycheck. They spend it together on crack and coke. Our area has a drug problem, and this isn't the first time he's gotten caught up with bad people. This is also the second time she's been around. The woman is a local, unemployed, and middle-aged. We know her name and residence, and not much else.

The first time this happened we got him to agree to give us his paycheck for a while so there would be no money, and made him promise to send her away. 

It worked, but it didn't last half a year. My brother is a sweet guy, but sex and affection are a big deal to him, and we can't trust him not to lie to us. He also just has difficulty saying no to people and keeping to something over time. Right now he's holding it together, but we can tell his usage increased over the last few weeks and worry he's in danger of becoming an addict. The last time this person came into the picture he nearly lost his job, calling in sick to do drugs with her.

So what do we do? 

If we tip off the cops about her, we don't know if they'd do anything, or if she even has enough drugs at her residence to make an arrest. If they do something, we also don't know if my brother might get swept up in it. We only know one police officer on a personal basis, who is a great guy, but though we haven't spoken to him yet neither my brother nor the woman are in his jurisdiction. If we send my brother out of state for a month and then tip the cops he might not have a job when he came back, and that job has been his lifeline. 

If we confiscate all his money and maintain constant vigilance over his petty financial dealings, that might do it. But then he's always in danger of her showing up again. My brother is a legally emancipated adult, so that only works so long as he agrees. 

My brother is in danger of screwing up his life in a permanent way, and this is driving my gray-haired saint of a mother to distraction. 

Is there anything we can do?",24Nov2020,1

42,"I can't imagine not talking to him anymore. I feel guilt and this sense of sadness not speaking to someone who has defined my life for 2 years.  At the same time, the idea of marrying him scares me these last 3ish months. Never did before in these last 2 years.

I keep focusing hard on incompatibilities. For example, I'm boring sexually , just want loving p in v and oral sex, maybe some blind folds. He wants to lick my ass/anal, finish on my face and boobs.. He's never made me orgasm. I can tell he sees pleasuring me as a chore for more than 5 minutes, maybe 10 times, he's tried a full 30 mins to get it to happen. Foreplay is often short with ""are you ready yet?"" being asked, it's just a boring step for him I guess. 

There's a mental illness he won't get help for nor a diagnosis. The first time it really hit 1.5 years ago, I let him unload on me for like an hour a day at least, for weeks. Even when what he thought hurt or scared me. I asked him to stop after 6ish weeks cos I was miserable. Had to threaten to leave a few times to get him to stop, was so ugly. I was insecure for a few months after. Things were mostly normal for many months and I was happy again but it came back hard late spring and most of summer. I really had it and insisted he get help and diagnosed. We fought about this almost everyday for 2 months in summer. Its still there and I know it'll probably strike again.

Thing is, I've been stuck at home with my family since mid-March because my college is online until fall 2021 and I lost my job a few weeks prior to the pandemic, I'm still job searching.

I just genuinely overall feel good. Last year I left a 3 year abusive relationship, which was also my first serious thing with someone, so maybe I just have low standards for relationships, but I love this person dearly, more than I ever have loved anyone else. 

Recently, they forgot their shirt at my place. When I mentioned it they told me I could keep it since they bought a replacement already anyway. And I was never one to obsess over how a person “smells,” as long as the person I was talking to maintained their own personal hygiene and didn’t smell awful, it was fine. I never liked to keep my partners’ clothing for their “smell,” I guess, and I’ve never noticed a partner’s specific scent. I had been planning on returning the shirt despite them saying they didn’t need it, and I was going to wash it before I did. But It’s been maybe a week now and I keep the shirt under my pillow every night because it smells exactly like my partner. I smell it anytime I miss them, which happens a lot, or even just when I remember that it’s there. It’s become a comfort object of mine. It’s one of my favorite things that I own, even though it isn’t exactly mine. I don’t even wear it or anything, I just keep it around. Is this weird/obsessive/creepy? I’ve never experienced this before. I feel like a total creep. They know I have it. I’m not hiding it from them. It’s not some kind of fetish thing or whatever either. I just like it.

This is the lowest low I’ve had in about 5 years (and definitely 2.5). I’ve had my medicine doubled to the max dose, and I’m still only having good days 30-50% of the time.

So, I think an anxiety service animal might be something I should look into.

I work two jobs, but I should have time to walk it at least three times a day outside of working ties. I’ve had a special needs dog for five years, so I know the dog basics. I worked with horses for five years, including training them, so I’d be prepared for that too. I already feel better when I have my cat, but she can’t come places with me because it would stress her out.

I would want:
•to be laid on when I’m having an attack
•a reminder to take my medicine
•something to not let people touch me without my seeing them
•a reason to go outside/get out of bed instead of sleeping 12+ hours
•something to stop me from hurting myself when I have a meltdown (hasn’t happened in 3 years, but it’s scary bc I have no control)
•to touch something grounding when I’m doing public outreach and meeting 800+ people a day
•idk something to hold when I’m sad

But my relationship with my mother has become destroyed to say the least. She doesn’t look me in the eye anymore, she looks utterly defeated whenever I see her it pains me so much. She blames herself for how I feel and even though I explained to her that it’s not her doing at all, she’s still struggling with so much self hate. I overheard her speaking with my dad and she was saying that she’s lost her purpose and that SHE wants to die now. I break down nearly night since then wishing I didn’t tell my mom about how I felt. My mom and I used to be so close and now she only talks to my younger sister (she’s 12 years old) and my dad. I honestly feel like I ruined her life and I don’t know how to repair my relationship with her. I’ve been doing all the chores and I’m buying an expensive purse for her for thanksgiving but idk. 

Asides from that, I was on her computer recently and “how to leave a cheating husband” came up when I was looking for something. I always had my suspicions but having it confirmed basically broke me.

I love my dad, he’s supported me and been there for me my whole life and even though I hate that he did this to my mom, I still love him. And I feel like I’m betraying my mom for that. Then I found out through my aunt that my mom is actually planning on moving back to the philippines, her home country, to live with her family there. I dont know the details or if she plans on taking my little sister or me but probably not. And I guess it’s a safe bet that she’s not taking my dad.

She evidently had a big reason to say no, she's been taking to someone that been overseas and still will be for the coming year. When I was reminded of this I was repulsed and saddened that I would simply overlook that, I played myself. Since then she's rightfully stopped taking to me, and I've just been distraught, less so then she's probably been, and my actions following this has disturbed her. The following week after asking her out, I constantly would leave my workstation and go to hers' and instead of talking I would just stare. I stopped after she told a mutual friend, who then told me what i had been doing. Infact, I've stopped trying to actively interact with her entirely and try to only say a greeting  and stay in the station I'm in unless I need to for break or taking over for someone else. It's been a month, and I'm still emotionally, and I hate it. I thought the sadness of ruining a friendship for my own selfish thoughts was bad, I betrayed a friend, I betrayed her trust. Usually I would say I have a decent gauge of my emotions because I have to be, I'm depressed and go through volatile mood swings, so I don't lash out at others, this feeling is to much. I can take being angry at myself, I'm used to it, but I cant take being mad a her. After all it's my fault, I'm the one would thought that it would be okay to ask out someone that's in a relationship, it's my fault that the fantasy of a romantic relationship with her was more tempting then the one we already had as friends, yet I'm. I've said recently that I would still like to try being friends with her to our friend. I don't think I can, or that I deserve it, I'm doing more harm then good. I'm scared, and angry, but why? I did this to myself,right.

Tl;dr I ruined my friendship because I couldn't get rid of  my crush on her. I'm angry and don't know why",24Nov2020,1
52,"My now ex-girlfriend messaged me Friday saying she lost feelings and wanted a break to see if she would get them back. I accepted but on Sunday ended the relationship as she wasn’t getting the feelings back and she even said “ You’re not the one” 

It was only a month ago she made a jar with the reasons she loved me in and stopping at her house carving pumpkins and enjoying each other’s time. 

This is a common occurrence in her past relationships as they would end between 4-6 months of getting together. 

She said I am everything she is looking for and wishes I was the one and hates that this is happening but she can’t help it and she doesn’t know why. 

She said she’s going to keep the teddy that symbolises me and she admitted to still sleeping with it. 

I blank her paragraph last night ( her explaining she’s sorry and wishes I was the one) and today she had messaged me accusing/asking me if I am messing around with her internet (Ddos I’m guessing) she said “ Don’t get angry I’m just eliminating the possibilities”

55,"I don't even know where to start. I guess I'll introduce myself. I am 20 years old guy living in Spain. I'm actually studying a marketing degree in college and I completed a marketing and advertising higher education degree (higher education degree is the most accurate english translation I found for 'grado superior' which is what we call it in Spain) in June, which I started in 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

My life is pretty normal, I have good friends which I spend time in the weekends with, I go to online classes because of COVID-19, I play video games, I have some online friends and I have a lot of interests and a huge thirst of knowledge about a lot of topics like technology, businesses, economy, science... I'm the average 20 years old dude.

&amp;#x200B;

I started my first job back in August 2019 and left it last October because it was exhausting and very dangerous as I was working all the time with boiling oil and hot-like-hell meat grill. I only went to work on weekends because I had to study the rest of the week. It was fine, I was making my money and being able to buy things I never had was a good experience.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had a good self steem because I didnt like my body. I've had overweight all my life until 2019. In 2019 I got an ankle luxation and after that I started doing a lot of exercise and lost a lot of weight. Now I'm thin and my self steem has boosted a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

My health is good (to my knowledge), I do sport everyday, I socialize everyday, I research about thing I like, I eat healthy food everyday, I drink 1,5 liters of water everyday... maybe I'm not the healthiest guy in the planet but I do a great effort for maintaining my weight on point and self steem high.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you know a bit about me, I'll start talking about what I feel.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all I feel I am very lucky and I am very grateful too, because I didnt lose any relatives to COVID-19 and everyday I thank whatever there is up there ruling the universe.  I do whatever is necessary for reducing the COVID contagion risk to the minimum. I rejected a lot of plans and I basically had one of the loneliest summers of my life because my friends arent as concerned as I am about COVID.

&amp;#x200B;

I consider myself a very optimistic and happy person. For me, there's no problem without solution and I'm always smiling and trying to make people laugh. I like to help other people and I hate to see anyone, no matter who, sad, specially my family. I do everything I can for keeping everybody happy and motivating them.

&amp;#x200B;

But there's something inside of me that I had never experienced before this year. I feel so empty and lonely. I don't know why but I started feeling this back in June, specially after spending half my savings in a computer that now, by no means I regret buying.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my life makes no sense in this world. Everyday is the same as the previous one. And days are going away too fast. I feel like I'm not doing enough. 'Enough for what?' you may be asking yourself, well I have the same question. I can't find a purpose for my life. I feel that other than my family nobody really cares about me.

&amp;#x200B;

I can be in a room with all of my closest friends and still feel I'm alone. I don't even know how to explain it. Everything I do feels useless for me. I want to do a lot of things but I don't find the energy nor the motivation for getting started.  I feel I'm late to the party of Life and I am scared as hell of what future is awaiting for me. I'm scared of not achieving my dreams and goals and end up living a life of emptiness and helplessness.  I have a lot of dreams, so ambitious that whoever I tell to about them would laugh at me.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't find my place here. I feel like my life makes no sense and that I can't do anything for solving it rather than sitting in front of my computer and waiting. That's what I do most of the time, browse reddit in my phone, play games in my PC and sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think there are 2 things that contributed to make me feel like this:

&amp;#x200B;

1. My sleep schedule has been fucked up for years. I sleep an average of 5-6 hours a day. I tried to change this habit but I just can't. 
2. I got rejected by a girl in 2016 and I still love her. \[I made a post here  about it a few months ago\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hpq3an/i\_still\_love\_the\_girl\_that\_rejected\_me\_4\_years/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hpq3an/i_still_love_the_girl_that_rejected_me_4_years/)) and talking about it with other people really helped me a lot. But now I think about it, I think about what I am and I think that no one will ever feel true romantic love for me. I just can't imagine anyone falling in love like I did with that girl. I can't think that anyone will ever talk or think about me like I talk about that girl in the linked post.

I think those 2 reasons are the main ones of why I feel like this. I also think it could be my age. I don't find a reason for living. I'm not talking about wanting to  suicide (I had several suicidal thoughts in 2014 and even searched for painless ways to do it, but I can proudly say that I overcame that situation). I just don't find a reason for me existing. What am I supposed to do here? Like I said I consider myself a very happy person, but that's when I have a distraction or something that entertains me.

&amp;#x200B;

When I am alone with my mind and no distraction my unhappiness comes out. I start questioning myself, my life, my choices, where am I heading to... that's when I realize how alone I am, or at least how alone I think I am. Who am I and what is my purpose? I fight really hard for discovering it but I just can't, even though I've been trying for years. I can't even find words for expressing what I want to say. Please help me because all I feel is emptiness and fear of the future. I think that a good example of what I feel is this phrase from the song 'Knocking on Heaven's Door' from Guns N' Roses: 'It's getting dark, too dark to see'. Thats how I feel my life is right now. Slowly fading to black. And I feel like I'm knocking on Heaven's door but nobody opens up. 

&amp;#x200B;

59," The other day, i ended an on and off relationship with someone i had very deep feelings for.

When we met all was so good and we clicked instantly and it was so fun, but then i (F 22) watched him (M23) slowly sink in his depression and the talking got less and less. i later found out that he had recently lost his girlfriend and needed time.

i gave him time. all the time he needed. the times i spent with him were all hot and cold, on and off, weeks without talking, then him popping back in my life. and i thought i was okay with it because i thought that the great guy i met would come back.

until when he said that he can never be in a relationship with me because i became his emotional rebound and i remind him of a dark time in his life, and that he's a very busy person and in his situation he can only cause pain. i kept asking him what if things were different if we tried again? did i do something wrong? why couldn't it be me? and he said he didn't want to hurt me anymore. it's not me, it's life. he said he treated me badly and he said i deserve so much better than him.

i deleted him from everywhere because we agreed it would be for the best. it was clear that i couldn't handle being just friends with him although that's what he wants.

i am sad and heart broken, but i am starting to realize that i was so stupid, naive, and selfish to think that i could fix someone who needs to fix theirself. the situation was too much, and no one should go through that.

it hurts if you put yourself out there like that; put others' feelings ahead of yours and forget that your feelings are important too.

but the things is, i don't why i keep feeling like i need to go back to him and fix things, and maybe torture myself to stay. he thinks i'm obsessing over him because he was in the same situation as me before.

62,"I can't believe I'm making this post, but I figured why get not an extra opinion. I'm not really upset about anything, and I don't need words of encouragement/a pep talk, just genuine advice.

I didn't have a great father figure growing up
 My dad has all the symptoms of aspergers/autism, and it runs in my family so we're all of the opinion that he's likely autistic as well. But regardless, he definitely isn't really a manly guy or the protective type at all. 

When I was young, I definitely encountered some mean kids, but the worst was when I was younger with a family friend's kid, a pretty big kid, who forcefully dunked my brother and I when we were all in a pool together, not fully drowning us of course, but basically doing the equivalent of beating us up in the pool.

Going into 9th grade, I lost my friends because I stopped hanging out with them cause I felt they were treating me poorly by teasing me and the like, and I got mad at them/fought back, which just made things worse as they enjoyed seeing my reaction. Then the rest of my highschool career I continued to get a lot of flak for various other reasons, and was generally treated poorly/low on the totem pole. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't a total loser, but since I lost most of my friends after freshman year, it made it more difficult.

Fast forward to junior year of college, I had the absolute worst roommate in the world. A guy who took advantage of my niceness, had his girlfriend over all the time without asking me, and was generally just a massive jerk. Dealing with him was a whole debacle, but I'll leave the story for another time. He wasn't bigger than me, and was more of a loser/beta male than me in a lot of ways, but I let him walk all over me essentially and never put my foot down, so that definitely did a number on my confidence (frankly, I'm not sure how much of it had to do with me being a coward per say or me just being too nice/wanting to avoid confrontation).

I have some more stories, for instance at one of my last jobs one of my coworkers, a giant guy, did a small play slap to my face. My other coworker said to me ""you're gonna let him treat you like that? You're a grown man"" to which I replied that he was just joking. I remember something similar happening in highschool when a kid untied my shoes and messed with me during driver's ed and instructor told me to standup for myself. I guess from my perspective, I didn't see it as being that big of a deal in both cases. 

I've just continually found myself in situations where I'm the guy who is made fun of and not respected. I've been criticized and teased for literally everything you can imagine. I don't wanna make it seem like I've never had any friends or that I've always been uncool, because I managed to make a ton of friends in college and be fairly charismatic, but I've come to really see myself as a misfit. 

I really do think that people take one look at me and see me as a beta male or something. I'm around 5'11-6'0, but I look somewhat young and I've gotten a fair bit of jokes about looking like a lesbian before. 

I of course could be in better shape, so I've been doing some basic bodyweight exercises to gain some more strength, with the eventual goal of buying some home equipment or getting a gym membership. And losing weight is another long term goal of mine, I've always had a few extra lbs. 

I'm aware being muscular is not what makes someone a man. But I also know it won't hurt to stop being a skinnyfat weakling, and I'd definitely benefit from the discipline alone. And also, I am working on a career, albeit slower than most, but I'm aware I can't live the rest of my life as a NEET. I guess I just need some general advice, considering I didn't have a role model growing up to give me any. Thanks",24Nov2020,1
63,"My Mom is the hardest working person I know and does not get compensated for the time she puts in. For example - she works over 40 hours, and receives calls all weekend to help others.

She finally asked for a raise after our family begged her to stand up for herself but her boss keeps “forgetting” and says he will “think about it more”.

67,"I (17f) have never really gotten along with my mother. She’s said some horrible things, I’ve said some horrible things. 

We had a big argument earlier and I think I reached my breaking point. I realized that I can literally just move out as soon as possible and never talk to her again. I don’t particularly want to do this, but she’s sat in her bedroom and avoided me all day and it’s genuinely been the most peaceful day I’ve ever had. As bad as it sounds, I don’t really want to “make up” with her if all my days can be this peaceful going forward. I’d rather our house be completely dull and silent than filled with our arguing.

I have some bad anxiety problems which have led to a heart/blood circulation condition. I suspect that my mom is the primary cause of my anxiety but she gets angry whenever I bring it up.

Today has been such a relaxing day— I never even knew I could have days this relaxing. Not having to be “on guard” for every sound of footsteps or voices is so freeing. The absence of  my anxiety today was really noticeable. I felt like an adult, my own individual person.

The problem is that I also feel really numb. If I decide to just cut my mom out of my life it will definitely ruin my family, but at the same time the thought of having to deal with her forever just makes me feel so... hopeless? I don’t really know the word for it but I just feel like I’m standing in the middle of a concrete gray tunnel and both sides just go on infinitely. Even if I walk for years I’ll never escape the tunnel.

I’ve grown resentful towards my dad and my siblings because they just don’t understand. They listen to me rant but I can tell that they think I’ll change my mind in the future. Everybody in my family treats me like a stereotypical “hormonal teenager” and nothing I ever do is validated.

I don’t even know if I’m overreacting to the arguments I have with my mom, but at the same time I’m so done with the arguing and trying to convince myself that I was overreacting, or that I wasn’t overreacting. I’m so done overthinking these arguments and all of that. I just don’t want to argue anymore. I’m so mentally tired. So mentally tired. She ignores me for a couple days after every argument we have and falls into a depression-like state. I don’t want to cause her depression but I’m tired of having to fight for her attention or grovel for her forgiveness for her to even look at me.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to make my family take me seriously and understand that I’m so close to just cutting them out of my life for good, but when I explain this to them they just keep pushing me. They don’t believe me.",24Nov2020,1

Then I saw the gunman run down a hill, get inside the parked vehicle, and the car drove off...

73,"Hi everyone. This is my first time posting on this subreddit that I stumbled upon a week or so ago.  I am going to try my best to explain my situation as it is, since I am not much of a writer please bare with me. 

So I have learned that I have a very weird attachment style to the people closest to me and that I get very involved and expect to be included in the lives of those closest to me on a constant basis. I have a very small circle and my best friend who is also my closest friend and the only person that I share most of my feelings and secrets with recently began dating a new guy. They both seem very happy, and honestly I am very happy for her. However, due to this I have begun to feel that although she isn't distancing herself from me her attention is more divided, I guess. Like she takes longer to text me, she doesn't really meet me as often and when she does her mood is really influenced by him. Also small things that she does, like for example when we are talking she will check her phone for his replies, or tag him in pictures I took of her make me angry. She also doesn't show much interest in seeing me anymore, like out of the week she will see him 2-3 times. I know this sounds horrible and petty when I say it out loud but again, this is why I am here. 

Another thing that also made me angry was that I spent a really long time trying to find her the right birthday presents (it was a bunch of things, some which were related to memories, or jokes or just things she liked. I actually spent a few weeks trying to think up of the perfect presents). I also spent hours writing her a card. However, I noticed that she did not open it for 2-3 days, and when she did she did not even read the card. Her boyfriend on the other hand gave her some of his used clothes and she took that all the way back to her country in the break, but left my presents and card unopened with me till she got back. (she still hasn't picked them up). 

I also had multiple arguments with my parents so I could hang out with her, let her stay over when she did not have a place, and many other things. However, nowadays it seems like she doesn't even want to spend time with me. When I notice things like this it makes me really upset that some friends would forget about their closest friends just for a boy. I don't know if I am being petty but I have always had this weird attachment style and I do not know how to fix it. For instance, when I was younger I would get 'jealous' when my mom gave attention to my other siblings or my school friends. This also occurred when my high school best friend moved to a different university and began making new friends. 

I find it difficult to accept that all my closest relationships who I truly care about will move on in life and find someone closer to them like a spouse, or a child, or even a new friend. This makes me upset and I spent a lot of time crying about this. I also have stopped speaking to my best friend because I prefer to be the one to detach first.

76,"Hello everyone, 

Background: 
  After my (18F) father died (50F), my mother got into a relationship fast with a man we will call sheep. At first, Sheep was a great guy but he slowly took advantage of the fact that we had no family in America and that my dad was dead. He slowly made my mom cut off her friends so that she would have no one but him. 

I was 10 at the time but Sheep slowly became abusive in every aspect. He would slap me, spit on my mother, break plates, scream at us, he forced his religion on us, and didn’t allow us to have contacts on our phones, or  social media. He constantly went through our phones to make sure we had no proof that he hurt us or anything against him. On the outside, we looked like a wonderful family so no one had any suspicions about what happened inside our home. 

  When I turned 16, my mother and I had saved enough money to secretly return to her home country and we never looked back. About a year ago, I returned back to America for college and I think Sheep found out and now he’s been contacting my mother saying he is going to take us back with him. We have no proof that he’s abused us so we can’t file a report and he won’t stop contacting us with fake accounts. How can we tell him to nicely leave us alone and that my mom is done with him?",24Nov2020,1

And the fact that he started talking to his ex girlfriend again. They work together, and after a 13 hour shift they hung out in the parking lot at her place. He decided to ignore my text messages when they were hanging out and didn’t even give me a heads up. Keep in mind I was coming over that night. He stated that she just knew his family drama better than I did and that’s why he decided to talk to her about it. Next morning when we wake up he gets a Snapchat from her and he won’t open it in front of me, which is fine it’s his phone but doesn’t see anything wrong with him officially talking to her again. Fast forward we were still arguing the week after and we didn’t talk much the day before he was supposed to come over. So when I texted him on the Wednesday if he’s coming over still he replied with a no. I tried calling him to ask why and he ignored my call. So I look at where he’s at because I know he wasn’t working and he was at her place. Apparently he wanted to talk to her because she could help him understand how to communicate better. With no response to my texts or calls I ended it right there and then. Turns out instead of trying to talk to me he ignores me for a couple hours. When I then just found out when we met up to talk, he ended up having sex with her because he thought he lost me. Fast forward to yesterday when we met up, he apologized and said he has never cried over anyone before and that he wishes he could take it all back and how much he loves me and how he was so scared because of how fast he fell for me... I love this guy and I obviously am pissed but I told him we can re visit in a months time and see if he’s worked on himself and if we could make this work. Am I stupid for thinking of taking him back?? Honestly I’m too embarrassed to tell my friends about this and idk what to do. Any advice helps!",24Nov2020,1

81,"My girlfriend and I live in an apartment and we have an elderly man who lives in the apartment below ours. We see him all the time, and when we first moved into the place he was a very nice, helpful neighbor. 

Recently though, he's been acting very... creepy. One night, a month or so ago he told my gf that he was in love with her and really freaked her out. She told me and made me promise to not start anything with him. I promised - after all, he'd been nothing but friendly in the past. 

But tonight, he tried it again. This time, he even invited her inside and then got angry with her when she declined. I'm pretty angry with him and ready to rip him a new one, but I don't know if/how I should. What should I do, Reddit?

For context, both my gf and I are in our mid-twenties. The neighbor in question is in his seventies, an alcoholic, and is battling cancer.",24Nov2020,1

We all get yelled at or treated awful for brining up problems to my boss. This resulted in 4 other employees and I to quit.

83,"I've been ruminating on my relationship with my ex, which she ended not me, if the title misguides you.

During our relationship there were instances in which I was deeply disturbed and felt the urge of breaking up with her, however I'm a fool and I don't use my brain to think, I use my heart, so every time I convinced myself that those were minor things and I could change for her.

Here is a list of these instances

1. She and I were in a relationship years ago, she came back to me 7 years later and wanted to get back together. When she found out I had sex with another girl in those 7 years she became extremely mad at me, despite that relationship being just sex friends and nothing more, I didn't even talked with that girl anymore when she came back. She was extremely mad and didn't speak to me, and I became mad at her for that, since she had no right to be mad at me for something like that. 
2. I'm an extremely familiar person, one of the core values of my life is that I wanted to be close to my family, all my family is old and I fear for them to get hurt if I got away, I'm usually helping them with lots of stuff to make sure they don't get hurt or robbed. However she called me a ''mommy's boy'' for that, and refused to live near my family in our near future. This was probably the most hard sacrifice I made for her, as it involved changing one of my core principles in life I didn't want to change, yet I agreed to go live with her to another country once I finished college.
3. Sometimes I like to have some time for myself and play video games or do other stuff, this was not the entire day, just a few hours a day, nor it was every day, yet she wanted to spend every hour she had free with me and made me choose between her and my own personal time. I once again ceded on this.
4. She got mad that I spent time with my friends a few days on the week. Once again I didn't stood my ground, I know I'm pathetic. 
5. During our 1 1/2 year distance relationship, I had one, and one single selfish spending, which was purchasing a new computer because my old one broke up, and I couldn't fix it. I ignored every other need or desire I had, I stopped buying myself clothes, sweets, and even delayed some minor medical needs to save money, I also don't have a TV but I didn't bought one to save money to short distances. She got extremely resentful for this and even throwed me in my face that while she could have come visit me she would rather buy herself a new laptop. 
6. Since I wasn't performing good enough in college, she told me to change careers, this proved to be a horrible mistake as I thought, I believed this sacrifice to be the last ditch effort to save our relationship, and I put all my effort on this new career path, however she choose to leave me anyways.

on hindsight she was very selfish on our relationship, but I don't know if this is me talking post break up pain or do I actually have a reason, to believe that I dodged a bullet with her.",24Nov2020,1
84,"I am a wedding planner. My services are different from most in the industry. I am all-inclusive. For example, you (the client) book me. We work together to curate your perfect vendors. You pay me the sum total of the entire event (photographer, videographer, officiant, reception, etc., etc.) and I pay out your vendors. It works for my company. It also helps that I’m in a destination, so it really helps out my clients and makes it more convenient for them. 

For a while, I’ve had a primary photographer who I recommend to everyone. This person—we’ll call him Steve—was the photographer for 90% of my weddings. He was making so much money off me. In return, he gave me rights to photos for my website at no cost. I naturally gave him credit at the bottom of the site. It was a symbiotic relationship for both of us. 

A little backstory: he and I were good friends. Not best friends, but close. He and I would go to lunch at least once a month, we were invited over to each other’s parties when we had them, he was in my wedding—my man of honor. 

About 5 months ago, I rebranded my entire company. I paid about $7,000 to rework my website. Still used all his photos, as usual—his pictures are just right on brand for my company. 

About 2 weeks after the website and rebrand was finished, he sent an email saying that he would only be booking directly with couples moving forward. That’s fine. His business. He can do what he wants. Since my business works in a completely different way, I had to replace all his photos. I can’t actively advertise for him because I can’t book him. If my clients see those photos on my site, they may want to book him, but they’d have to do it separately. 

So I spent another $500 replacing all the images on my site with other photographers I’ve worked with. I realize that I backed myself into a corner by only using his photos on my site, but I am not upset about that part, though it was super inconvenient. 

Here’s my issue: Why didn’t he come to me? We see each other once a month for lunch. He was my man of honor. We were supposed to be friends. Why didn’t he tell me in person instead of some one-lined quickie email? On top of all that, I learned through another planner friend that HE IS STILL BOOKING DIRECTLY WITH OTHER PLANNERS! 

So he didn’t want to work with me any longer. That’s also fine. But why lie? Why not bring it up to me in person? 

He continues to message me like we’re still friends, but I’m out... should I bring it up? Should I let it go? I’m at a loss... I don’t get it. My husband has said for years that he is not my friend. Now I see it, but should I say something to him?",24Nov2020,1

He says he is trying to make everyone welcome, I say that he is allowing himself and his unit to become associated with bigotry if they allow these people to play and don't ban them. He says they have discussions frequently about how to act and have told these people before that they cant say that stuff. I wonder how many chances you give people to learn. He says they allow all people to play and he thinks a black person, a muslim, etc would feel comfortable in their unit but I disagree because it seems like every day they are having to shut down some vocal idiot about something. He thinks you shouldnt kick people out because they need other perspectives. I say that he isnt doing enough to make sure they are getting a perspective that doesnt feed into their bigoted ideals. Its a weird point of contention for us right now. Advice and opinions on the situation are much appreciated.",24Nov2020,1

89,"(18M) I'm finishing up my first semester of college and even though things were going really well for me for the first month or two, I really fell down a hole of lost motivation and sociability among other things. To be completely transparent here, my grades are awful, I haven't submitted a single assignment in about a month and a half's time, so I've practically sabotaged myself as far as college goes. But as far as moving back home, my mom has been very supportive and encouraging as far as my future goes since she herself never even finished 9th grade. Where I'm struggling is coping with the fact of moving back home and of failure, I'm a strict perfectionist and anytime I've failed or come close to failing in life I get really depressed and suicidal, to put it bluntly. Which is exactly what's been happening these last few weeks, not only with feeling like I've failed my family and myself, but especially with feeling like I have no future and that I'll have to revert to being dependent on my mother again, which I don't want. On top of this, my mom is very homophobic and against anything LGBT-Related, which doesn't necessarily effect me but with my sister being Bisexual and my aunt being Gay, it's hard for my mom to keep her mouth shut. When I was living there I couldn't bear to listen to my mom spew her hatred constantly. I've even picked up a bit of crossdressing and experimentation with my gender identity in the time that I've been on my own, which had always been something I had wanted to explore from the time I was young, so in a way I feel like I'll lose a lot of what I've gained here going back to live with my family. That being said though, going back doesn't hold all negatives, my mom does work within the real estate industry and has told me that she'd give me pointers on getting my real estate license and starting my career and so on, which is definitely more valuable than working at McDonald's or something and going from there. I'm just afraid that when she says that I'll probably have to live at home for at least two years that she really means that because of how hard it is to get money at first in real estate, I just can't handle even a year more there, that's why I was so eager to leave for college in the first place. With all this in mind I've really been debating internally on just selling literally everything I have and just walking as far as I can somewhere to see where that'd get me, but I'm too scared to take a risk like that. I'm just at a loss for what to think anymore, I've been crying myself to sleep recently and it just feels like my life is coming to an end. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I'm dropping out due to lost motivations and depression, so my options are moving back in with my mom to pursue real estate which she has some expertise in with the sacrifice of independent thinking and emotional health, or I could sell literally everything I have and walk as far as my feet will take me in a sort of gamble.",24Nov2020,1
90,"Basically my friend is a dickhead. He takes everything to heart and expects everyone to give him things or help him and gives nothing in return. I’ve literally fought this guy before and nearly done it again a few times, he is always vaping “thc” which is known to be spice or synthetic cannabinoids. Most of my friends used to but since we found out it wasn’t weed we all stopped and I think it’s ruining his brain tbh. But he was like this before he started using it.

He has fucked up her brain, she’s not the same woman she was prior to meeting him, he is a plague in her life, she’s beginning to realize but I wish I could remove the poison he planted in her brain, that poor girl, if you guys witnessed this first hand you would feel awful for her, but anyways I guess my big question is, how do you properly deal with someone with anxiety, PTSD, my goal is to become her safe place, her person to feel safe with, to tell everything too without fear of judgement, we have been friends for a very long time so I am somewhat that person already but I would just like to know more tactics to properly bond with someone who’s as damaged as her without saying anything that can be taken the wrong way and potentially cause a “trigger”",24Nov2020,1

The thing keeping me from sharing the news is that I don't want to jinx it. I don't have the internship yet and I would hate to have to go back and say to them that I didn't get it. So I guess I wanna know if I should keep it to myself or share the news with my friend and then focus on doing well in the interview.

94,"Long story short I had fallen in love with a very close friend, we talked about it and she then led me on for months (not taking advantage or anything like that). 

Back in early October her ex who has antagonised me in the past shows up and starts going for her again knowing my feelings and would constantly give me taunting faces and do subtle things to upset me with out my friend finding out. 
Then she got back with this ex (who had hurt her before) and concealed it from me for weeks and one day seemed upset and uncomfortable around me and stayed that way for a week or so, refusing to tell me anything. 

During this my best friend knew that she had gotten with this guy and informed me, so I have been trying to cope with it and trying to remain friends with her despite it. And the ex is now doing things like purposely encountering me and making smug faces and he even sized me up last week. 

Today she saw me see her with her ex and she now completely avoids me but she came by me at lunch and gave me a sort of cryptic note that said that she ""is in a certain situation at the moment"" and ""she can't hang out with me in the mornings or at lunch anymore but would like me to continue to walk her to her last period class"".

I want to beat the living hell out of the narcissistic ex who is taunting me because I am not a violent person and he thinks I won't do anything about him antagonizing me and I will if he dares to put his hands on me. 

Should I still attempt to be friends with her? Is she being manipulated by this ex or is she manipulating me? Am I way over reacting? I am so tangled up, hurt and confused. I guess I just need to get this out of my system without bogging down the few friends that I have.",24Nov2020,1

Well, when I was 5 me and him were playing this game together on the gamecube. My mom was at the store. He paused the game, and asked me if I wanted to see something. So what this guy did was put his finger through his pocket, and take his dick out pretending that it was his finger. Then he asked me to touch it. I don't really want to think about it anymore than that. He didn't ever do more than that but I've always been concerned and cautious because of that. 


He was probably 16 or 17. He's a complete douchebag now and I'm stressed about it because obviously that's wrong but what if it was just a weird hormone thing?

100,"     I am 20, and my mom is 39. She’s always had health issues— like lupus, epilepsy, cancer, etc.. kind of just domino effected my whole life. One caused the other or made each worse. Ergo she’s had lots of GI surgery, and various other surgeries as well. Even though she didn’t always recover the quickest **she was always ok in the end**. 
    This week, she had another surgery to correct a digestive disorder. Went fine, then two days ago I was told she was going to the ER for her pain getting worse overnight. (I don’t live with them so I get updates often and as long as they’re being handled I just note it in my head and remember to call later to check by). By mid day she was transferred to a large medical center and went under the knife again for an emergency fix. This morning she was fine to my knowledge and it fixed the issue. I went to work, texted with my stepdad to check In. All good. 
     Then 11:45 AM came, I suddenly was getting 5 calls back to back from her phone, and texts that I needed to leave work ASAP and get to the ICU at the hospital she was in. It was my stepdad on her phone because his died. “She could die” was the text in this group of messages that stopped me in my tracts. We never used that word, ever. The fact that I was being told immediately that it was life threatening made me instantly pack all my things and tell my supervisor what was happening. 
     I got there in 10 minutes and got to her room 5 min before they took her back again for an emergency exploratory surgery because her BP was dropping, she was hurting, she was intubated and they couldn’t figure out what was going on. I talked to her for a minute, just watching her eyes roll around and hoping she could hear me. She was struggling against her restraints that were keeping her from pulling on the ventilator tube. She started writing letters with her fingers against the sheets, “CANT BREATHE”. It broke my heart because she could but she was so confused and out of it that she didn’t make the connection the tube was in there doing it for her. They took her back and all I’ve been left with was that feeling of being useless and powerless while my mom was trying to tell everyone she was in pain and needed help. 
     I am so scared, and I have no idea what I will do if she doesn’t make it out of this. I have been crying for hours, thinking it over, wondering, praying even though I’m agnostic. Nothing seems to make sense when I try to imagine what will happen if she isn’t with me anymore. I need help and the strength of you all right now.",24Nov2020,1

My mom is inviting 7 people who don't live with us to our house. 1 of them is my grandma who lives in another state, then there's my Nana who's more at risk from years of smoking (she sleeps with an oxygen tank ffs), my aunt on my mom's side who just recently recovered from covid, my cousin who works at the same place as my mom and aunt along with her boyfriend, and my cousin who is currently pregnant along with her boyfriend. Not to mention that my mom is high risk since she takes immuno-suppressants and my dad is high risk because he has been smoking for pretty much 30 years.

My mom was around a lot of people who got covid, but her test luckily came back negative. I myself, am fairly healthy even if I'm a little overweight. I had a very short run-in with my aunt on Halloween, but that was before we found out she was positive and my test came back negative. So no one around me has it, but I'm have an awful feeling in my stomach about this. I'm not good at confrontation since I have anxiety, so I can't really challenge my parents about this. If I did, they'd just yell at me and I can't really take that right now.

Both of my parents are very conservative and even though they're not explicitly anti-mask, they still play down just how dangerous this virus is. My entire family kinda does this with the exception of my uncle on my dad's side who's on the more liberal side of things. My parents were thinking of inviting him, but he declined and told my dad through a text to stay safe. To which my dad grumbled out loud something along the lines of ""i don't live under a damn rock."" and more complaining about how covid has taken away all of his freedom or something like that. And if he's reacting that way about it, then his reaction would be ten times worse if I said ""Hey, maybe inviting 7 people to our house in the middle of a pandemic isn't a good idea. We should be thankful that we can still talk to them online and not risk anyone's health."" I can already imagine just how much yelling would be thrown my way.

So with that said, I can't share my concerns about calling it quits with my parents. There's no way that they would listen to me. If I could, I would take one of the cars and go for a drive the entire time everyone was at the house. I live in a more rural area on the outskirts of town, so I could probably find a long back-road to drive on. I really love driving so it would ease my anxiety. Plus, there wouldn't be anyone in the car telling me how ridiculous I'm acting for being scared since my parents have done that too. But that idea falls apart almost immediately because not only do I not have a driver's license yet, I don't even have a permit. I'm 15 and 1/2, I can get a permit, but my parents lost my social security card so I'll have to wait to get a new one. The best option for me would be to leave the house and isolate alone, avoiding people that don't live there, but that's not an option either. So I have to stay in my house and I can't try to reason with my parents about this since they've made up their minds.  


The only thing I can think of to do is hide away in my room as soon as everyone gets there, but I'm not sure how they'd react, of if they would even let me. My door doesn't have a lock but if I got desperate, I could just push my bed against the door to get the message clear. I know that it might damage my relationship with my family, but I don't want to risk getting it again, the close call I had was bad enough. Even if I was fine, my parents wouldn't be. I'm already lucky that I was negative the first time, I don't want there to be another situation where I'll have to get tested. My family is absolutely NOT going to understand why I'm doing this if I end up doing it. And after everyone leaves, I can imagine a screaming session from my parents, maybe my mom guilting me by saying something like ""Do you not love your family enough to spend time with them?"" Or calling my isolating as an excuse not to spend time with them since I'm naturally anti-social anyway. I just know that the feedback I'll get from my parents is going to be dreadful if I isolate myself from the 7 guests and I don't know if I can prepare for that. I mean, our relationship is already not ideal and if I want to get a higher education after high school, I can't do anything to push them over the edge.  


But If I don't do anything to isolate from anyone, there's a chance that I'll get it. It's not like I'm going to be happy around anyone anyway, I'll be too nervous thinking about the situation at hand. I probably won't be able to hold a normal conversation with anyone there because my anxiety is going to go haywire thinking of everything that can go wrong. I won't be surprised if I have a panic attack thinking about how someone could get sick. And then I would blame myself for not being able to convince my parents to cancel. If anyone gets sick I'm going to be overcome with guilt. I just feel like the guilt is going to be a lot worse if I don't isolate myself.   


Plus if I get sick, my grades are going to fall behind. I'm trying to go to medical school, I don't have time to catch a plague. I barely hung on during freshman year and sophomore year's not going too well either. I'm going to try to catch up and get better grades when the break is over. If I have a virus that has killed over 250,000 people, I won't be able to focus on school. And what's going to happen if I can't get good grades? I can kiss medical school goodbye and I won't know what to do with my life. It'd be even worse if I died because dead people can't go to school either. I probably wouldn't die if I got it, but I might as well be dead if I can't achieve my dreams.   


Ignoring that school rambling though, I can't imagine anything good from having so many people over during Thanksgiving. I'm worried about my aunt because she could get it again and it would be worse. I'm worried about my cousin because she is pregnant and I'd imagine that it would make covid way harder on her. My Nana's lungs are very weak. My other Grandma is also high risk since she'd older and it doesn't help that she's coming from another state (which arguably handles the situation better. Of course though, my parents have been complaining about their governor nonstop, furthering my doubt that they would listen to my reasoning). My dad has been smoking for twice the time I have been alive, his lungs might as well be charred steaks at this point. My mom has a much weaker immune system because she is chronically ill and her medicine makes her weak. The only people I'm not worried about are my non-pregnant cousin and her boyfriend, and my pregnant cousin's boyfriend. I'm losing sleep thinking about everyone else.   


I'll wrap it up here since this post is getting a bit long and I've said everything I need to say, so thanks for reading this. I'm completely lost on what to do and Thanksgiving feels so hopeless right now. Any advice at all will be helpful. Even if no one has any advice, words of encouragement will also be greatly appreciated. Wish me luck (since I'll need it) and PLEASE stay safe for Thanksgiving if you can. Thanks to everyone reading this and if you need anymore info just let me know.    


**TL;DR: My mom's inviting 7 people who are mainly high risk to my house for thanksgiving. I can't leave because I can't drive yet. My parents don't take the pandemic seriously. I don't know what to do. Please help.**",24Nov2020,1

113," I found a video of someone playing this piano piece on Instagram and wanted to learn it myself; however they didn't leave any info about the song. So I tried to find the song afterwards, but it was suddenly like it didn't exist. I played the audio for Shazam and my Siri, but neither of them had any results, despite playing multiple different parts of the song several times. I have attempted to ask for help identifying the song in a few subreddits, but have yet to receive any response. And unfortunately a response from the video creator is unlikely because they have 6 million followers.

Do any of you know other ways to try to find the song? I know it's kind of futile to spend this much effort on finding a song, when I could easily just learn something else... But I have already sunk 4 hours into looking for the piece, so I might as well finish what I started.

(Here's a recording of the song, if that helps, or if you somehow know any info about it)

114,"sorry for any grammar mistakes in advance.

(background info)  

I (25M) have been out of work for a few months. I quit my job after my boss who lived with me at the time refused to cover my shift knowing I was sick. After a short argument I quit. Later he started to refuse to pay rent so we kicked him out. 

(Now)

A few weeks later I find out my friend is moving in. He (28M) is my (24F) sisters boyfriend as well and she had convinced my mom to let him move in. 2 months have gone by and I have been working on weight loss and good habits. I have not been looking for work as I had paid up my rent for 6 months at the time that I had quit my job. My family and friend  are not pleased that I am not working. They all see it as, if I am not working I am not contributing despite me paying up my rent (Bills included).

It came to a head when my sister started a argument over me needing to work to pay rent. Long argument short she tried to insinuate I was taking advantage of my mom because things have been tight and that if I did pay rent that would not be the case (My rent went on back bills). Despite being told that's not the case keeps the argument going saying if I don't get a job by X date she will stop paying rent (Ya I am taking advantage). She is saying I will not get a job and just mooch.

Things get heated over this stupid argument to the point me and my friend almost get into a fight. Later after things cool off, I am just done with my sister and her bull. My friend wants to hang out like nothing happened. I ask him how he can be ok with how she attacked me over something that she believes will happen 4 months from now, Just so she could try and not pay rent. He said he was not ok with it but he didn't want to be in the middle of it.

I just cant see myself being friends with someone who is ok with another person, who is willing to throw me under the buss for money. I told him it was basically me or her because even if I did pretend it was ok she would likely do it again and then we might just fight ending our friendship there.

Am I over reacting?",24Nov2020,1
115,"hey, my name is salvador and i’m just gonna call my girlfriend J for speed and to protect her privacy cuz people online crazy as fuck sometimes and freak me out LMAO. anyways, if you couldn’t tell from the first sentence alone i’m a highly anxious person. i do try to keep this anxiety at bay, and have been doing quiet well lately, except for one aspect of it...

i genuinely think i’m dying of something at least once a week, usually the “thing” being covid, J’s mom, who she lives with is high risk, my mom who is high-risk (not as much as J’s mom, but worryingly enough) and my family doesn’t take covid seriously.

me and J have basically come to terms with the fact we are not going to be able to see each other for even longer because of my family, but i don’t know how long i can go on with this shit guys. how do i deal with my family? they never take my difficulties with anxiety seriously and when they do, it’s only for a day. my younger brother goes to fucking basketball five times a week, having frequent INDOOR meals with these fucking baboons, frequent indoor games with other schools, etc. none of us goes to school irl, but he goes to these wretched fucking basketball meet-ups and games. 

how do i deal with this? how do i maybe convince them to take it a bit more seriously? i’ve tried everything i know, they literally get pissed off with me for wiping the groceries  down properly! i try my BEST to be as chill with it as possible, hiding my pain (yes, pain, i’m not being dramatic, this makes me suffer daily in my own head, don’t come for me lmao) on a daily basis and they still call me crazy or over dramatic. i don’t know what to do, if i were to get covid i would probably have to be hospitalized for cardiac arrest before anything covid related.

now... here’s the plot twist... my mom is one of the main people not taking it seriously, despite her being high-risk herself!!! i am terrified! this is my ((number one fear)) my mind getting it and kicking the fucking bucket! what the fuck do i do?!

before you guys call my family ignorant, don’t, i love my family so much and this is just ONE of very few flaws they have. this is understandable, it’s hard to deal with this shit at this point, but it’s a sorta a LOT selfish to themselves, my mom, myself, my girlfriend, and my girlfriend’s mom to be acting this way...living in america... where the rates just keep raising...every. single. day... y’all i’m seriously about to permanently astral project from this hell i’m so fr, i’m about to become a monk who lives in the mountains at this mf point... wtf do i do? whether it be to convince them, or keep myself sane. just anything please.",24Nov2020,1

117,"Hello everyone, I’m a 21 year old male living in the US. My father is a 5th generation electrician in my family, and a successful one too. I grew up doing electrical with him in the summers from age 10 to 19 (residential and commercial). I am fairly skilled in it as well but since i grew up with it as more of a “chore” than a choice it made me not want to pursue electrical. I decided to go to community college instead of taking the electrical route and study computer science. A recent talk with a family friend and his friends (all in their 60’s and 70’s) made me rethink my route. The comment that made me think about pursuing electrical was “Well when you turn 40 and common sense hits you like a fucking door you’ll realize you should’ve taken our advice.” He was referring to taking over my fathers company. My dad has offered to train me before and put me on payroll at a very fair rate for an apprentice. If I entered this route I would drop out of college (I will be getting an associates degree this semester regardless) and start with him full time in January. A few friends have already told me that I should 100% do it if I enjoy it. I used to not but in all honesty the past few times I’ve helped him on jobs wasn’t too bad. I just want some opinions. Thank you all &lt;3",24Nov2020,1
118,"Problem with this is that I only know he's mad at me when he does it and I don't know why until he talks. He won't talk to me until he has figured out exactly what he's going to say, is the reason he always gives me. But until I know what he has to say it drives my anxiety up the wall.

Usually it's about adult things (bedroom stuff) that I didn't even realize were happening until he finally talks to me about how he tried to initiate something and I didn't reciprocate. I know last night he was pretty blatantly obvious about it. He came over to the couch and we were watching a movie together and he was running my leg but I said my knee and hip were hurting which they have been for a few days. Which I said to him. Then later he literally said ""I'm going upstairs, you should come up too"" but also I was pretty blunt and said I didn't want to. I eventually went upstairs to actual bed (sleep) and I thought things were fine. 

This morning he came downstairs and he sat down on the opposite end of the couch then after a while he snuggled against me and me what I was doing. I told him what I was doing (watching a video on my phone and playing a game at the same time) and then after a bit he did the thing he does where he buries himself in the blanket and won't talk to me. Then a bit later he just went upstairs. He's downstairs now and I asked him what's going on and he shrugged at me. Which I know to be the signal that at some point tonight or possibly not until tomorrow he's going to bring up whatever the issue is. Which I'm going to bet is related to last night. But when I told him I was hurting in my hip and knee, I thought that made things clear, I don't want to have painful sex. 

Idk, he's probably going to bring up the game too, which he's brought up in the past but it's literally the only game I play and he constantly plays games on his computer which I've brought up before too. Not as an issue on my end but as I pointed thing that it feels hypocritical that he gets mad at me for playing my 1 cell phone game when he spends literal hours playing multiple games on his computer. I don't mind him playing his games except when I want to talk to him and he's involved with something and won't take off his headphones because it's important. And even with that it's just mild annoyance but understanding from me.

Basically idk how to not get anxious when he does this, and idk how to get him to just talk to me about whatever is going on at the time that it is going on as opposed to getting mad then talking to me over 12+ hours after the fact..",24Nov2020,1
119,"I am terrible with titles and have never posted on here before. My mom got pregnant with me at 15 while my bio father was 23. I'm not entirely sure of what happened but he ended up choosing to walk away which he confirmed himself when he found out he knew one of my friends when I was in high-school through her family; he called and asked to speak to me. Long story and it was a mess and I do not blame her because she was in distress after realizing what was happening. I chose not to have a relationship with him because I honestly didn't know him and he wanted nothing to do with me until I had a few years left of child support age. My family always gave me the option. He even came to my graduation and cornered me when I was alone and my boyfriend and family were talking to other people. He and his wife even threatened some of my family members for ""keeping me from him"". As I said very long years worth of events but to kind of give a basic idea.

The man my mom is married to is my dad. There is no other way to put that. While my mom and I haven't had the best relationship they are good parents. Even still they ask if I ever want to talk to my bio (bio father but will just say bio here out) or when he does get into contact with them if I want to to share info; just basic stuff is okay with me. He has attempted to find me on social media and has made multiple accounts to try and add me since I am private but I don't really friend people I don't know. Within the last year I have had multiple people contact me within my age range and whelp turns out they are all my half siblings through him. Like jeeze man what the heck. While I do question the morality of why all their mothers were around my mom's age i feel really uncomfortable with how they want to know me. I want to respect what they may be going through but at the same time they occasionally try bringing bio up in conversation. I am really considering telling them that I did try to uphold some kind of relationship with them but between them trying to have better relationships with bio and wanting to meet in person I don't know if I can emotionally keep doing it. The man makes me feel unsafe to be frank and I know through multiple sources that me and my mom are his ""regrets"" because we are the only two he has attempted to reform some kind of connection with multiple times. I worry that my half siblings may be trying to get to know me in some kind of attempts to get bio's affection since his sister is the only communication they have with him. The man only wants the attention of those who want nothing to do with him ultimately.

My question is would I be an asshole if I did communicate with them that I don't want any kind of relationship and cut ties? I really have tried but they keep bringing up things I have openly told them I'm uncomfortable with and have said I wasn't really comfortable in the first place but I would give it a try.

121,"Hi. I'm a 20 year old lower-class male in Oklahoma, US of A.
I don't have a car, or even know how to drive,
never having had an opportunity to learn.

For a couple years I worked at a fast food chain and was pretty good at it. Helped me get on my feet when I was homeless. I live in income-based housing.

About a month ago I was offered by a parent's new SO to get set up with an electrician's apprenticeship. Everyone around me was encouraging me to do it, telling me how good it would be. The SO told me he could provide transportation, put me through driving school and give me a vehicle when that was finished so I could take myself to work.
I was completely sick of fast food at this point,
so I jumped at it. I feel like it was a mistake now.

Directly after I start, SO tells me on the way to work that I need to start thinking about how I'm going to get to work on my own ""If something happens"".
Less than a week after this parent's SO is now a parent's EX, and out of the picture entirely.

I've been working as an Electrical Apprentice for two weeks now. I like the work, and I like the idea that I'm learning a trade, but getting to work is difficult. Our job sites vary and take us all over Oklahoma, and we don't really have an expansive bus system. Right now I'm paying an acquaintance of mine about 25% of my weekly checks to get rides to work. Add to this the fact that we get a 30-minute to an hour lunch break, and thusly I'm only really making 35-37 hours a week...
I'm making less than I was at the fast food joint.
Ntm the fact that my acquaintance is frequently late, and that things happen to his vehicle as well to put it out of commission.
I missed work today because of it.
Nobody wants to carpool because of Covid-19,
and my boss has previously expressed that he's worried about catching coronavirus from me or my driver.
I'm realizing now that I was an idiot for not thinking about this in terms of how I could support this job independently.

If I want to make it work, I need to learn how to drive/get a car. People are telling me I should go to Driver's Ed, which would be more money, but also slightly reduce my insurance rates.

I'm debating whether I should switch to a different, higher paying job to better be able to afford these things so I can live without having to depend on other people. If I had to, I could go back to my fast food job, possibly with a raise. I was one of their better employees and my General Manager made it clear if I wanted the job back I'd have it.

I'm worried about screwing up my chance at a good career, but also about whether I can make this career work in the first place.",24Nov2020,1

Needless to say I was hurt, but I was able to make some new friends and have some fun as a college kid in a college town. I was also able to turn my life around and improve in a number of areas. I came home for the holidays because I wanted to be around family. The night before I left, I made the decision to unfollow her on all social medias, so I wouldn’t feel tempted to look. I also added “The best start is a fresh start” to my instagram bio because I thought it described what I was going through. Fast forward to today and she texts me a really passive aggressive text mentioning my instagram bio and says it is aimed at her. She also accused me of not being over her, not doing enough in the relationship, and lying about the situation. I explained to her that she was misunderstood and that it had nothing to do with her at all. She got pissed and told me to fuck off and blocked me on snapchat (but weirdly not on Instagram or Twitter). The reason I think she is lying is because I unfollowed her on the 20th and she has an app that sends her a notification when she loses a follower. Its the 23rd today and if she got that notification on the 20th, she would’ve said something about it there and then, but she didn’t.

128,"A year or so ago, i was in a bad place. I had immense pressure and lacked the skills to combat such. In the years prior,  I had been betrayed over and over again. The entirety of my school hated me.. i was exploited and abused constantly. I would go home crying on the daily because of how bad it was. Years later, I was still bound by the traumas I had suffered. Due to my ineptitude pertaining to executive functioning, I lived a rather discordant lifestyle. One of the products of those habits was my irregular consumption of my high dosage medication. I have bipolar and was very erratic at the time. Sometimes, i would yell at my sister or even get a little violent. (Background on my sister: she knows how to get around socially, unlike me. Her friends have always been supportive and my parents have shown evident bias towards her. She was the opposite of me: cared for and adored without even tryung) When we argue, she gets heartless and speaks her mind. She knows what to say to make me feel absolutely horrible. I hit her a few times, not that hard.. I am not justifying my behavior,  but my sister still hasn't gotten over my actions from a year ago. 
Once... almost two years ago now.. in the heat of the moment, after I went into shock (due to irregular consumption of meds) I threw hot soup at her. I feel absolutely horrible about it. I get sick whenever I think back at what I did. She says that it will take years before she can forgive me. I have tried everything to rectify me wrongs. I've apologized over and over. I've done her chores for her. I've given her my switch for free. I've put myself through a mental hospital and group home. I've tried my best to improve over the past year. Now, when we argue, and i get really angry, i slice my arms instead of hitting her. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. What am I doing wrong? Why does she still hate me for what I did? 
I indirectly implied that she needs to get over it. I realized the apathy in my words, and apologized afterwards. Her life has been so much fuckung easier than mine. I can't do it anymore. She still hatess me.wtf",24Nov2020,1
129,"My car is an 03 Nissan Micra. I was pressured into buying it by a 'friend' who wanted to be able to borrow it and I really don't need it, I was just stupidly swayed by the idea of random trips. I live in an area with great public transport and barely use the car. It's expensive to run what with fuel, insurance and tax so I definitely am not going to use it for at least a year. 

In fact I realised recently that I should have just SORNed it (declared it off road) and cancelled insurance for a refund since I haven't used it since July!

When I took it in for MOT, it was knackered from non-use. It needs £350 worth of repairs. I was going to simply sell it for scrap value - £185 - but now I'm thinking what if in a years time I want a car. Then I'd have to spend say at least £800 or so for another car. Would it be more sensible to disconnect the battery and leave it in my apartment car park? Then pay the £350 if and when I need it again? Or would the scrap value just depreciate and the repair costs appreciate too much?",24Nov2020,1
130,"If there is a better sub to post this on, let me know.

I apologize for the length I don't want to leave anything out. 

Anyway, let's get into it.

I (18F) arrived home from university a few days ago. While I was away, my family (Mom and two sisters) moved apartments. If it is relevant, the apartment is in a middle-class neighborhood, and it seems safe enough.

The issue: 

A person has been ringing our buzzer which is outside next to the apartment building's front door. The person does this at night, usually around 8 pm-9 am. I know this sounds more like the work of an obnoxious teenager than a dangerous situation but hold on. My mom taped a note a few days before I arrived saying, ""Stop ringing our doorbell."" The buzzer still rang that night. That morning she found the note torn up on our welcome mat by our apartment door. Through a peephole, my mom saw a short, white man run past our door and up the stairs after our buzzer rang. Seconds later, she then heard the upstairs neighbors' door slam loudly. Also, every time the buzzer ring, we hear combat-type sounding boots run past our door, up the stairs, and the slamming of the door above us. Needless to say, we know who is doing it.

My mom contacted the leasing department and, they said they cannot do anything until they know who is doing it and that we should just call the police. The problem with that is a ding-dong ditcher isn't high on a police officer's priority list. We asked for another apartment in the same neighborhood, they said there were only one-bedroom apartments left.

Fast forward to last night, the ONLY night since they moved here that the doorbell wasn’t rung. This is because my mom left a note taped to our buzzer saying, ""The leasing department said if you ring our doorbell again to call the police."" So instead of buzzing, he resorted to banging on the floor in the am hours. This morning, my mom found the note torn to a million pieces by the buzzers. As mentioned before, we are a family of women, a young girl, and a 10lb dog. None of us are petite or anything, but we are concerned he will escalate. As I am typing this, he is banging on the floor. He has been doing this on-and-off for the past 5 minutes or so. He also likes to stomp and, I mean **stomp** down the hallway. Last night, I guess he was really angry about the note because I woke up to the walls **SHAKING. LITERALLY SHAKING**. I would be impressed if I wasn't scared.

So, what should we do? What should we NOT do? Put more pressure on the leasing department? Call the police right now? And how far does he have to go until we get out of our lease? I read something about if your neighbor is disruptive too many times, the leasing department can legally kick them out. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",24Nov2020,1

132,"Hey everyone, i need a little help in making a decision. I (16M) am a junior attending a small private high school. Let me preface this situation with a little background on my history with student council. Since 6th grade, I have been apart of student council. I was Student body secretary in 6th and 7th grade and student body president in 8th grade. In freshman year at a new high school that I am still attending, I ran and won for freshman class president. However, my downfall began in sophomore year when I ran for sophomore class president when I lost against a popular boy that had bad behavior and grades (which isn’t allowed in student council) who just ran because his friends told him to. Then, in Junior year, I ran again, but this time I ran for student body secretary because I didn’t think anyone else was running for the position. I ended up losing to a senior which I was fine with because she won fair and square. I wasn’t mad but just a little bummer. I still remained a member of student council the two years I lost. Now, it is halfway through my Junior year and we are beginning elections for the next school year when I will be a senior. Obviously throughout this time I’ve realized student council is just a popularity contest. I mean I hate to sound cocky or rude but I believe I had much more leadership skills than the kid I lost to in sophomore year who ran as a prank. It was honestly annoying but now it’s water under the bridge. Though, this year, I don’t know what to run for. Since 8th grade when I was student body president in middle school, I wanted to become student body president in high school. Now it’s my year to shine, but I don’t know if I should run for it or not. The girl who won Junior class president last year is running again for student body class president which I wanted since 8th grade. But since it’s basically a popularity contest, I have no idea if I will win. I feel like I know a lot of kids who would vote for me, but at the end of the day that won’t carry me to the win. It’s a small school and like there’s isn’t much votes going to one person or the other. So since that position will be taken by a candidate, I don’t know if I should just step down to run for student body Vice President or senior class president. It sucks that I probably won’t win student body class president like I wanted but life isn’t fair all the time. So, I’m here asking you guys, should I still run for student body class president like I’ve always wanted to and run the risk of losing and just being a member of student council or should I run for Vice President or senior class president. I mean student body president will look the best on college resumes but I mean I don’t know. I mean im a good student who just wants to excel and do the best I can and most I can. Please help!

I have contamination OCD and the only person I'm seeing besides my family ( which I live with, my mom and dad ) is my girlfriend, and for whatever reason some friends of her parents decided to go to their house and spend some days there ( like 2 days ).
When they got there I was there, and today they also were there ( tho I saw her outside of her house, we went for a walk together ).
I want to go there tomorrow but I'm worried because of COVID... 
My girlfriend talked with her mother and she said it's okay, but I don't think she asked if they had any symptoms or anything, although I don't think anyone would visit someone if they had, that would be so fucking rude...
I really wanna see her tomorrow, but I don't know if I should, she said she thinks it's okay ( she also said she didn't see they coughing or anything, and they are older people, like more than 55 I would say, so I guess they would show symptoms )
I'm really worried because of my parents, what if they get the virus and die?? They're not part of the risk group ( they're not even 50 yet ) and I should ask them if it's okay for me to go, but what if they don't let me because I asked?? And it's not like they would know tbh

138,"So this upcoming spring will be my last semester of college before I graduate. I have 4 courses I need to take in the spring before graduating, a course for my final project, a lab science course, and any two other courses (just to meet credits requirement.) 

The problem that's come up is that the science lab course that I was going to take got cancelled due to lack of students signing up for it and there's apparently no other science lab course at my school that I meet the requirements for this semester. Because of this, I have to take a science lab course at another school in order to graduate on time. 

The thing is that I have to stay a full time student at my actual school in order to stay eligible for my scholarship and health insurance. So I have to pay for the credits at the other school, and still pay the same full time fee I was going to pay anyways at my actual school. 

When I talked to my financial aid advisor, he said that there's something called a consortium agreement that I could fill out to combine the credits from both schools for federal financial aid purposes, but if I was not full time at my current school I would lose my scholarship since that is one of the requirements for the scholarship.

My advisor set up a plan for me to graduate in a certain amount of time, but that plan didn't take into account a class getting cancelled by the school. I don't blame her for the class getting cancelled, but I don't think I should have to pay extra just because the school decided to cancel my class. 

Basically, I'm trying to figure out if there's someone at the school who could kind of advocate my case for me. My financial aid advisor wasn't all too helpful in figuring something out. It's not the end of the world for me even if they don't reimburse me or something, I have enough money to afford the other class, but again, I don't really think it's fair I have to pay for the school's decision. Would there be some dedicated person who tries to help students with problems like this?

143,"I know, it's bad. Please keep personal judgements out of this I am looking for helpful advice that they can take action on.

My friend got a used car for $10,000. Put $3,000, has a loan of $7,000.

I was a little concerned because we had always agreed that car financing is a bad idea and to always try and buy a used car outright (we both have savings.) We also have discussed high interest rates and predatory lenders in the past during conversation, so this took me by surprise. 

Anyways, they were very stressed and felt pressured to get a car quickly after an accident in which they were T-Boned. Still unsure if the insurance will pay out but needed a car for work. Please again no judgement they are very upset right now and have realised their mistake. 

They signed a contract for 25% interest rate on this used car loan, which I believe is a 48 month. I need to go over the contract with them. This is a ridiculous and predatory amount in my opinion. And they have to pay premium insurance for the first 6 months, which is almost $300 a month.

Is this even legal in Texas? I am very concerned. Is there some action we can take? Possibly refinancing? They just signed today.",24Nov2020,1
144,"Alright, let me preface this by saying that she started her OnlyFans while we were together. I was totally okay with it, and I even have one myself. The main thing that appealed to me is that it's anonymous for the most part in the sense that you can't just search her real name and find her on there. It made me feel better about it that people that we know wouldn't know about it. 

Recently she's been sending the link to people that she knows and people that's had weird sexual tension with her in the past. To her it's no big deal because they're paying to see the content, and it's not like they could have it in person, but this still makes me feel very strange. Maybe it's insecurity, but I just don't want people that I know to be able to see my girlfriend that way. On top of this, she made an instagram account to advertise it and I didn't even know about it. This also kind of sketches me out.

146,"will be quick- unsure of where to post this, but I want to move forward with a complaint, and know what my rights are so I am making a fool of myself. am in new york, ny &amp; this is in regards to nypd, precinct 9

I live on the block of a police precinct, and walked across the street last night to go to the local deal. all the cops go there too actually, because it's the closet bodega to them. the owner has always treated them fairly and kindly. 

tbh, I do not love the police-- I don't love the idea of them, the turmoil they cause and allow-- but must be fair and know that I have certainly called 911 before, and have been helped. There is a HUGE systemic problem with the police, and I understand that. I do not want to get political here, and (maybe because I appear as an asian female) have not encountered problems with cops.

never gone out of my way to defend them, but never shit on them either.

at the bodega last night, there were two homeless men who were harassing the deli owner- a wonderful, hard working Korean man. the two men have been in before, and have previously stolen, As a result, they were banned. after being asked to leave the store, they were essentially saying ""make me"" and provoking the owner, who has difficulty speaking english.

i immediately stepped in and told the men if they aren't welcomed, they had to leave. they were making fun of us for being asian, inciting violence, and being disruptive.

when they wouldn't leave after at least 5 minutes, I finally walked to the police precinct to let the two desk cops know that there was an IRT incident occurring at the deli across the street, and figured- of course I don't know how cops work- that they would be able to send someone over. literally a matter of feet that we are talking about- maybe 50.

i walked into my deli today, and the owner said the cops never showed up. who did show up are the two men, yet again, harassing him.

I called the desk of my local precinct a bit ago, and asked for the SGT's name. i don't know the roles within, and assumed it was public knowledge, in the same sense that when I worked at a store, my name is what it is and I can't change that if someone wanted to complain about me. 

what actually scared me is immediately, the PAA on the phone said, in a rude and bitchy, shit tone that she wouldn't do that. she doesn't know who I am, etc. I said i'd be happy to explain, and that I've lived on the block for 7 years and worked on the block for 10. 

the woman sounded unwell. like truly- I am not an ACAB person, I have been trying to understand all this turmoil and work through how painful it is for both sides- and I know that people will shit all over me for that. it a weird reversal, she just presumed I was guilty (or wanting to hurt her precinct, who knows) rather than innocent (or just wanted to ask simple questions). 

I wanted the SGT's name because I wanted to ask questions, like moving forward is it better to just call 911 over what seems to be a mild situation that I'm sure cops would laugh over having to go to. I thought they might care because it's THEIR deli too- the owner told me he felt so sad about it. that he feeds them everyday and that they didn't. care. he now is looking into getting his own weapon because he doesn't trust that they'll help him. and I agree. I truly lost faith in all cops tonight.

the PAA i spoke to needs a psych evaluation. if you're walking into work: a) scared as shit and b) unable to conceal your fear and c) bare minimally doing your job-- you shouldn't be there.

was I wrong to ask for who the SGT/captain is? I went online after and it's public information. is it illegal to ask that? to share that information? I don't know how anything gets done.

I was molested over the summer, and walked into a precinct and was HUMILIATED by the desk agent who, even through my tears and whispers of being molested (I was so ashamed)-- made me tell my story pretty much at a public desk with other people around. It was so insensitive and humiliating. I just want answers, and don't mean to be dramatic. a lot worse happens out there, like blatant murder of civilians for unjustified reasons, and people and families don't receive them.

after this summer, I just don't know where to turn. If anyone can recommend a site where a lot of this and our rights are made easier to understand-- i just never want to encounter a cop again and be tricked into being fearful of them. 

I HOPE the call was recorded- it was absurd. It was actually scary that they employ someone who is so unwell, who was so eager to cut me off because she assumed the worse. I hung up on this point, but she was threatening something to me if I didn't give my information or tell her what this was about. Does anyone know if the call is recorded if I didn't dial 911, and instead the desk of my local precinct?

thanks for your time.",24Nov2020,1

152,"Since I was a little kid, I’ve always loved everything relating to fossils, dinosaurs, extinct animals, and museums. Because of that, I’ve always felt a clear sense of direction in my life- wanting to work with that kind of thing. Anyways, I’m now finishing up with my 1st semester as a college junior. I’ve been working towards that goal, but it’s honestly feeling harder to attain for me now. A little background

I went to a weird little pseudo-montessori place for high school. This place had good humanities teaching, but STEM? Well, the health teacher was an open and proud antivaxxer if that tells you anything. Basically, I never encountered a science class in high school that wasn’t either easy enough or lenient enough to pass. I was considered one of the “smart kids” there, and graduated with a 93rd percentile ACT score. Yeah, I know- this stuff is always a prelude to bad things.

My Freshman year, I faceplanted *hard* as a result of not having the study skills needed for a STEM course, or the organization skills needed for any course. I finished my first semester that year with a 2.25 GPA, and I didn’t do much better the second. I was setting out to do either a Bio/English double major, or a bio major and English minor by this point, which is still where I’m at today. 

My sophomore year, I started taking microbio classes that were required, like Cell Physiology. Those were really tough for me, because they required a lot of memorization, and I got Cs in them. So I tried to concentrate on the macrobio courses instead, stuff like Animal Behavior and Ornithology. I love those topics, and the profs that teach them at my school are awesome. The thing is, and here’s the crux of my problem- I keep getting “Bs” in those classes, no matter how hard I try. I always make little mistakes, or fuck something up on an organizational level. It’s like, I came into college without organizational skills, and it’s still fucking me over 2+ years later. For my recent Animal Behavior course, I know that over half the class got an A. I’m probably gonna finish the course with an 85-88%, which isn’t bad, but I could have done so much better. As I said, I love my profs, but I don’t know how to look them in the eye when I’m doing worse than a majority of the class. 

What’s funny is that I do well in my English classes for the minor. I have a 99% in my current literature course, and I have pulled 3 other English A’s. I’ve only had 2 science A’s. My GPA for the current sem is gonna be 3.3 or 3.4. My overall GPA is 2.94, meaning that I can almost certainly get it up past 3.02 by senior year, which is apparently the average for bio majors upon graduating. But this lack of science A’s, which other people clearly are getting, is now getting to me. I want to be better, and have good relationships with my profs, but I feel like I’m running all out of time, with only 3 semesters left. So I guess I want to know what I should do? How screwed am I? What people should I be talking to?",24Nov2020,1

Anytime I feel like I work up enough nerve to even try and open up a little bit to my friends, one of my friends has a problem, and I lose my nerve becuase to my friend group im the stable, self-confident (if not arrogant), dad who is always there for them. I just don't think I could take that away from them by telling them I'm just as flawed as they are.

And with my parents its a whole different story. Anytime I complain about a minor physical pain, they'll brush it off as ""I'll be fine."" Recently I asked my mother if it would be smart to get myself checked in with a psychologist to make sure I don't have ADHD or ADD (both of my siblings do) and once I got one but I would talk about my other possible problems too. But she asked if I thought I had ADHD or ADD and like an idiot I said no. So she immediately said ""you don't have it"" and brushed me off.

I prefer cleanliness, organization, and peace and quiet. she and her boyfriend (who literally lives here rent free 5+ days a week) are loud, messy, and disruptive. since we've moved in, I haven't had a single weekend where she and her boyfriend aren't in the living room 10 feet away from my room shouting at video games full send all day. it probably sounds like any average ""bad roommate"" situation, and it is. but even after many kindly worded conversations asking her to take it down a notch and contribute a little bit more to the upkeep, nothing has changed. and honestly it's pretty fucking pathetic that I'm ready to throw in the towel and risk having a good rental history after two months, but I'm lucky enough to have parents who will have me back home if it doesn't get any better (and it doesn't seem to be going that way, at all). seeing as her boyfriend already lives here for free most days, I figured it wouldn't be far off for more to utilize my lease clause stating that I can, with permission of my landlord, sublease my half of the lease. if anything it's a win win for us both, her boyfriend moves in full time and I can take this as a learning experience and go back home until I can find a more ideal living situation. but is it worth risking my positive rental history? should I wait it out a few more months and reevaluate? have you ever broken a lease because of a bad roommate?",24Nov2020,1
161,"This guy I really liked and was consistently dating recently ended things with me, just when I thought he was gonna make it official, leaving me confused and feeling abandoned. I don't blame him for his actions, he said he wasn't emotionally ready for a relationship. While that's how I felt, I know how I felt too and it was strong. 

I keep trying to forget him and forget what happened but I can't. I would see a Jaguar car outside and remember that that was going to be his next big purchase, or I'd have pasta and remember how he would teach me all about his Italian roots (I don't even enjoy pasta anymore), or I would scroll through my socials and see something that he and I would have a great conversation about and realize that I can't.

He also made me start reading the Harry Potter series. I know that I'm 20 years old and late, but I was never curious about it till I started talking to him and I got really into it. I was midway through the third book when he ended things and now I can't bring myself to continue reading it without thinking of him and ending up in a dark pit.

How do I put a stop to this. I feel like every time I'm close to climbing out of a hole, something reminds me of him and I fall back in again. I just want to put him behind me... what do I do? It also doesn't help that lockdown has restarted and there are not many things I can do at home to keep me distracted and simultaneously don't remind me of him.",24Nov2020,1

164,"I likely will sound arrogant explaining this, and I am aware that I am arrogant, but I can't help reacting/feeling irritated toward my parents when they interact with me. 

It (22f) is not unusual for me to speak curtly/aggressively in response to my parents (50s). Anything they ask of me is a burden, questions asked I find stupid, attempts to make jokes/be funny are dumb, comments they make I don't give a shit. Nothing they say shouldn't normally be triggering, it's ordinary phrases you'd hear in households.

""What should I make for dinner?"" &gt;&gt;  I. Don't. Care. You've made dinner for 20 yrs why can't you figure it out yourself.  

""Can you pleeaaase make dinner tonight???"" &gt;&gt; Fine. sure. Just tell me to, wtf are you begging.

""Omg X happened to neighbor yesterday, did you know!!"" &gt;&gt; Why are you telling me this. It has nothing to do with me.

""Did you hear back from X yet?"" &gt;&gt; No. If I did I would have told you. Stop asking.

Because I get pissed when they talk to me, I'd rather have them pretend I'm not at home, and let me go about my day myself. We barely interact regardless. Often I respond with one word answers, ignore them, or stay silent because engaging in conversation is even more of a bother. 

Attitude has been happening since I was a teen. Didn't notice as much when I was in college because I wasn't home too long and didn't regularly communicate. I've been home after graduating and I've been like this half the time. Our relationship isn't necessarily dysfunctional or poor. I think my parents are used my behavior, but this behavior/attitude is not comfortable for me. I don't want keep reacting in this way.

My attitude definitely is influenced by my mood. When I'm in a good mood, then I can converse somewhat more regularly, but not in any other neutral/negative mood. I feel like external factors are influencing my mood this year (ie. covid), so I'm really looking for ways to deal when I'm in a bad mood. Not necessarily advice to change the mood I'm in (because that's improbable). Nor am I looking for explanations for my parents being parents, I know that's how they are. They're not doing anything wrong.",24Nov2020,1

More specifically pertaining to my girlfriend, we are both females for reference. For example, she recently got a job and hearing her talk about it and knowing she’s there without me brings me an overwhelming rage that makes my head feel like it’s on fire. The same thing happens when she talks about some of the medications she’s on. She takes adderall for her ADHD, and hearing her talk about it and how much it helps her makes me nearly sick to my stomach with anger. I feel like I’m going crazy, I want her to be happy and I’m glad that she has a job and she’s on the right meds, however, the overarching feeling of fury is tiring and brings forth a guilt that is arguably worse than the initial feelings.

I don’t have many friends so he’s probably been the best non family friend I’ve had. We dated for 2 weeks back in March before we realized we were better as friends. We hung out all the time until I started seeing another guy in May and we’ve been together since 

Recently my boyfriend has become very jealous of my friendship with my friend and the fact we briefly dated and has asked that I not be friends with him anymore. I’ve told him many times my friend and I don’t have feelings for each other at all. He’s just a really good friend who makes me happy and I don’t have many of those. I love my boyfriend but I can tell this is going to be a major issue and I have no idea how I can choose between them. My boyfriend just can’t get passed it

My friend has done nothing wrong and doesn’t deserve this. He’s even backed off a little bit on his own without me even asking to give me and my boyfriend space, he’s been great about it. He was absolutely crushed/basically in tears when I told him what my boyfriend asked. 

I have no idea what to do, do I think about my future and stay with a guy who loves me and who I love and treats me right or do I pick an amazing friend who has been incredible to me and will always be there for me, especially since I don’t have many close friends at all?

My professor brushed it off and critiques it on what we could, but didn’t show any signs of being upset. If my professor was upset, she was really good at hiding it.

So basically, I [16 F] have been acting really mean to my little sister [13] recently and I'm having trouble stopping myself from acting like this. 

In the past few months, I've been getting angry at her wayyyyyyyyyy more than usual. Moving my things, touching me, small stuff. Even just hearing her talk sometimes makes me upset. Most of our conversations end with me at least somewhat annoyed with her. 

This has led me to be really horrible to her. I yell at her a lot. A couple times in the past few weeks, I've gotten so angry that I've hit her. 

I'm not acting like this towards anyone else. I never have. I've pretty much never hit anyone in my life. I almost never raise my voice. But now I am.

182,"Throwaway account for privacy.

My roommate is a part time nanny. Last week she knowingly worked with a child that was pending a covid test. They told her that it was pending, but it should be fine. Parents are a doctor and a nurse. She got the news that the child's test came back positive after taking care of the child for several hours.

Now, since i was exposed to someone who could potentially have covid, I had to take off work for 3 days. I've brought up several times that I'm out basically half my rent.

Am I in the wrong to ask her to cover the wages I lost? Especially, if she admitted to knowing that the child had a pending test, and that she made a mistake.

Her grandmother is my landlord, I really don't want to get her involved. I'm pretty sure that I don't have any legal ground, nor will it be worth pursuing, but I think I'm not in the wrong for her covering my wages.

Side note: Her bf who was also exposed, didn't miss work because his company has 'relaxed' covid policies. She also isn't working besides maybe one shift or two a week, whenever she gets called to nanny this child. So this didn't affect her at all.",24Nov2020,1
183,"Hi I am 25 years. I have had a traumatic childhood as I lived with my uncle and grandma while my parents lived somewhere else. They say they went away to find money to look after myself and 2 other siblings.
My uncle did physical maltreat all of us and most of the things my parents sent, we never got. He (uncle) started lying on us and surprisingly my parents believed him. Most of the time we spoke to our parents, we are being cussed or blamed for something we didn't do. 
2x I got sexually abused buy 2 different cousins. My parents made it family issue and let these people go scort free. I was only 7 and 14 when it happened. I have battled with this for long. I fight back so my family has always tagged me the aggressor. They make jokes about sensitive issues thats happened. I blame them for everything that happened when I didnt live with them. They never believe anything I say. They believe other people instead. 
I hadn't lived with my parents until I was 18 years. I try to let everything go and forgive  and build a relationship with them but they always find ways to get me so angry. 
Recently, my dad made a comment to remind of the rape at 14. It was his nephew who sexually assaulted me.  Its been 11 years i have just tried to bury it. The nephew and his parents told my parents it was a mutual sex. My parents believed them and even blame me. I was 14, he was an adult. Even if it was mutual, is that not a red flag to even talk to me about it? I got very angry, I left their house. I thought my mum will be there for me. My mum is worst. She asked me to move on. I have called my parents several times to help me cos now everything is haunting me. They keep saying I had sex with my cousin, I deal with it. I have tried counselling, everything but whats eating me up now is my parents behavior towards me. They never believe me. I felt very suicidal because of this. My parents called the police on me. I nearly lost my job because I am a nurse. My dad specifically said he does not think I am mentally stable to look after patients. He might have been right but all I asked of my parents was to just speak to me about it. To them, I am a liar and it never happened so there's nothing to talk about. My mum said even if it happened, was my fault so I shoukd move on. She said I have always been a problem...
Now my question is, I want to cut ties with my parents. Am I taking things too far if I do? I very much dislike them now and I hope they regret. I want to disappear but I do not know how to start.Sometimes I just want to die to see they will care at all but we only have 1 life",24Nov2020,1

185,"I met this girl freshman year, lets call her Mary. Now Mary was fucking beautiful, and I mean everyone knew her for her looks. We became friends almost instantly in the class I had with her because besides looks she also had this amazing personality, we loved the same music and would have deep conversations in the middle of this dumbass study period. I looked at her as a good friend for a while until probably the summer, our similarities and her beauty got a hold of my heart and I fell for her. The worst thing is, by the beginning of sophomore year, she had a thing with my best friend. Damn I've never been so depressed. We would still hang out and text all the time but I didn't want to fuck it up for my friend or me and Mary's friendship, especially because I knew she didn't feel the same thing for me. That ended, but of course she always had a million other dudes on her plate. I did take her to a school dance tho. Wasn't that fun except for the afterparty but she looked great in her dress. 2 years went by, my mind always plagued by her. I would just be sitting down or showering and would instantly hit by sadness at the thought of her, but near the beginning of junior year I told myself I would do everything possible to get over her. Turns out I didn't have to do much except make fun of her tik tok, which she got pissed af about. We didn't talk for 3 months. Then we started texting one day and got coffee the next morning. I thought maybe I could actually be friends with her. Of course I was wrong, I overthought everything as usual, but eventually I was very close to getting over her. I was finally feeling happy. I was always in a better mood. But I got too conferrable, and I feel like I started to fall for her again. One day we were hanging out with a mutual friend and got into a little argument about song lyrics which obvoiusly left her butthurt. I was so tired of embarrassing myself, and I thought the only way to actually get over her was to text her ""I don't think we should be friends anymore"". She was clearly upset, but I didn't want to answer her calls or texts. Now Halloween rolls around and my friends picked her and my other friend up from a party to go to another. She was in the trunk and I was in the shotgun. In front of all my friends she yells ""\*my name\*, are we friends?"", of course I responded with a ""uhhh"". She took it as offensive when I was really just trying to stay true to what I said about not being friends. When we got to the next party, she got out of the car and started cussing about me. I felt embarrassed. She tried to talk to me a few times at the party tho. We had a short convo but I wasn't enthusiastic about it, and she could tell. Now time goes on and she texts me every once and a while and we have short convos. Shes been going to a lot of parties and shit and it kind of makes me jealous but what can I do I asked for this and I need to get over her. Im close to getting over her, but for the last few days ive been struggling to get her off my mind which has been easy for me. Now I obviously couldn't go over every major event in our friendship but those are the recent ones. The question I have now is what should I do. I miss her, but im close to getting over her but I don't want to risk my progress by being friends with her again. Should I wait, or not be friends with her ever, or should I say something?

187,"Hi everyone, I'm 13 and in eighth grade in middle school. I am taking online school right now, and it has realllly sucked. 
   Before the school year started I was preparing for online school so that I would be productive and follow a schedule. As you can probably guess, I did not do this. Some days I just did no school at all because in my mind I just thought ""why do this?"" Obviously this was stupid thinking, and before I knew it I was failing Every. Single. Class. At this point I just started to feel like ""Jeez I'm this far behind, I really don't want to try to get caught up because, heck, this is going to take forever."" Anyways, my teachers started emailing me and my parents, and I just started feeling really icky about myself. And keep in mind I have always been practically a straight A student, so I just kept feeling this ""oh my gosh, how is this happening, THIS IS NOT WHO I AM!!"" 
  So, my teachers kept sending me emails and I just felt so unmotivated and lazy, and would do anything to distract myself from all of the missing work on my shoulders. I also do running as a hobby/sport/for fun, and used to go like 4 miles a day before online school came along, and all of this crap has literally taken a toll on me physically because I have been running only about 2 miles per day on average, and just not going at all sometimes for no reason. Anyways, I ended the marking period with a majority of E's. Wow, that frickin sucks to type.
      I was going to get a fresh start this marking period, but I just couldn't get into a rhythm. I still use my phone wayyy too much, and stay up until like 12-2 a.m. most days and sleep in until 10-10:30, and before this pandemic I would go to bed at about 10-11 and wake up at around 7:30-8. 
         At the moment I am still failing most classes, and just feel hopeless and know that I am better than this. I'm not sure what I'm trying to gain out of this post, I guess I'm just looking for advice/support and wondering if anyone else is in the same situation. Thanks guys.",24Nov2020,1
188,"My girlfriend and I  of 4 years broke up a week ago. It was kind of mutual, but how it got there and where everything is going is the part I can't stop thinking about especially with a child that we both love so much and we're still going to live together for now.

The little things over the years may have built up to it. From her I would get a snarky remarks here, a small disrespect there, an argument every so often, and a one day break once or twice over the years. I always did what I could to be nice and take care of comfort her though. I guess on my end I wasn't always the best either. I was selfish with my time by playing some video games for excessive amounts of time more often than I should have, I would not want to go anywhere and just stay at home more often than not, and when we went places I would often spend more time on my phone than enjoying what we were doing.

Anyway one day she talked about an open relationship. It sounded like something interesting to try after some years of being together, so I agreed, which was a bad fucking idea in my hind-sighted opinion, it may work for some, but it did not for us. Aside from talking to people online, nothing happened until a few months ago. She kept telling me to go get another girlfriend. So, I finally started putting some effort into it and I met someone and then she met someone shortly after that. She always felt that you should be able to love more than one person, but she was also afraid I might love someone more and leave her, but I just wanted a fuck buddy, I didn't want a relationship, so I didn't imagine that would happen. However, that did happen, well not quite, because I can't quantify loves as they're different. I love them both and I still love my ex, I really do, but I just don't know anymore about anything. An open relationship did not work for us, my ex kept being back and forth about it, one moment she would be jealous and the next she would be genuinely happy for me. It was frustrating for me and my new girlfriend. My ex and I started arguing more often and being distant to each other. It just kept getting worse until last week when we talked and cried and ended everything. 

Was everything going to crash and burn further down the road anyway without this open relationship mess? Would we have been fine? Hindsight is a bitch. I feel awful about everything and I want too much. It wasn't all my ex's fault and it wasn't all my fault either, but we decided to play with fire together and we got burned... badly. I just can't stop thinking about everything, the new girlfriend is being a bit weird about how everything is now after the fact and maybe I'm being paranoid thinking this might not work for her either. My ex and I haven't spoke much about it all since last week. What the fuck did we do? Is this truly over and it's time to move on? Are our new people just some kind of temporary fling? Is this some kind of test of our relationship and we'll get back together sooner or later, but I know nothing will ever be the same, but it could be better if we truly listened to and paid attention to the problems we voiced to each other when everything finally fell apart, or it could just be a shit show and end in flames. So much damn uncertainty all the time in life.

191," So I'm always really anxious with money.

I'm currently living in a studio apartment. I've lived in this place for just under 4 years. It's not luxury by any means, but up until a few months ago it was my favorite apartment I've lived in.

During the summer I had new upstairs neighbors move in and they are LOUD. In the previous 3 years I never heard anything upstairs, now I'm woken up at 7am every day and hear pounds and thuds constantly. This past week there's been an issue with my radiator pipes making noise and the maintenance guy has made it clear they aren't sure when/if it'll get fixed. I starting to feel like I'm going batty and living in a tin can.

I have the possibility of moving in the building to a one bedroom. The rent is 33% more than I'm paying now. Right now my rent is 22.9% of my net (take home) pay, with the new apartment it'll be 30.7%

Power, water and gas are included. I only pay for internet.

With the pandemic, living in a studio is really starting to wear on me. I don't get much sunlight since I'm up against another building. The new unit has drastically more sunlight and my living space would increase by over 60%. It's also the exact unit floorplan I would want from options in the building. It's also around 20-30% cheaper than other similar apartments in my area, and I love my neighborhood. I'm unsure if my company will have give us the option to work from home fulltime after things settle down, but I'm WFH at least until July. I don't like moving and would want to stay for at least 3-5 years.

My other expenses are

Student Loans - 15%

Long term Savings - 9.5%

Short term savings - 5.9%

Other bills/Reoccurring costs - 10% (Phone, netflix, internet, medical)

Food - 15%

Other/Fun - 14%

401k - 12% of my gross pay, but I don't add/subtract it from my net pay. It's totally separate.

I live in the city so I don't own or need a car.

196,"Hello. I’m (21F) on a throwaway account for obvious privacy reasons. 

I truly don’t know where to begin to start this off. 
I’ll start by, I live with my mother(60) and my older brother.
My mother had an addiction to pain killers over 20 years ago, and has been on everyday medication since to help. I’m not entirely sure what her meds are, but I know that she very much needs them. (Not to live, but if she doesn’t she’ll be “crazy”). I mention that incase it could fall into why she’s been the way she has been.

The past 7 or so months now, my mom has been picking at her skin, head to toe. I mean she has GIANT scabs, all over her face, chest, arms, hands, stomach, legs, feet. She sits on the couch all day long and just picks at herself. She claims that she has bugs living inside of her skin. At first she said they must be mites from a tree outside that she’s always touching and got them that way. Now she’s been thinking they’re like little wasps or something, I don’t know. She’s been to the hospital and the doctors and they both told her she’s just picking at herself. She told me today she probably is just picking sometimes but there’s definitely bugs inside too. I don’t really know what to do with her anymore and it makes me feel very drained because I know there’s nothing wrong with her. I should also mention when I was much younger, my sister-in-law always told me she had a weird “picking” addiction. Pimples, scabs, etc. and then this past year, her main hobby has been sitting on the couch and picking “bugs” out of raspberries.
She will go to the store and buy raspberries and just sit all day long and pick out the bugs. I’m considering this may have a play into how she’s migrated to her skin. IDK. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for on here. Advice, a solution, at this point it hurts to be near her and it pains me to see my mother destroying herself. 

I know she suffers from major depression. She lacks total confidence in herself and always has. She never cared about my schooling or anything I tried attending growing up. She has just kind of gotten by in life. She has 5 kids and the only ones that talk to her are my brother and I, because we live with her. My brother is a whole other story that I will also make a post about.
My life is just extremely depressing and I just need to here some outside insight more than anything because I have zero mental or physical help from anybody, whatsoever.
Thank u",24Nov2020,1
197," My grandfather, who is nearly 80 years old and has only one working lung and is overweight with diabetes, has gotten COVID, so I'm a bit worried about his health and how much longer he'll be around. I want to somehow let him know how much I love him, but since I can't see him in person and don't even know if I'd be comfortable seeing him in person, I decided to write a letter. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to ask this here, but I was wondering if you guys could take a look at the letter and tell me what you think about it. Should I shorten it? Should I change some wording? How should I hit the right spot? Any and all advice would be greatly welcome and appreciated.

Here it is:

&gt;Dear Grampa,  
I really don’t know how to begin this, since I usually don’t share my emotions like this. Nonetheless, here goes nothing. I love you, Grampa. I am so appreciative of you, and I am so blessed to have you. I am so grateful for all the great experiences I have had with you over the last few years, whether it be when we did hay together, when we were chopping wood, or when we got to go on the Christmas train, it was all so very amazing, and the best part was being able to be with you, as well as Grammy.  
Unfortunately, this past year hasn’t been the greatest to spend time with you guys, but I hope you know that my love and appreciation for you guys is no less. I was so delighted to see you guys at your house right before I left for college, it made me so happy, so thank you for letting me have dinner with you. Anyways, I just wanted you guys to know how much you mean to me and how much I love you.  
Thank you for letting me work with you whether that be building the woodchip road to the chickens, cutting hay in the field, or splitting wood. Whether it was cold out or hot out, I was always excited to be able to spend time with you. Thank you for teaching me how to drive the boat in Ipswich. Thank you for bringing me to the construction show in New Hampshire, too. That was very much fun! Thank you for bringing me with you guys to get lobster rolls and take a boat ride with Don. Thank you for bringing me on the Christmas train ride.  
I hope you know how appreciative I am for all the experiences and times we got to spend together over these last couple years, and although things have changed and become more difficult this past year, I hope that we can continue our fun times again soon. Even if we just watch football on Sunday or watch some episodes of Gold Rush, as long as we can spend time together again, that’ll be a dream come true, but we shouldn’t rush it, because I know there’ll be a time when we can do it all again.  
Thank you for teaching me all the lessons you have over the past couple years, such as hard work, humor, honesty, strength, perseverance, integrity, and the value of family. From words of wisdom you have shared to observations I have made of your actions and habits, I truly do thank you for teaching me such great lessons and virtues, essentially instructions of how to be a good man. While I do have Mom and Dad and I do have what I’ve learned from Xavier, I know for a fact that I wouldn’t have the potential I do if it weren’t for you, so thank you so much.  
It is my wish that I could only return the favor, but you’ve done so much, and I could never repay the debt I owe you. Nonetheless, I will do my best. I will do my best to continue your traditions of hard work, emphasis on family, love of the outdoors and the country, and above all being a good man, a good person. I will do my best to pass on this key lesson to my future family, to my future kids, and to everyone I meet in life. Already, from experience, these lessons you’ve taught me have already proven useful as I’ve made great friends I couldn’t have made otherwise, so again I am very grateful.  
In conclusion, I just want to thank you, tell you how much I appreciate and love you as well as tell you that, although I’m not sure how much longer this distancing and separation will go on, I do hope we can see each other again and spend some good quality time together like we did before these times. Regardless of how much longer we have to wait for the times to get better, I am extremely grateful for all you have done, and I truly mean this, and I will always love you and appreciate you. I will never forget all of these lessons you’ve taught me and experiences we’ve shared, and even when we can’t see each other face to face, we’ll never be too far away.  
With the deepest appreciation and love,

199,"Last night I met up with my two best friends to get some dinner. We had a few drinks ate some food, when my friend brings up that her boyfriend of almost 5 years voted from Trump in the recent election. Just as a backstory, I have met her boyfriend and we have had a couple disagreements in the past. I don’t particularly like him because his style of humor is basically degrading anyone he meets, usually with racist jokes. He has on multiple occasions said racist “jokes” toward me and my boyfriend who is Asian.
My friends and I are all Mexican women and her boyfriend is white. Everyone in our friend group have similar political views and have openly talked about how we feel about the election and the candidates, especially my friend. She is the most outspoken, opinionated, activist of all of us and she constantly talks about Trump and her overall distaste towards him. So last night when she told us this, I was completely shocked and figured he did it as an edgy joke. Apparently not, he did it being 100% serious. I can’t wrap my head around her being okay with dating someone that supports a racist, rapist, white suprematist. 
This led to an argument, mostly me trying to understand why/how she is still dating him after learning this, and why she didn’t break up with him. I feel like she doesn’t have the self respect to understand that she’s dating a racist. I haven’t spoken to either of the friends since and I don’t know whether or not I should apologize and try to fix things or move on.",24Nov2020,1
200,"I live with a roommate currently. One of my friends. She drives me crazy sometimes, and I find myself taking on most of the “adult things”. Shes kind of learning though, and sometimes it’s fun. I’m so torn because I really want to live on my own. Though I can technically afford it, we currently live in a 2 bed 2 1/2 bed town house. If I were to move I’d have to pay at least $500 more for an apartment (Seattle FYI) I’d have more of my own space, and I wouldn’t have a roommate to deal with! Is it worth it?? Or is what’s technically only minor-ish annoyances worth just keeping a roommate and paying less for rent. 

Hope this is what r /advice is for lol. Please help.",24Nov2020,1
201,Hey guys first time doing this but I really don’t have anyone to talk to. I’m 19 and supposed to leave for the Air Force soon so while waiting for the day I leave I just play videogames with friends and watch tv. My mom hates it and has started taking it out on me. In our most recent fight she threatened to call the recruiter and get me kicked out or something. Obviously she doesn’t have any power to do that but the fact that she would attempt to dismantle my future over a petty fight seems like a big deal to me. What do I do?,24Nov2020,1
202,"I'm not here to get into a political debate or to start one, but my girlfriend is a huge Trump supporter and I am not, at all. I voted for Biden who I really didn't like (I liked Bernie wayyyy better). But anyways that's besides the point. I really do love her and she's a good person but it can get really irritating having to hear here political views on things because she is the complete opposite of me and i've always said don't judge the politics, judge the person. I'm kinda hot headed sometimes and I kinda just say ""ok"" or ""cool"", or i'll be straight up and say ""i don't want to get into an argument about this"". Is there a better way to handle it? Like...i'd never break off a relationship or friendship because if political differences but it's really hard to keep my cool about that stuff; because other than that, we get along really great.",24Nov2020,1
203,"A few days ago I (22) came home to one of my parents attempted suicide. I called 911 and within a matter of minutes the sheriffs department, a fire truck, an investigator, and an ambulance arrived at my house.

My parent lived and was taken to the E.R. and then taken in another ambulance to a psychiatric  facility where they stayed for a few days on heavy medication. They are now obviously expected to continue therapy and medication for an unforeseen amount of time.

One parent (the one who didn’t attempt suicide) is struggling to figure out how to pay for each individual bill that is sure to come in. The other parent (the one who attempted suicide) stated after waking that there is no way for us to afford everything.

I refuse to mention the fact that I have trouble sleeping or being in the same area as the suicide attempt because that would only cause more bills with therapy.

How can I help my family and why do I feel guilty?",24Nov2020,1
204,"Hi, maybe a weird type of advice post but, I sent nudes a couple years ago to a couple strangers my age. They were mutuals that went to different schools, and they were completely meaningless interactions (one time, don't remember their names, etc.).

I assume that these people wouldn't really be a problem because it's been years and we don't even remember each other.

I then became super close to an online friend this year and ended up trading nudes back and forth quite a bit. It's a long story, but I didn't respect myself and he was really manipulative. As soon as a realization clicked in me that he was a fucked up person, I tried to cut ties but he just keeps showing up in my life to harass me and my friends. We had a sincere talk about how we both never saved any nudes and how we'd never talk about it again, and it did sound genuine. I blocked him on everything.

Here's the issue, I really wanted to become a streamer for the longest time of my life. And not to sound like a narcissist or anything, but I feel that I can get pretty decently well-known. How likely is it that the person I sent nudes to this year would come back and stalk my stream? It just makes me so uncomfortable and anxious that he might just keep harassing me, join my stream and tell everyone that I sent him nudes. 

What would I even do if this hypothetically happened? Could I deny it? I'm so bad at lying... should I ignore it? And continued on with needing advice, I really wanted to go into the stem field work in a very official field, how likely is it that me having sent nudes underage will actually affect my career? Is it more likely to just never come out in the future because I was a minor? Like the fact that I sent nudes will stay unknown to others?

I live in regret and fear everyday, and I just have no clue what to do.",24Nov2020,1

I didn’t like it but she was my friend and I knew asking her to take it down would upset her. Me and Jess had a huge falling out with grace. We asked her take down the account multiple times but she would block us every time. Her father messaged me today saying if we were to continue to “harass” his daughter he would file a lawsuit. 

I feel uncomfortable that she has an entire Instagram account with pictures of me and Jess, we can’t even see the account or what she posts on it.",24Nov2020,1
208,"Recently me and my girlfriend are going through a rough patch. Everything was good, we would talk and FaceTime everyday meet up. And everything was going great and it was beautiful. But for the past week she’s been acting weird and it’s all been after she’s gotten her hair dyed. She hasn’t been calling me back, taking long to text back. And honestly it’s annoying.  It makes me feel like the hair dye is seeping into her brain honestly. I’ve been trying to ask her what’s going on and she keeps saying nothing and she seems to be busy all of a sudden. I’m so confused and it just irritates my soul.",24Nov2020,1
209,"People are telling me about cool things they’ve done or gotten, yet I can’t feel happy for them. Rather, I feel anger towards them, I get jealous. 

I figure they talk to me about these things because I know they value me as I value them, and want validation. Or they want me to happy for them. 

And I know I should be happy for them, but I just can’t find it in me. They talk about being good at something that I also do, I want to use it as a drive to improve at said thing, while still being happy for them. 

It’s like a “I have to be better” kind of mentality, I want to be good for at least one thing.",24Nov2020,1

211,"Title says it all. I made a plan by getting my life together to make her lose her shit. Did somethings that made me look like a criminal as I knew a smear campaign was coming. Didnt realize the full extent to everything that was going on. I planned this with some “friends” of mine and now nobody believes me as I did inevitably have a psychotic break from long standing PTSD and drug abuse. Most people are convinced im delusional. I cant seem to get over that this is my life now when it never used to be. Used to be able to actually attract women the way i wanted to and feel their emotions now im detached emotionally and for quite literally over a year getting worse mentally that i am unable to do so now. I failed. I didnt know the extent of what was going on. I didnt expect much, but holy shit..i cant get over how lonely my life is going to be and how i am not only now seeking approval and validation but i’ll never get it. Seriously. Moved out of my narcissistic moms house to a narcissistic roommate, to a fucking weird psychological manipulation from another friend, and to my dad who’s a total narcissist himself. I often fear im becoming a lot like him and i dont know what to do. Do i off myself or continue even though i know im not going to get the life I wanted? This has been on my mind for a long time as I’ve explored so much manipulation throughout the years only to been seen as fucking insane",24Nov2020,1
212,I lost my grandpa on veterans day. My father is a lunatic he is the source of my anger. He screams yells constantly and I just am so done with it all. All the things that happen I just cant handle it anymore I'm so done with it all. I've thought about suicide but I couldn't do that just the thought of it makes me uncomfortable now. There is just about no one I can talk to that won't end up telling anyone else that could just make things worse I just can't handle it anymore.,24Nov2020,1
213,"First of all, thank you for taking the time to read this. 

I currently live in campus housing, but am unable to stay here over the winter (5 weeks). I can either a) move back and live with my parents or b) take up my friend’s offer to stay with her family.

For context, about a year ago I moved out after years of verbal abuse and manipulation from my mother. 

I feel bad for considering option B in the first place since I’d be inconveniencing someone else and potentially dragging them into my family’s shenanigans. If I go with option A, I don’t mind staying out for most of the day and taking a night shift job so I’ll be away from home most of the time.

Taking option A in the past has led to crippling depression and me becoming basically mute. I spoke to the counsellor at my university about this - she told me to return home so I can learn to deal with this uncomfortable situation and stand my ground. To be fair, I assume my parents have been more mindful of boundaries since they haven’t called or texted me much. But I still feel uneasy.

I’m not sure how to go about deciding, so guiding questions/advice are welcome. Thank you!",24Nov2020,1

I have a friend who I’ll call tom. He is a little younger than me(I’m 17 and I think he’s either 16 or 15) and we’ve been friends for a while. Not the “I’ll catch a bullet for you” kinda friends but we’ve hung out quite a bit and spent time with eachother. Recently he’s entered a sorta relationship with my sister(she’s 14 and we all go to the same school). I say sorta because it’s not like he comes over and presents himself that way. I’ve seen her come home with his hoodie on and even my mom has confirmed they might have a little thing going on which I’m pretty sure is right. My sister doesn’t talk to me about this stuff ever so it makes sense as to why. I don’t know why but I just get a weird feeling thinking about it. It’s not like he’s a bad guy at all and he thinks highly of me(I’ve was told he made nice comments about me) but it’s just weird because it’s my friend. I wouldn’t care if it was a random stranger but it being my friend just puts me off. It’s like I don’t wanna be in the same room as them together if they start like seriously dating or what if he does wrong by my sister and I gotta kick his ass? I wouldn’t care if it was a random guy but I don’t wanna have to knock tom out. It’s just awkward all across the board.

218,"I recently submitted an essay to my English teacher. I worked my butt off on it and spent way longer on it than I probably should've because I had a really difficult time with the material. It didn't help that he gives us dozens of pages of material to read daily and didn't ease off that any when he assigned us this essay (meaning I had to keep up with that in addition to everything else I was working on.) Well, checking my grade online, I see that I made a C- on it. Crap. I check the feedback, and he has note after note listing how my interpretation of the text doesn't agree with his, and in the end, he leaves a note saying I can't be a good teacher without first being a good student.   


I'm at a loss for words at this point. Maybe it's the exhaustion sinking in, but that comment just felt... I don't know, unprofessional, I guess? I've worked so hard in this class and still have a B to show for it (despite it taking a serious hit with that grade.) I feel like he shouldn't expect his students to read his mind; if there are things he wants us to include in these essays, he should really mention those things in class, right?   


I also just feel *bad*. Should I apologize to him or something? I'm not sure what to do anymore, but I have two classes with him next semester and many more to come if I'm going to become an English teacher. Any advice on where to go from here would be appreciated.",24Nov2020,1
219,"Today around 1 pm I got my blood drawn for testing at the hospital. It all seemed like a normal routine. It felt kind of painful to bend my arm but I guess that's normal. A few hours ago I accidentally squeezed and rubbed the area where the blood was drawn,and now it hurts more than it did before. I also noticed a bit of a lump in the area of the vein. I guess they call it the brachial vein,which is at the bend of the arm. It kind of hurts when I bend my arm to type on my phone or browse around.
Should I be concerned about this? I heard some people getting hematoma and infections after getting blood drawn,who needed emergency treatment. Anyone else dealt with this???

221,"my mental health relies STRONGLY on working out at the gym and hanging out with my coach/teammates. I do martial arts btw

This might not seem like a big deal, but I have a really strict schedule, and if I go out of it I can get seriously depressed (like genuinely really depressed it’s bad) my hormone balance is rly delicate and I have worked my schedule out to help my mental health. it’s been rly good for me, but if I break from my schedule I’m fucked. 

I’m planning on working out on my own, but I can’t get as good of a workout when I’m not training like I do at the gym. So I know I’ll get mentally frustrated, and I won’t physically feel great. 

Plus- I can’t replace my coach and friends. My family is a handful, just like any other family. My dad is an abusive hot head, my mom is a druggy/alcoholic, my grandparents are offensive, my brother can be a dick, my sister can be a bitch. 

I’m looking at the negatives here, and I should stop, but I have a good reason to be worried. I will most likely get very depressed without the gym. Idk what to do. I honestly don’t. I will work out, but it’s not like I can do that all day (I normally spend all day hanging out at the gym talking w my team) and if you guys have ideas I would appreciate it.",24Nov2020,1

223,"I don't know how to best articulate my feelings right now. I'm just feeling a bit fed up. My (27/F) friend (50/M), who is actually my former coworker from company we used to work at, was laid off from our previous employer earlier this year. I know a friendship between a 27 and 50 year old sounds weird, but trust me, it's genuine and we've known each other a long time. Any who, prior to him getting laid off, I was laid off from the same company and unemployed for almost 1.5 years - this indeed was a personal choice of falling into &amp; staying in a deep depression, sulking, and not applying myself. I ended up getting a fantastic job earlier this year and I'm not sure I would be able to appreciate it in the sense that I do today had I not experienced the darkness that is unemployment and depression for an elongated period of time.

Anyways, back to my friend. So, he's got a lot on his plate. Two children, an ex he's still trying to finalize divorce papers with, a LOT of debt, and then some. He only recently landed his new job, maybe just a month ago, and up until that point had been telling me how he felt like he'd been losing his mind with all the free time, how he felt useless and wanted so badly to work again. When the job opportunity came about, he wasn't sure if he should take it, and asked me what I thought. I pressed him hard to take the job, mentioning multiple factors to help shape his perspective/shed life on the reality of his current situation, but ultimately stressing the importance of having a job in this insane and shifty economic climate. He took the job, of course, but every single time I ask him about it, I hear NOTHING but negativity. The company sucks, they're disorganized, they're not helping him get oriented, they have no resources, the pay is hourly/terrible, etc. I try to be supportive, lending my ear and offering advice, but it's draining me because I realized I can't help this person. Only they can help themselves. And I have no idea what to do. 

He had this same exact attitude/mentality at our previous company - and I'll admit, yes, the place was disorganized and pretty messed up. But having a negative attitude not only makes things worse but doesn't really do anything good whatsoever. If there's anything I've learned over the past years through hardship, it's that being proactive in trying to change your circumstances might suck temporarily, but will almost always pay off dividends in the long run. He just doesn't seem to see things this way and kind of acts like a victim in every situation. The company is wronging him, no one likes him, he has no friends and can't get along with anyone. I don't want to make him sound like an awful person to be around because he really is wonderful and has a great heart and has been a dear friend to me over the years, but I just got to a point where I feel like I've either outgrown certain friendships/mentalities, or I don't know what. I just can't keep feeling dragged down and it pisses me off that someone could complain about having a VERY decent job at a pretty reputable company during a pandemic when people are starving and would kill for that job. End rant.

I don't really know what to ask. I think I'm just wondering how you guys would feel if you were in my shoes. How would you handle this? Is there anything you'd say to this person to try and help them? Or do sometimes we just have to distance ourselves from situations/people that feel toxic in life?",24Nov2020,1
224,"Hey Guys I really need some advice here, I have a coworker who had a miscarriage a year ago, just a little backstory, the pregnancy was not planned nor did the baby ever have a heart beat. the pregnancy was 5 or 6 weeks long. She ended up passing everything on her own. She took a couple days off from work. Some months later she would just up and leave work because of miscarriage(due to all the emotions she was having) We also work in the birthing unit at the hospital in Atlanta, so you can’t just leave when we got tons of patients that gotta deliver?! She also won’t stop talking about it now a year later.. I do feel bad for her but i’m trying to figure out if it’s just an excuse for all the mistakes she’s making, if there’s mistake &amp; I call her out on it, she will bring up that it’s been a tough year and the “miscarriage”. I know that miscarriage are hard and everyone grieves differently. But how long is long enough! Another coworker in our same shift had a miscarriage at 39 weeks, she took it hard for the first few months but now is feeling good, never not once blaming her miscarriage for her mistakes, she immediately take responsibility for her actions. rather than my coworkers baby’s heart hadn’t even developed yet, it was a sac. Here my questions, how long can she keep going using her miscarriage from a year ago to blame all the mistakes that she makes and two what can i say or do that’s polite to make her stop talking about it because it quite frankly irritates me and i don’t wanna say something nasty because she is super defensive and quick to victimize herself. And also am i being too cold? I spoke with multiple of our on call doctors to get there opinion without telling them who they were and they agreed to that it’s normal to grieve for maybe 1-3 months but for a unplanned pregnancy that hadn’t even developed fully, we shouldn’t be struggling after 1 year.

226,"Thank you all first for taking the time to review my question.  I’m currently torn whether or not to take an offer from another company or to stay at my current company.  

Current company (Manager) - base salary $120k but I have 1MM unvested equity to be vested in next four years. This means I’ll average $370k over the next four years in total comp.  The work life balance sucks and I often think about job security as all my immediate managers or senior leadership tend to get fired or get pushed out.  This makes me think I have about 2-3 years until I may potentially get fired when they think about “re-organization”.  I have worked at this job for 7 years and I can do the job with my eyes closed.

New company (Sr. Manager) - base salary of $185k but I have 10,000 shares of options with a strike price of around $3.00.  If this company goes public and is 1/20th the size of my current company, the total equity I would vest would be equivalent to the 1MM at my current company.  The pros is I have an opportunity to come in as a senior manager and I can maybe become a director in the next 3-4 years if I hustle.  I’m going to be the subject matter expert and I’ll have a lot of visibility to senior leadership as I’ll be building and launching a product similar to my current company.  This also means it’ll be challenging.  

I’m however torn as I’m continually going by the old adage- a bird in hand is better than two in the bush.  Should I take the job given I’ll forfeit so much guaranteed money?  How would you evaluate which company would be best?  I’m trying to not make the decision on money but I can’t help it. Any advice or suggestions would be awesome.  Due to privacy I will not release what I do or the companies.  Sorryyy but I would still love any feedback.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.",24Nov2020,1
227,"Nightmares have been affecting me in every way possible, and when I am awake the smallest thing can make me flinch.

Like when I was doing my violin practice I couldn't hear anyone upstairs, and my stupid mind told me that someone just shot my family and their screams were drowned out by the sounds of my instrument.

And when my grandmother traveled back to our home country, I keep thinking that the plane will crash or get hit by a missile (don't even know what that came from)

In my nightmares, is usually something about a meteor hitting Earth and somehow splitting everything in half, or a dinosaur came alive from a fossil and ate everyone. Sometimes it gets on the personal side, like a member of the family gets kidnapped or killed. And other times it goes public like Trump getting angry and firing a missile at Joe Biden (don't know where that came either) and ended up destroying the world.

And yeah

This has been happening from around when I was 7 until now, I am 13.

228,"Hello Reddit, 

First-time poster here.

Also not a native English speaker, so please excuse any poor grammar choices I might make.

**My situation:**  
I (not Japanese) am living in Japan and have joined a Tokyo-based IT-staffing company in October.

It has been decided that I stand-by in our Tokyo office and work on training material before I go to work as a network engineer at a contractor\`s company starting December. You know, like staffing companies usually do.  
The company is small-to medium sized (200+ people) and has no centralized IT. (not organized in ActiveDirectory or similar)  
It\`s also using a Software-based VPN to connect Home-office workers to their Intranet. 

While working on studying material for new employees, I stumbled across something that seems like a security disaster to me.

The Intranet page alone is not only running a 10 year-old Apache/CentOS release, but is also accessible from anyone in the network. It offers an e-mail address list of every employee and a static IP address of every device on the networks between our 5 branch-offices, all without requiring any authentication.  
To make matters worse, the same server also stores employee and customer data without proper encryption - this includes me and my family\`s data.  
Because of this setup, our entire IT landscape can be easily compromised by either insiders (or outsiders if they manage to infect a VPN-connected PC)

Of course, I have raised this issue with my superiors who escalated it further to our IT department.   
A few of IT\`s answers were as follows: **(in Japanese, mind you)**  
*""Since the server in question is not reachable from the outside, there is no risk of compromise. Thus, we see no need to update.""*  
*""We trust every employee fully, there is no risk of a breach.""*  
*""It has gone well up until now, we don\`t see a problem.""*  
*""There\`s nobody who would target us, get real.""*

Since this situation is costing me sleep for almost two months, I have escalated this to the highest level in the Tokyo location about 3 weeks ago.  
The guy is not tech-savvy at all, but has promised me to look into it with the IT department.   
I have gotten no feedback to this day.

I\`m still on my trial-period and will be a full-time employee starting April 1st and I really don\`t want to quit this job since pay and benefits are quite nice.

What can I do in such a situation? Am I perhaps too paranoid?  
I would be so grateful if I could get any advice on what I should do,  or some feedback. 

Many thanks in advance.",24Nov2020,1
229,"So for almost this whole year  me and my ex/best friend have been playing Minecraft for hours at a time. 
But for some reason when we played today I decided I couldn’t keep it a secret anymore. 
The reason why I love her is because We get along well we tell jokes to each other we know each other very well ever time we play together I get so happy. 

Anyways the reason why I wanted to tell her is because today when we were playing she was really happy we where joking around talking I was making her laugh and she even made me laugh a few times and I just know that I love her and would do anything to make her or smile I just want to know how can I tell her",24Nov2020,1

And now we don’t talk. And I DON’T want to lose her, but the little stuff became big stuff and now I feel like she doesn’t want to fight either, and instead of open communication, it’s secrets and radio silence. And because of this, I feel like I lost two friends (her and her boyfriend, who is also my friend).

231,"**Please help me figure out what I'm missing in my lifelong quest to become better at socializing.**  

I'm in my twenties and for most of my life I've felt socially retarded/left out/shy. A few patterns I've gathered are: 

1) I usually end up getting left out. E.g. during group work it starts off usually fine and then after a short while the other people end up bonding with each other better. Same thing with small group of friends. Sometimes when I think I'm getting along with someone, and a third person comes along and then they start bonding with the the other person. 

2)  I don't think fast enough - sometimes I simply don't say anything because I can't come with anything on the spot! I've tried just ""reacting"" before thinking but that doesn't really work for me. My brain literally feels....blank. It's frustrating because usually after a few minutes or hours or days I realize what I could've said. Someone usually beats me to responding to someone else. 

3)  I love one on one convos, where I feel way more comfortable sharing my thoughts with just one other person. I'm usually pretty good with these convos and have a lot of contribute. That's just my perception though. 

4) I listen to a bunch of podcasts, watch interesting documentaries, have a good education, play music, know a few languages...but still feel like I don't know ""enough""/feel like it takes time for my brain to recall something or apply something from one situation somewhere else. 

Some possible explanations I've come with for my inability to make friends or do well in social situations are: 

* People get the wrong impression of me from my bland or cliché responses, or lack of excitement. 
* I don't present info in an interesting way/I'm unrelatable? 
* I come off as judgmental/stuck up/boring due to slow response time

232,"Her and I have had sex many times. She is currently 5 months pregnant and hates it. She feels sick and tired and weak and she has communicated to me that it’s the worst thing that has ever happened to her. Unfortunately, this caused her to come to the conclusion that she didn’t ever want sex again because she didn’t want to risk getting pregnant. 

I know a lot of people are going to say that sex isn’t a part of marriage or that you can be happy in a sexless relationship, but sex is a part of intimacy for me (especially since my love language is physical touch). She didn’t seem open to protected sex or anything like that because “those aren’t always successful”. Going into my life I just can’t be in a marriage where I never have sex again.

234,"So I (13f) have been friends with R(13nb) for approximately 4 years now. Over the course of a couple months, their living situation has deteriorated drastically. It started when they came out as non-binary earlier this year and it has slowly become worse over time. Before this, their parents seemed to be doing fine, and if there was any early warning signs of abuse I couldn't tell. I think that at some point they cracked and decided to take it out on R. R has had to put up with physical, verbal, emotional, and in some cases even sexual abuse. Their mom has threatened to stab them on multiple occasions and has even hit them. She makes R take 3 different types of depression medications, all of them which either make R's depression worse or make them sick. She goes through their room and one time looked up a skirt they were wearing for a cosplay. Both their stepdad and mom have yelled at them and made rude remarks about their weight. 

They're mom is divorced and remarried to their stepdad before I met R. Their mom really cares about outside appearances and is very careful that she puts up a good front. I see this every time I look at her relationship with my parents who, from what I can tell, can't see just how much of a nut she is. She takes her anger out on R and then talks to people like she isn't an abuser, and it really pisses me off, especially when she does it to my parents. 

R's stepdad is also abusive, but from what I can tell it isn't as bad. He still yells at R and slings demeaning comments, but he doesn't hit them. Now, I could be completely wrong about and I'll get into that later, but I digress.

Now, their dad is interesting because although R doesn't see him very much(their mom got full custody) but every  has been horrible . Even before R's mother became this way, their dad was always abusive. They abused R's mom before she divorced, and abuses R whenever they visit. I'm not really going to get into this because it would be incredibly long if I did. He lives across the country, so besides the affects of his abuse, I don't think he impacts the situation. 

R has two stepsibling, a stepsister and a stepbrother(16), however, they only live with their step brother. Most of the abuse is shoved onto R because in the words of their mom, ""they can handle it because they are more mature"". Really, the whole situation in the house is just bad, but I don't know anything about the brothers situation, so I don't feel like I have the authority to make a call about that.

Okay I think I might need to put this here, but it really doesn't change my opinion. As you could probably already tell, all the information I get is directly from R so I don't have any way of verifying it. I do, however, know that this is not something R would ever lie about in a million years. 

I just want to know what I can do to help them. From how it looks I don't think separating them from their parents is feasible. If I called the CDC I doubt that they would do anything, and I'm worried that calling them would only make the abuse worse. They can't stay with me because we don't have any rooms in my house that they could use. 

I'm sorry if this was just an incoherent mess, If you need anymore clarification I'd be glad to give it to you. I think that's all I have to say. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",24Nov2020,1

I’ve been overweight for a large majority of my life, but recently in the past 5 months I’ve decided to finally do something about it. I’ve gone from weight 86kg done to 65kg. However, recently I’ve been struggling to get my Body fat percentage down to 10% (I’m stuck at 13.9%) and it’s beginning to really affect my motivation. I have been having cheat days weekly and on those cheat days I absolutely stuff myself with food until I feel utterly sick and disgusted with myself. It’s got to the point where I’ve begun experimenting with purging so I feel less guilty about eating so much. I don’t know why I’m doing this to myself, as soon as I eat something over my calorie deficit (1,750 calories) I become a different person, constantly fixated on food and nothing else.

242,"I (23F) have never had a boyfriend before. I’ve dated a handful of guys, a few of which I’ve mentioned to my mom before, but it rarely went past a first date. I haven’t had much luck with dating because I was a late bloomer (didn’t date at all in high school) and have been sexually assaulted. I haven’t shared those experiences explicitly with my mom, but she vaguely knows that something traumatic happened to me at least once (long story). 

All that is to say is I am straight! But still, my mom will says things to me like “it’s okay if you’re gay, we’ll still love you”. Or when I had a hickey and my mom said “I didn’t know you had a boyfriend” and I said that I don’t, she responded “Oh, sorry, I didn’t know you had a girlfriend”. Or, today, when I said that I wasn’t the one whose girlfriend was staying over in reference to my younger brother, she said “You have a girlfriend?!”. 

I don’t know why she makes jokes about my sexuality as if I am gay. I was involved heavily in the performing arts growing up and as a result, I have a lot of LGBTQ friends. A handful of my friends from college are LGBTQ as well, but I’ve never once insinuated that I’m interested in dating women and have only ever gone out with men. It makes me very insecure about the fact that I’ve never brought a guy home to meet my family because I’ve never found a guy worth bringing home. It makes me feel inadequate. Besides that, it’s just very frustrating having my sexuality questioned all the time. How do I get her to stop?

247,"Okay, to start off, I know that this whole thing is so stupid and unnecessarily dramatic. But one night in late August, I was bored and decided to go on Omegle. I met a guy who I clicked with immediately and he wasn’t a weirdo or looking for me to virtually satisfy some fetish or something. We talked for a good three hours or so and then I gave him my snapchat. We continued to talk for a few more days but I felt like things were going way too fast (ex: he was making small comments about our future) and eventually he tried to do this thing with me through text that made me extremely uncomfortable and I cut ties with him. We went our separate ways but I couldn’t help but think about him every once in a while. In the few days that we talked in August, I learned a lot about myself and I really did like him at first. 

A few weeks ago, I had a bright idea (admittedly after two glasses of champagne and a rough week) to text him and congratulate him on Biden’s win because he’s in the US. We started talking from there, turns out he has a girl now but he’s extremely thankful that he met me because I was like the last straw or something. Well we kept talking but...I don’t want to talk to him anymore. I feel pressured because he sees me as this amazing friend who he can trust and I just can’t do the same for him. I admit I also said some weird stuff but I apologized and he didn’t seem to mind. We also had a small argument about the fact that I was worried that maybe his gf wouldn’t be okay with him talking me, and he felt like I was assuming that she was jealous as he wasn’t trustworthy and he scolded me for not elaborating on what I say. Minutes before coming onto this sub, I told him that I didn’t want him to have high expectations and then have his bubble burst basically because I can’t put my trust in someone that quickly. I won’t even lie, some of the stuff he’s said to me straight up sounds like flirting but then he’ll call me bitch and joke around because we’re friends, and apparently he has a lot of female best friends. What do I do here? I don’t really want to continue on with this friendship but I don’t want to hurt his feelings. 

TLDR: met a dude on Omegle and we hit it off, ended up cutting ties with him bc of an incident, hit him up again bc bad decision and he’s putting his trust in me and putting me above his other friends while only knowing me for a few weeks. He also has a gf and sometimes some of what he says is flirtatious.",24Nov2020,1

I’m 21, currently active duty military. I’m being medically discharged due to medical issues. From day 1 of my life I’ve cared a bit too much about my health, always worked out, watched what I ate, restricted bad foods etc. about a year in the military I developed epilepsy. 

I was being treated for epilepsy and at the time I wasn’t aware I had a family history but apparently the anti epileptic medications triggered schizophrenia. I find this SO funny because any “brain chemistry altering” drug can trigger it. I wasn’t “bound” to get it but it so happened that I had an unknown family history of it. Growing up I never touched drugs, not even pot. I never even had caffein till the military. If I had done pot, lsd, molly etc those types of drugs it’s possible it would’ve triggered it earlier. 

Then to top it all off the epilepsy is somehow causing heart issues. My heart has stopped once which I had to be given CPR until the ambulance arrived because I wasn’t in a hospital at the time. EKGs have picked up my heart doing weird stuff since this whole thing started. Truth is I’m going to be needing a heart transplant sometime around my early- mid 30s (if I make it that far). 

I’ve tried so hard to live a healthy life and for some reason everything is going down the drain. Recently something just “clicked” in my head. Why should I care now? I used to vape a while back but recently I started up again because why not? Seriously, why not? Lungs are gonna die, any unknown thing about vaping is bound to not have enough time to happen before I die etc. tbh I’ve been thinking about doing drugs once I get out because well, why not?

My friend group (R) (P) (J) and (B) have been friends for awhile now, I’ve known R and P for at least a year but J and B were new additions to the group. R knows that I had a little crush on J, and before J was coming to hangout with us, R told me she wouldn’t let on what I said about J. Pretty much after J arrives, R tells her everything, the way she said it and looked afterwards, you could tell she wasnt joking. At this point i’m visibly uncomfortable, and after i’m basically yelling at her to stop, she goes on to make jokes about it.I’m stunned, because I believed I could trust her and have been her friend for a while. We all go back to her house, I grab my stuff there and tell her i have to go, (i was a bit rude when she asked why i was leaving, but nothing more than a little frustrated) i walk to go hangout with another friend.


 R texts me a day after, I would have forgiven her, expect when she texted me she acted as if she didn’t know what she did or didn’t have a clue what was going on. i told her what she did wasn’t cool, and she got very defensive very quickly claiming that it wasn’t a big deal, and she gave a fake ass apology that i had to hint that she should even give an apology first. I block her the next day, when (B) tells me that (R) continues to talk shit about me in the group. I still trust P, and he calls me and asked what happened with R, i tell him and later that day B tells me that P calling me was a set up and the group was there to hear the call. I’m pretty mad at P as he told me he was at his house.I try telling him what he did was fucked up, and he denied doing it, that he was alone, gets super defensive, saying he won’t apologize for something he didn’t do. He ignores what i say and pretends like we’re friends when i don’t feel like that’s the best thing for me anymore, i feel like he doesn’t care about me and B has also told me he’s talked once or twice behind my back as well.

After that I’ve been having sex left and right with girls and I’m feeling like I do it validate that I am good looking/charming and rely on them for that feeling. I miss getting that from myself.

259,"A few months into covid I met a girl online I’ll call Sarah(14). We hit it off and for 2 months we talked about dating since she only lived 20 minutes away from me(another issue was age, I was 16 at the time now 17 and I didn’t wanna get into something that has a clear expiration date). Things got weird and I ended finding out that the guy she “left” was still her boyfriend and she was lying to both of us(they got together the same time we started talking so she played us both). I exposed her to the boyfriend I had screenshots of conversations between us that showed we were intimate online and planning on meeting up/dating. I blocked her after getting a measly “I’m sorry and I ducked up”. Fast forward to a month or two ago and my sister calls me to tell me that she hung out with Sarah and that Sarah was a “pretty chill person”. I got upset and she apologized for what she said. My sister then went on to explain that they were just at the same place and it was one time. Now in the present I find out that Sarah is a part of her friend group and they are on a group chat together where they text and I think they hang out all together(don’t know if they have since then but bottom line is my sister is somewhat friends with her). I confronted my sister to which she said that Sarah was a part of the “group” and for her to cut her out would cause problems for her. That all translated to “I choose Sarah over you” since If it was the other way around I would have her back. She also justified it because Sarah told my sister that she “felt really bad” for what she did to me. I have no sympathy for cheaters and she only feels bad because she got caught. My sister knows me feelings but as far as I know still talks to Sarah since she’s part of the group. Am I wrong to feel like this? I feel like my sister doesn’t have my back since she knows exactly what happens and has told me it’s in the past.",24Nov2020,1
261,"i dont feel validated in any way.. cuz im just simply isolated atm (cut people off)

on top of that all i see is others get praised, positive feedback, thru social media and that fucks me up and angers me even more

even tho i'd always get at least handsome/attractive from people, and regardless of lots of girls liking me in the past, i feel so much frustration..

im confused asf... 

the fact that this girl made this satirical tiktok about how there's no attractive guys at our uni too doesnt help... which made me feel even weirder about myself..

it's even weirder seeing other girls commenting crying laughing emojies too, girls who have told me that im attractive..

AND NO.. im not stupid, if they were mocking me i'd know.. and plus that, i've literally always had people tell me that i look good even before, so...

but its weird when someone tells you that you should've pursued modeling and you also see shit like that..

Obviously this was due to a previous tennet or the building is infested. I messaged the leasing office asking if the have an exterminator they use for situations like this. It's late so I don't expect a response until tomorrow around 10am.

I was super close with his sister &amp; mom and haven’t spoke to them since before the breakup. I’ve wanted to reach out multiple times but had no idea what I would’ve even said.

Example: we have different friend circles and sometimes I just want to hang out with my friends without having my housemate around all the time. However if I don’t invite her  she is gonna feel bad. This is very childish behaviour from her side and I don’t know how to talk to her about it.

267,"Hey Guys I really need some advice here, I have a coworker who had a miscarriage a year ago, just a little backstory, the pregnancy was not planned nor did the baby ever have a heart beat. the pregnancy was 5 or 6 weeks long. She ended up passing everything on her own. She took a couple days off from work. Some months later she would just up and leave work because of miscarriage(due to all the emotions she was having) We also work in the birthing unit at the hospital in Atlanta, so you can’t just leave when we got tons of patients that gotta deliver?! She also won’t stop talking about it now a year later.. I do feel bad for her but i’m trying to figure out if it’s just an excuse for all the mistakes she’s making, if there’s mistake &amp; I call her out on it, she will bring up that it’s been a tough year and the “miscarriage”.

 

I know that miscarriage are hard and everyone grieves differently. But how long is long enough! Another coworker in our same shift had a miscarriage at 39 weeks, she took it hard for the first few months but now is feeling good, never not once blaming her miscarriage for her mistakes, she immediately take responsibility for her actions. rather than my coworkers baby’s heart hadn’t even developed yet, it was a sac. Here my questions, how long can she keep going using her miscarriage from a year ago to blame all the mistakes that she makes and two what can i say or do that’s polite to make her stop talking about it because it quite frankly irritates me and i don’t wanna say something nasty because she is super defensive and quick to victimize herself.

 

And also am i being too cold? I spoke with multiple of our on call doctors to get there opinion without telling them who they were and they agreed to that it’s normal to grieve for maybe 1-3 months but for a unplanned pregnancy that hadn’t even developed fully, we shouldn’t be struggling after 1 year. Btw my coworker does not want to go to therapy like we’ve suggested early. But all her excuses of the miscarriage happen every week, i don’t think she will ever learn if she start taking accountability?!

 

I would love all y’all’s responses and input, thanks guys!",24Nov2020,1
268,"I get it, I'm young (14 years old) this shouldn't matter to me or anything, and on top of all of that, I met her online. The thing is, conveniently, she lives in my area which really surprised me. We also have so much else in common that I've never met a girl who has, and it's honestly shocking. We were in a call for 19 hours too, until she randomly left without saying anything. Now in the middle of it, too, she always mentioned her being worried that her mom was near her. She wouldn't respond to any texts, and I assume she was caught or something and just doesn't have the chance to talk to me at the moment. It has also been two days. I don't know what exactly happened but that's the only safe assumption I can make. I just can't stop thinking about her, though, and I don't know what to do. Should I just be patient and wait until she hopefully comes back and somehow pass time.

I don’t care who you voted for but this was just for context of the story. She got so mad she stopped talking to me. A few days later she tried to talk to me like nothing happened and never apologized. I haven’t talked to her since. Should I text her again despite her pretty much hating me because of my opinion?

Im currently 23 and in college and working a job that has me working at least 30-28hr a week. Now my folks all 4 of them ( both bio parents are divorced and remarried) all wants best for me and say I should just focus on my education. but saying ""focus"" to a person that has adhd, dyslexia and depression it kinda drains me. I feel like I have to rely on meds to focus on school work  and feel that even when I try I just end up coming up short with results that satisfy me or parents. My bio mom just wants me to focus on school and try to graduate with just a general degree then look for a trade job, my bio dad wants me to figure out what career I want, and step mom encourages my bio dads advice, and my step dad... he just wants me to find something that can keep me interested and go from there.  

They want me to succeed and they put all their focus on me now since I'm the youngest out of 6 and it feels like I need to think really fast, so fast I feel that even when I make a decision it feels I missed the deadline to enact my decision. I'm blessed to have them and my siblings but I every time I think about my future and thinking about how I can make all my family proud I feel like their is a pain in my chest and I tense up. And when I fail they think that they failed as parents but its just their dumb son being too scared to make a chose thinking it might be the wrong one in their eyes. 

I'm really scared, I hide it pretty well but I'm cracking and I just feel so...lost? I don't know, I was thinking about working for year and looking into some career majors that I would want to do, or just bitting the bullet and stick with college and try to scrape by the skin of my teeth. But I need to know just what can I do, that in the long run my parents wont feel that they have to worry?",24Nov2020,1
276,"I (13M) have lots of anxiety, guilt, regret, shamefulness and lots of other bad emotions all the time. A lot of the time my anxiety is on and off. Like when things are going good in my life my anxiety is still there and I feel it a lot but its not to the point where I want to jump out the window. A lot of the time my anxiety comes when I make a bad decision or do something really stupid. Like the other day I got in some trouble with some neighbors for a very very insensitive joke I made which I shouldn't have made in the first place and because of that I feel so guilty, shameful, and I cringe at the literal thought of what happened. I keep beating myself up for it and I cant let go of what happened. And to add on that I also have a problem of not thinking before I act. And thats also a really big issue I have. I do things disregarding the consequences and a lot of the time it doesn't turn up bad but when you keep on doing it the consequences are eventually going to get to you. So im working on that currently but back to the main topic. Whenever I get a lot of anxiety my whole body it feels as if im severely sick.

277,"So I am in a senior year of high school and I have this goal of trying to get scholarships anywhere. Basically, the scholarships that I can only afford is through admissions test because I didn't do well in my junior years of high school. I flunked almost all of my subjects in those early years just because I don't have a purpose in life or any type of goal you could imagine. I had this thought process that once I got to college, I will be happy, successful and financially secured. It turns out that wasn't the case, and I realized this during lockdown when I got so bored and lonely that I have to find my purpose in life and that's when I decided to be an engineer (mechanical engineer to be specific) and to start a tech startup someday. So I started to research all the schools that I can in my country and it turns out that there are many schools that offer this program in a cheap cost. As soon as I know my purpose I started to do some research for more and I found out that those schools are nott good for the program/degree that I want so I decided to look for more (during this time, one of the best schools in our country isnt even in my option because my parents can't afford it). I am so overwhelmed that I don't know what school to go to. Until, I got introduced to the admissions exam from the different big universities. I am so thrilled and happy, because I now have the opportunity to show them what I am capable of despite of having a bad grades during my junior years and this serve as an inspiration and motivation for myself to get studying and make it as my habit. With a matter of purpose, determination and inspiration it feels like I could achieve anything with those 3 components during those times. I started off strong and I am enjoying the process at the same time having to study 10 hours per day with consistency I thought I will be doing just fine for the rest of the year till I saw the university updates. The other universities will not have an admissions exam for 2021-22 and the admission will be based on the grades, at first it still didn't affect me because those universities that got mentioned were not my dream schools. Then as days go by I started to worry about what my dream school is planning for and soon as I expected.... they announced that there will be no admissions exam for next year and it will be based on the grades yet again :&lt;&lt;&lt;. I am so shocked when I found while literally working my ass off just to know that my goal is now gone. It was like you were expecting to climb to the peak of the mountain but instead you climbed up on a hill expecting to have a peak as high as the mountain and only now know that that is the best you could do because thats the only peak you could reach. I was so frustrated that I didn't get enough sleep and discouraged to study, demotivated and I don't know what to do anymore. Because the goal that I was trying so hard to reach is gone. My only best option is getting a scholarship so that my family won't be burdened with expenses and  be able to learn from the best. I can't quite share this to my parents because they are too stressed and busy to their jobs and I don't want to give them another reason to be stressed about and I don't even have friends. So yeah I think reddit is all I have to share my problems with because I learned alot more in reddit than if I talk to my friend that barely cares about me, and sharing my problems makes me and the situation feel a little bit better.

281,"About a month ago I (25F) got black out drunk and called my fwb (35M) 10 times. He only answered one of my calls and my call log showed that the call lasted for 2 minutes. I have zero memory of my night (and of course the phone call) and saw my call log/texts the next morning when I woke up. I apologized and told him I blacked out. He said that I just called telling him to come party (that’s what my texts to him had said as well). I had bad anxiety over not knowing what else we spoke about for 2 minutes but trusted that he would’ve told me if i said anything else that was bad/stupid. 

Here we are, over a month later, and he has not messaged me since. I want to reach out and ask what happened but I don’t want to come off as desperate since it’s been over a month now? I want to know why we stopped talking and especially if it was because of something I said while blacked out? I feel like I at least deserve an answer so I can try to move on. 

There is a 50/50 chance that I may see him again next month as he’s a family friend and I was planning on waiting until then to ask him in person.

284,"Hello, I am a gay American male living in Taiwan. A few months ago, I went on a date with a Taiwanese guy, but I didn't connect with him at all. We stayed in touch for a little bit, and he definitely still had interest in me, but it was difficult to meet, since we live in different cities, so when he suggested to hang out I said I was busy, or I responded very late. (in retrospect I should have just told him there was no interest anymore). We didn't talk for about a month or so.

Then yesterday, he asked me how I was, and then said that his mom passed away. I said I was sorry for his loss and said that if there was anything he needed, he could let me know. He then asked me to go to the funeral with him. I feel very uncomfortable going, since I only met him one time, and especially because I am unfamiliar with funerals in Taiwan. He said he ""wants me to be with him"". I said at first I would go, since I felt sympathetic towards him and wanted to support him. But I am starting to get a lot of doubt. I don't know if this is a big funeral, or a small funeral with just his family, in which case I would feel more like a +1. He said he was ""excited to see me"". Based on the language in the texts, it sounds like I will be next to him, and not just a friend of her son. I know that I should just go, show my support, and then leave, and not make a big deal out of this, but I just don't want to get sucked into a type of relationship where I feel obligated to keep hanging out with him because he is going through a hard time, and then he gets the wrong idea about our status. I am thinking of just telling him, some day after the funeral, if he continues to pursue me, that I can be a supportive friend but not a boyfriend. I just am really having doubts about the funeral, and if it seems appropriate for me to go, since I am not really his friend.",24Nov2020,1

Last November I started dating someone and then they ghosted me, didn't tell me why and all of sudden got a girl pregnant and now been dating her since. Of course he did while I was struggling with court. Still to this day never heard from him again... just saw on social media, or his new bitch messaging me to rub it my face. I met up with this girl afterwards, we hung out, had some drinks, kissed, then had a few conversations on the phone again afterwards then she stopped replying and never talked to me again. I got close with another guy, after repeatedly not opening my heart to people. He convinced me he was different so I let him in and today blocked on everything! I've been ghosted other times but they're pretty insignificant to the others. I'm on house arrest right now, so yes it's hard to meet up but we're supposed to be on lockdown anyway.

I am so discouraged to go out again and find someone else. Everyone makes me promises and they never keep them.

I have nobody anymore and it just feels like im stuck. Everytime I try to get out, the hole deepens. I just really hurt internally, I have no idea why this keeps happening.

I'm in a situation where it feels like I'm living multiple lives around different people and no one is truely aware  of it. Each person only sees a certain part of my life and I avoid telling them details about other parts of my life. 

This is a problem because I need to continuously avoid questions and sharing details.. otherwise it would be better lying than telling the whole story of why I have kept so many things from them for so long.

An example of this is going to the gym. I wanted to get in shape so I started going to the gym. I haven't told anyone.. and now if I do It's a problem because I need to explain all the details and they'll ask how long I've been going.. but I'll have to lie unless I suddenly admit it and they will realise why I've been busy sometimes for the past year.

Another problem is with a long distance relationship. I haven't told anyone except for my mom and even then she doesn't know many details. My long distance girlfriend wants to meet my family but I keep avoiding it because I've got such a fear of the situation and all the questions my mom and family will ask. I know that if my girlfriend and mom talk, my girlfriend is going to be upset. She will see that my mum doesn't know much more than just basic details about her.. 

So as much as I want to be more open with everyone now, I've got such a big fear of things going wrong because people will be (rightfully) upset with me.

I just want advice on the best way to go about this and if I'm overthinking the whole situation?

Thank you",24Nov2020,1
292,"I recently broke up with my (idk how to refer to them cause now they identify as non binary but they don’t mind boyfriend) boyfriend. We were best friends before but then I realised that they are not the person I thought they were. Now it seems like they do everything they can to make me angry. They sit right next to me and play on their phone when they know that’s highly distracting to me. They make jokes about things that it took me a really hard time to get past. Those don’t sound all that major, but they build up. Anyway, it’s developed to the point where if I so much as see a picture of them, I get extremely angry. I can’t be in the same classroom as them for long periods of time because I literally start shaking from anger. It used to happen with my sister when I was little. I used to describe it as a magnet. Anytime I was within a certain range of her, I would get uncontrollably angry. It wasn’t her fault, but just the sight of her would cause me to lose it. ——————————————tl;dr: I’m already mad at my ex, but so much as seeing him makes me uncontrollably angry.

I was confused because she was wearing a tank top and I didn’t notice (nor would I ever notice because I don’t judge or look at people in that way...IM PLAYING GOLF FOR GODS SAKE) so I asked him confused like “how could you tell?” and he goes “I’ve been with a lot of woman naked, and I can just tell what any woman looks like naked with their clothes on” AND I LITERALLY YELLED AT HIM saying how weird it was....and than he goes “what!! that’s not weird!

295,"I’m currently 18, female. I have not gone more than maybe 1-2 months being officially single since the 7th grade. I’m not a very promiscuous individual and most of these relationships were somewhat long term, very fast paced (I love you within 1-2 weeks), and pretty “serious”. I dated the same person from 7-8th, another guy for 9th grade, another for the rest of 9th-12th grade, and most recently a 4 month relationship that I am fairly certain is coming to a close. 

Many of these relationships were extremely toxic and one was almost abusive towards the end but I never left them because I was so terrified of not having a person and was so very very attached to them. I also had almost no friends outside of my significant other and their friends throughout this entire time period. 

I’m not sure how I went that long without ever being single, but it happened. Every time I got dumped, someone would usually coincidentally come along and ask me out or start talking to me pretty quickly, I’d take a few weeks to collect myself, and ended up pursuing that. 

I now feel quite foolish for not taking more time to myself during my formative years, because I’ve realized I have no idea what the fuck I’m like as a human without being in a committed relationship and I’m nervous. I am VERY emotionally codependent and always have been in relationships. I like to think I’ve taken steps towards rectifying that a bit but I’d be deluding myself to claim I’m not still incredibly emotionally dependent on other people. 

My current boyfriend has basically been ghosting me for a month and not putting in effort and after 2 very bad fights, I gave him an ultimatum; contribute to the relationship or we’re done. He told me he’d sleep on it and I am currently awaiting his response. I’d also be delusional if I said I’m even slightly optimistic about the situation with the way things have been going, but I’m proud I stood up for myself instead of clinging to a toxic relationship out of fear of being alone. 

So... uh, how do I deal with the feeling of impending doom, crippling loneliness, and constant need for affection and stability that I’ve developed over the past few years? I do NOT function well during times of conflict in my relationships and I think that speaks to my emotional independence (or lack thereof), and I’m really not sure what steps I can take to figure myself out alone. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Maybe there’s no advice to be offered and the answer is “deal with it”, but I have no support system currently (my “friend group” consists of 5 people I never really speak to) and I don’t know where else to go.

After that, his life has just turned to shit and I hate knowing that. Because of this, Ive never actually said the word because it was probably offensive.

I never really dared to search if it was okay because I dont want to type the actual word. I also have a pretty bad history with the word because I broke up with my black girlfriend after she said it because I thought and still think it is offensive to some sort of culture. White men say it constantly, so I guess its offensive to the white race.

The word is so common as well, especially in rap and social media, and Im so flustered as to why black people havent been canceled for saying the word.

So basically, everyone I work with was sitting at a table, with no masks on, and in close proximity with someone who was symptomatic. I was not part of this group and did not find out until nearly an hour into my Saturday shift, three days after exposure. Unfortunately, I am now self-quarantining and will miss out on all my thanksgiving plans because they did not tell me before my shift, probably knowing I would have not shown up. At that, they told me ONEHOUR into my shift not as soon as I came in. 

After work, I told the boss/owner that I would not be coming into work for two weeks as I don't want to get COVID. I tried to explain to her that it's very risky to keep the deli open when the ENTIRE crew was directly exposed to COVID. However, according to her, ""I think we are all okay until we show symptoms. That's my philosophy"". She won't close the deli until two people test positive.  If two people test positive, which is very likely, that means the 48-72 hours before symptoms were shown, they could have spread it to other coworkers and to the customers themselves. 

Keeping the deli open is extremely irresponsible and is putting the lives of our customers at risk. I don't know how I should go about this situation and I need advice.",24Nov2020,1

Hello everyone, 


So two years ago, I fell in love with a guy but the problem is he lives in California. We’ve never been officially in a relationship but we absolutely share love between us. I know we are young but my heart is set. We are absolutely best friends and I recently was able to meet him in person and it was like magic. We hit it off and there was absolutely 0 awkwardness between us and I spent the better part of 5 days with him. Now I’m back home, and have been for about two weeks and we talked about how we share these feelings but we are separated by 1,400mi and that I want him to be able to meet people there.

The problem is, I really struggle with the fact that he might be hooking up with other guys or things like that. I understand that it’s what best and we are still definitely best friends and he’s not going anywhere. I just really really struggle with the idea of it. 

I was just wondering if anyone had any advice on how to accept this and just come at peace with it. 

Thank you so much

301,"Hello, I'm a recent user of this sub, so please excuse any rule breaking or faux pas i may commit in this. I recently (today) interviewed for a job I am not really sure I want or not. I am a recent mechanical engineering graduate (at the age of 31)  and have aspirations of getting in to the aerospace field. However, my only job interview since I graduated in August (summer grad) is for a job not at all in that industry. I had the second interview about six hours away today. While I like the people who work at the company I can't help but feel like maybe it's not the place for me. The job itself sounds like a great deal of clerical, customer service, and maintenance work and maybe not really the engineering work I had in mind. I know times are tough right now so I should be thankful to even have a possible job lead. However, I do not want to get in to a job that will maybe not hinder, but limit my future by being in a limit role as an engineer. The design field of the product is really taken over by one guy. While I will have some minimum design work, it is really just taking prior designs and adjusting their dimensions to fit in a certain amount of space. They base all their products on a singular product that, while very successful and hasn't been rivaled yet, was made in the 70's  or 80's and someone could think of a better way to do it no problem (not me I'm not smart enough, that's doctorate level work). Basically if the job offers the right amount of salary I feel like I have to take it especially since I don't have any experience outside of schooling. However, I know it is not at all connect to the field I wanna get in to, could be a dead product one day soon, and may be a dead end job as growth is limited. So I don't know if the job is worth taking or not. ( I have intentionally left out the field of the job as they are the best known company in their field).",24Nov2020,1

304,"&gt;I (13M) have lots of anxiety, guilt, regret, shamefulness and lots of other bad emotions all the time. A lot of the time my anxiety is on and off. Like when things are going good in my life my anxiety is still there and I feel it a lot but its not to the point where I want to jump out the window. A lot of the time my anxiety comes when I make a bad decision or do something really stupid. Like the other day I got in some trouble with some neighbors for a very very insensitive joke I made which I shouldn't have made in the first place and because of that I feel so guilty, shameful, and I cringe at the literal thought of what happened.  
&gt;  
&gt;I keep beating myself up for it and I cant let go of what happened. And to add on that I also have a problem of not thinking before I act. And thats also a really big issue I have. I do things disregarding the consequences and a lot of the time it doesn't turn up bad but when you keep on doing it the consequences are eventually going to get to you. So im working on that currently but back to the main topic. Whenever I get a lot of anxiety my whole body it feels as if im severely sick. My stomach aches and it feels like I have hundreds of butterflies in my stomach. My whole body trembles my breath is shaky.  
&gt;  
&gt;My whole body shakes. I feel like throwing up. I cant do a lot of my daily needs for the day like doing homework. I procrastinate a lot and it shows up in my grades. I honestly dont know what to do. Any advice on how I can handle my anxiety, stop procrastinating, being more cautious about what I do with others, and how to let go of things which I dont need to hold on to?

This started 2 years ago, it was mild for the time being, it was fine, it was fine, I had some issues with it, time goes on and then last year November came up.

I wanted to quit, and my dad harassed me saying I was worthless, stupid and not good enough in anything. That anybody could deal with two masters, and my job is not a job as I do not earn much.

We hung out all the time until I started seeing another guy in May and we’ve been together since. 

Recently my boyfriend has become very jealous of my friendship with my friend and the fact we briefly dated and has asked that I not be friends with him anymore.

My friend has done nothing wrong and doesn’t deserve this. He’s even backed off on his own without me even asking to give me and my boyfriend space, he’s been great about it. He was absolutely crushed/basically in tears when I told him what my boyfriend asked and this is a guy that doesn’t get overly emotional at all

I have no idea what to do, do I think about my future and stay with a guy who loves me and who I love and treats me right or do I pick an amazing friend who has been incredible to me and will always be there for me, especially since I don’t have many close friends at all?

I work nights so I'm awake until the sun goes down and comes back up again, but earlier, at around 4am the guy next door to me wandered out his room and kept pushing on my door and proceeded to urinate on the carpet outside as well as on my door. 

It was definitely not water or him spilling something, it seemed intentional because the toilet is literally 10 ft away, although he may have been flat out drunk or sleepwalking I guess... idk

This has never happened before and I don't know him, I've never even seen him, but I do feel like this deserves a report, a grown adult should know better.

Only thing is, I don't know if this is enough to get him kicked out. But if he's this weird, what else is he going to do??

Might not be relevant but I'm in this place because of a bad sports injury and going through rehab for brain damage which has left me a little fractured.

I thought about working in healthcare administration but I heard it’s hard to get a job unless you know someone and I also thought of criminal psychology but I know you have to go through a lot of schooling. Basically, I feel stuck and I know I have to compromise in order to study something and have a career. I often feel like a parasite and my parents remind of that fact every day. I plan to move out next year and I’m starting a part time job soon but realizing I have no long term future plans make me more depressed than I already am. I don’t really see a point in doing anything if I can’t enjoy it. What should I do?",24Nov2020,1
320,"Didn’t know where else to post and thanks for reading. I’m currently in a relationship with a girl, we’re two weeks in. We’ve been friends for about 8 months now. We matched on a dating app but due to her just getting out of a relationship at the time, things didn’t work out. We had an instant connection however and she wanted to stay as friends. I’m coming to realize that maybe we’re better off as just friends though. She’s in university (I’m attending in spring) and she is super super busy with classes. She has 5 different classes this semester and is taking the same amount next semester because of her mother’s expectations. We aren’t able to see each other often because our work schedules don’t line up very often and when we do spend time together, she’s doing work or I’m helping her do work. We only get to talk when either of us are on break or in the morning and late at night. I can’t stay up to 2am to FaceTime her though I’m too tired. I still do because I really love this girl guys. I wish I could see her more but I just keep thinking maybe this isn’t the right time for a relationship. We’ve been seeing each other on Friday’s for a few hours which makes her miss potential work time and has a lot of work to catch up on the next day sometimes only getting 2 (yes 2!) hours of sleep then going to work. I feel like I’m just another burden for her. I want to see her more but we just can’t fit it in her schedule. I love this girl so much I’ve been into her since we started talking and even after that 5 month period of just being friends I still wanted only her. What do I do?",24Nov2020,1
321,"My partner has awful anger management. Even just the idea of saying something the wrong way, or making a small mistake or even asking her to repeat herself is enough to set her over the edge. To be fair, i think she had undiagnosed ADHD, and she has other mental illnesses as well such as anxiety, depression and probably also PTSD. I know all these things added together can make for someone to have an incredibly short fuse, but she wont seek therapy because shes... too scared to do so? And ive been meaning to do it for her but im pretty busy with school/work one half of the time and the other half is walking on eggshells around her. I only have one ""me"" day and maybe its selfish, but id like that day to be... well for me.
Im not gonna bother naming things she does because thats too long of a list, but like i said at the beginning, it doesnt take much to set her off. Shes really a 1,2,3, 8,9,10 if you get what i mean, and the only person whos affected by her sudden rages or silent treatments is me, so i just want to know what kind of advice i could give her to help her work on calming down faster, or preventing her from exploding in the first place. I love the idea of communication, but its impossible with her. Like im not kidding when i say there is no point, ive been trying for 2 and a half years and gotten no where. Maybe later? But certainly not now
If you have any advice i could give her that could help her control it at all that would be greatly appreciated thank you",24Nov2020,1
322,"Recently, we had a new project involving a complicated process where there is not much (if any) information available on how to use the portal.

He knows I’ve never used the portal before. He hasn’t either. I explained what I’ve learned about it and all he said was, “You’re just standing there and not even offering a solution.”

Obviously, I was pretty annoyed/cut as I’ve ran around asking various people and trying to learn as much as I can of the processes involved in using the portal.

324,"I've been depressed for a long time and was diagnosed shortly after I started college 5 years ago. I'm currently in what was supposed to be my last semester before I graduate with a Computer Science degree, but I'm failing. I'm completely out of aid and my parents and I are in a crazy amount of debt. I will have to tell them I'm not graduating soon and I know they'll ask me what I plan to do about it.

I honestly don't want to try again. It would be my 16th semester when a four year degree is only supposed to take 8. I'm miserable and I'd feel guilty asking my parents to take out more loans to pay for school.

The other option is giving up and getting a job, but that sounds worse. At least I know there is an end to school. There is no end to working. I'm supposed to work until I die, or at least until my parents die and there is no one to miss me. 

I have a therapist and a psychiatrist and I'm on meds. They don't help. I could ask to switch to something else, but it would take at least a few months or possibly even years to find something and I have to make this decision now.",24Nov2020,1
325,"Me of 28yrs, and her of 25 had discussed this several times before. I never met this guy. She says he’s like “family” and a “brother” to her. She tried to get him to come on a road trip with us, and she tried to spend a night at his apartment at one time. Now, he has moved to town. She asked me shortly after I had got off work to see if she can head over to his new apartment to help him unpack some things, which I was very confused about. She offered for me to come with her, and I declined because honestly I have no desire in meeting her male friends like we’ve talked about this twice before already. Her argument is that her guy friend will scold her if she can’t “make time” for him since I been in the picture, and make that it would her out to be the bad person. She also told me that she didn’t want this to be a choose deal between “him or me”. Point is, I have already told her that I was uncomfortable with her being out alone with another guy whether be a long time friend or not; she will really go back and forward with me about this, and honestly when this happens, I get so angry because it’s like she’s really going wits end to convince me how “it’s not like that” or that “I have nothing to worry about it” This has honestly been stressing me out really bad and idk how much longer I can take this. I’m starting to have concern and doubt for the relationship now. 

I mean honestly guys if she’s going that far to convince me other wise about how I feel about him and her hanging out together, the. im convinced that she’s gonna be hanging out with this guy behind my back when we start living apart. (Yes, we both live together at the moment, im susposed to be moving into my own apartment soon, and she’s gonna roommate with her friend.)As much as this would hurt my heart and her heart, Should I just save some time and cut my losses now?

332,(22m) I haven't made more than 20k ( still living w mom and pop ) a year my life and my self worth has largely been tied to wealth.  A stock that i invested a good amount of money in 3 years ago has  absolutely blown tf up. 30k has turned into 1.03m.  the gradual high was unexplainable but now ( after selling) I feel exactly the same.  I don't want to tell any friends or family out of fear of fakeness.  I don't feel rewarded in my money as the investment was just a drunken chance.  I still feel just as shit I do 1 mil later. I want to see a therapist. I'm just so insecure im scared if people find out.,24Nov2020,1
333,"I feel absolutely awful. All the time. People expect so fucking much of me. Ever since I was a little kid (at the time of writing this I'm 14), I've held an interest in world history, philosophy, geopolitics, theology, economics, and anatomy. This coincides with far above-average academic performance, and now everyone expects me to be an Einsteinian genius.

A couple months ago, I was pretty sick (I might have had Hepatitis E, in fact), and couldn't attend school for a couple of days. When I returned, my science teacher was visibly relieved, saying his class was collapsing without me, as I was the only one regularly giving detailed, accurate answers to questions posed in class.

Additionally, I despise my body. I'm a tall male, and my skin looks largely like a combination between eastern European, British, Hispanic, and Sephardic Jewish. People say I look handsome or beautiful, but I don't see it at all. Girls fixate on my curly hair, boys are envious of my height, and people say I have a really nice beard. But I hate all of that.

I want long, black flowing hair. I want to look southeast Asian. I wish my face was larger and my skull was smaller. I wish my hands were smaller, and I want breasts, a vagina, and pump butt. I wish I could dye my hair partially pink and wear girly clothes like Converse shoes, Vans, boots, heels, skinny jeans, leggings, denim shorts, tutus, sweaters, crop tops, makeup, jewlery, etc. But I can't, because my area is super, super Conservative.

I also feel like my childhood has been taken from me. From a combination of my mother abusing me, the expectations that have been weighed on my shoulders, and my own embarrassment of being a child when I was one, I have very few memories of doing childish things like playing video games, watching cartoons, or playing with other children. I kind of just sat there, waiting to turn 12 or 13.

At 14, I still possess a love for cotton candy, toys, cartoons, sweets, stuffies, and carnivals. However, I push it down and suppress it to look mature and is I'm growing up. But all I want is to ride a big, inflated hoppity hop ball or play with Pokemon cards while watching Adventure Time, all while being a curvy southeast Asian woman.

In fact, when I graduate high school in 2025, I plan on studying education, atomic physics, world history, philosophy, and virology at my local community college for 2 years, and then getting a job at my local school district as a history teacher.

I then plan on saving up money for a few years while living with my parents, and then moving out as 24 to buy a home in a more Liberal area and recreate my childhood. At that point I'd like to buy a gumball machine, cotton candy maker, perhaps even arcade and crane machine.

I'd buy a bunch toys and a Snorlax and Wailord bean bags and posters for Adventure Time, Steven Universe, We Bare Bears, and other cartoons. I'd have a bunch of Pokemon plushies and big fluffy teddy bears. And I'd finally begin my transition into the body I want.

337,"Im not currently in a relationship, but when I was analyzing mentally sexual relatuonships Ive had throughout the years since I had a rough breakup with my ex girl  I noticed that actually quite often she comes up in my mind during sex, sometimes I find myself comparing my sexual partner to her  for Example during doggy I noticed sometimes I think something like ""She looks like ____""
Or I think how it reminds me of sex with her.
Being brutally honest, sometimes I have caught myself fantasizing that my sexual partner is my ex. 
When I meet a girl who has the same name as her (She has a common name) its as if Im immediately interested in her. 
Wtf. I never realized how weird that is or really even thought much of it until today that I started analyzing that behavior.
Now that I think about it, I think of my ex fairly often.
She was the one I lost my virginity to aswell as the fact that she was a decent person and I, due to so much messed up things that I was going through acted really wrong towards her, I cheated on her, didnt tell her, and even in anger once when I knew the relationship was broken beyond repair I childishly and selfishly attempted to hurt her by revealing and flaunting to her that I cheated.
I dont know man, that shit was so fucked up, it was years ago too, the relationship has been over for about 4 years now.
How do I get over this? 
Now even reading what I wrote it seems like im obssesed with her in a way or something.😐
How do I get over those weird thoughts?
How do I forgive myself for the wrongdoings I commited?
Could the thinking of her in sexual settings just be because she is the one I lost my viriginty to so theres some connection in my mind between sex and her?
Is it possible I still have unfinished weird leftover feelings for her that hold me back?",24Nov2020,1
338,"Disclaimer: i feel like a total ass posting this but i just am looking for advice on a situation that i feel confused abt 

Preface: I used to work an acting job, it was a month long job and i was the youngest one there (19 at the time.) I tried to be social, and made a lot of “friends”. Some of them had bad intentions, especially the older men. One of the older, probably 40+, tried to kiss me on the last day. Honestly, it took me a lot of time afterwards to reflect and realize a lot of them werent actual friends of mine.

ANYWAY. Theres one gentleman who I talked to a lot, who is probably in his 30s+, and he was never creepy but.. he was definitely *really* into talking with me. Every chance he got to talk to me he would take, with big enthusiasm. I was grateful at the time! We mainly talked about his photography work, im an artist myself, and he liked explaining his processes and work. It was hard for me to leave sometimes, like to go to sleep, because he just wanted so much of my time? Still, i didnt mind him, but the enthusiasm was definitely more one sided unfortunately... I dont know. The vibes didnt match completely, and I‘d feel drained at times.

Fast forward to now, through the year he has tried to contact me via cell. At first I just ignored the call because i was nervous? But now its been three times and I just listened to his latest voicemail. He started it off by reminding me who he was, and then saying he missed talking to me, he “really does!” and wants me to return his calls.
In my gut i just get such a twisted feeling. Im scared ill feel trapped, or that he doesnt have the best intentions like my other colleagues maybe? im not even sure. 

I feel really bad. The way he sounded was kind of genuine but i cant help how i feel, and honestly? i think it would be disingenuous of me to just pretend i want to talk to him still. But, like with other “friends” who I had problems with, I try to tell them why instead of just ghosting them. But, he hasnt done anything wrong per say... Im not sure what to even do?

Thanks for your time yall
Cheers

tldr; an old work colleague who is twice my age, who was really attached to me, and who i get weird vibes from keeps trying to reach out to me. Ive ignored his calls a few times already, but after hearing his genuine voicemail it makes me feel bad. Should i let him know im not interested in talking, or just keep ghosting him?",24Nov2020,1

This is a big problem I am facing. I am 16f and I dated a guy (now 20m) for 3 years breaking up this past June. He was super toxic and put me through so much. Mental, sexual, emotional, verbal, and physical abuse for so long I finally turned away and ran. He even tried controlling my current relationship which took me awhile but I shut that down. I found out he is with a new girl 18f who he bragged to me about getting pregnant. He said they both agreed to give up the baby but he pushed for abortion.
He was said some bad things to me about the baby saying ""he would walk into the woods with it and come out without it"" and I freaked out. I know who she is and how to contact her but would I be the asshole if I contacted her and warned her of his behavior. 
He has gone as far as to make me watch him commit not alive (post will be deleted if I say the word) and said he would kill me too. What should I do?

So I (18f) have been talking to this guy that lives a couple hours away from me for over a month now. When everything was new we talked to each other all day and all night. We talked about serious stuff like us visiting each other, moving in together, sometimes even marriage but vaguely. We took our relationship to a sexual level and everything was great. But that stopped recently. We still talk throughout the day but our response time is way longer and our conversations get dragged out. He still sometimes says he wants to be in the bed next to me or that he’s been thinking about me but he doesn’t show it. There’s been a couple instances where he hasn’t even texted me all day until late at night and then he apologizes and stays he had a busy day. He’s home right now visiting his family so I’m trying to be understanding. We used to get intimate over the phone every night but recently he’s been falling asleep or i’ve fallen asleep before we can do anything, which makes me feel kind of bad about myself but I don’t tell him because he says it makes him upset when i’m upset. I’ve never had a guy treat me as well as he does and I don’t want to let this go, so i’m hoping that this is just a rough patch and that we have some sort of future together. Is there some way I can liven up our relationship, or some way I can let him know that I still feel strongly for him because I haven’t been showing it that great recently either.

Lied about not sleeping with certain guys. And I have caught her plenty times entertaining and talking to other guys. So after our first 5 months together her family was moving away and she was going back to Virginia well I was cheating on her with acouple of my exes because after everything I found out I realized this girl was a super huge slut and couldn’t be trusted. Well both exes ended up telling her what I had been up to and she seemed heartbroken but Somehow we couldn’t let eachother go after she left . Obviously there was no trust between us while she was gone. We had some ups and downs and I started seeing another girl who I ended up telling her about and basically called it quits but still couldn’t leave each-other alone . She tells me she was seeing a guy but they only kissed . She moved back to my state in PA about 8months ago and after catching her talking to guys again we broke up . I wanted some kind of closure so we had a “put it all on the table” conversation where she admitted to sleeping with 2 guys multiple times during the 6months apart. I’m completely destroyed even though I assumed it would happen anyways but I still allowed myself to fall for this girl .. anyways idk if I should continue with her even though we both cheated I just can’t get over SHE cheated too I know it’s double sided but idk what to do , we both want to start fresh and give eachother our passwords and everything to help build trust again but idk if it’s even worth it!

I do not want to live in this household where they treat me like a child, among many, many other things that shouldn’t even be happening, and where I can’t be an adult, I wanted and still to this day to be an adult during the pass 4 years of hell and make my own m——-f——— choices, but they won’t let me. And yet I should have escaped this hellhole years ago, but I didn’t. I can’t have an adult conversation with the devil “my mom” or anything like that. Honestly I feel like an hostage, I feel like the devil “my mom” is a psychopath and I feel like I’m brainwashed from her and this hellhole, and this makes me feel like I’m escaping North Korea. It has been an extremely long 4 years of years of me playing the long term game of this m——-f——— hellhole.

One of the many, many issues going with me is that my devil of a “mom” has all my money that I earned from a job in a bank to where I can’t have access to it. It is $4,200. My money is locked up under her account ID and under my name and account. I don’t think I can get my $4,200 out of my own bank account without her being there because it is under her account ID, but under my name and account number. 

Since I’m changing all 3 parts of my name (My whole entire name) in the near future, if I can get my $4,200 out of my account, do I need to close down the other accounts that’s in my legal name that I have right now, or can I leave the other accounts open and let the devil “my mom” handle it even though in the near future I’m changing my whole entire name?

Also, since I’m filed as a dependent on her taxes, what do I need to do for taxes on her end, like do I need to wait til tax season to make changes on her tax form so I can pay taxes on my own and live legally by myself, or what do I need to do related to this situation?

The other issues are below. I know in most parts of the United States that when you turn 18, you’re an legal adult who can make decisions for themselves and live by their rules along as it isn’t under your legal guardian or parent or somebody else household. I’m 21 years old, and I’m in Texas. I want to live by myself.

1. Can a legal guardian or parent or somebody force me to go back to being a child  and force me to listen to my parents, go by their rules, treat me like a child for the rest of my life (So I can’t have any legal or nonlegal decisions, medical decisions, living decisions, and other decisions like that or any decisions at all) and force themselves to stand by my side for the rest of my life WITHOUT living under their roof?
2. Can a legal guardian or parent or somebody force me to go back home or can a legal guardian or parent or somebody force themselves to live in my house or live with me?
3. If a legal guardian or parent or somebody find a way to treat me legally as a child, a.k.a. an incapacitated adult. What are the exact requirements/proof that a court will need to make an adult into an incapacitated adult? Since I’m moving out of Texas, where will the legal guardian or parent or somebody file a court order if they decide to do, will they go to court in Texas or will they go to court in whatever state I’m going to live in legally?
4. Here is an example that I want to know the answer to. This person’s name is Karen, who is 28, has no children and isn’t married, she is an Anti-Vaxxer, racist, homophobic, and basically a racist Karen and likes to cause drama, but she pays her bills on time, she owns a car and a house and is paying them off, has an physically healthy body, has no problems making legal or non legal decisions despite herself being an anti-vaxxer and her being herself, Can her parents make her an incapacitated adult? This is just an example (not me) that I just want to know about.

Any suggestions or anything would help. I tried to make it more easy to understand. I hopes this helps.",24Nov2020,1
351,"So I've been trying for the last 4 months to get in contact with a shop I purchased something online from.
The product didn't turn up, so I emailed the small company 4 times before about 2 months after I made the purchase they had replied and told me that the item was out of stock. I was offered a replacement or my money back. I informed them I understood that covid was making an affect on wait times etc etc so I wasn't outwardly annoyed with them. 

I asked for my money back due to just the frustration of waiting so long for this item and the poor communication from them too. It's now been another 2 months and they have still not replied to my email asking for the refund and I have also tried contacting them myself too.

The frustrating part is that their website seems to be down and there is no phone number contact. So I'm relying on emails.

Should I just forget the £50 I spent or is there a way to fight this?",24Nov2020,1
352,"For as long as I can remember, I've had particular vivid daydreams that could involve me (or an ideal version of me) in certain situations. These things are usually affected by the current media that I'm consuming, and get more vivid depending on how stressed or just bored I am at that moment. I can't go a single day without daydreaming for at least 5 hours, and recently I've only begun to get worse.  


In December I received some totally perspective shaping news from my sibling. Since then I've felt more detached than ever, and I've only found solace in my daydreams where I can live out my desired life with the desired people: even if those people are fake. Most of the time the people that appear in my daydreams are totally conjured up subconsciously, and sometimes they're people from real life or shows. I don't control these daydreams in real-time, I don't consciously imagine the next plot point. Everything that happens within the dream is totally (almost) out of my control.  


For the past month or so these people that appear in my daydreams are personifying. They've almost formed to become imaginary friends of sorts, but realistic to the point where I can almost hear their voices throughout the day. In certain situations, I can almost feel someone looking at me, but I don't feel threatened. But most of the time, I can tell when the voices I hear are fake, I can tell when the people I'm seeing aren't real.   


However, as of late, my subconscious control is dwindling almost. I had a dream about one of my ""imaginary friends"" personifying into reality and ruining my life. Since then I've had certain times in the day where I feel a threatening stare on me. I also feel like I'm growing attached to these people as if they were real friends. I was daydreaming in the middle of my room, listening to music, having fun in my imaginary world. All of a sudden I looked to my right and saw myself in the reflection of the TV screen. I was ripped away from my imaginary world and was immediately forcefully thrown back into reality. I could see how lonely and sad it looked when you're just looking at it from an outsider's perspective. For the rest of that day, I felt anxious, and the realization that none of those people or worlds would ever be real plagued my thoughts for the entire day. I always knew that they were fake, but that day, I felt particularly distressed about that fact.   


I just want to figure out a place where I can find out something about what I'm going through. A blog post or hell even a subreddit would be great. Maybe even an answer as to how I can become more accepting of the fact that my ""friends"" aren't real, maybe even a way to manage my daydreams.",24Nov2020,1

I feel old and I feel like I can't do a lot of things now and I think that these thoughts will only get worse in the future.

355,"So, my friends used to bully me about little things I would say or do, and they would also bully me about the way I looked. Any time I would do this to one of them, thinking it’s just a joking group thing, they would all just attack me (verbally, not physically). I have started to distance myself from them, but here is the situation. I used to be close friends with a lot of them, until I introduced one of my new friends to each one of them individually. Eventually, we started hanging out in a group and the new friend that I introduced is making them be more toxic, leading to the behavior mentioned above. I feel sad distancing myself from them because one on one, they are nice. But whenever we are with that one friend, he sort of “corrupts” them into bullying me. It’s difficult for me to want to hang out with each of them one on one because I recall the bullying and feel extremely sad. And whenever I’m alone with my thoughts, I recall the bullying incidents and feel very sad. At this point I feel trapped. I don’t know what to fucking do because I feel damaged and can’t hang out with them, but when I’m alone, distancing myself from the toxicity, these incidents of their bullying pop up in my head, making me feel really sad. (I tried to not say “depressed” in this because I am not depressed.) what should I do to feel more happy in this situation?

Since they split up, my dad has been living with his mom and she has tons of animals there with her because she lives on a giant property/lake house. It was any animals dream. When i went there i met Fish. The sweetest most playful little cat i have ever had. My mom had already knew I wanted a cat for years before but it never ended up happening for one reason or another so I convinced her to bring her back home with us when we left my grandmas house.

When she came home the first 2 weeks were great. She was eating right and using the litter box and basically was being a super chill cat that everyone loved to have around. My mom had no complaints she loved her too. My mom had a boyfriend at the time who had a dog his name is Slider. Slider. eats. cats. My mom realized that her boyfriend was being neglectful to this untrained cat eater and decided to break up with him and take his dog so now in a matter of 1 month we have a cat, and a cat eater in the house.

All my cat does now is sit by the window in my room and meow (which can get to be more like a scream) at the door telling me she wants to go in the living room but she cant, because Slider is in there. We have tried to train slider ever since July to be friendly with Fish but its like hes a brainwashed dog and all he knows is bloodshed of felines.

What do I do? I feel that Im trapping my kitten in my room all the time and she cant go outside because she ran away a couple of blocks on the woods when we first tried to let her go outside. My mom wont give Slider to the pound as hes an older dog (9yrs) and she knows they’ll put him down soon enough.

a little back story for jeff. jeff is someone who tries to flirt with girls and when they flirt back, he disrespects them with his friends. so one time he kissed a girl, and came to his friends and called her a slut because she kissed him back. he even talked shit about me. he acts like all girls are after him, and hence any girl who likes him is a slut. he objectifies girls and talks badly about them. and how do i know this, we have common friends.

few days ago i've had enough with his im-a-stud attitude and decided to expose him for who he is, so i and rob created a fake instagram account texted him, played truth or dare, and suddenly he says he's horny. i didn't flirt with him during any of our conversation, i honestly freaked out. so i put the screenshots of the chat as the story and tagged all of his followers.the girls in his followers texted the fake account saying ""yes he's a creep,im glad someone did this"", i felt happy. but now, he told one of his friends that he knows someone in cyber security and will soon know all the details about the person. so my friend panicked and deleted the account. now we're tensed if we will get caught.

367,"Hello everyone,

A bit of background about my situation: at the age of 9, I was diagnosed with depression. I think it’s genetic as my Dad, all 4 of my uncles, and my grandma are all on anti-depressants. When I was young, I used to get excited about going to the dentist. I loved the way the laughing gas made me feel. When I later told my mom about loving this experience she said “don’t ever try drugs, you’ll probably like them!” I should have listened, but here we are. 

I started using opiates at the age of 15. After trying alcohol, weed, speed, and xanax it was the next logical step in my mind. It was everything I ever wanted from a drug. I wanted something that made me normal. I wanted to be able to go out with friends, do my school work, and get out of bed in the morning. Opiates made me just like everyone else, and I loved it. 

My use gradually increased over the years, eventually after the death of a loved one, I became addicted. I was 17 at that point. Time flies when you're addicted and I had enough money to keep my habit going for a long time. Eventually as my tolerance grew, I started to feel the negative side effects. I didn’t feel like a man anymore, my voice was a nasally and annoying shrill, my sex drive was shot, I felt like a discusting unmotivated blob. I quit in May and stayed sober for 42 days. I went back to old habits and by August I was addicted again. I live in a religious community and have spoken out against the religion from a young age. I am hated by my family and community. I think this is why I relapsed. I expected sobriety to bring me what I was missing in life but it really just brought me back to the point I was at before the addiction. If that point was good, I never would have gotten hooked.

I’ve been trying to quit recently, my best attempt so far was a measly 48 hours. I need to quit before December 1rst. That is the first anniversary of my addiction. I want to go out to a family owned cabin and just sweat it out there for a couple weeks. The problem with this is I would have to tell my dad about my addiction or make up some excuse. I have big dreams and to realize them I need to get clean. Does anyone have any advice for me? Thank you!

369,"I'm 23, as soon as I left school at 17 I went straight into work where I'm still at now.

During that time I've been the unofficial second hand of the department behind my manager. My pay barely increased.

During that time my workload increased dramatically to pick up the slack in the department. My pay barely increased.

Just over two years ago I took a month of work for my mental health as my job was causing me insane anxiety and depression. During that month It was made abundantly clear that I needed to get better, or get out. My mental health is the worse it's ever been and I'm still there.

During the pandemic our industry is probably the busiest and most disorganised across the board its ever been. Yesterday I got called into a meeting for an ""Unofficial verbal warning"" as I'm making more mistakes. No mention of how I'm now basically the busiest in the department now.

That and the looming threat of if I don't get better my job is basically on the line I've finally thought, ""Fuck this place"".

For where I need advice, I'm currently living with my parents with no plans of moving out too soon. I have enough saved up to pay my way at home.   I've spoken to them about this and they don't mind if I take some time off from work, but they're worried a gap on my CV is going to cause big issues later down the line.

On top of all that I’ve been depressed for months and I’m failing every class right now, I started feeling better but the whole getting friendzoned and hurt by a friend tossed me back in the hole. I have a history with depression and anxiety and I know when things get really bad my depression turns into suicidal thoughts. I’ve never attempted but I don’t know how bad my own mental illness can get. I’ve asked numerous times for help from both my parents and school counselor, only for my parents to tell me they can’t afford it (they’re in an even bigger hole), and my counselor just ignored me. I don’t know what to do, and I don’t want to fall back to dark times. I greatly appreciate all or any advice given",24Nov2020,1
386,"My parents are really poor and I have never complained to them about anything. 

About Me: I am a 15 year old and cant get a job because I live in a place where the minimum working age is 18 and their are agencies who will place you in small jobs but due to the present conditions and a rise in demands for jobs they have stopped operating. I am a national level football and chess player, and score about a 90% ( A's and A+'s in most subjects). I really love gaming but have no source to play the demanding games of today. my pc has parts which are really old. the latest part in my pc is of 2012, you get the idea. building a gaming pc would cost equivalent to about 2 months of our house rent which is not an option since they are struggling to choose between paying rent and my school fees.(my mom recently lost her job)

I see my classmates they all live like kings compared to me, they wear brands, use expensive products and accessories,  go out every week together to big malls and spend a lot of money on food and other stuff. They have their own rooms with expensive furniture and stuff, but we live in a 1BHK where my father sleeps on the ground and my mother and me share the bunk beds. There are kids who don't get half the marks I do and still treat me like dust because their parents are rich and they got fake friends and followers to muster them. I get ostracized because of being poor. I don't usually tell all this to my parents because I know it will break their hearts.  they are already going through a lot and I don't want to burden on them. At the moment I have really bad mental health( I googled it up and it shows I have symptoms of BPD and bipolar disorder) but we cant afford a psychiatrist. I always wanted to go to a certain school for my 11th grade but I cant afford it even with a scholarship. there is a huge amount of pressure on me to succeed to not only give myself but also them a comfortable life.  at this point I really don't know what to do...I cant tell this to my parents, got no friends that will listen and understand, I am just very confuse and depressed, any advices that could help please?",24Nov2020,1

Anyway if anyone knows how i can help her, please let me know. I'm pretty sure she already takes antidepressants (she said she wanted to overdose on them this one time).",24Nov2020,1
391,"My girlfriend and I are sexually active and we use condoms as our only form of contraception. Since I lost my virginity a year and a half ago, I’ve had this crazy OCD obsession and fear of getting somebody pregnant. I can have the safest of sex and still be paranoid the entire month until a period comes... so basically, if I have sex even once I worry about pregnancy the whole month and it’s very hard to shake it from my mind, so I’m seeking reassurance here.

I always try to be incredibly safe when having sex. I check the condom every like 30 seconds for tears or slips, and I put a new condom if the current one starts to get too dry (I know, it’s obsessive). Even with all of this, this month we were having sex and I hadn’t ejaculated yet, but I was changing the condom and as I was rolling it down, my fingers were touching the fluid on my penis from the previous condom, and then those same fingers were touching the new condom as I rolled it down. I was gonna stop and take it off and put a new one on, but my girlfriend told me I was being paranoid, so we continued to have sex. 

I hadn’t ejaculated into the previous condom, which means the only way she could get pregnant is if I got pre-cum on my fingers and then touched the outside of the new condom with those fingers, and had sex with that condom on. I know it sounds insane, but this has always been my biggest OCD obsession. 

Any help is appreciated!!",24Nov2020,1

Anyways I'm so paranoid that she's gonna try and get me in trouble with the law by lying to the police by saying shit like ""I was underage when I took those photos"" or like ""He forced me to"". We were both 19 when she sent them but I'm worried that she will lie to the cops to get me in trouble.

396,"Hi everyone. I'm a 23 year old female from Australia and I'm in a season of extreme frustration right now. Essentially I'm the embodiment of failure. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 8, been 'treated' for it consistently since with no success (therapy, medication, etc.). Psychiatrists and psychologists tell me that I'm a lost cause, they tell me that they can't help me.

My main problems are

* Inability to function properly - i can't hold a job. i either get fired or get so absolutely miserable that i quit impulsively. I'm so unorganized, i lose things all the time, i'm always late. i don't know why. i mostly live in my head, i'm pretty disconnected from reality and i go into day dreaming without realizing and i'm easily distracted. 
* i quit everything i start. this has been an issue since i was a little kid with sports and activities. I'd be super into it in the beginning, like sometimes to the point of obsession, then all interest would suddenly cease and i'd rather die that do it again so i would quit. When my parents forced me, I'd be an anxious mess and it felt like I was being tortures. In 5 years i have started 4 different bachelor degrees. in 8 years i have had 17 different jobs.
* I'm super impulsive. i don't think about things i do/say, i just do it. I'm especially bad with money, like i'm currently unemployed and just bought a $400 electric toothbrush simply because it lights up when you're pressing too hard. i also purchased the iphone 12 pro ($2200) and used a credit card to pay for it. money i don't have.
* I'm bored so easily and if i'm not interesting in something my brain completely shuts down but when i am interested in something i have this extreme focus.
* i'm intelligent, but i haven't achieved much. i was always told by my teachers that i have wasted potential and that i need to apply myself more if i want to achieve anything.
* extremely low mood most all of the time. i definitely still have depression in one way or another. i feel hopeless and worthless, i have never enjoyed being alive, i don't want to be alive. But i am so tired of feeling this way
* I don't know what I want to do in life. I know this is an extremely common issue, but when it comes to figuring out a good career I literally have NO idea. I don't know who I am, I don't know what I'm good at, I don't know what I'm genuinely interested in. Every interest I have ever had has been a brief, extreme obsession that I suddenly lose interest in over night after days/weeks/months and even the thought of continuing something after it ends brings nothing but agonizing misery.
* Extreme social anxiety, i don't like being around people mostly because of how i think they will perceive me, so i avoid people all together even though i'm so lonely and want friends badly. I don't have any friends whatsoever and if I ever get the chance I either avoid getting close or sabotage things when they do start progressing so I don't have to risk being rejected or losing them.

I'm so sick of who I am. I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know how to fix myself. I just want to be able to function ""normally"" - job, friends, hobbies, balance. I know this mess is all my fault. I haven't been able to find anyone who has been through something similar online so now I'm here hoping that someone deals with these same things.",24Nov2020,1
397,"This is probably going to be very disorganized. I'm sorry. I'm very anxious making this. Really out of my comfort zone

I'm not used to asking for advice, but I'm feeling conflicted at the moment and I want others opinions. 

About a year and a half ago I was dating this guy. I personally really enjoyed the relationship. We'd play games together and we were both extreme introverts. I loved going over to his house and sitting on the couch for 2 days straight with him. It came to an abrupppppt halt when we woke up to banging on the door one morning.

It was the police. They detained us and searched his home. I asked what tf was going on. The police said that his computer or something had flagged for child pornography being downloaded. (Definitely not exactly what they said). He was like, ""what the fuck?"" and said he didn't do a thing.

The police searched his computer and didn't find anything at all. But they still took almost every electronic in the home.

I asked him again after we were released what the fuck that was all about. He said he really didn't know. 2 websites were listed on some paperwork the police brought, but one was just a file sharing thing. And the other I can't remember. 

About a week later I broke up with him despite having no evidence that he'd done anything wrong. I figured if it happened once it could happen again and I really didn't like the feeling of being detained.

That is the end of the story. But lately I've missed him? It's been a year and 8 months. But every once in a while I wonder if I shouldn't have broken up with him.

I'm struggling with the following: I'm avidly against longterm dating because I think they are bullshit, but I miss having constant company and a steady sexual partner. But I was comfortable with him. So, should I break my rule and reach out to him? Just to see what's going on, if he was innocent, and if I should try and hang out with him again. Or should I go with my normal routine and continue to never seek companionship or take unnecessary risk?

This is probably super disorganized. I don't normally have issues that I don't resolve myself but my thoughts are too tangled at the moment to make any sense of myself. 

I'm sure it seems like a no-brainer but I reallllly don't think he did anything and it'd be nice to feel comfortable again.

If I broke any rules or this belongs in a different sub lmk. New to reddit and trying to do this on my lunchbreak.",24Nov2020,1
398,"So my only son, (now my daughter, 20mtf) has come out as trans. It was a complete shock to our family as he never showed anything but 'male'. He is heterosexual (or so I thought). He had a normal upbringing, loved horror movies, playing his computer/PS games and he dated a few girls. 

He left for college in the fall of 2019 and a week ago, he came to visit us for the first time since leaving. Next morning, he sat us down and told us he is a transgender woman. He said he's a year into HRT and is in a relationship with a 28 y/o man, whom he plans to marry eventually. 

I can't believe it. I want him to be happy. But I feel I'm losing the son I've bonded with half my life. The thought of my son becoming a woman and someone's wife was enough to turn me to drinking. I'm horribly depressed. His brother, my other son (23M) has flat out refused to accept it and has left the house. My SO is accusing me of not being supportive. World is falling apart.

She is Bipolar and has a lot of issues. I knew about some of her issues but after i opened up, she told me alot of things. She told me if she killed herself it wasnt my fault and that i was the only person she consider a real friend. After that i had alot of regrets and told her i could be there for her and we could try to sort it out. Now she is so depressed and wont talk to me.

404,"It feels absolutely absurd that an adult is behaving like such a bully. 

There are 5 of us employees at this site and we work off site from our main office. We all work alone, thank God. One of us works 8 hours and someone else comes in and replaces us. So there is a 5-20 min overlap depending on when they next person shows up. There is always someone here 24/7. Shifts are 12am-8am, 8am-4pm, 4pm-12am.

We also have someone coming in for 2, 4 hour shifts a day. Once 4am-8am and one 1pm-5pm. This person works in the same building but on the other side of a large building.

So in the morning we have 3 people here for a few moments before two people leave and one coming in.

Ok so the oldest employee here, I'll call Bob. Is like in his late 50s-60s. And he is a massive dick. He is aggressive, talks down to everyone, rude, just a huge bully who attempts to provoke people.

He once had me in tears screaming at me because I called packages being delivered mail and he said it's packages and not mail and as I tried to explain that it wasn't a big deal everyone just refers to it as mail he began to get angry and scream red faced. 

Stuff like this is common place. I obviously told my supervisor but he denied it and nothing really came of it. 

He spoke down to another co-worker and told her ""she needed to wear her big girl panties"" and she replied he was a dick and he got so angry about that he refused to talk to her for months and refused to help out covering any shifts lol like so childish. 

Before we were all women except him and I felt he just had an issue with women. Now we have another guy working here who is like 19, and he has been actually the worst to him. 

It's nothing major, just this constant talking down to, being rude and aggressive towards him.

When our shifts overlap in the morning the other guy will often come down early and talk with whoever is working before he leaves because his stuff is over early. He is cleared by the supervisor that this is fine. But Bob goes absolutely nuts over this. If he walks in and sees him here talking to me he just goes off on him! 

This past week the moment he walked in the door he told him ""ok bye. You can leave. You have no business being here."" And kept repeating it and saying bye... It was 10-15 mins before 8. His shift wasn't even over yet. 

Like it's absolutely bizarre to me that a grown adult can behave this way. We all ignore him and it's hard when he doesn't get a response to his rude comments he just repeats them lol 

So far the higher ups are just like ""ignore him"" and don't think it's a big deal because it's nothing really major and we see him just for a small bit of time. But it's so stressful!",24Nov2020,1

406,"TDLR: relationship has been dying with my best friend. Her boyfriend drunkenly picked a fight with my brother at my wedding and the couple is refusing to acknowledge it at all. I feel crazy. 

this is a long read, so strap in. I appreciate anyone who hears me out. 

So my best friend of roughly like 5 years has had a bit of a personality change since beginning to date her boyfriend of about a year. I've know him for close to 10 years and he's a bit of a jackass and gets worse when he drinks, which he does a lot. The boyfriend bit is important later in our story. I can expand even further in to the backstory if it helps but it is A LOT. 


I originally had her as MOH in my wedding and she wasn't really doing anything to help plan any of the events leading up to the wedding and was kind of just expecting me to do all of it, which was fine but not really what I signed up for when I asked her to be MOH. My sister ended up taking over and I told my friend that my sister would be MOH. Which leads us to the bachelorette party. 

I really wanted to just go sight see and people watch on those Uber scooter rentals, and she wasn't even willing to try to do that. She also non stop tried to talk over me every time I had a conversation with someone else and it gave me terrible anxiety. At another point, she sat next to me trying to show me weird lewds of her boyfriend (who at this point I considered to be like a brother) and it was all just really weird. I noticed around this time that I was starting to get annoyed with how she acted when she would drink. She puts on this really weird sorority girl-esque act and just acts really ditsy and stupid and all ""hehe dumb cute"", and it just grinds my gears. 

I will mention here that I've also gone through a bit of a change in personality over the past year. I think in my own eyes, I've become a little more assertive of my needs and less willing to be walked (or talked) all over. Especially in the past month, it makes me feel absolutely crazy when someone just consistently tries to talk over me and I've become really aware of it and I just simply don't allow it to happen. I'm sure some people think I'm bitchy or mean because I will straight up ignore them until I'm done with
my train of thought or conversation. 

All of this leads up to this past weekend, when I had my wedding. We booked a gorgeous ranch venue that we could use and stay at with our wedding party all weekend. She didn't show up to help with set up on Friday afternoon and then showed up for dinner and our rehearsal meeting later and was already drinking by the time I gathered everyone to prep. She spent the time after the meeting trying to speak over me some more which was frustrating but I brushed it off. She went off later in the evening with my cousin in law and was flirting with him and leading him on a bit IMO, which made me really sad for her boyfriend because we were pretty close for a long time before I ever knew her. She shows up back at the cabins pretty trashed and is on her ""OMGGGG BAAAAABE"" thing that she's started on with me recently that almost makes my teeth hurt. 

Saturday comes, the boyfriend shows up, we get through ceremony and everything without a hitch. The reception begins, and she starts telling my family and guests to not let her boyfriend have any liquor at all, which is extremely embarrassing IMO. We all go back up to the cabins, she shows up again to smoke and her and her boyfriend drink more. My husband and I go to bed around 1. 

Through the grapevine the next morning, I hear that not only was her boyfriend making weird, off color, violent remarks to other guests (some women included), and antagonized my brother and his girlfriend to the point that my brother got naked (he was wearing our recently deceased uncle's suit and didn't want to mess it up) and beat the fuck out of him. My brother does not drink and only partakes in weed and acid. He was currently on both during this and definitely did not want to beat up some dude at my wedding while he was tripping. Apparently the story is the boyfriend heard my brother and his girlfriend arguing and tried to interject saying that he was protecting my brothers girlfriend, which is bullshit because my brother would never hurt a woman. My brother and his girlfriend kept asking the guy to leave them alone and he refused. As my brother took off each piece of the suit and folded it, he calmly asked the guy to leave them alone, and the guy refused until my brother was naked and then my brother proceeded to beat him down. I will mention that I am not in any way mad at my brother and he was well within his rights. 

The next morning, I'm told about all of this and was also told that my friend tried to convince everyone to just not say anything to me and pretend it didn't happen at all. It's now Tuesday a she nor her boyfriend have breathed a single word about it to me, no apologies, nothing. In fact, she texted me tonight around 2 am saying ""as your best friend I could use some advice right now"". 

I know this is long winded, and definitely insane. 
I feel like I'm going crazy, or that I'm the bad guy for feeling how I do. I genuinely don't know how to respond. I feel disrespected. I feel that our friendship had already fizzled out before the wedding. I feel that we haven't connected like that in a while. I'm upset that she is trying to pretend that the events over the weekend didn't happen. And I really feel like I'm owed an apology.

408,"Howdy yall. So a few nights ago my best friend, another friend and I were playing a video game, just relaxing and enjoying our time; we're all about the same age, 28. I misunderstood something that he said about task we needed to do in the video game and I told him he was wrong. Then I realized he was right, I apologized and owned up to my mistake. 

After that it was like switch was flipped and he really started to be rude and passive aggressive. I kept my cool and continued try and enjoy my time, but it got to the point where I gave him a warning shot, slightly raising my voice to tell him to relax. I didn't want to argue with him because 1, I didn't want to make my other friend uncomfortable, and 2, I thought it would be silly to argue over a video game. 

I had already apologized and admitted at fault, so I still didn't understand why he was so angry and was pretty much bullying me, he has never done that. 

So now we haven't talked since then, I noticed he tries to avoid me. I was hoping he would apologize to me, but  that never happened. There's a part of me that wants to let this friendship end, because the way he acted really disappointed me, I would never be friends with someone who bullies someone to make them feel better, especially if it's their best friend; all over a video game, which just sounds extremely silly to me. But then there's another part of me that wants to try and contact them and ask if they're okay, and try and rebuild our friendship.

Being silly twelve-year-old girls and having crushes on boys at our church, we would have diaries. For me at first, the diary was me MADLY crushing on this boy at church for my eyes alone. And then one day, I don't know who initiated it, but we decided to read our diaries to each other. It was embarrassing for me, (at this point I really didn't know her for a super long time, leaving out some details in reading) but I didn't really have anyone else to vent to about this boy. 

Anyway, I told her that we had to be quiet over the phone because then my sister would tell my mom about the crush.
It wasn't a week later that she told me ""let's not talk about having crushes especially if your parents don't know about it."" It was basically a little apology from her for talking about the whole thing. But moving on, I agreed, but I was slightly confused, as I didn't think this apology would be initiated on her own about some dumb crush talk. 

 *Let's just call her  Katie*  Katie called on one week, and her mom basically told her that since she failed one of her online classes ((no, this wasn't during covid, this was in 2017-18. we are both homeschoolers)) we wouldn't be able to talk on the phone that often anymore. 
(Katie lives a few hrs away from me)
I felt betrayed when she told me that. I felt as if her mom was saying I was a bad influence. But I was ""cool"" with it. But anyway, somewhere along time we now consider each other best friends. I believe she originally said the best friend thing.

But the thing is, we never have THOSE  conversations. Ya know? There's the typical stuff: food, and church. But I always felt uncomfortable telling her my feelings about a lot of things. And how I felt inside, feeling sad or lonely. To me that didn't really scream best-friend trust. The only person I tell my feelings, is God and my mom. I don't like vulnerability, so if you're truly a best friend that wall should be torn after at least 1 year, right?  There's so much more I want to express on this post and more of our interactions, but believe it or not I've been writing for about an hour and a half. Sooo, what should I do? I can't just tell her straight up that I don't feel support from her and we are just friends and not really best friends.

TL;DR: We've been friends for a while now, have had a few things happen and a lot of left on read messages for hours, only small talk or catchup convo, no ""real real"" stuff.  she has been calling me her best friend and I feel like I'm lying by saying the same. I know the solution would be to just be honest but for a lot of reasons it's not that easy. Your advice?",24Nov2020,1
410,"So I have a coworker that is also a friend, we talk quite often as we have similar interests. 

Lately, he is constantly sniffing me, jokingly trying to grab my hand, grabs my nipples, strokes my arm or back, burps in my face, facts on me. 

I confronted him, and asked him to stop doing these things. He said he thought it was hilarious and he was going to push me as far as he could. I told him I would end the friendship, as it is driving me insane. For example, he sniffed me 5 times today, not counting the constant touching. 

His response to me saying that I would end the friendship, was that I was having a bad day and was having a powertrip..................................

He's a very nice person, we are both straight. But I would have no problem ending the friendship if he really keeps doing it. 

Am I over reacting? What should I do? I still feel violated the next day because he does it so much.",24Nov2020,1
411,"I am (F13) and I got a really bad habit of eating too much in one sitting.

I used to eat food as a way to get over my worries since it felt nice, but I think quickly I started eating more then I should be in one sitting.

Like I have started to eat more then half a box of kraft dinner in one sitting, another sitting I eat almost or half a box of pizza. 

The binge eating problem got so worse to the point I threw up my own breakfast after a long weekend of eating cake and pizza for two different birthday parties (We are all in a circle with each other)

Do you guys have any advice to stop it or atleast try to get me to eat lesser then what I am now? It really sucks and now I am scared I might throw up another meal.

412,"So a little bit of context is that I have a girl on my friend's list who I went to high school with. However, she was a grade below me so we didn't have any classes together and never really got a chance to talk. I see her on Facebook and would like to get to know her more and see where things go. Should I even go through with this because I don't want to sound like a creep. My message would go as follows. ""Hey, I'll just be straight up and say that I think you're kinda cute and would really like the chance to get to know you better."" Should I change anything from this? I'm open to suggestions.",24Nov2020,1

414,"I'll try to keep this short, but basically I have a really REALLY hard time accepting anyone genuinely cares about me. I grew up friendless, and had a friendless high school experience, and now in my last year of HS, I met people that I'm growing attached to, and I'm realizing it's unhealthy attachment, it's obsessive.

I feel like going back to my former strategy of just not engaging in any socializing so that I don't get hurt.

I'm good at maths and science and that's probably where my skills end, how stupid can I be to believe that I can be both socio-affectively and academically intelligent.

I just don't know what to do, part of me feels like the best solution is to work on myself and to temporarily (potentially for a long time) block all attempts at interpersonal relationships, but another part of me feels like I can do both at the same time despite risking to fuck up the relationships with my clinginess and mood swings.",24Nov2020,1

416,"It’s been 2 years since I broke up with my ex, though now I’m really starting to miss her. 

I’ve come to realize a lot of things after undergoing therapy. 

I spent most of my life playing a victim, where people would walk right over me and Id let them, then once I was pushed into a corner.. I’d just walk away. Blocked, deleted, have a great day. 

What did she do? 

At the time, I had several reasons, she was this and that. 

Though today I have none.

Now looking back, I don’t feel any of those reasons were valid and were generally just a product of my emotions. 

I have ADHD and depression, though I never really opened up to her fully about the depression. 

Instead, I expected her to understand.

Something that even I was clueless about. 

Though she had no idea how to handle it, she did accept it. 

I’m 25 now, I don’t see myself being with anyone else. 

I’ve tried several dating apps, I’ve gone out on several dates ...yet nothing felt right. 

I’ve accepted that I’m going to be alone for the rest of my days, since whose going to want a guy who has all this baggage? 

I know it’s been 2 years, she might be with someone else now.. but she had me blocked on social media since we broke up, but today she ended up on my feed.

Now I’m not all that spiritual but something inside of me felt like perhaps now is a good time to reach out.

My heart has me convinced that she’s the one.

I sent her an email, with a genuine apology.

Hopefully she replies back, I’ll keep everyone posted.",24Nov2020,1
417,"I work for a large multi-national in the UK (England).  In December 2018 I was offered a promotion which would take effect in January 2019.  This included additional staff and a pay increase, due to company rules I would receive a percentage increase immediately and another after 6 months in role.  All of this was communicated verbally to me.  Over the next few months we were involved in a very busy go-live at two additional sites for the primary customer, during this project it transpired that we (the service provider) had made a bit of a cock-up on the pricing and that we needed to make cuts, some of these cuts turned out to be the two additional staff I was to receive. Around this time I received a letter from my company informing me of the new job, title and first salary increase, no mention of any further increases.  I was disappointed and a bit upset and felt taken advantage of but took it in my stride and rationalised it in the context of the cuts from the customer.  I had no discussion or feedback to say this second increase would not happen, I did investigate what the process is to receive the second increase; goal setting by manager, review and then on success reward.  This process was never initiated by my manager.

I have made reference to this second increase I never received on two occasions to my then manager and it was just glossed over.

Fast forward two years (18 months after the second increase was due) and I have now been promoted into my old managers job, he is leaving the organisation but will be working for a partially owned subsidiary.

Part of the handover was HR, this was a review of each member of the team, salaries, performance and so on.  Naturally I was curious about my own record so I went to 'my' folder and found a spreadsheet  which detailed that I would receive two increases.

This is a reasonable sum of money, excluding pension contributions, reduced bonus payments etc.

Given that I am now in a new much more senior role my dilemma is do I pursue this and find out what happened?  Do I leave it alone?  If I do pursue it do I go to my old manager and ask the question? Do I speak to my new manager (Old managers boss)? Will pursuing this cast me in a bad light?

I'd like your thoughts on what my options are and how I should deal with this?

Thank you for reading and taking the time to respond!",24Nov2020,1
418,"Hi everyone, i [23F] for 5,6 months have been under a lot of stress with the whole situation, last year of college(graduation, last exams etc) also family issues and that resulted of me being very anxious and depressed. Somehow when i was feeling that way and started to overthink i developed this hair/scalp picking habit and it stuck with me to the point i can't control it when im overwhelmed.
That resulted in my hair falling a lot which stresses me out even more, because i can see that my hair is getting thinner and my hair line has changed. It is freaking me out everytime i run my fingers through my hair, comb it or wash it, because it does fell a lot. And naturally i have very thick and curly hair so when i visibly see the difference in volume it scares me. I don't know what to do as my mindset is that it will get worse.. Especially if i continue with this habit of hair picking which i have been trying to reduce but it is not going to well and that's the root issue.
 So my question/concern for advice is two fold, first how do  i get rid of this habit and second what treatments, products should I start using to get my hair to grow back and be thicker as it used to be as my scalp may be sensitive and damaged due to  picking (i have heard about the alpecin shampoo, any experience with thay?) .
 
Thank you and sorry for my english.",24Nov2020,1
419,"Hello, it's a throw-away account and I hope I'm not on the wrong subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

So I know that the answer should obviously be ""no"" but I've been seeing this person for two years (ptsd-related). Everything was normal until I had a bf (it's not correlated, it's just to give a context) 9 months ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

So she started telling me I shouldn't tell my bf things about my past because he might use them later like ""you're reacting that way because this happened before"". Those were her words and it was a first slap to the face bc she knew I had troubles trusting anybody and I was affraid this would happen. I feel like she just reactivated this fear I had and that she saw my bf as a person with a possible futur toxic behaviour/trait. 

&amp;#x200B;

After, knowing I'm also a health professionnal, I told her about my problems finding a job since I graduated. She started, at every session, asking me how I was doing, that I shouldn't work in a different field from what I studied (She said that bc at some point, I just wanted to work &amp; feel active. After I'd search a better job).

&amp;#x200B;

She also continued telling me I should do some formations, have tools, show that I'm active etc. She's right but she's been telling me about it constantly and it put me a great deal of pressure. At one point I told her how I felt but she continued aniway.

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks ago, some things happened that were even harder for me to deal with. I told her about a job interview I would have but that I had some questions concerning privacy bc there's a member of my family going there as a patient (it's just Yesterday that I realized we wouldn't be on the same place so this problem is solved).

&amp;#x200B;

She sort of reacted unprofessionally, she told me I shouldn't apply bc they'll see me as pathologic, that my family is pathologic and they'll even see me as a patient. She also told me that maybe they also have psychological disorders but it can't be seen bc they only come as professionals there. This Made me feel so bad bc I do struggle in accepting I'm normal, I can have sometimes a negative perception of me and I'm trying to work abt it and I started feeling better about myself, also thanks to my friends and my bf. And I didn't like how she casually said that about my family.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, her last reaction that really made me feel it was enough was during the same appointement. I told her I had a small conflict with my mother (m'y mother wanted to help me but it made her carry on her own heavy things so I was more worried and l didn't thank her so she felt she did sthg wrong) and It was confusing for me bc I grew up with the Maxim ""favor no pedido, no es bien recibido"" (meaning that sometimes by doing an unrequested favor is not well received). 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to say it differently but the psychiatrist went apeshit. She started telling me  that this belief was bullshit (she truly said that, ""conneries"") that I should stop having this belief and that only wait for people to ask some help to help them even if I saw them struggling was ridiculous... I didn't say I would do that bc like it's obvious I won't.... I feel like she took it out of context and misunderstood It maybe? (I had to explain her for 5min what It meant BC I translated It literally and she didn't understand it).

&amp;#x200B;

So now, I think I should stop meeting her bc it's not the first time she made me feel bad about sthg important to me, she used some words that weren't exactly appropriate in a professional relationship, she undermined my self-esteem/excitment/trust I've been building slowly about me, some events, people around me. I feel like she just sees me as a struggling colleague and thus when I have ambivalent feelings, she says it's not ok.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now ""dreading"" to see her but the problem is that she directed me and my family to her colleague (a familial therapist) and I don't know if I could/ should stop seeing her? And how to finish It? I mean, I know I have no legal obligations etc so I could just stop going but at the same time, is it really a good idea to just stop by going no contact? 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel it wouldn't be a mature solution but I don't know how to get out of this ""normally""

420,"I'm a 21 year old female who is attending a nearby community college for mortuary science. I live with my mother still because I haven't found reliable people to move in with and I never felt like I had anywhere else to go. My mom has been gaslighting me and manipulating me for as long as I can remember, telling me that my emotions weren't valid because they made her uncomfortable basically. I'm reaching a point where I can't deal with it anymore. My step mom recently left my dad, taking all of her kids with her, meaning that his house is currently occupied by only him. If it weren't for the fact that he's also abused me growing up, physically and emotionally, I would move in with him, no questions asked. I'm debating if it's worth moving away from my mom and leaving my step-dad and brother behind to continue to put up with her, or if I should just stick it out until I graduate and can move in with my friend. I know that if I moved in with my dad, I'd probably have to deal with the same sort of stuff, but his opinions wouldn't bother me as much because I generally do not care what he thinks.

422,"A few days ago, I cut off one of my former friends who was toxic to my friend group. I was thinking about cutting him off when he started being more mean to my friends and I. He also started
getting in arguements over things that were extremely random like us winning a 1v1 on a custom game in siege or cod. Afterwards in October, he randomly blocked me and my other friend who was trying to help me, and we later
found out he blocked us because of some stuff that happened that day to him that we had no involvement in. He unblocked us a month later and I was thinking just telling him fuck off and blocking him because he put me through a lot of stuff mentally because i considered him my closest friend at the time and i shifted
the blame onto me and i felt like shit. fast forward to this weekend, he got in another arguement over a competition and i intervened and told him to stop being rude to a different friend. i took the blame again and he told me he was thinking of finding new friends when he gets in high school. I felt betrayed and instantly felt my self esteem plummet. I spent years building a friendship with him and trusted him. I told him that it was more sadness than happiness in the friendship and i blocked him. he leaked the dms of that to my friends in a group chat and was saying that he wanted “real friends”. My friends didnt understand what he meant and he told us that we “dont hang out irl enough”. I told him several times before that I couldn’t risk getting covid because of the size of my house that my family lives in and my health issues. I told him about how hes made me feel and about my anxiety and slef consciousness and my friends supported me and they all cut him off because they too felt betrayed and hurt. He afterwards started to call us out on all of the things that we have wrong with ourselves and stopped talking. Today he sent me an extremely short apology owning up to his actions and i rejected it. What should I do now? I feel pressured to forgive him because of my other friends accepting the apology and I dont know what to do.

425,"I am a 22 year old male, I am 107 kg now. I was around 80 a couple months ago, I was still fat but not like this. I was never in my desired weight for my whole life, I was always fighting with it. Currently I live with my family and we're not getting along well. I lived for a year alone, around 2 years ago, it was great. I lost weight because I walked every day and ate everyday, I ate what I made. I cooked every day. I actually like cooking, I like to experiment, try recipes I seen on the internet...

I was living in a different city then, it was flat, I like to walk for hours by the sea. I don't like it here, it's not beautiful and there's hills everywhere. And cooking, it's just the worst. I never know what is in the fridge, I have hard time finding pans or stuff. When I was living alone, I didn't have a dishwasher, I washed my dishes right after I ate. Here, I try to find something to cook myself a food, and see that it's dirty. We have a dishwasher but some things stays dirty for days. Sometimes I take a spoon or a plate from where we put the clean ones, only to see it's dirty. My parents just don't give a fuck about anything. I am actually concerned about my health too.

Anyway I am not cooking here, I hate kitchen. And I hate my family, so I generally stay up until late to take some quiet time for myself while everyone's sleeping. At night, when I feel hungry, I like to have something in my drawer that I can eat right away. And when I want to eat something sweet I'm not making them, I buy them. I lost so much weight while I was living alone but here, even though I gained some I actually managed to keep myself in around 80's. I hate gyms by the way, I was working out on my own while I was living alone, and I actually went to a gym for a while but now I am a oily, disgusting thing walking around, I mean I am ashamed of it a little. And good ones are expensive, bad ones are, well, bad.

I am so depressed nowadays. I mean I was depressed for my whole life but this time it's different. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to continue playing the game I am so curious about it's ending,  I don't want to continue reading the final pages of the book I loved, I don't wan't to continue watching my favorite show. I mean I want to but, how can I describe this, I don't feel like doing it. ""I'll watch it later, I want to watch but not now."". Even though I hate to take a walk around here, I was still doing that to get away from this house a little bit. Walking while listening to music is like my favorite activity. Now, my phone is broken and headphone jack isn't working, then I don't want to go out. I stay home and listen to music from my computer or lay in bed and stare at the ceiling. I just let go. I saw myself getting fatter and fatter but I said ""I don't care anymore."". And I didn't, I saw myself passing the 100, I said ""I will be 200 soon because I'm not changing anything in my life."". I thought losing weight will not change my life, I'll still be miserable etc. My depression isn't caused by my fatness.

I was talking to my aunt, she is the only person that cares about me in this world. She said, if I want to get away from everything maybe I should go visit her. I actually want to but I am ashamed of my body, I don't want her to see me like this. She says it's ok, I know she doesn't care about it but I do. That's when I wanted to lose weight.

But, as everything, I'm failing so hard so far. When I eat a good meal, I feel like something's missing and I crave some sweets. When I am sitting in my room, I want to have some junk food next to me. When I sit back and watch something, I want to stuff my mouth with junk food, I just can't think any other way to watch something. When I'm hungry, first thing I think of is garbage. I want to eat junk food all the time. I was looking around for some junk food a couple minutes ago and I found something but I want to lose weight, I told my aunt so. I left it there but I don't know I might go and grab it anytime. I feel it, I feel like I need it. Like feeling hunger, when I feel hungry, I feel it somewhere in my chest and when I eat it goes away. It's just like this, right now it's there, a gap waiting to be filled with chips and chocolates. I know it won't go away until I eat some junk food and it's like, pushing me. I don't know if I can resist it for much longer. I want to eat.

There's some junk food lying around all the time. My parents but them, my sister makes them buy sometimes. And when I go out, I always enter the groceries to see what's new. I know that the big, evil companies play with my health and take advantage of me to fill their pockets but I just can not help it. I always, always enter them to see what garbage I can eat today. I know I should just go straight home but I can't. I think like ""I'll just see, if I see something new I'll buy it, if I don't then I will go home."" but if I don't, I enter the next shop. I hate myself. Like, no one has had a gun pointed at my head, just what happens if I don't enter them? Or eat them? Nothing, so saying things like ""I can't help it."" just embarrasses me, I don't have to eat. What does it mean to ""need"" them, no I don't, actually I need to get rid of them for a healthy life, for life even, it's killing me.

I just don't know what to do and I don't know what kind of advice I'm looking for but, here you go.",24Nov2020,1
426,"This is my first post on reddit so if I make a mistake it's not my fault 🙂

I'm a 14 (15 in march) year old boy. And my girlfriend is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my entire life. She is 5'1 (I think), very skinny, and very beautiful.

I'm gonna go into some backstory here.

When I was in 8th grade I had a girlfriend that a few months after dating, I found out she was literally crazy. But about a month before (while we were still dating), I was in gym class and we had to get into groups of 4. My girlfriend at the time had 3 other friends in the class. Two of her friends got into our group.
But 1. She looked sad... but her friends didn't care. They didn't even say anything. As she was walking away I took a step forward. But stopped. I was going to swap place's with her. But my girlfriend said my name.
Then it hit me. I had started to develop feelings for this girl...

A week or 2 later we had this ""Teen Night"" at my school. The girl I started to like walked up to me and gave me her phone. It said ""Can I have your number?"" In the contacts thing. I put my number in and she kinda just hung around me the rest of the time. Didn't even say anything. But it looked like she wanted to.

After the ""Teen Night"" I got home and texted her why she asked for my number. She said ""Because I think your cute"". I thought to myself ""Fair enough lol"" Now she wasn't the brightest when it came to texting so it's a bit difficult. 

After me and my Ex broke up me and my new crush started talking all the time. But then I stopped. I stopped talking to her for months. Every day she would call. And I would just sit there, and wait. Until one day I realized how bad of a boyfriend I was. I answered her call. I don't remember what she said. A week later she broke up with me. I wasn't sad. I deserved it... 
(We were still in contact afterwards)

A few months later she texted me that she wanted to get back together. And I said sure. 

(This is during Covid)
A few months go by and BAM. I'm in high school now. We have 2 classes together. A few weeks of school go by and we get a little break.
And then I do something even worse...

My girlfriend had put me in a group chat with one of her friends. We talked a little in the group, and then she talked to me privately. (She was the shy girl who left school one day unexpectedly and was never seen again.) She had told me she liked me and long longstoryshort I got with her instead.

(Now before I continue I want to add why.
My girlfriend always talked about other guys right to my face, called other guys cute, and all the other stuff you don't want to hear from the person you love. She never even showed any interest in me.)

About a day into our ""relationship"" I found out she had sexual intentions with me. And when I found that out I wanted to ruin her life. (Not in a sexual way lol) I played along for a few day's and then I broke up with her. A little later her sister texts me how bad of a person I am. I said ""Your kidding, right?"" Now obviously her sister had no idea she wanted to have unholy times in bed with me. So I told her sister. And she lost everything.

Now thats not exactly how it happened. But it is.
Each day I wasn't getting a call was the day's I was realizing that... I was a terrible boyfriend. I had left the person I loved. And in my head I thought ""What if she's crying right now?"" And I wouldn't even know. I called her and told her how sorry I was and how bad of a boyfriend I was. She forgave me. Why? Why would she forgive me for doing something so wrong? 

A little while after I texted her about what had happened and if she would still be interested in getting back together. She said yes, but she wanted to work our way into a relationship with time. 

It's been a few months since then. We talk almost every day. She hasn't been talking about other guys or anything anymore. And I wanted to make things right. So I bought her a diamond ring. (Yes it is diamond. Yes it was expensive) I'm not sure if it will fit her but even so, I'm sure she will love it. 

Sorry for the long read but I had to get it all in.

But was I a bad boyfriend? And can I PLEASE get some advice?",24Nov2020,1

428,"I’m a 19 year old guy from the UK. I’m on a foundation year at university and then going into a 4 year course. As I’ve already done a year at a separate uni, student finance won’t cover me throughout the whole course. Meaning I’ll have to pay £9250 for both of the last two years. 

At the same time. I hate the course, and I really don’t know whether university is for me. But at the same time, I have no other job prospects lined up. I need some kind of degree. However there is nothing in the world that I’m passionate about. 

Due to this. The only way that I can see myself moving forward is to claim from the benefits system which I really don’t want to do. I want to work and have a career but I have no idea what I want to do with my life. 

I’m into music and theatre production, anything that boasts an ounce of creativity really sparks my interest, however I’m open to anything.

I’d appreciate if anyone could tell me about their careers, what alternative routes they’ve taken other than a university/ college degree, or just some general life advice for getting out of a slump. Anything would be lovely right now. Thanks guys!",24Nov2020,1
429,"I can't imagine not talking to him anymore. I feel guilt and this sense of sadness not speaking to someone who has defined my life for 2 years.  At the same time, the idea of marrying him scares me these last 3ish months. Never did before in these last 2 years.

I keep focusing hard on incompatibilities. For example, I'm boring sexually , just want loving p in v and oral sex, maybe some blind folds. He wants to lick my ass/anal, finish on my face and boobs.. He's never made me orgasm. I can tell he sees pleasuring me as a chore for more than 5 minutes, maybe 10 times, he's tried a full 30 mins to get it to happen. Foreplay is often short with ""are you ready yet?"" being asked, it's just a boring step for him I guess. 

There's a mental illness he won't get help for nor a diagnosis. The first time it really hit 1.5 years ago, I let him unload on me for like an hour a day at least, for weeks. Even when what he thought hurt or scared me. I asked him to stop after 6ish weeks cos I was miserable. Had to threaten to leave a few times to get him to stop, was so ugly. I was insecure for a few months after. Things were mostly normal for many months and I was happy again but it came back hard late spring and most of summer. I really had it and insisted he get help and diagnosed. We fought about this almost everyday for 2 months in summer. Its still there and I know it'll probably strike him again.

Thing is, I've been stuck at home with my family since mid-March because my college is online until fall 2021 and I lost my job a few weeks prior to the pandemic, I'm still job searching. My anxiety is so much worse for the last 6 months and our issues propelled it. Or perhaps my anxiety propelled these issues? I feel so much pressure, I worry almost daily  whether or not to stay and Google most days for advice these last 2 months or so. I've lost feelings but I think its just the stress? Sometimes I panic about never dating anyone else ever again and never knowing if there's someone without his issues and who is similar sexually. Im thinking of purposely going with the flow until New Years and then checking in for a more natural, less logic based answer.

437,"Morning all, I am going to give you a summed up life story so that you have an idea or where I currently stand.

\_\_\_\_

Place of residence: Scotland, UK

Age: 22

Gender: Male

Medication: Sertraline 200mg

Mental/Physical Illnesses: OCD (diagnosed 2018)

Work: Call Centre for Telecommunications

\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

early-2018,

&amp;#x200B;

I met a girl \[17\] over Instagram and we started talking, we got on really well and we both had OCD so we related to each other a lot, she lived across the country and I didn't drive but when my mood was very low I was signed off work by my GP, I used this time to visit her. I stayed at her house (England, 700 miles away) twice and on the third time she stayed at mine; she was pretty perfect, I loved the company and compassion we both had, but when she stayed at my house I took a mental breakdown and THEN she split up with me via call when she went home (I was in the hospital when she left), which sent me off the rails.

&amp;#x200B;

mid-2018,

&amp;#x200B;

Spent most of these months depressed as hell, not a work, not eating, crying (I never cry), and just have suicidal and intrusive thoughts every day; it was awful. I kept texting her, messaging her, I was a wreck (she wasn't great either). It was by far the worst year of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

late-2018,

&amp;#x200B;

I started to recover from the loss of my breakup, I chatted to her now and then but overtime I slowly started to fix myself. started to go back to my hobbies, returned to work in October (signed off in June). I was on the mend but still not 100%.

&amp;#x200B;

early-2019

&amp;#x200B;

My memory isn't great at all so I struggle to pin point any details, but during 2019, I recovered to about 90%, still on medication, in and out of appointment for my mental health, struggling to trust anyone (especially woman from a relationship stand point).

&amp;#x200B;

mid/late-2019

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to focus on my dream career in the police, I studied often and later sat the interview but I failed pretty badly (passed initial testing and exams mid-2017). this put me down and led to me be signed off work again due to my low mood. I was off work for about 7 weeks, I returned once my mood improved and did my best to get into a good habit and improving my life style.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

CURRENT:

&amp;#x200B;

I recently failed the assessment day for the Police, because of this, I will be moving away for a few years to get a different job, meet new people and learn new skills.

&amp;#x200B;

I volunteer often, I enjoy my passion for photography, I swim, and I am also looking to move away to a city about 120 miles from me for a new taste of life. I want to get a job that pays better than my current one and gets me out in the public domain more often, ensuring my mind is constantly stimulated and not stuck behind a desk.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also applied to sit my Higher in English as I want to be more academic and gain a higher qualification for my CV. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have also hooked up with several woman, and last my virginity, one of which wanted a relationship with me but I have since told her that I don't want to be tied down as I plan on moving away. She was pretty upset and now I feel like I am the bad guy as I like her, but there are several factors which made me think she isn't the one (she smokes and her weight being the main problem). Although she can be attractive, these main issues is the reason why I don't orgasm during sex with her. I did have a blowjob previously from someone who wasn't that good looking but she made me cum as her skills where very good.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR //

&amp;#x200B;

Mental breakdown after S.O. breakup during 2018, spent 2 years recovering, failed police interview, medicated for OCD, started new hobbies, lost virginity, had a few hook ups after realising what's the point in waiting. I have had sex about 7 times this year, with 2 separate woman + 2 blowjobs from another woman. My plan is to leave my town and rent a room in a city and work there, meet new friends, try new things, learn life skills and becoming a better version of my current self.

440,"hey everyone this may be a common theme these days for a lot of people but i guess i’m just getting to it now for myself. 

the first issue i have is that i’m in my fourth year and am beginning to regret taking my major. the applications of it sounded cool to me when i was 17 and chose it but it’s been 3.5 years and i’m only realizing now that my interests may have shifted. i don’t know what i want to do anymore and so i was thinking of taking some time off from school to explore my options more but i need a job for this to be possible. however everywhere i’m applying (most are related to my degree) say i’m too inexperienced. i have related professional experience, volunteer experience in the field, and side projects i’ve worked on by myself but this still somehow isn’t enough. i’ve gone to multiple job fairs and sent so many job applications and am having no luck after 5 months. this may not be so long compared to some people but i’m getting absolutely nothing back for a paying job :/. after a while has started to feel like this is for absolutely nothing when i do research on the company/position and make custom cover letters for them when less than 10% even reply to reject me. i live alone and due to covid these days i have few social interactions in-person. i call my parents about twice a week so we can facetime together for dinner or just catch up but it seems they’re constantly getting comparing me to my sister who has dropped out of school and started her own business. i’m getting no support from them and i just feel so alone. 

the other thing i’m struggling with is with my long distance boyfriend. we’ve been together for almost 2 years now and long distance since corona. he lives in europe and is coming here in january for a few months. i’m 21 and hes 22. when he lived here he has his own temporary place but we always knew he’d have to move here permanently if we wanted this to work but now that it’s coming soon (within the next year according to our plan) i’m getting really nervous. i’m not ready for any of this and i feel like we’re moving too fast. i love him very much and understand the sacrifices he’s making for us but i don’t know if i’m ready for this big of a step yet. he doesn’t have much of a network for finding jobs here and would be relying on me for much of these things. but what would happen if i find my dream job in another city? im only 21 and need to get my career going but is that fair to him? is it fair to me if i don’t? are we in too deep with our relationship? 

i feel stuck my career/relationship and am lost on how to go forward with the two together.

Last thursday my son got a fever of 105 and had to be taken to the hospital. with the covid restrictions only 1 parent can be there at once, so i went and worked my 10 hour shift and informed my boss of my situation. he tells me i need to get my shifts covered on my own knowing there was no one that could cover me. After work i went to the hospital to swap with my wife and give her a chance to go home. they decided they were going to keep him at the hospital through the weekend at this point. his white blood cells count is way off. I manage to get a few hours sleep in the chair next to my sons bed but not much.

Friday I go to work at 9am work my entire shift until about 9pm then go back to the hospital again. hes not getting any better and the doctors are consulting with specialists from another hospital. im up with him all night, finally manage to get to sleep around 5am.

saturday morning I wake up 2 hours late at 1030 rush to my store my boss was there he only said something along the lines of nice of you to wake up and join us and then he leaves. i work my shift until 8pm without hearing anything else from him. by the afternoon most the tests have come back at this point. they realize its not viral or bacterial but  they want observe him a little more. The  doctors inform us they are referring him to a oncology and hematology  doctor at the other hospital. Saturday night they let him come home.

447," Throwaway account because... well, I'm not sure why I made a new account just for this. I guess it's because the whole incident felt dirty to me.

My mom's in her late 60s, speaks little English and lives alone. Two years ago - when I helped her move - I went around the block, left my number to all the neighbors and asked them to call me for... well, anything.

Things were great at first. But, soon enough, I started getting weekly calls and texts from one particular neighbor (we'll call him **Neighbor A**), complaining about 'endless' barking from my mom's dog, **T** \- a 100 lb German Shepherd/Labrador mix. I acted on every one of his complaints, and did just about everything I can - stopping just short of the devocalization surgery that **Neighbor A** kept suggesting we get.

Nothing made **Neighbor A** happy. Running out of ideas, I installed some cameras in the yard and monitor each incident. Turns out, what my neighbor considered incessant barking amounts only to about a handful incidents of 15-20 second of periodic barking, all with cause (folks walking past the house, small critters running by the fence, etc.).

I can go on. **Neighbor A** once called animal control and got my mom cited, with a continued, 5-minute recording of barking. My camera footage told a different story: my neighbor got a stranger (not anyone from his household) standing on a stool, reaching over the fence and pointing his phone at **T** to record the reaction.

Anyways. Fast forward to today. I haven't seen my mom since Jan, and decided to stay over through the holidays\*. At this point, we haven't heard from **Neighbor A** for almost a full year. I assumed - falsely - that we're all happy with each other now.

Today at 10:30 PM, **Neighbor A** came-a knocking. Hard. I was about half-way to sleep, but got up and answered the door after some frantic dress-up. He clearly didn't expect me, and - after a minute of pleasantry - launched into some aggressive complaints of *animal abuse*. According to **Neighbor A**, because **T** is an outside dog, we have, apparently, abandoned **T** in all sense of words. We have deprived **T** of no human interaction all year, and **T**'s barks are a cry for help. **Neighbor A** asks why we even bother keeping **T**, and says that he'll take **T** off our hands if we allow it.

I've abridged his part quite a bit, but let's assume the tirade went on for a good few minutes. Half-way through, he threw the blame on me for not keeping my mom in check (?), and got angrier as he continued.

I know people tend to have a somewhat skewed depiction of themselves in these moments. But I promise you, I was - at the very least - polite. In retrospect, I kinda wish I wasn't.

Anyways, our talk didn't get very far. His girlfriend came by and pleaded with him to go back to their house. As **Neighbor A** walked away, I told him I appreciate his concerns and respect it (exact words), but am happy to talk more to address his thoughts. He started shouting profanity - the standard F words, what-not. And then, for all the hear...

# ""Sell your house. I hope you sell your house and move. You better sell your house soon. Go back to China, you fxxker.""

I know, I know. This is pretty tame for most in the racism department, but it really, *really* took me by surprise. This is a person I've spoken with in multiple occasions. Someone I've shook hands with, given holidays gift and tried my best to make nice to. I've had my fair share of run-in's with racial slurs, but... this undisguised racism, in such grown-up, intimate setting, is jarring.

I've posted this on another subreddit, but would really like to advise on what to do from here on. 

1. I can take **T** to live with me in Texas, but it'll break my mom's heart. The contention had always been about **T**, so maybe this will smooth things out.
2. Move my Mom elsewhere. I don't want **Neighbor A** to win, but I also don't feel comfortable having my mom living next to him.
3. ???

In less than a month, I will have to go back to my job in Texas. I think things are fine while I'm still here, but I really, *really* don't want to leave my mom alone to deal with Neighbor A.

I would appreciate any advises. Thank you.",24Nov2020,1

Now I have a best friend who is a guy, and I’ve never had feelings for him until we started having these really long talks at parties. It felt like the world disappeared bcs we were SO alike, it can be kinda freaky sometimes how alike we are. I don’t like him whatsoever and I’m not attracted to him in a romantic way, but I really value this amazing connection we have as friends. 

My boyfriend started to notice this and I respected his frustrations, and told him the truth (I didn’t see him in that way, but I can understand how this can look wrong to him). So I told him I could stop total contact with my friend for him, but he admitted that he didn’t want to be controlling and just said to not be so close. I agreed and said I would do anything for him. 

I’ve been trying to step away from my friend, but I’m finding it difficult. I would start paying more attention to my boyfriend when we were all hanging out, sometimes I would talk to my friend, but it would always end in us having a never ending conversation and suddenly it’s been hours. 

The big problem happened at a recent party, where I was dared by a mutual friend to kiss my best friend. It was a small peck, nothing more. I didn’t even remember it until a few days later and now I’m struck with guilt. 

How could I do that to my boyfriend? Why couldn’t I just stay away? I know I was drunk but that is never an excuse for something like this. 

Now I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I could ever tell him about this, and I’ve thought about just ending it and walking away. I thought about cutting my friend off and never speaking to him again, but he’s in our close friend group and I don’t want any bad blood between anyone. 

My boyfriend is so amazing he never deserved any of this, but I can’t even fathom leaving him because I did such a stupid mistake, but also if I tell him I know he would leave me. I’m being so selfish in saying this, but I think I might just commit suicide.

I try to do commission work as an artist but because of my hand pain, it's impossible to pull in a sustainable income. I'm basically relying on the kindness and charitablility of my friends and online community to pay my bills and overall life has been really shitty this year. I live in rural Texas, far enough from any cities that without a vehicle of my own, it's just about impossible to go anywhere. Resources for physical and mental health are already generally difficult to come by in the cities that do have them. My health is failing me and I've got nowhere to go and nothing to do but stew in my room 24/7.

I want to finally get an education, I want to live on my own and be stable make my own happiness, everything I've been denied for so long.

My questions:

- Does anyone have experience with getting into low-income housing? If so, do you have any resources you could share that could help me understand what paths I could take?
- How do I continue to survive with this disability? I can't really apply for disability assistance because I know they'll just want me to go see one of their docs, and not only can I not travel unless my roommates happen to have an off day to take me, but the previous two specialists I saw still haven't found the source of my pain so I doubt one more visit to any doctor will convince the SSI people that I'm ""truly disabled""
- More specific to the geographic area, but does anyone know of decent cities in WA or OR that I could look into further? Someplace with decent and accessible resources, public transportation, safe for LGBTQ+ folks, and not so overpriced I can't survive there.

my friend is organizing a trip to a tourist destination for his classmates and asked me if i would like to join . at first i thought may be i could go there for free , but then realized that would be wrong.

he charged $60 from his classmates. and i asked if he could give me a ticket for $$20 - 30. i know half price is way too low , but he is one of my close frnds so i thought maybe i can give it a shot. and then maybe settle around $40 after negotiation.

at first he directly stated a no for price reduction and which i found to be a bit rude.

then a day later , he states $50 as the price for me , and i think which is fine as all the tour guides charge the same amount. i am about to take this offer .

he calls me and wants my confirmation wheather i want to go or not , and along with this, he says that he felt bad when i asked for a discount . 

now i dont think i did anything wrong in asking for a discount ( maybe you can say $20 was way too low but he was the one who told me while negotiating , give a  price even lower than your suitable one , this way your price may be attained easily) .. but really, did i do something wrong?? 

note-i did not mean to hurt him while asking the lower price.",24Nov2020,1
456,"So me and this girl matched on Tinder (note that my bio was ""Looking for friends or smth idk"", we found out we both share many interests, both suffer from gastritis and have the same type of pain, both of us are bi (rare in my country) and a bunch of other interests we have in common. Shw told me numerous times how I'm a copy or a clone of her. Long story short, we add each other on Discord and start to game together almost every day, but like 1-2 hours max and sometimes less, and usually with a group but also sometimes alone. Anyway, she changes her profile pic on Dc and tells me ""I like my pfp on Discord"" and I was like okay yeah it's nice. Then the other day, this guy we'll call Josh played with me and her, me and her were talking about our similarities and he definitely overheard it. The next day she uploads the same photo from Discord but to Instagram. The caption says something along the lines of ""Imagine someone who understands your mind"", and Josh left a comment ""Imagine a clone"" and she replied with ""🤤"". Is this a sign I should take seriously or just coincidence? It's eating me from the inside, please help.

460,"I'm (32 M), the mother of my children is (28F) and my cousin is (31M).

I spent 8 years with my ex partner, my cousin was around alot of that. He is the godfather of our first born child who is now 5.  

Me and my ex split up 2019 April, when she was pregnant with our second child. because I had cheated on her in the past (more than once and she found out). Every part of me wanted to fix it at the time even hoped in the future she would have forgiven me and we could make it together. But initially I was embarrassed and had to accept my mistakes and fuck up. 

My cousin has many times told me he's slept with women whom have partners,  on more than one occasion. He's slept with the women of our friends and obviously I knew this. So I told my then partner to be weary of him. 

All this time I've been split up with my ex, my cousin was in my ear telling me that I shouldn't try and work things out. While also being in her ear and being somewhat of a confidant. Never telling me anything of her, but visiting my kids and seeing my children on social media.( Something I didn't have the privilege of doing as my ex has blocked me).

When we were younger I'd spoke to girls he had been seeing and some even wanted to sleep with me. I had never slept with them but the intent was there. I've grown alot since then and I wouldn't dream of doing that shit now. As morally it's wrong in my eyes. (I know I'm a cheater and its rich coming from me, but I've learnt my lesson).

So fast forward to September 2020, me and my cousin are still speaking and it's all good. I was helping him get a new TV. But this fell through. I gave him my old TV to say sorry about that. It's my birthday and he drops a present off for me. I tell him about girls I've dated recently, you know usual bro talk. 

After this he starts to act off, doesn't return my calls, doesn't reply to texts. 

Turns to october 2020 and I'm going to my ex's house for my daughter's 5th birthday, to see my daughter and drop off presents. Obviously Im a soldier I don't get to see my daughter as much as I would like especially due to Covid and restrictions. But anyway, cousin turns up and my daughter's happy she sees her uncle. I'm sat on the couch, and he goes into the kitchen and then sits with my ex partner. 

I'm very good at reading the room and body language of people, and I noticed her knees where always pointed towards him and he was being very offish when I tried to make conversation. So I automatically knew something was off that I didn't know about. 

After this interaction with them, he text me and told me he didn't want to be in the same room as me. That I had done everything to stop him seeing my children and I was a selfish peice of shit. (This list goes on).

I tried to explain how it's hard for me because now I don't see my children as much as I did when I lived there. So I like to spend it with me and them. But he proceeded to tell me how he was done with me.

I said okay. 

I spoke to the mother of my kids and she said oh it's between you both. I asked her what's gone on with them she said nothing.


October 31st Halloween my son was sick, so I went there and spotted a birthday card to the mother from my cousin. With a big paragraph saying he was so proud of her and loves speaking to her all night. I didn't mention it at the time as my son wasnt well so I took the mother and son to hospital and returned to the house with my daughter.

When I returned I realised she had hidden the card, and it made sense she didn't want me to see it because there was more to it than the card. So I text her and told her I had seen it and wondered why she hid it...

She denied it, then eventually said I need to talk to you when I get back. 

I of course knew and was certain by this point. 

But she told me he had told her he had feelings for her and she had feelings for him. And it broke me. He had told her everything about anything I had done and had been doing to manipulate her is what I think. 

I cried, I left her and drunk drove my self to my to my house and tried to end my life. (The girl I have been seeing came and helped me and consoled me. I explained to her the situation and she has given me her advice. But I'm here for an unbiased opinion)

I had decided as much as I was feeling betrayed and hatred I would just not feed my energy into it and text them and said. If you are happy I can't stop you. You'll do it regardless. 

My ex said thanks, but it wasn't going anywhere. Feelings fade. 

My cousin said how I was selfish and a piece of shit and trying to be the victim but all I am is a victim of my own stupidness. (recurring theme of the last two times we contacted)


Fast forward, to Sunday early hours. My ex calls me. Apologising. After me getting over this somewhat. She called to apologise saying it wasn't nice and can see why I'm hurt. Obviously this has sent my head abit sideways  

I've asked her to ensure he cannot see my children anymore and I feel like it's selfish on a part of me. But I don't think he deserves to be a part of there life as if he genuinely cared for them. He wouldn't have ruined any form of civil relationship between the children's parents...

Please someone give me advice. I realise this sounds like a vent but I just need people's perspective.",24Nov2020,1

this guy is crazy...I got mod status to a sub after filing for a request when the original owner went inactive for 8 months and the sub was closed from new submissions. There was nothing happening much in that sub until recent events in that sub's topic (the sub is basically a fanpage to a rap artist). Whoever it is, he's downvoting every post I made to that sub, almost within 5-10 minutes after I post it, even when it's just bland informational pieces that are not even subjective, even if it's something cool and noteworthy. The sub has about 500 joined and he's like the first one to downvote my post before anyone sees it, so it's automatically 0 by the time someone else sees it, where a lot of people just leaves it at 0 or some people have the decency to raise it back to 1. So all my posts are upvoted 97% positive except for that one guy. 

The guy wont show himself nor does he ask to be mod. He doesn't downvote anyone else who posts on that sub because other posts get unscathed and stay at 100% positive. I don't abuse my mod status because there's barely any traffic for anything. I know he is one of my followers on my userpage...he just does his petty little downvotes every time I post on the sub (and not other subs, fortunately for now) ...what stylesheet or technique can I use? I already hid downvotes on the sub and now he's going to my profile to downvote my posts, it's getting out of hand, and he's one of those no-lifer types that wont give up on the internet (I suppose I can hide my userpage history, but I have 12 other followers and decent people who PM me because of my track record)...he's been consistent at it for 4-6 weeks already and it's one of those people who wanted to be a mod but didn't get a chance, and now he's lashing out with petty downvotes in front of everyone who follows that sub

468,"Bear with me on the vague title.

I’m going through a breakup. I’m 24 years old, was dating the love of my life for 5 1/2 years, when I ruined it all. I never got help for my self esteem and insecurity issues and it was enough for my ex to reach his limit. I am shattered. Angry. Distraught. Hopeless. Hopeful (but not too often). I’ve been working with a therapist who I thoroughly enjoy actually, so I believe that’s the first step.

I’m a medical student, currently on clinical rotations. I’m good at what I do. I enjoy being on the field, I enjoy the opportunity to learn, but also, the distraction. Since I’ve been out on rotations, I’ve moved away from family and friends, I don’t have scheduled classes anymore, and my boyfriend is out of the picture. I have all this time, and seemingly nothing to do with it.

I take long walks, I read, and that’s just about it. I met my ex when I was 18, when I was most problematic. I hate the person I used to be. I can’t go back to being her. Clearly, the person I was in my relationship wasn’t good enough, so I can’t go back to being that. I don’t really know who I am now. My hobbies are so limited. My relationships are mostly all gone throughout the years, some for the best though. 

If I wanted to see the silver lining, it would be clear that this is a clean slate. But a clean slate puts so much pressure on what you put on it first... it’s why I never stuck with therapy in the first place. I recognized deep down that everything needs to change, and that’s so scary. I’m so lost.

At first I was working as a bike mechanic there then I got laid off and rehired when they found out about my skill sets. Apart from being underpaid which I won’t get into, my boss has become a complete jerk and I don’t know how to handle this besides work completely off site. He used to be cool and talk to me about work and stuff but lately he has completely left me in the dark.

I email him and he never emails me back. He only reaches out to tell me to fix something or when he needs to criticize my work if I made a mistake which is rare. When I try to talk to him in person in his office He won’t even look me in the eye. He just stares at his computer and I talk to his back and shoulder. I get no respect there. Not only this my coworkers are also jerks and shady and just love to gossip behind peoples back.

My job goes a little like this... Due to COVID I’ve been onsite for 2 days a week. While there I create content by shooting his products and then taking them off site working from home creating content to market for his business online. But the two days that I am there are the two days that really drain me to the point where I began having dreams about my boss and the work and how much I dread the toxic environment.

It’s Tuesday and I’m supposed to go in to shoot content today. However, I was thinking of just staying home and away from the office and digital manipulate content from home. Not only is this something I am able to do since he’s ok with me working remotely. But it will keep my head in the right place mentally.

470,"Howdy yall. So a few nights ago my best friend, another friend and I were playing a video game, just relaxing and enjoying our time; we're all about the same age, 28. I misunderstood something that he said about task we needed to do in the video game and I told him he was wrong. Then I realized he was right, I apologized and owned up to my mistake. 

After that it was like a switch was flipped and he really started to be rude and passive aggressive. I kept my cool and continued try and enjoy my time, but it got to the point where I gave him a warning shot, slightly raising my voice to tell him to relax. I didn't want to argue with him because 1, I didn't want to make my other friend uncomfortable, and 2, I thought it would be silly to argue over a video game. 

I had already apologized and admitted at fault, so I still didn't understand why he was so angry and was pretty much bullying me, he has never done that. 

So now we haven't talked since then, I noticed he tries to avoid me. I was hoping he would apologize to me, but  that never happened. There's a part of me that wants to let this friendship end, because the way he acted really disappointed me, I would never be friends with someone who bullies innocent people to make them feel better, especially if it's their best friend; all over a video game, which just sounds extremely silly to me. But then there's another part of me that wants to try and contact them and ask if they're okay, and try and rebuild our friendship.

475,"So a little background information; me (f21) and my girlfriend (f20) moved in together about 4 months ago. We’ve known each other for around 3-4 years and dated once before in this period however we were long distance before before the last 4 months. Our relationship has always been amazing, even when we broke up it wasn’t malicious we just had some mental health things to sort out (mainly anxiety and depression which we both suffer with) and a year and a half later we found ourselves back together again. 

Since living together my girlfriend started a job where sometimes she does long shifts, however i work from home, no matter the length of the shift however when she gets home I always feel blank and overwhelmed. She is always excited to tell me about her day and is always in a happy mood to see me and I am also so excited to see her and I love to hear about her day but I just shut off?? My brain goes blank and I feel overwhelmed and it makes it hard for me to share the genuine excitement I have to see her. 

We have spoken about it as she noticed I was always a little off when she gets home but I explained I really don’t know why, maybe it’s because I had all day to myself without socialising and then when she gets home my brain isn’t in social mode?? Sometimes it happens in general conversation when she will tell me about something and my mind will go completely blank, it feels like I have to remember how to be a human and have a conversation for a second before I realise how to respond. We also spoke about this and now whenever I buffer she will say “interesting response” and I have a minute to think about how I feel and how I want to respond. 

I suppose due to covid i’ve had lots less social interaction but it doesn’t seem normal to not remember how to function anymore as i see and speak to my girlfriend everyday. It is very frustrating as my girlfriend is always so tired after work and I bet it’s not nice to come home to an empty girlfriend.

481,"So, in 6-7 months I intend on joining the Navy, and I've been working hard to achieve that, talking to recruiters, and getting in shape. Last night I was up and scripting a move on Roblox (I dont play the game, but I do it as a hobby), and there are many things in particular that he said was false. He was most definitely trying to get me to not want to join the military, and told me that I need to actually do research on the topic before I go down it (he likes to say that whenever he thinks you arent educated about it). 

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, I've done a shit ton of research (you can even look in my post history, thats just the surface of stuff). When I tried doing this, he didnt want to listen, he wanted to continue to listen to himself, and just ignore that I said that I do do research. And here's the kicker, he said ""me and my mother have worked hard trying to get you into contact with these recruiters, and you arent grateful"". But the thing is, that was a bold face lie to my face. Because i'm the one who has literally been on the phone with recruiters, and i'm the one whose been getting into contact, and setting up meetings. My mother has just been approving of me doing this all (she insists that I go into the military, shes supportive of my endeavors). To add onto all of that, back then when I was interested in joining a trade, he wasnt supportive of that either. ""Oh you should not join a union, they do nothing but treat black people like shit"". But now suddenly he recommends I do a trade when I finally find that I may actually like going into the Navy despite its initial challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing that he said that stood out to me is that he can put a stop to me going to the Navy completely. Does he as a step parent have the right to do that when my biological parent supports my endeavors? I turn 18 next month by the way. To be honest, I can be a little bit lazy at times, but i've been trying to fix all of that for a better quality of life. I've been doing better at school, and I had a job (he also of course had something to say about that). Should I just try to get alone with him and just agree with everything he says until its time for me to ship out? I dont know if I can go 6-7 months more of this. He is one of the major push favors that made me want to go into the military in the first place. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now a list of things he lied about (I know because I did the research):

&amp;#x200B;

\-Bootcamp is 6-10 months (its only 8 weeks)

\-You get deployed after you get out of bootcamp (You go to A School)

\-The chances of you loosing a leg, or seeing combat is high (False. Navy barely see's combat anymore, just do what you are supposed to do, and you will be fine)

&amp;#x200B;

He also seems to think that I only want to go to the Navy to spite him, when in reality, he isnt that important to me for that to be the sole reason. I want to go because the sea calls to me, I want to travel, I want the benefits, I want to make my mother proud, and I want a better chance to get out of my shitty town (St.Louis).

489,"Has anyone had any experience with being diagnosed with benign exertional headaches but had it treated / taken further beyond having pills thrown at you?  
Not to discredit anyone working in the medical industry but I've lost all faith with this one and want some advice, perhaps exclusively a UK thing?  
Working out has always been standard 3-5 days a week, heavy lifting combined with stretching and some basic cardio work. One day start stretching then skipping and within minutes had a very sudden explosive headache that was comparable to when I had bacterial meningitis. Had to stop and lie down and cradle myself before limping to the car and barely driving home. Rinse repeat, thought it was a one off or something trapped but happened 3 more times at random intervals. I know it's not related to the exertion as I worked on overhead press doing PB with no effect then lightly doing some lat pulldowns saw it go boom again. The once I didn't even get through stretching. Blood pressure fine, heart rate normal, no other health conditions. Obviously explain all this to the doc and after a test of looking into my eyes and then checking co-ordination, labelled it as benign exertion headaches and prescribed beta blockers.

Admittedly I got a little pissed because it felt like treating the symptoms not the cause coupled with the ridiculous advice of ""don't exercise"" like what planet doctor advises that. I questioned her choice and advice to which I got back ""We don't really know how beta blockers work, but it seems to relax blood vessels and it might help. We'll put you on a medium dose then go up to a double dose and then ween you off them for a few weeks after about 4 months"". Seriously eyebrow raising. Went private and got a similar answer but this time got recommended a head scan #phukit I paid the bill and went for it for science. Came back normal in the brain however they noted that both the main arteries leading to my brain are dilated which is abnormal and quite uncommon. Get the old ""We'll be right back."" over the phone and wait for 2 weeks with no word before I crack and ring up to ask what's going on. The response being ""Well we meet up with specialists about every 2 weeks to discuss these sorts of things when we need to but from what we've gathered so far we don't know what it is, what's going on or what we can do to help.""

So here I am stuck with major headaches if I go to a gym but this also probably explains the ""normal"" issues I've had since teen years such as head rushes from anything, deafness and intense pressure when training, major sickness after doing some workouts, generally feeling crappy, getting headaches from dumb things like going out just to do shopping. I know it's oddly specific but hoping someone has either had similar diagnoses or experiences and perhaps managed to get a label and some kind of pathway to improvement out of it because not only are we cooped up but for people who love training and work hard to keep up their health, not being able to even do little bits of exercise is getting me more bummed than Sasha Gray on set during her period.

490,"Imagine you are a mother of a 22-year-old daughter during covid. Your daughter still lives at home and has bad asthma. She has been working hard to finish her last year of university for a bachelor's and has been saving money for a master's program. She pays for everything on her own, does not cause problems and does not do things such as drinking and drugs.

She has progressively gotten more and more ill. She has to stop working out, doing school work and going to work for a few months. It is later confirmed that it is because of allergies to the family dog you have had for 10 years. What do you do in this situation? If she moves she risks not finishing her education.

491,"I've been dating this girl for a year now. Things are going well. She is very religious, I am not. But we worked it out and things are fine. 

However, recently, this issue sprung up: her brother-in-law, who is just 40 years old, is dying of cancer. He has a daughter of 2 years. It's a fucking tragedy and it's really causing a lot of pain in my gf's family. Now I am kind of an outsider in this situation so I usually shut my mouth and listen when her BIL comes up as a topic. Thing is, her sister (twin sister!) is as religious as she is. They're devout Christians and naturally they will pray for her BIL's wellbeing. Nothing wrong here. 

After long long treatment it seems that the remaining options for her BIL have come to an end. His illness is now considered no longer treatable. It is probably only a matter of months before he is going to die. 

Now ever since her BIL fell ill her sister's been telling my gf that she received revelations from god. God told her that my gf's BIL will survive no matter what doctors say. My gf is trying to be supportive by supporting her sister in her view and not questioning said revelations. Me personally, I am quit irritated by her sisters behaviour. I get it, death of a family member is something very stressful, I've been through the same thing. But to me there's two problems with her sister's attitude:

1) It prevents her from actuallly coming to terms with her husband's (my gf's BIL) death

2) It could lead to some sort of state of delusion and/or massive disappointment which might lead to her losing faith. 

I am no expert in psychology but to me that is kind of a worrying situation. I am afraid that her sister will suffer some kind of mental breakdown once her husband dies. 

Should I say something to my gf? 

Is  it even up to me to say something? 

Am I right to be worried about my gf's sister?

I have 4 dogs who are the only joy of my life and have kept me sane.. if I leave she will take them from me and has already told me plans of how she would falsify me abusing her and what not.. she has gone to the extent of bruising herself, taking photos and written that it was me. I've considered suicide so many times but I just don't have the balls to do it. There's so much more which I cant even put into words, I cant even explain the feelings or emotions I have, its unexplainable.

I already knew 2 of my worst housemates were moving with new people, however, I wasn't expecting my best friend in the house to reject my offer of living together, only to shove in my face her better offers and offer another one of our housemates a place with her and her friends. I did question her on this and she said her friends wouldn't like me as I'm epileptic. Bullshit answer I'm aware, and yes before you say it, I'm very much questioning our friendship.

The other housemates are a problematic couple I've spoken about and I can't deal with another year of them. All of my friends from outside the house already have established houses and groups which I couldn't join.

I wish I could live alone but I really don't know if I'm mentally or financially stable to sustain that, however, I don't know how I'd cope moving in with randomers again given how much these horrible lot have affected me.

What I have to do is stock items on shelves, do inventory orders, and face the items so they can look in order and clean. Nothing too difficult but I’m just having small issues remembering where certain items go and just learning how to do small items here and there. 

I’m in a small team so there’s really only me, two other girls, and two other guys (one being my boss). I work with them almost every night and when I first meant them they weren’t bad. Most of us don’t talk because we are all focus on the job. It’s not really a job we can sit and chit since we are all running around. I try to be friendly with them but I’m shy and with me learning new things everyday, I’m kinda focus on getting my part on the job done.

I started to notice that the two girls seem to get a little irritated with me. Sometimes they’d snap at me saying I’m down something wrong or when I try to help them they push me aside and tell me to go somewhere else. The other guys are totally fine with me and I don’t have any problems with them. But these girls, they just seemed to not like me at all.

I think it’s because I’m really new and I have to stop and ask questions to know where things are and stuff. I know I’m sometimes slowing them down and I feel really bad so I’m trying hard to make sure I don’t mess up and get things done fast. But since they’ve been acting a little cold to me, it’s been getting to me while on the job. 

I don’t want to be their friends outside of work or anything but I just want to come to work and not come into a bad atmosphere.

Or should I talk to my boss and let them know about it? I just want to work in peace and get my paycheck.

I told my boss that our supervisor said this, and he said “ehhh I don’t like the idea of that on your arm, buuuut I can’t change your mind” then walks out. I understand that I can just do it and there’s essentially nothing he can do but I feel wrong to go against my boss like this but at the same time I feel it’s not fair of him to impose his own opinion on my decisions when he knows it’s out of his control. I know if I just show up with the tattoo I won’t get fired but it will for sure be awkward. Have any of you been in this situation before? How would you go about this? I really do want to finish my sleeve but I feel like I’m just waiting until I’m “allowed” to but that time will never come, im already “allowed” to my boss just doesn’t like it. I’m gonna be in the same job 5 years maybe 10 years from now so I’m considering just doing it and dealing with the awkwardness for a few weeks but idk.",24Nov2020,1
526,"I (19f) am a really dumb mf. I already know that. I'd been with my gf (19f) for over a year, all of 12th grade and the summer that followed basically. I really loved her and wanted to build a future with her, and she said she did too. And I believed her. 

I was born in country A. Spent all of my childhood there until my family moved to country B because of a job offer my parents got. Didn't like it there at all so I moved back to country A for high school, where I lived with my grandma at first and then by myself (this is going to matter later). I was lucky and made some really good friends and was really happy for a while, until I met her.

We got really close all of a sudden and she gave me false hopes and left me in standby for over 8 months, while she dated and had sex with other dudes. Then she did something really stupid that I'm not going to get into (basically flirted with her friend's boyfriend) and everyone in our group of friends started to hate her. Except for me. I was loyal to her for some reason even though we weren't together yet, and I chose to believe her side of the story and try to make my other friends believe it too. She knew I was her only hope of staying in the group so she told me that she loved me and that she wanted us to be together. I accepted. 

I knew she wasn't a good person but I believed I could change her. And I did, to an extent. Things were going great for a while and I really loved her and we said several times that we wanted to build a future together. I initially planned to go to college to country C (a much more developed country than A) with a couple of friends, but she told me she wanted me to stay with her. And I wanted it too. So I accepted and chose to go to college in country A, where she wanted to stay.

She failed her exam and couldn't get into the college she wanted to go to. So her father pulled some strings and got her into a college that was 2 hours away, in a nearby city. We agreed we'd stay together and see each other as often as possible.

2 days after she moved to that other city she told me she had classes and that she'd text me in a few hours. I later found out (she didn't really try to hide it) that she actually went to a guy's house to ""study"". When we met again 2 weeks later (we didn't talk at all during that time, I was really mad at her for lying to me and she never wanted to talk about it) she told me she wanted to break up because a long distance relationship wouldn't work for her. I told her I never wanna see or hear from her ever again, I felt betrayed. I later found out from a mutual friend that her actual reason was that she wanted to ""live her life and see other guys"".

I was devastated. I moved back with my parents in country B because I couldn't bear living alone in country A where there were so many memories of her. Of us. Because of the pandemic I only have online classes, so I won't have to go back to country A anytime soon. But I'm lost. I have no friends here, all my friends are either in country A or C, and I regret staying in A for college instead of going to C, as she was the only reason for it. I thought about quitting and going to C next year but I can't because I haven't taken my Cambridge English Exam yet and I won't be able to anytime soon because of the pandemic. So I'd have to wait 2 years to go where I always wanted to go, basically.

I could stay in country A until I finish college and then move to C for my master's degree, but she's still part of the group of friends I have there (when she comes back from that other town) so I'd have to be part of the same social circle as her and live by myself in an apartment and a city that would always remind me of her and the times we had together. I'd also have to stay at home instead of go out whenever she decides she wants to come back home. I don't think I could ever get over her under these circumstances, especially because as far as I know she already has another boyfriend. Making new friends is hard, mainly because of the pandemic and also because I don't really feel like I have the energy for it right now.

So I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, I either stay in A and accept the fact that getting over her will be a million times harder or stay at home for 2 years doing nothing until I can go to country C where I've always wanted to go, and finish college 2 years later than my friends who are already there. I know I'm the only one who can make this decision but I feel completely lost, like my near future is doomed and I don't know what to do, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR Went to college in the town where my gf was instead of going where I always wanted to go, and now she left me and I feel completely lost and don't know what to do next or how to build my future.",24Nov2020,1

531,"Basically I got discontinued from my course because I failed 3 modules out of 7. The ones I did pass I got 70%+. The problem with me was my anxiety and I was just overwhelmed. My fault I kept it bottled never told anyone just struggled in silence. Then I ended up having physical symptoms as well like keep needing to go the toilet, loss of appetite, feeling sick etc. 
In September I was waiting for timetable they said they messed it up so they’re hoping to send another one. They never did but I checked my email and they said they discontinued me from the course with immediate effect. After that they locked me out of everything like my student email other student stuff etc. I was mess then contacted student union advisor, who suggested I apply for a late mitigation. I never heard back from the uni formally saying they have accepted my late mitigation however, the advisor said they have accepted my mitigation and to contact my course leader. I did the course leader said she couldn’t do anything until she gets a formal reply saying I’ve been accepted. Anyway long story short she got back to me last Friday and I said I contact the 3 module leaders that I failed in so I can submit by the 18th. Less than a month to do it. I spent the last two days crying and being a mess now I’ve calmed down. But I’m having second thoughts whether I should go back if it’s worth it. I’ve talked to some friends and my parents half suggested I stay in uni the others said drop out.

535,"A few months ago, me and my SO were taking a break and I didn't know if we were going to get back together. Because of this I was trying to take control of my life and put myself out there. I've wanted to do boxing for a while now, and I was incredibly lucky to come across the only place in town with a ring. I was surprised by the lack of paperwork or registration, especially since I'm under 18, but I just started showing up. 

It's been a very good experience for me and my confidence has gone through the roof. I am visibly muscular and I've never had that before. I'm starting to form a good relationship with my coach and I know all my teammates. I'm the only 16 year old girl among 30s men and I've been accepted as one of them. I'm learning a lot and I love that I'm able to defend myself.

However, there is a downside to this. Part of the reason the experience of it is so magical is that it's like for an hour and a half covid doesn't exist. Usually only a few people show up at a time but we rotate between 20ish people throughout the week. None of us wear masks (imagine trying to breathe!) And obviously we get close to one another. 

My SO and I recently got back together and they and several of their family members are immunocompromised. I will admit that the whole experience is slightly shady, with the lack of paperwork and social distancing and all, but I've sort of pushed that to the back of my mind. Now that I'm back in contact with my SO and covid is spreading more rapidly, the risk vs. reward factor has shifted. I dont want to get them sick, but joining boxing has been one of the best decisions of my life! If I quit I'll lose so much that has greatly enriched my life.

Its possible that I'm just being immature and selfish and I know what I have to do. But the gyms are open! I'm not sure if this is any different. but I do know that if one person happened to have covid everyone in that gym would definitely contract it. Covid has taken so much from everyone. Maybe it's my turn to lose something I love. Thoughts?",24Nov2020,1

541,"I need advice on how to get over something that I have no control over. Also just an outlet because I can't talk about this with the people in my life. Thanks, whoever takes the time to read this. 

My older sister and my mother have always been fighting but it reached an irreversible point this week. My country is still under quarantine because of poor governing and the virus is still a very big issue here. Two aunts tested positive so my sister was telling my mom to be more careful about going out because my mom keeps spending time with her friends without masks, commuting (which my father forbid; he told us to use the cars if we need to go somewhere), and is just overall not very careful. 

My mom then retorted with ""What about your aunts?? They tested positive even though they were careful. None of my friends have the virus."" And my sister asked her which of her friends have been tested. Whenever my mom loses an argument or gets caught in a lie, she tends to start screaming and throwing random arguments. Usually, my sister can handle it, but I think she had enough and told my mom she wished she had another mom. She even said ""Why don't you go live in your friends' house?""

My mom got really mad and said ""How about you? You're already married!"" (We live in a country where its normal to stay in your parents' place even after you graduated and my sister stays here every other week because her apartment with her husband is still being rennovated) and this hurt my sister so much that she started to cry. 

Neither of them apologized to each other and now they're both pretending the other doesn't exist. 

My problem is that I feel incredibly heartbroken over their relationship and I don't know why. I keep praying for them to make up but maybe this is for the best. However, the center of my life is my family and knowing that my sister and my mother probably hate each other pulls me into despair more and more. 

I love my sister more than anything, so I'm afraid of her not coming back home because of this and although my mom isn't the best and has a lot of faults, I still love her. I wish they would stop hurting each other but they won't so if this is for their healing, I would gladly deal with it. 

But I don't know how to cope with it. I get teary eyed just by thinking of it. Please give me advice on how to move past something that you have to deal with everyday.

i'm trying but i cant. my teens weren't the best. my parents restricted me, so i couldn't go out home except for school or somewhere they wanted me to go (with them). i had to deal with the fact people from school were going out and having fun while all i had was anime and videogames. they would go out and have fun during the day and also at night, then go post about it on social media. i couldn't. i had to stay home and play videogames, because there was nothing else left to do.

&amp;#x200B;

they would get their first kiss, first girlfriend, most of them were having sex also. i had none of that. not only because i couldn't go out, but also because my personality didn't match everyone else's back then, so everyone would just avoid making any unnecessary contact with me. the people who talked to me were the people in my same situation, nerds who watched anime and played games. i've been bullied of course, but won't include it because everyone's been bullied before and it's not the point. 

&amp;#x200B;

the thing that makes me angry the most is that i did not have the same opportunities as everyone else. going out, getting a girlfriend, kissing on the lips, having sex, everyone had their first time doing those things at 14-15 meanwhile i could only have those much later, due to my circumstances as a teenager. even after reaching 18 i took a few years to get my first girl and have my first sex because i had to ""learn"" how to get those from zero since everyone learned that at 14-15 and i could only start learning it at 18. now everytime someone mentions they had girlfriends, kisses and a sex life before the age i started having those, i get angry. i don't let it show, but i get furious inside. i feel like destroying things. even when it's a stranger i get mad a little. now there's this girl i like and she likes me back, we've been dating and recently been thinking about finally being boyfriend and girlfriend. i think she's perfect and she says i am too, but she's 18 and i'm 22. and yeah, she had plenty of dates, kisses and even sex before 18. so yeah i get extremely angry and frustrated by that. i go home and take it out on the punching bag, but i don't believe that's a definitive solution. i can't even blame myself because it was not my fault my teens were like that, so all there's left for me is to be angry and pissed 24 hours a day. i mean everytime i look at my girl or someone else i know, i can't help but think they had so much stuff in their teens and i didn't. i was the geek whose parents didn't allow outside home, unmatching personality with the rest of the school so no friends other than other geeks, virgin and kissless until after 18.",24Nov2020,1

Not only is his girlfriend extremely problematic, he is just the same. He was on the run for multiple DUIs and eventually got caught while he was with my sister, who rented a truck out in her name for him.

He went to jail for a few months and she wrote him letters and sent inappropriate pictures. He was also writing his ex too, of course, and there was so much drama.

Then, he went to rehab and came back to stay with us for a while. This is when he left our house to have sex with his ex girlfriend, got herpes, came back the next day and gave it to my sister.

557,"I gave my last exams in Nov 2019 and was set to attend my convocation in April 2020. Unless you've been living under a rock (or America) the COVID-19 situations forced my country to go into lockdown mid March and the ceremony was canceled/postponed. We had the option of going through a virtual zoom ceremony, but I was hoping to attend the ceremony so I postponed for the next round (Nov 2020). So much so that I bought my entire outfit with my mom back in my country (I'm a foreigner in my university) hoping to represent both my country and my family's pride in my achievement. I'm also the first person in my family to achieve a bachelor's degree. 
Cases in my country were almost down to zero around August till a sudden cluster chain caused the country to go back into lockdown in September for the foreseeable future.
Yet again I was given the option of choosing a physical graduation at a later date or just go for a virtual graduation. This time I chose virtual because I wanted to get this over with. Because if I continue to postpone for a real life ceremony, my certificate will be withheld til this unknown date.
Today I received my virtual certificate in the email, and I can't stop crying because I have grinded through 4 years of university, gotten into severe depressive episodes and pulled myself out, worked so hard, only to get a pdf to show for it (although my physical certificate is en route). 
I know that not having a physical ceremony doesn't take away from my achievement but I can't convince myself of that. I was unable to attend my high school graduation because my dad had to move for his job right after my finals, and I was looking forward to this so so much. 
I'm crying as I write this, but I can't explain why it is affecting me so much. I don't know what kind of advice I need or want, but if you have any, please tell me.

Around 2 am my dad and her briefly spoke on the phone. She said she was going to pick him up from work around 6 am.
6 am comes around and she does not show up or answer the phone. 
It is now 10 by me and she hasn’t answered the phone.

She clearly changed out of her bed clothes into something else because they were left on the floor. She took everything with her like keys, purse, phone, jacket, car etc. I really do not know what to do. She is bi polar depressive and I’m starting to get worried. Our home life isn’t the best right now (dad is on drugs). It is possible she left to go hang out with someone, but she would at the bare minimum tell me she is leaving for a couple hours/days. To not say anything at all is strange and unlike her.

I called police departments and hospitals. She was not involved in any accidents or injury. I’m going to file a missing persons report. What else can I do?

559,"I (21 F) am a junior in college and a CS major. I am currently failing two out of three courses this semester, and my GPA is plummeting (currently 2.99 and bound to drop even more after this semester). I have finally lost all motivation for my major and don’t know what I am really passionate about. I struggle to find joy in anything. If I do, it’s so fleeting and temporary.

My parents and two older sisters have been counting on me from a young age to be the smart, young, and successful one. I guess I’m like that gifted child meme since I peaked in elementary, middle, and partially high school. They all expected me to go into a STEM field because I was pretty good at and interested in math and science subjects. When asked about what career I was thinking of pursuing around the time of elementary school, I said a bunch of things because I wasn’t really sure. I switched from aerospace engineering to becoming an astronaut and a bunch of other stuff. However, the first time I remember being pretty decided on a career was in the beginning of middle school. I told my parents I wanted to study marine biology. It shouldn’t have been a surprise to be honest since my dad always had on Animal Planet, National Geographic, Steve Irwin, etc. I would sit down and watch those shows nearly every day after I came home from elementary school. Boy did my mom shoot that idea down so fast. She started saying there is no money in that and why would I want to study that.

Fast forward to high school. I went to a high school that was also a vocational school for adults. In addition to regular high school classes in your last two years, you would be in a vocational program with adults. I started expressing an interest in a television and film production program because at this point in time, I was interested in all things filmmaking. The program offered courses and experience in set design, tele-prompting, lighting, sound production, technical directing, and script writing. I also was considering a cyber security and networking program. Of course my family shot down all thoughts of the TV and film production program. I went the networking and cyber security route and did fairly well in it and came out with a certification. I even enjoyed some of it, but there was always the thought in the back of my head saying I’m not sure if this is what I really want to do though. My family was beyond pleased with this program and thought about how successful and “rich” I would be if I continued down this career path after college. I would try to jokingly bring up other career paths that weren’t STEM related, and every single time my family would reject them saying I have to think about the money. I just want to say that I completely get where they were coming from even though it hurt and was not what I wanted to hear. They only wanted the best for me and wanted me to follow a career path with a good job outlook and decent pay. With time running out in high school and college nearing, I decided to just do the thing that would please everyone and apply to colleges with a focus on a CS degree. I faked and smiled through my senior year pretending to be interested in computer science and and STEM colleges. I was accepted into a STEM focused school that was my first choice and decided to go there.

Fast forward to freshman year of college. It was alright, but we didn’t really get into much CS stuff until intro to programming in the second semester. The class itself was fine, but I had never felt so discouraged and disheartened about pursuing something. Most people in the class were already proficient in programming, knew multiple languages, and had projects on GitHub. I had absolutely no experience in programming. I felt like an imposter, mostly because I was. I was feigning interest in this major all for my family. I did enjoy learning programming, and it might have even become a hobby; however, I didn’t think I wanted to make a career out of it. It only got worse sophomore year. I struggled to get out of bed to drive and attend class. I stopped doing a lot of assignments and started doing poorly on exams.

I am going to interrupt here with some background info on my family and living situation. My mom and dad came to the US for a better life for their three daughters. We have always struggled financially as my mom and dad worked multiple shitty jobs to support us. My dad had a stroke over a decade ago and could no longer work or drive, so my mom was the breadwinner now. She has busted her ass for us, and that has taken its toll on her physical and mental health. My sisters have both graduated college and have successful careers, but both are crippled by their student debt. They have only now, since about 2-3 years now, started to get their careers off the ground. When it was time for me to go to college, I was originally planning to stay in the dorms. That summer before I started college, my mom had just quit her job. She had enough of the hard labor for crappy pay. It was decided that we would move to the town where my college was and rent a house, but it would be hard to pay for ourselves. At the same time, my oldest sister was job hunting with her new doctoral degree while her husband was struggling to find a job of his own, and they had two kids to support. It was decided that ALL of us were going to move to the town where my college was and rent a house because no one was having luck finding any jobs where we were all living already. This loud, cramped living situation coupled with my loss of motivation was maddening to say the least, but I know it was tough for all of us. My mom was unemployed and struggling to find a job, my sister still had no luck, and it was decided that her husband would stay with the kids until they were of age to go to school. Eventually, my sister, her husband, and kids decided to move out and rent a house of their own now. This is all during freshman year. Coming towards the end of freshman year, my leftover financial aid is barely enough to cover our expenses for rent and bills. My mom isn’t working, and I was looking for a job. I couldn’t break it to my parents that I was already struggling with motivation for school and my grades were slipping, so how could I focus with a job on top of that. My sister finally gets a job, and once again, for financial reasons, we decide to all move together in one house and rent. This time, we had to find a place to move that would be sort of between my college and my sister’s new job. Where we moved, it was about a half hour drive for my sister’s work and an hour and a half drive for me. We moved right before I started my sophomore year. Things really started to come apart here for me. I was already struggling during the second semester of freshman year to get out of bed and drive to class when it was only about 25 minutes away, but now for sophomore year with this hour and a half drive it was near impossible. I lied to everyone about my schedule and only attended class about half the time. The cramped living situation was even worse this time around. I wasn’t sleeping, I was worried about failing, I was looking for other options outside college while lying to everyone when they asked how I was doing in school. My mom finally got a job for a couple months but had to quit because of an injury. I could see she and my dad had had enough of this living situation. They also felt like they were invading my sister and her husband’s space, so they decided to move back down to our hometown. This was the end of sophomore year. My mom got a job and was renting a place for her and my dad. I had to make a decision. It was either stay with my sister and her husband and rot away in my room struggling to attend classes or put myself in expense and get a job to live in the dorms or move back with my parents and transfer to another university. I decided on the latter. Then, COVID-19 was now beginning. I transferred to a university in my hometown (still majoring in CS) but took remote learning classes for the sake of my parents as to not bring the virus home. Now this is where I am today. Junior year. Failing two out of three classes.

I spent almost the entire fall semester weeping struggling to get out of bed and at my desk for online classes. I weep because I am exhausted, because I have no motivation, because I don’t have any passions or ambitions, because I don’t know who I am, because I am lying straight to my family’s faces, because I am a disappointment. I am so close to finishing this degree, but I don’t have it in me to continue. Even if I do finish it, I don’t have the skills, determination, or experience to get a job in the field. I can’t even bear to think what my mother would say if I told her any of this. I once joked about dropping out and finding a job doing something else or learning a trade and she actually cried saying how everyone in this family is depending on you to be the one to get a high-paying job straight out of college. I should mention now that my parents, specifically my mom, ask only one thing of me now. She only wants a small house for her, my dad, and me of course. After that, I can do as I please. That is all she wants at this point. A house, something she and my dad have never owned since coming to the US 20 years ago. My sisters have been generous and have helped us as much as they could with things like phone bills, but they have debt of their own and their own lives now. My mom has made it very clear that I am their last hope. Don’t get me wrong, I want so badly to help my parents and buy them the house they never had. However, I feel lost, numb, and hollow. I don’t know how I can continue lying and faking through this degree, but I don’t want to disappoint my family. Even if I decide to drop out, I would still be lost. More importantly, my mom would be devastated. I don’t know what to do. I have contemplated suicide a few times throughout high school and now, but my fear of death and the nothingness of the afterlife stopped me in my tracks. But I also feel nothing anymore. I have told no one this as I have no one to tell it to. For the past week, I have found that I no longer weep. I am so numb I can’t cry anymore. Some days, the only thing that gives me hope is the thought of finding a girl, someone to love and spend the rest of my life with, as corny as that sounds. But then I wonder if I would truly be happy then or still feel empty. I find myself trying to sit down for an assignment then hours will pass because I was lost in a daydream where I and my imaginary wife grew old together. I used to daydream often when I was younger, but it is becoming frightening how much more time I lose and how easily I slip into these figments of my imagination now.

I can’t help but also feel a little betrayed. My sisters, I love them and know they helped as much as they could while living their own lives, but they were allowed to make mistakes and switch majors and be unsure. They were given time to find themselves and their footing. My mother even paid for a large chunk of their college expenses while I am depending on scholarships and other financial aid while also using that money to pay my mother’s bills. I feel as if I was on a strict schedule and given no room for error. I wish I would have had the confidence to tell my family how I really felt before diving headfirst into college like they wanted me to. I did try to slip how I felt into small conversation, but it was the same hostile reaction every time. I think to myself sometimes that I would be perfectly okay with working a warehouse job and budgeting or something until I find myself and figure out a better career path for me. If it weren’t for my family’s expectations and parents’ need for financial help, I wouldn’t have gone straight into college. I am my parents’ last hope for happiness. It’s simple: graduate, get a job immediately out of college and start making bank right away, then buy a house and live happily ever after.

Should I try to finish the degree then find another career? Should I try to continue down this career path? Should I tell my parents anything? Should I drop out and look for other options and risk killing my mother’s hopes and dreams?

Sorry if I was too dramatic, but I am walking on a thin line right now. The crushing weight of everyone’s expectations is too much to bear right now. I am so close to giving up. Any help would be appreciated.",24Nov2020,1
560,"Maybe this belongs in a certain sick subreddit, but I needed advice on it. 

USA college student here. Every major health administration is begging people not to travel for Thanksgiving, but our college is closing up and going virtual after Thanksgiving, forcing students out unless they can get an exemption. I live in the same state as my folks and will be driving to get to them, not flying, and need to grab medication refills while I'm down there (shipping them is very expensive and risky). I was tested and have been isolated since then, and the rest of my family is watching their ps and qs as much as possible. It's a small gathering (6 people max), we're hoping to space out when we eat, and I'm the one traveling the furthest-- everyone else is locally based. 

I feel like we've taken what precautions we can, and I need to at least get the medication and things, but I also want to follow the recommendations and not make our situation worse. I'm not sure what to do. It feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Between needing to grab stuff, my college trying to get everyone out of town, and following health recommendations...

561,"I’ll preface this by saying that I have a degree in languages. 
I’ll admit that I’d rather be a doctor. Medicine is such a varied and challenging field, and I love the idea of dedicating my life to healing people. However, med school is really expensive, and I’m already 21 years old, which means I’ll be plunging myself into debt during my twenties. The 20s for most people is a period in life where they don’t really have to worry about money and have the freedom to travel and live comfortably and freely. I’m willing to give this up for medicine, in my opinion it’s worthwhile, but I know it’s going to be really difficult. 
Now, I could also be a speech pathologist. This is a much cheaper option and will only take two years. It’s guaranteed good pay, as much as a doctor if not more. I’m sure the work will be relatively rewarding but I don’t think I’m as interested in speech pathology as I am in medicine. I guess I don’t know enough about what the work of a speech pathologist entails. My mother would rather I be a speech pathologist because it’s an easier path and she doesn’t want me to struggle.

563,"There is this is one boy that everyone in my school say that we look similar and they keep calling us twin.Thanks to this, things become really awkward between us even though we never knew and talk to each other. But then, I found out that my friend likes him, which I was shocked since she didin’t say anything when me and that boy were being mentioned. At first, I didn’t care about who she likes and it is normal to have a crush, right? Then, everyone keep telling that we have the same face even our behaviour is quite similar. It is not just that, my friend, who likes that boy is one of my closest best friend, so we always go anywhere together and people always jokes with her ‘Didn’t you feel strange to have a crush on someone who looks similar to your best friend?’ and she denied that I didn’t even look like him. Even though they ask it as a joke, but for me, its not.  At that time, I started to be awkward, being similar with her crush, but I believe, she didn’t see me as him as she said we have totally different face. Often she was asked for the same question and she will answer with the same answer ‘They are totally different’ ‘I wouldn’t imagine her as him’. 

But at this one time, I was eating with her and she sit in front of me. I noticed how she always glanced at me, and to be honest I am uncomfortable. Suddenly, she said to me, ‘You know what, whenever we eat together, I always feel like I am eating with him(his crush)’ and at that time... I just felt very uncomfortable as I am now confirmed that she sometimes sees me as him and I dislike it. So, because of that, I started become awkward with her and I avoid eye contact with her. And after that time, she always saying how I am very similar with him, the way we smile walk and everything. Because of this, I unconsciously avoid her and we are not close as we used to, but we still close as a best friend but not that close. That uneasiness feeling is still there whenever I’m with her. I know that she doesn’t mean anything with what she said, but that words to me shows that she sees me as him sometimes and that scared me. 

Is it relevant for me to feel like this or am I just overreacting? It sometimes become really awkward when it’s just us two as I didn’t talk as much as I used to. So... I don’t know what to do. Is it relevant to feel this way??",24Nov2020,1

so my s/o wants to break up
the reason is so fking shtty and im losing my mind

she keeps repeating its her fault and it shouldnt have went this way, shes doubting her love for me, says i should find someone better, just reads my messages rn.

shes going through a lot and i sort of understand. no i dont. its just so messy... im losing my sanity too, my depression has gotten worse. shes the first one i liked in my whole life, we had dreams and stuff, she promised shed be always there for me yet she never was, she said shed never break up.

i told her a dozen of times that i love her and im going to stay and support her, she just doesnt answer.

im starting to doubt her too. maybe its just a way to say ""hey im bored and i dont want you to feel bad so feel bad for me"". maybe shes just trying to get out of the relationship.

i keep telling her i love her but it just goes wrong

""i dont wanna hurt you, just go away""

how can someone be so stupid? you are hurting me right now and i dont know whether youre serious or not. it hurts. especially your words how i would forget you easily, how i havent helped you at all, shes just gone and its bringing me down too.

shes like literally about to break up with me and all is she doing is repeating noone loves her.

570,"For some background, my lovely bio father jetted when my mother was pregnant with me. I was a teenage oops baby, and when he found out that she was pregnant it was the clsssic “that’s not my baby” kind of deal. As far as I know, he might have come to the hospital to look at me when I was born and after over 30 years that has been the limit of our contact. No child support, letters or meetings of any kind. This bothered me quite a bit as a child, but as I grew up it became less of an issue.


Things have changed a bit for our family recently. We’ve found out that my maternal grandfather might have a type of cancer that is genetic. There is actually a lot of cancer on my mom’s side of the family, so my odds in the future don’t look all that great. Not knowing anything about my bio father outside of the name has me a bit concerned. While I don’t know if I ever want any kind of relationship with him, I feel like I have the right to know about any medical issues on his side of the family. Knowing if there’s a genetic risk on his side for certain things will help me prevent and prepare as I get older, yknow? Also, as I cross closer to midlife, he gets older too, and my window for ever making any kind of contact slowly closes as he could die from age or illness.


I have nobody in my life with any similar experiences, so I wanted to look towards strangers to see if anyone has any advice on finding a father when all you have is the name. How did that go? Does it cost a lot of money? Is it really a door I should leave closed? What agencies should I contact? He’s not on my birth certificate, but my mother guarantees that he’s the only person that could be my father. I don’t know anything outside of the name.

Censored the title because I don't know if I'm ok to use that word.
I'm the survivor of repeated r*pes over the space of two years as well as being assaulted throughout my childhood. It's caused me a lot of physical and emotional damage that I've only recently started getting treatment for. I've gotten to the point that I can build up the trust and comfort to be physically intimate with somebody but if I can't build up that comfort I get completely triggered and can't function for a couple of weeks.
Due to my age and a few recent health issues, I'll have to attend my first gynecological exam tomorrow afternoon. I've avoided it up until this point because the idea horrifies me and triggers a panic attack. I've tried to calm myself down and get myself ready since the appointment was booked but I feel no better. I've been told that because of Covid I can't bring anyone to the appointment and that I'll have a limited time for the exam. My partner and a friend who's staying with us are both aware of my issues and my appointment. They've promised to look after me from the second I leave the hospital but it doesn't make me feel any better.
I'm sure most gynecologists have some level of training with r*pe victims so how do I tell them and does anyone have any advice on how to cope tomorrow. Anything is appreciated.",24Nov2020,1

Last night I noticed that he on unadded me on Snapchat bc I was on his subscriptions and although I know it was just a hook up my ego is a little bruised because this has never happened to me. I feel so confused because he had me added for months w/o any sexual convos and I was even on his little private story and when we did hu we were talking, he gave me his favorite wine and it just seemed normal!! I just wanted to know if anyone could offer some perspective as to why this happend to me, was I not as good as I thought ? Could anyone give me advice on how not let it make me question myself so bad :(",24Nov2020,1
582,"Just about every day, my stepmom is always yelling at me, or my brother. We just take turns getting yelled at pretty much. And it's for bullshit reasons and today, it was my turn. This time, it was because ""I didn't get enough sleep, so I'm cranky"" or some 5-year-old bullshit. I'm 15 and either get treated like I'm 5, or get bitched at. Sometimes both. Everything I've tried to do, it gets worse. I've tried saying ""I'm sorry"". I've tried saying ""It won't happen again"". I've tried crying in the corner. But everything I do makes it worse. How? She calls me a fucking lier. She rarely lets me try to explain and when she does, she still calls me a lier. Another thing she does, is assume bullshit that's not true and has no proof. One time I was cleaning out one of our cat's litter box, and she said I didn't clean it out the next day after I did. Even when I do have evidence that I didn't do anything wrong, she pulls a ""Are you calling me a lier?"" on me. And if my dad is around, she'll say something like ""HAHA! What's with the sudden change in attitude?"" when I've been acting the same as before he was around. She assumes things way too much and it's really been annoying the shit out of me, lately. This has been going in for years. She won't ever let me explain my case. She always gets mad over stupid shit. She's also very hypocritical. She talks shit about how lazy me and my generation is, or whatever untrue bullshit she can think of, and calls me out for touching my phone for 5 seconds and playing video games for 10 minutes, when she's always watching TV all day. I'm also homeschooled and if I get something wrong, which is mainly Social Studies, she gets overly pissed, like she expects me to be a historian. She talks so much shit about me. She talked about how she would be happy if I were sent to military school. Me and my brother take turns getting yelled at by her. Sometimes a few weeks for one of us. Sometimes a month for one of us. We both have this problem and I don't know what to do. If someone could give me advice, I would GREATLY appreciate it. Thank you.",24Nov2020,1

585,"The other day I was on a phone call with customer service trying to solve an important and sensitive issue but the customer rep that was helping me had a very heavy Indian accent and I couldn’t understand half of what he was saying. Because I didn’t want any miscommunication I asked for an English speaking service rep and he transferred me to a native English woman. Near the end of the call the woman told me I was being insensitive and borderline racist because I asked for someone who speaks clear English. Was I being an asshole or was I justified?

So I want to avoid getting too complicated, but I (20 m) and my house mate (23 f) obviously live together with 2 others. My house mate (23 f) is going away with her boy friend for a month, maybe 1.5 months and has seen my best friend publicly posting that she is looking for a place to stay. My house mate (23 f) has now gotten into contact with my best friend and asked if she wanted to take the room for that 1 month, they have been organising this with out telling me at all. Fast forward to now and my best friend is moving in, my house mate calls me to her room and ‘runs it by me’ before it’s all final. I was really put on the spot and didn’t really know how to say no. I am weird about my space and I need my own time to get away and relax. I now have just gotten a text from my best friend saying ‘ROOMIES’ and it’s just hit me. This won’t fit my life and the dynamic here, but I am so afraid of being an asshole and ruining everything they have planned and my best friend thinking it’s something to do with her when it’s a me problem. I just wish I wasn’t sucked into this, and wish more respect was given to me and run by me BEFORE my housemate ever got into contact with my best friend just to be sure I was okay with it. My house mate says she cannot afford to pay rent while she isn’t living here (on holiday) and that this would help her so much- (her boyfriend is paying for the whole trip they’re going on...) How do I put this back on them and take the spot light off me, HELP! And thank you &lt;3",24Nov2020,1
587,"So, my partner (24m) and I (24f) live with his little sister (K,19f). On xmas day we and his other siblings will be going to my parents house (If COVID restrictions allow). My dad is an alcoholic. 

His other siblings are older and less sheltered than K. K is extremely sheltered and very young for her age. Her parents don’t drink at all and she has never been around alcohol and views it as bad, scary etc. She’s a Christian as is very straight edge. She’s a very sweet girl, but she is like a much younger teen- think 13/14 and easily spooked. His other siblings have been around my dad before and have obviously noticed that he’s drunk- but they are ok with it and kind of laugh it off. They find it not a big deal, as he is always happy/ friendly towards them. They also drink themselves- but a normal amount. 

I am really worried about K being completely horrified by my family, particularly my dad. There is no way to stop him drinking, or make him drink less, so that’s not an option. My mum and other guests will likely also be drunk as it’s xmas day, but they are not alcoholics. 

I’m really embarrassed and I don’t want to traumatise her or think my family is like the cast of Shameless \*facepalm\*. Thank God their parents will not be there- so that’s one blessing. 

I’m also hoping she doesn’t tell her parents about the state of my dad. Our parents have met before, but always during the day time. My dad is pretty high functioning, so if you catch him before 4pm he is usually not drunk. We rarely see his parents, so usually this is not an issue.

I have an anxiety disorder and I can’t stop thinking about xmas this year. It’s also going to be a problem for future events. We are planning on getting married, but the thought of my dad and his parents together, at any evening event, makes me want to throw up with worry.

But obviously, I love my family and want to spend xmas with them… Any suggestions to survive this ordeal without being completely mortified would be so helpful. Thank you!",24Nov2020,1

592,Okay so My friends have said that I may have social anxiety I’m still not sure about it because I can talk just fine with some people but I’ve started hanging out with new people and it’s like I’m not even there I want to start a conversation with this new friend group but I’m kinda outside of everything and I’m not able to find the right chance to talk because everyone else is having an ongoing conversation with each other and I don’t want to interrupt and be rude but I’m just so distant making it difficult to talk I have written down these feelings before but I figured expressing myself here might be more helpful than keeping them to myself.

594,"I was seeing a guy for a few months, intimate, good connection. I really liked him. We stopped speaking for over a year. I still really liked him. My bestfriend knew. I told her how I still always would think about him and that I care about him. He added me on social Media and was interacting with my posts, my selfies, but we never spoke. I was excited bc I knew eventually we would speak again but I didn’t want to make the first move. So I came up with this idea to goto the bar around his 21st birthday and “bump” into him. I decided not to do it. 
Around this time, my friend just kinda falls off with me, first acting distant then one day just blocks me from social media. Like ghost. So I had this intuitive feeling that it was something to do about him. Idk why (my gut instinct is very sharp). I noticed he deleted me so I got on my fake Facebook (FBI status here 😈) and noticed they were friends on Facebook!!! I was hurt but so confused. They’d never met before that. Then she started running around telling mutual friends that I had slept with her ex boyfriend/baby daddy, I instantly knew that this was a lie and she was saying this to make herself feel better about what she was doing. There was a few times she texted me accusing me of that and vandalizing her new property but I never knew where she even lived. Saying I was texting her off fake numbers. 
Then one day I noticed it said they were in a relationship on Facebook so I texted her a few days after just letting her know that I didn’t want any drama, I was happy for them. I’ve always been nice and understanding.I wasn’t asking to be her friend I was just wanted peace and I wanted him to know to that I am not the type of person she made me out to be. I was still HURT. 
Well about a week after that. She texted me and she wanted to hang out and I did, because I am stupid I guess and give people more chances than they deserve. We hung out once a week, she’s always talking about how she wasn’t that attracted to him. How she had to be real drunk to have sex with him. How she met him at THAT BAR we had a plan at. She said she didn’t even realize who he was at first. Who knows. She says he’s in love with her and he thinks they are soul mates. She cheated on him with her ex boyfriend(baby daddy) who’s she’s still in love with. She also realty even told him she cheated and he’s still with her. 
Ok, now they’re living together. 
So two weekends ago she wants me to come drink and hangout, we’ve talked about how we’d like it to not be awkward but I was telling her how I just wasn’t sure about it. But I was just like, ok, fuck it. So we all drank, then she goes literally drunk psycho bc he won’t give her molly (she wanted to do molly w me AND him) screaming around, throwing stuff, being ABUSIVE to him and me. Telling him he’s a pieces of shit and just like her cheating/abusive ex. I was standing up for him, but in a way beneficial to her. I remember yelling something about how he loves her and he’s nothing like her ex and he said something like “even your friend is telling you!” Just nuts. There was a point she had him like pinned on the recliner and was in his face calling him a piece of shit and like slapping him alittle. I felt fucking terrible for him and helpless bc I wanted to help but there are boundaries I’m scared she’s just “testing” me or him. I remember thinking “he probably doesn’t WANT to do molly with both of us” awkward right? I didn’t even want to do molly. I was drunk and why would I want to do molly w my ex and his gf 😭 

Listen, I care about this girl as a person but it’s been draining. I realize after this I AM stilll attracted to him a lot, and I do still have feelings. Idk if she’s trying to set us up for failure and see if anyone tries anything. She’s mentioned how she wishes he’d cheat or leave or find someone else. She said how he was looking me up on IG and had a message typed out to me that said “Don’t tell [her name] ..” but it hasn’t been finished like he was “going to send it.” but I feel like its a lie. She’s testing me. She asked me to make a fake Facebook to see if he’d try anything (which I refuse to do now, but I did do this with her ex/baby daddy and it was successful but we already knew he was a cheater and liar.) she obviously has PTSD or something from her last relationship but I seriously don’t know what to think. 

We’ve hung out since and everything was kinda OK but he did get upset with her a few times. Idfk. It’s draining in every way. Emotionally, mentally, physically. When I care about people, I CARE, and it takes a long to for me to not care. I pretty much avoid him and don’t talk to him but we’ve spoken a few words to eachother. I don’t cross boundaries. But I kinda fucking want to now but THATS not me. I’d never go do this so my bestfriend.

597,"My boyfriend and I had a hiccup in personal health.  I had a bump on my vagina and was scared that it was herpes. We had unprotected sex and I ended up paying for the plan b pill, paid for him a lyft to me and when we were on our way to the clinic, small things happened that tipped him. 

•Boss held back money so he couldn’t get my plan b
•boss held him longer after work and he was tired
•he hates traveling in the cold
•bus driver wouldn’t accept his rusted quarter so he had to burrow money from another passenger. 
•clinic told him he had to go somewhere else if he couldn’t pay then and there

He then wanted to go home, and did... I respected his decision and called him when he got home. We ended up talking and I sent him another lyft to come back to me even though I barely had the money. 

Next day, it was rough for me because I was thinking about past people who’ve violated me and could’ve given me herpes. Then I had him telling me he’d rather go to my house than me go to his because he isn’t comfortable at his house... ive never seen his house, were always at mines so I was pretty annoyed. Got some good news from the doctors so far but they gave me meds that made me nauseous so when he got to my house I didn’t talk much.

He was upset, so I told him my stomach was hurting. After a while, my mom(have a bad relationship with) texted me something bad and it reminded me of being sexually assaulted and how she contributed to it. I tried to vent to him, he interrupts me so I told him I was annoyed that he did that and sat silent. He asked if I wanted to go but I told him no, I’d rather sit there. After about an hour, I go to the bathroom, come back and he’s up and dressed and ready to leave. 
He asks if I wanted to talk again and that my silence made him uncomfortable to the point he didn’t want to stay. I told him I just wanted to lay there with him and I didn’t feel comfortable talking about it because he kinda ruined that space the first time...
He gets upset... he leaves..
I text him and tell him to lose my number, he comes back, we argue again. He tells me how a past relationship, a girl never talked to him at all and it ended up bad. I told him he’s pinning his past relationship on me and it’s invalid because I always talk about how I feel but it’s just this one time when I don’t and I just want to relax. He gets mad. I cry. He does nothing. I tell him to just lay down, he finally complies. I tell him how I was sexually assaulted and how it’s extremely uncomfortable to talk about because I’ve been abandoned by my entire family for bringing that stuff up and it made me homeless for two years . He says he understands and that it shouldn’t have happened to me. I asked him if he was still mad at me now that I’ve explained why I just wanted to sit there. He says yes

I tell him to leave. He should’ve never made a victim talk about that stuff and it’s not ok. He refuse to believe he’s wrong. He leaves, we call and text and argue. I tell him he needs therapy. He tells me I’m disrespectful for saying that. I tell him that he’s miserable and he lets everything around him tip him off to no return. He says it’s extremely hurtful and he needs time.

I've been overwhelmed by the amount of homework I've been given and how my classes alone fill up 3 of my days per week. I did not choose them well. What's more, I'm having trouble fitting my new classes in a way that doesn't let this happen again

I have autism and I don't have any friends. I've always kind of kept to myself, you know? My goal for college was to try to change that. So far, I've had little success. So I've been trying to reach out to people who's contact information I have. I started trying to invite people to play video games with me. No success so far

I started a art Twitter account back in March. I already have 120 followers, but none of them ever respond to my posts. Ever. It's been kind of discouraging me from even drawing at all

I just found out that my uncle has tried every treatment for his pancreatic cancer with little success. He's now trying some of the experimental stuff. I've never really seen my uncle that much in my life at all. Only a few times when I was a kid. I did visit him once in January but so far that's been it. I want to spend a bit more time with him to make up for lost time but he lives all the way in California (I live in Illinois) and I still have to try to manage myself

Overall, I've been feeling completely overwhelmed and it's been affecting my ability to do..........anything. I feel no motivation to do anything.

603,"I’m a 28f. I honestly do have a baby-face and regularly get comments that people mistake me for a teenager. I’ve dealt with it my whole life, but usually when people learn my real age, they move past the youthful face. I have a Ph. D. in my area, as well, so people tend to focus on my expertise, not my age.


So, about 5 months ago I moved cross-country for a position near my home town. It’s a great job that pays well for the area and that I’m qualified (honestly, over qualified) for. I like the work and enjoy my new workplace.

However, I have a coworker who shares some team responsibilities with me, and she keeps commenting on my age. She’s older than me, and she does have a lot of professional experience, but not specifically in the project we work on together (which is my expertise). At first I figured it was because of my baby face, but it’s now moved to comments about my naïveté and lack of experience (which... just isn’t true, I have a full decade of experience in our field, more than most of my coworkers). 

Comments like:
“How cute, you’re so young fluffyomens” (this one happens almost every 5 minutes which feels  like overkill)

“You’ll change your opinion as you gain experience, fluffyomens” (in response to my research-supported suggestions)

“You’re so naive and cute, fluffyomens”

“You’re so forgiving, fluffyomens, after a few years of (job) you won’t be so forgiving” (again... I have experience)

These kinds of comments are more than common, they overwhelm any conversation I’m in with her (and a lot of smaller references to my hair, which is curly and I don’t relax it, and my clothes, where I prefer very colorful prints, get folded into conversations about my age). 

I’ve made polite redirections, I’ve responded by restating my expertise, but nothing has changed. It feels dramatic to go to my boss or HR, but I honestly feel like it’s getting in the way of my coworkers being able to trust my work (there are others on the project besides me and her). Moreover, it’s making me deeply uncomfortable because my only response is to point out how much experience and education I have, which comes off as belittling and elitist.


I need advice on where to go from here. Do I talk to my boss or HR? Is there a response I could use that would make it clear the comments are extremely unwelcome? Should I just have the conversation, and if so, how do I make her understand it’s not “you hurt my feelings boohoo” but “you are undermining me at work, which is unacceptable”.",24Nov2020,1

606,"Hi Reddit,

I have a younger cognitively disabled brother in his twenties. We live in the U.S. He's able to hold a steady factory job, live independently, drive a car, and do most day to day things. But he is also seriously and unmistakably mentally deficient. 

Unfortunately, a much older woman has been sleeping with him for his paycheck. They spend it together on crack and coke. The woman is a local, unemployed, and middle-aged. We know her name and residence, and not much else. This is the second time she's been around. The first time we got him to agree to give us his paycheck for a while so there would be no money, and made him promise to send her away.

It  worked, but it didn't last half a year. My brother is a sweet guy, but sex and affection are a big deal to him, and we can't trust him not to lie to us. He also has difficulty saying no to friends or keeping to something over time. Right now he's holding it together, but we can tell his usage has increased over the last few weeks and worry he's in danger of becoming an addict. The last time this person came into the picture he nearly lost his job, calling in sick to do drugs with her.

Tipping the cops about her seems risky and unlikely, we only know one officer and it's out of his jurisdiction. If we send my brother out of state for a while and then tip them he might not keep his job. If he agrees to give us his paycheck again that might work, but he's an emancipated adult and it's a very temporary solution. 

\*TL;DR:\* An addict is exploiting my disabled brother for drug money, and he is in danger of screwing up his life in a permanent way. This is driving my gray-haired saint of a mother to distraction.

Is there anything we can do?",24Nov2020,1

608,"Hi, I've been struggling to get proper advice about this from both parents and friends, so thought I'd give it to you lot to tell me if I'm about to do something stupid or not.

So I've been employed as an apprentice in the UK in software dev for just over a year now (i'm 19). This apprenticeship is sponsored by the university that I applied to, so the company + uni I'm with is quite connected with one another, which is because what we cover in the course is also what I need to learn to supplement my dev position in the company. I'll be doing this for 4 more years until I finish the course.

As an employee for only a year, I would like to request about a month and a half (we've planned for 6 weeks) but I'm not sure if this is too ambitious for someone in my position as a new employee and apprentice/student. People i've spoken to like my parents and relatives think it's probably too much time in one go and won't be allowed to take it off, which I'm thinking will end up being the case also.

Currently, I don't have enough days to book off the amount of days I need but once they get forwarded to next years holiday allowance I'll have enough for it.

I will eventually ask the university and then my host company, but I wanted to hear other's thoughts beforehand, because I'd like to try and avoid coming off as rude/ungrateful by already asking for a stupid amount of time off. During the time off I'll be travelling with funds I've saved up, along with my friends.

Are my relatives right in thinking this is kinda stupid, or should I give it a go?

611,"My brothers fiancé (f24) is pregnant and she’s planning on coming out with the news to our family in thanksgiving. Since it’s a secret, I (f20) can’t ask my mom for advice on this yet. So my brothers fiancé babysits kids for a living and most just get dropped of to her house. There is one 9 year old that can’t get dropped off, she either has to go to his house or pick him up. She is in her first trimester of pregnancy, so her morning sickness is terrible when she drives. She spends the whole day puking. She asked me to either take over watching the 9 year old until Christmas or pick him up every morning for her. 
The 9 year old needs to be watched 4 days a week from 7am to anywhere from 10:30 am to 2:30pm and the parent only pays $130 a week which would mean at minimum hours it pays $9 an hour and at max hours it’s just over $4 an hour. It doesn’t make sense to me why she accepts such a low value for herself and her time. Minimum wage in my area is $12.10 I believe maybe more. 
Firstly what I’m uncomfortable about is watching children in general, I’m not comfortable with it I never plan on having kids on my own it don’t like it and it makes me uncomfortable watching someone else’s kids (I’d watch my brothers kid in the future because that’s family and I’d have to make myself comfortable). 
Secondly the timing of it, I moved to another state and came back because of the pandemic. Since I’ve been back I wake up as early as 1pm as late as 3:30pm and it’s one of my unspoken duties to be at my bfs house to help him fall asleep and massage him (he lifts a ton of weight and he has sleep issues) which goes as late as 4am so I don’t see myself being able to push my sleep schedule back 8 hours. Plus I love being there for my boyfriend.
Third, I hate driving. It makes me very anxious and honestly I’m not a good driving because of my anxiety. I drive with my bf in the car and even that’s not good. I definitely wouldn’t feel comfortable driving someone else’s child especially so early in the morning where I would definitely be sleep deprived.
Fourth, I know if I accept I’d be spreading myself too thin and be sooo sleep deprived I wouldn’t be able to make time for myself. This is a rare opportunity I have to sit down and focus on my studies and I also have been lifting and working on that too. I know once everything opens back up I’d be back to working 40+ hours a week. I plan on going back after Christmas so this would seriously mess up my life and I don’t know how to tell her I’m not comfortable with it. I don’t want her to resent me and I don’t want to give her the impression I’d never be there for her, but this is just not something I’m comfortable with. What do I do/how do I tell her?",24Nov2020,1

613,"Obligatory “on mobile” apologies 

Me - 23M
Sister (K) - 17F
Brother (T) - 16M
Brother (L) - 15M

My family is fairly dysfunctional. My parents are separated but not divorced after some pretty hefty affairs on the part of my father that I had the pleasure of discovering when I was 10. (Babysitters, man.)

Since then, my family has been pretty divided. I handled my parents separation pretty well but had a terrible temper in my teens and pushed my family away until I moved to Uni 9. I’ve always tried to make myself available for my siblings when I left, and for a while we were all the best of friends, going on road trips, Ice cream runs at 2AM, movies, anime, video games, pretty much anything my younger siblings were into, I would enjoy with them. Last year, I graduated from Uni and moved to a big city about 9 hours from my hometown, and still visit for holidays (with social distancing/testing). 

For about a year or two, my brother, T, has been slowly drifting away from us all. He has a short temper, locks himself in his (shared with L) room to play video games with his friends quite literally all night, waking up at 3PM, and only leaving his room for water and food.

I have been home for a few days, as my mother rented a beachside condo about 10 minutes from our home, so my sister and I packed up and I drove from the city and met them there. T was nowhere to be found, and he refused to come spend time with us there and told us he didn’t want to be near us. This broke my heart a little. I totally understand wanting quiet time that isn’t possible with a family of 6 and 4 who live in the same 3 bedroom home. I initially hoped that he just didn’t want to leave his games, but after assuring him we would be playing video games all night at the condo, he still refused. 

His behavior is mostly standoffish with us, never being patient, and snapping at mostly everything. Never a smile on his face and never wants to talk. I try not to pry, but I only see him 4ish times a year and he only speaks to me like a stranger. For example, I asked him last night about some LED ceiling lights I found by my things in his room, and asked if they were his. He responded by (and by no means a stretch) the most exasperated tone of yes and put his headphones on to continue playing games. 

My mother and I talked last night about him and she told me about their conversation when he stopped by the condo, where he said he wanted nothing to do with us, and doesn’t want to be a part of this family. 

Obviously a 16 year old can feel this way, but my brother isn’t angsty or edgy. He’s a very cut and dry, matter-of-fact person who doesn’t really mess around. This is what concerns me. When I was his age I was emotional and angry, but was civil and at least understood that family is important. 

So cut to today, I am going thanksgiving grocery shopping for my family, and will be cooking a FEAST for everyone, since our family friends are cancelling the yearly meet up for safety. I want to make this a memorable time for us all, and want to have a great time with my family and just have a shimmer of happiness in these times. 

If anyone can offer me advice on how to speak to him or anything please let me know. I apologize for length and I will try to answer any questions as fast as I can.",24Nov2020,1

616,"I have been talking to this guy that I met online for a year and a half now. When he messaged me I was just out of a relationship, and wasn't interested in him in a romantic sense. He just wanted to be friends I suppose. He messaged me on an online language learning site because he thought that I was beautiful and he has consistently messaged me since. He has always been respectful and caring towards me and there is nothing about his behaviour that I can complain about. We have been extremely flirty, sharing pictures with each other and talking regularly. He has also just wanted me to have fun, to go out and enjoy myself and to date (which implies that he doesn't want a relationship)  the beginning. As time went by I started to develop feelings for him. December of last year he had told me that he liked me a lot and he stated that he hoped that one day we will meet. We even discussed some very personal things like children and marriage and would occasionally flirt around that matter. But one thing I noticed is that he always avoided getting too 'attached'. Distance is a bit of a problem because we both live in different countries, I am also in my last year of university.

However the issue is that I have completely fallen for this guy, it's just too hard to explain, but I heard the worst news yesterday. We hadn't talked in about 4 weeks and he messaged me asking me how I was doing to make sure that I am okay. I said that I was and he said that I sounded upset which I was as if I had been going through something. I have been going through things at home but I told him that I was upset because we hadn't spoken in 4 weeks and that I missed him. He asked me why and I responded by saying I just can't explain. Following this he asked me 'What do you see me as'? and I told him that he is the only one who can answer that question. He asked me why and I said 'because... what do you see me as'? He said 'A sweet girl that I enjoy flirting with'. I responded by saying that I understand and he asked me if I do. I told him that I believe what he means by that is that he just wants to flirt with me and doesn't want anything serious and that he has also found another girl where he lives. He said that he is so, so sorry and that I am looking for a real partner and he hopes that I can find someone close to where I live who will be here for me. At this point my heart literally stopped, I couldn't even concentrate because I had felt so nauseous. I said that I hope that he is happy with her. He then proceeded to say that he hopes that I find someone where I live and that he wishes me the best, and he also stated that it is not about a girl. I just said okay and he said that he was sorry and I told him not to be and he then stated that he felt bad and he will only stop feeling bad if I am not upset or mad at him, but I didn't respond.

The truth is that my heart is literally broken. I know that it's hard to comprehend when I haven't met this person in real life etc... but the chemistry we had and the feelings I feel for him are incomprehensible. I feel like I wasted a year and a half, my time and energy focused on him. I know that there are other guys out there and that I am still young, but this hurts like hell. I didn't expect that conversation whatsoever and I just feel so low. I don't know what to do to be honest. I thought he possibly felt the same way but it turns out that he didn't.

In all media love is shown as this explosive or at least intense thing. She does make me smile or feel happy sometimes, especially when she sends a cute text, but I can't find in myself any big feelings towards her. Could be because I haven't met her and can't for a while, but when I look in myself what I can find is imagining cute future scenarios but nothing like deep love.

Now I've seen love as also a verb, something you build and if it is so it may be that we haven't built it yet, especially because of the distance, but what happens if you put in effort and it's not the right person anyway? Is it a combination of potential and effort? 

That's not the only kind of love I'm wondering about though—I have an amazing mother and sister that I can say I love very much, and I do act like it, but I feel like love should have a shape and it doesn't. And would I go through torture for them? Probably not. I wouldn't want to. Would I do other sacrifical things? Probably yes. Does that mean I don't love them? It's like my love is a colorless, odorless gas that I can't place at all.

This is not the first time I've had these thoughts. Honestly I can't remember how many times I've felt this way.

I know I can handle the pain but the fear of not knowing holds me back. I'm a coward.  I want more . Not what I have now. Something different. A meaning to it all.

Long backstory:  
I am a gay 27 yo male.  Throughout my life I know I all in all have had a good life and pain isn't a competition but here is mine.  At an early age I became aware of my sexual orientation and did my best to hide it from my family since I grew up in a stereotypical, at least till I was 16 important later, Christian home.   Also important for all of my life from my brother and my peers I grew up constantly bullied and mocked for my weight, for being emotional, and being introverted. My only source of support was my mother who was my shoulder to cry on while I was bullied. When I say ""all of my life"" that does mean even till this day as far as my brother goes as many times as I told him to stop or that he is being an a$$.  To compound this I had a abusive relationship with my father since when I was 8 I started mowing grass with a rider mower, he was drunk, and I was not mowing right.  The result?  I got hit over the head with a beer bottle.  Another time he got home late and was arguing loudly in the kitchen with my mother he moved to try and hit her.  I got in the way.  I got hit to the floor.  


At about 13 years old I started realizing the severity of what it means to be a homosexual individual in a Christian home and community and hear first hand an account of a peer who got thrown out of his home for coming out to his family and was left coach hopping.  Compounded with me writing a report in English class outing the abuse my father did.  We went to therapy but he just seemed to take the tool learned and use them as weapons and went from physical and slight emotional abuse to just full on verbal and emotional abuse.   Thereafter I was sent spiraling into depression.  I got to the point I became apathetic to everything even what happened to me.   Sadly the person I saw as my friend at the time took advantage of that and I let him for I no longer had an opinion, what I wanted no longer mattered, it was what he wanted or nothing even when in sparse moments I did care.  During this time I did not exactly cut myself but I did develop suicidal tendencies and started scratching my wrists till I bled.  I hated my father especially during this time that I hated even having an ounce of his blood in my veins.  I call this period my emotional coma . . . .this continued on for 8 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 16 even during my emotional coma I came out to my supposed best friend and my mother.  They seemed to have taken it well.  At 18 when I was prepared to be kicked out I came out to the rest of my family . . . . . they too seemed to have taken it well.  Like I said about this time before I left my coma I learned from her what my sisters true ideology was after a messy divorce.  My sister, who ironically stood up for LGBTQ+ rights when going to religious school when young and I looked up to her because of it, has since changed her belief that all gays are sinners who will go to h\*ll and must be saved.  My heart broke as my niece preached to me during the outing I took her on.  


At 21 I woke from my coma after one final act of betrayal from my supposed best friend at the time when we were making plans to move in together.  His family strongly rejected, after they too seemingly accepted me for being gay and made it seem like they were a strong second family for me, because I was gay and might try something with their children.  Even after this I was so dependent on him and had not fully snapped from my coma I gave him one more chance after hearing his sob story on how we should be friends since we had been for so long.  I couldn't forgive him for rejecting me after saying he accepted me and though it is not important to the story I will never forget the words he said to me when I finally ended things ""Well can I get \[the stuff I borrowed  you and some of your own things\] back?""  At this time in particular I decided to separate from my extended family especially after one of them made an especially cruel joke and a good majority of them laughed.  The joke being  a big truck backing up as I was getting a few pieces of candy from a candy bowl among other things I could never forget that were just ""jokes"" and it was my fault for being sensitive.  Some I may have cut off unfairly but I couldn't handle anymore rejection especially since I was taught that family is supposed to have your back no matter what . . . though honestly I do not think I ever felt that way.  


Since 21 to now more fun things have happened.  I had a conversation with my mother that I will never forget where I told her that I am open to dating other ethnicities other than Caucasian . . .where her response was ""why do you keep pushing the envelope?"" note I am also vegetarian for later when I told her how much this hurt me her clarification was not much better.  For my mother said ""why would anyone chose to be gay"" in defense of being gay is NOT a choice and she felt sad for me for my life will be so much harder.   From the conversation though I kept getting the subtext that I was forcing her to accept me and how different I am from her and the rest of my family and the rest of the family accept me  . . .and she just wanted peace in the family.  After all my mother's whole ideal is her family image . . . as I took a position of ""counselor"" in my parents relationship and learned far more about their relationship than I should of;  granted I took the position of my own volition though in retrospect I never should have and gave up a good piece of my childhood doing so.    I also confronted my sister as I mentioned in a previous post on what my niece said years back which ended up in her not accepting me and myself deciding and setting the boundary ""if you cannot accept me you cannot love me, and if you cannot love me you cannot be my sister.""  


&amp;#x200B;

The problem:

Dealing with all this trauma I have since July been going to therapy and trying to deal with everything.  I recently been devastated with the fact that the more I recover it seems the farther drift from my family . . . . .which I feel like a monster for I am starting to think that it might be a good thing.   Which if it means I get better I know I have to accept.   This especially became clear based on one question from my therapist that I did not even so much as hesitate to answer or second guess which I am known for.  ""If you had a partner would you bring him home to see your family?"", ""No.""  So reddit if you made it this far what boundaries do I set with my family?  For I want to set boundaries and not cut them off completely for I want to give them a chance if they truly change their minds to know I am here and willing to love them.  The ones I do not know how to set especially are my mother and my brother who seems to for now have stopped with the teasing after telling him it was bad for my mental health.   I will try to answer all posts in a timely fashion and sorry if this seems slapped together it is just I am crying while going through writing this.  Thank you all and I hope you have a good day.",24Nov2020,1

632,"Like, really. I've already fucked up my grades just cuz I always spend my days pacing across my room, daydreaming (My teachers were kind enough to give me time to catch up). And not just that, I think I'm slowly breaking my ears, since I listen to music with the volume so high. I can't help it, it's so addicting.

And ig that's not my only problem. When I'm not daydreaming, I do other trivial things when I should be doing assignmemts and assessments. I get easily frustrated when I do things I don't like, so I move on to things I do. 

But this question is mostly for the daydreaming part. I asked my sister the other day if she does the same thing, she did not. Even called me weird when she caught me pacing back and forth while I was talking to myself (don't judge, I was acting out the scene inside my head. And it was a bomb ass story if you ask me).  

How do you stop this? This is seriously messing with my mind. And life. And with quarantine and stuff, it has gotten WORSE. I reeeaaallly wanna stop but I can't help it. It's so addicting.

Me and my boyfriend have been dating for two years now and he started filming/editing music videos for local wannabe rappers and he’s had pretty good success in it but lately the videos he’s been filming have had naked girls in it just showing off their ass and body. It really annoys me everytime I think about it because he’s at a house with some random naked girls just filming them and who knows what else happens there and if he’s being loyal and then he goes home and edits it and stares at that for a few days. I’ve told him that it annoys me and makes me uncomfortable but the only thing he ever says is ‘it’s my job’ and even though I understand it’s his job I still find it disrespectful. I wanted your opinion on if u think I’m overreacting or not? And what should I do about it?

Anyways, she went out of town and when I asked her clearly what she thinks, she said that she doesn't like texting and she still observing about it as she had horrible experiences with men before and she needs time to meet face to face when she comes back to town soon.

I’m confused, in texts she seems cold but in real life different, she seems unsure about dating but she responses to my texts but never started one first. However, I like her and I bought her a nice gift and told her that. 
This year was awful for me in dating wise, I had shitty experiences and I'm generally a sensitive person and I don't know if I can handle her rejecting me.

I need help. I'm just so overwhelmed and panicked and it's all my own fault but I cant help it.  I have absolutely terrible anxiety about the smallest things. Last semester I managed to finish up MOST of my classes and pass them all, because we had partial in class, and partial online. But this semester... it was fully online and I just cant. 

My one class from last semester I was supposed to continue it throughout summer but I just couldnt. I had no one to help me and I was afraid to ask the teacher which i know i shouldnt be but i was. And this semester i barely started on anything for my two classes and theres just no way I'll get them done. Theres just no way. Up until a week ago i couldnt even bring myself to look at my assignments because I'd have a panic attack when I saw how many there were. I'm sitting here now in front of my computer just utterly sad and disappointed in myself. I havent talked with my teacher at all and thats partly because I'm afraid and scared. I know he will be upset with me and I dont want to hear it. 

Maybe I should just withdrawal? I dont know. I hate college and all I want to do is lay down and never think about it again. I cant do this. Online is so horrible for me I have nothing to keep me accountable my parents dont really understand the issue and I have no one to help me. I dont know what to do anymore.

Curiosity struck me when I found out this common ingredient in food can be turned into a drug. I figured out how to make a drug with heavy research and because it's so easy and relatively safe, I thought jokingly to myself  ""It's like cooking money!"". And that's when I started going down a rabbit  hole that led to me concluding I should make this drug and sell it.

I  tell myself how wrong this is and what it can do to my soul (I'm religious, which is why I'm more concerned on why I'm not scared of  doing this, and not  scared about what would happen to me in the  afterlife/next life, I'm not sure if many people here relate to this but  I think I should put it here for everyone to better understand me).

I don't want to do this  yet here I am with everything I need and everything setup. It's a wonder  how I got myself to post this.

646,"Hi all. Im 22m, my girlfriend is 24 and my ex is 20f

So my ex was my bestfriend, we had a short lived fling before I ended it because I wasn't ready for something. 
We were super close, like I've never been closer to someone before, due to the fling ending we drifted..mainly so she could move on, and it was awkward after this, we just drifted slowly.

Im seeing someone new now, well sort of.. its a previous ex but we have made great progress in our lives and things just make sense now.

I love my girlfriend so much, I want to marry her and spend every day waking up to her face.

My ex (and ex bestfriend) still has some type of connection to me, she has tried to reconcile but I've decided to block her as she had messaged me about being together a few times after I started seeing my girlfriend and it was making her feel weird so I said nice fairwells but turned her down, wished her well and etc before blocking. It was hard to do as she meant a lot to me but there was flirtation etc.

The thought of her being with someone else makes me feel happy yet sad and bothered and almost jealous? and I dont know why, because I dont want to be with her.
 I believe my ego is the thing taking a hit as she was very clingy as my friend and I've never had had a friend like her, or have been so close to someone and I did have real feelings. 
Its been a year since this ended and we haven't spoke in about 6 months.

I dont want to be with her, I've told her I dont and haven't given any indication that I do, nor do I have any interest in it.

I should mention maybe that I do have OCD and I get some intrusive thoughts.
I feel like an ass for this, really I want her to be happy but I think again it is maybe my ego taking a hit after the amount of attention.

I love my girlfriend and I am obsessing over 'do I still want my ex?' And all this shit and feelint anxious because she doesn't deserve that  but I feel also like my obsessing is making me create scenarios when really, I just miss my ex as a bestfriend since we were so close, and I wish we still could be but its complicated. I dont have many friends so I get very attached to the ones I do. She was funny and we had lots in common but my current girlfriend? 

I dknt even know where to start. Shes beautiful, kind, patient, soft, funny, loyal and oh god does she make me smile. 

She deserves the world and I want to give it to her but im afraid im being selfish? And I don't even think I can talk go her about this as she is always worried and mentioning that she fears I srill want my ex (both of us have anxiety) and this is fueling my worry even more. 

Has anyone experienced similar ? I feel like an ass.. I am hoping to see my therapist soon but I just want to feel less alone or hear some other input.",24Nov2020,1

649," 

A roommate moved into my house 4 months ago. Their dog is an aggressive dog and the problems resulting from it's aggression are coming to a head.

Things that have happened since she moved in:

* Bite my dog on the head and behind ear. Punctured skin and left a scar/cut behind ear.
* Bite my dog on the muzzle. Broke skin in three spots, not very serious or deep, but still broke skin from aggression.
* Seemingly bit my dog again last night (I did not see it).
* Bit a friend of ours in the face. Very very small abrasion on her cheek.
* Has bit my hand and the other roommates hand. It did not hurt or break skin.
* Her old roommates came by and commented that he had bitten everyone.
* I found out he bit her ex so badly on the face he went to the ER.

At this point it is very clear the dog is aggressive and she is making no effort to train or muzzle him. He's 5 and not a puppy. I spoke with her after he broke skin on my dog and told her it needs to end or I'm going to the landlord. Just last night it seems they got in a scuffle and my dog has a scratch (enough to remove all hair to make it look like a scar and seems to be tooth size/look like a tooth scrape) right above his eye. My dog has never been aggressive - he is a 7 year old lab with a very calm and friendly demeanor. He has never bitten anyone or aggressively attacked another dog. I'm fairly certain her dog did this unprovoked. What makes this tough is my dog must walk by her room, which he guards, to get to my room and her dog is very protective and aggressive about her.

I'm just not sure how to proceed. It's clear to me this dog will not be trained by her and that if he has bitten this many people he would have already been put down by the state. I feel horrible having to take action, but I'm afraid if nothing is done this could get much worse than a few small puncture wounds on my dogs head. I feel if she and her dog are to stay he must wear a muzzle at all times, she gets rid of the dog, or they both move out.

It probably doesn't sound serious, but what makes me uncomfortable is how I don't have any symptoms, signs or traits of any of those things.

664,"This year due to COVID I decided it would be best for me to live off campus in order to protect myself.  Ultimately it ended up being a good idea since the amount of cases on campus were ridiculous. 

For some background, I go to a private college, they charge $4,000 a semester for rooming and then an additional price for meal, tuition is $12,000 this semester with no room and board.  The y charged me $810 to live off campus which I think is ridiculous.  I have sent a few emails and have been told it goes toward ""technology service"" but no one can explain what.  So I decided to write emails to other private colleges in MI asking about their off campus living charges and one said they charge $50 to live off campus.  Here is my current email that I plan on sending to the school.  

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, 

I am wondering why we are charged $810 to live off campus?  I understand it is usually charged but it seems inappropriate for that fee to exist especially during a global pandemic.  I would like to start off by stating we are not utilizing campus resources when living off campus this year.  For example, I do not have access to the library, computer labs, printers, etc.  I should add I am living off campus due to medical reasons and COVID, not by choice.  Might I also mention tuition went up, times are hard and we are not getting the same learning experience as we would on campus.  I was informed “it is believed that the money goes toward a wide variety of technology services” and “that it is still a technology fee for the additional technology to make it possible for the professors to host online classes.”  Can I please get an itemized list of what this $810 goes to since no one can seem to tell me what exactly it goes to and Zoom and Google Meet are free.  I took the liberty of sending an email to multiple different private colleges in Michigan, asking if they charge an off campus living fee.  From the responses I received, one college charges a $50 off campus living fee (emails attached below).  If you can show me what the $810 adds up to, I would be more accepting of the idea of this price tag but based on my research, emails and other colleges responses, the charge makes no sense.  

Thank you,

Any input on my email would be helpful.",24Nov2020,1

667,"Throwaway 

With the knowledge that abusers who get away with their abuse often go on to take on other victims, I periodically (say, every couple years) will google my aunt husband's name to see if he will ever get arrested. I didn't actually ever expect it to happen, but a month ago I google his name + South Carolina (the state that he lives in currently) and his name and convictions came up on the SC sex offenders list. Full picture, everything. I will link it below if that's allowed. Idgaf. He was convicted of two counts of sexual battery on a nine year old. Probably the daughter of someone who knew and trusted him, but who knows. 

A billion years ago, when I was 9, he also sexually abused me. It was a whole huge saga to deal with, but I told my parents and eventually my parents confronted them (maternal Aunt + her Abuser Husband). He denied it up and down and eventually they moved to South Carolina and all communication was cut off, aside from essential communication surrounding deaths/my grandma's will and stuff. My grandma still talked to her daughter (we'll call her Aunt #1) on the phone, but she never saw Mike again or visited them in SC. They have a kid who is now in high school together. 

Anyway... I found out about a month ago that he was convicted and sent my Aunt a text message being like umm wtf? No answer.

Then my mom sent my aunt a well thought out text asking for more info. Days later she responded ""I can't talk about it"". 

She can go eff herself, I honestly don't care. Coward. 

The issue is though, I have another maternal Aunt (60sF), we'll call her aunt #2, who has always been my idol/like another mom to me. She has no kids, is a feminist lawyer with interesting ideas/perspectives and who is pretty progressive for someone who grew up when she did.  I've never discussed my other aunt with her or the abuse with her until now, because it was too painful, but I called her and explicitly asked her to cut off communication with my other aunt (her sister). She said that they never discuss the details of Aunt #1's marriage and their relationship exists outside of their marriage. She also cares deeply about her nephew (abuser's son), which I get. 

So now, I'm no longer talking to Aunt #2. She talks weekly with Aunt #1 and has visited her a bunch in SC. She told me she knows nothing about her husband, their marriage, any of this and Aunt #1 wont give her more info either. They simply just don't talk about it. 

Am I wrong in never talking to Aunt #2 ever again? This is crazy right? 

TL;DR: I have two aunt's on mom's side. Aunt #1's husband sexually abused me when I was 9. The whole family knows I've accused him of this. I'm now 31 and he's been convicted of another sexual assault on another 9 year old and no one will give me any info. Feeling guilty about cutting off Aunt #1, who still talks to Aunt #2.",24Nov2020,1

670,"For 17 years my family and I celebrated Christmas together. But when my aunt and uncle moved to a different country and my grandparents divorced, Christmas became nothing but stressful. I’ve tried to get everyone in Christmas spirits by buying gifts, suggesting to by new Christmas decor but my mother have decided to become the real life grinch.

Christmas for years was a holiday I looked for because I got to spend time with my family and eat amazing food. It was a holiday where everyone had to get a long and dress nice. I loved it.

Fast forward to last year and this year my mother has decided she just doesn’t want to celebrate Christmas anymore. I’ve multiple times tried to ask her why but she gets angry and aggressive. I get so mad at her as well for dismissing me when I talk about it where it’s to the point that I want to cry. Last year I decorated in my room because I was extremely happy and looking forward to Christmas. But being in my room alone decorating alone for the first time ever was so depressing and I actually started crying. 

Almost 5 years ago she was dating this guy who decided to bring us into the jehovas witnesses knowing that we are catholic. My mom not being able to stand up for herself decided to just go with it. And I wouldn’t be upset about it if it wasn’t for the fact that I know how my mom is with religion. And I know that these people have done stuff for my mom and I know deep down that she just does it because she feels like she has to and she owes it to them. At some point my mom also refused to celebrate my sisters birthday because of her new beliefs. So my sister was forced to ask her grandmother for help to plan the birthday party. 

Im not against religion at all but my mother seems so brainwashed and tbh I’ve only had bad experiences with the jehova witnesses so I’m not really thrilled about her being apart of it. 

Today i asked her if she wanted to buy some new Christmas lights, to decorate the windows and she got so mad at me over the phone that I just hung up on her. When I got home from work she pretended that nothing happened. I don’t want to lose the little Christmas spirit I have left because I want to be able to celebrate Christmas with my future family (if I even have one) so I have decided to celebrate Christmas with my grandmother and just decorate my room. And also my sisters room if she wants to.

I’m not trying to force a holiday on anyone but it’s always been a tradition but then my mother just decides that she doesn’t believe it anymore. It’s just crazy to me.

671,"For short period of time I was friends with this guy (Guy A), however the friendship evolved into something a little more. We both developed feelings and started sleeping together as well as confessed said feelings to each other. We got very close. The only reason I let it manifest into anything more than friendship is because at the time the guy I truly wanted to be with and loved (Guy B) was playing with my heart and wouldn’t take me serious because he had just gotten out of a relationship. Guy B and I had on and off “talking” phases for a couple months. 

At times I did talk to both considering one was consistent with me and the other was on and off however the consistent one, Guy A, was aware of my feelings for the other guy. Guy B didn't know about Guy A because seeing how he played with me and did what he wanted, I owed no explanation.

I did not want to jump into a relationship with Guy A because I wasn't over Guy B but also because he had a history of drug abuse and hadn't been clean long, just a mere three months. He even relapsed and overdosed within the first few weeks of us meeting and agreed he needed time to work on himself before a relationship. This is why he couldn't be terribly upset about me needing time to figure out what was going on with Guy B.

Once I was finally fed up with Guy B for giving me the run around and decided to cut him off for good, he straightened up and promised to take me serious because he realized that he didn't want to lose me and fucking around with random girls wasn't worth not having me in his life and claimed to be in love with me. He was ready to give us being together a chance but before making it official he wanted us to seriously talk and him to take me out before making me his girlfriend. Due to past events, I was still cautious and kept my guard up because I wasn't 100% convinced. Guy A wasn't aware that Guy B and I were seriously trying at this point and still thought I was done with him and that he had a shot with me in the near future.

I still continued to see Guy A while Guy B and I worked on things, which was not right but again, I had serious doubts that Guy B was going to fully commit. (Side note however, I had never slept with Guy B. He said because he really liked me he didn't want to get physically involved until we dated.) This went on for short amount of time, not even a week, because Guy A offered me drugs (opiates) which I stupidly did one night and ended up overdosing seeing as I never had done them before and he kept offering more and more which I took. He gave me Narcan because he couldn't wake me up and when I finally did wake up it was the most traumatizing experience of my life. The night it happened I was supposed to be at Guy B's house but went ghost because I was unconscious for about 3 hours. I immediately told Guy B what had happened. He even tried to fight Guy A but I wouldn't give him the address. I thought I had ruined my chance with him but he forgave me and a few days after, asked me out. Naturally, part of him forgiving me involved me cutting off Guy A. I agreed because even though I, an adult, made the conscious decision to take the drug, didn't need to be around that. I know in the end I hurt Guy A and the whole situation was fucked up. I have immense guilt that still plagues my mind.

Regardless, I don't hate Guy A. I sometimes pass him on Thursdays at the college we both attend and last I spoke to Guy A he claimed he would never touch another drug and was getting help. We said our goodbyes and no longer speak. Now here comes the part I need advice on.....

Guy B and I have been together for almost two months now. I'm very happy with him and he has been loyal as promised but is about to do something kind of fucked up... He has a fake account posing as a female and has recently started talking to Guy A. He's not sure what he's going to do yet but he's trying to lure Guy A into a trap. He mentioned possibly getting Guy A to say something about drugs so he couldn't screenshot it and ""put him on blast"" or call the cops and even mentioned trying to get his address to physically harm him. I don't think he'd actually go as far as to harm him but I have no doubt he would take it to social media. I don't know if Guy A is still using drugs but either way I don't agree with any of it and when trying to talk to my boyfriend about it he accuses me of having feelings for Guy A and claims since he couldn't beat his ass before, this is payback.

Idk if I should warn Guy A since I see him sometimes on Thursdays or keep quiet and let it happen. Of course I wouldn't tell on my boyfriend but I want to tell Guy A to stop talking to ""her"" because ""she"" isn't who he thinks she is and leave it at that. My only dilemma is if Guy A confronts ""her"" for being fake or mentions my name my boyfriend will automatically know it was me and I don't want to start that fight. I thought that maybe if I asked Guy A not to saying anything and to simply quit talking to her maybe he would but I'm not sure. I also thought about an anonymous text to him from a texting app but that's evidence that could get back to my boyfriend as well.

678,"Hey everyone, i need a little help in making a decision. I (16M) am a junior attending a small private high school. Let me preface this situation with a little background on my history with student council. Since 6th grade, I have been apart of student council. I was Student body secretary in 6th and 7th grade and student body president in 8th grade. In freshman year at a new high school that I am still attending, I ran and won for freshman class president. 

However, my downfall began in sophomore year when I ran for sophomore class president when I lost against a popular boy that had bad behavior and grades (which isn’t allowed in student council) who just ran because his friends told him to. Then, in Junior year, I ran again, but this time I ran for student body secretary because I didn’t think anyone else was running for the position. I ended up losing to a senior which I was fine with because she won fair and square. I wasn’t mad but just a little bummer. I still remained a member of student council the two years I lost. 

Now, it is halfway through my Junior year and we are beginning elections for the next school year when I will be a senior. Obviously throughout this time I’ve realized student council is just a popularity contest. I mean I hate to sound cocky or rude but I believe I had much more leadership skills than the kid I lost to in sophomore year who ran as a prank. It was honestly annoying but now it’s water under the bridge. Though, this year, I don’t know what to run for. Since 8th grade when I was student body president in middle school, I wanted to become student body president in high school. 

Now it’s my year to shine, but I don’t know if I should run for it or not. The girl who won Junior class president last year is running again for student body class president which I wanted since 8th grade. But since it’s basically a popularity contest, I have no idea if I will win. I feel like I know a lot of kids who would vote for me, but at the end of the day that won’t carry me to the win. It’s a small school and like there’s isn’t much votes going to one person or the other. So since that position will be taken by a candidate, I don’t know if I should just step down to run for student body Vice President or senior class president. It sucks that I probably won’t win student body class president like I wanted but life isn’t fair all the time. 

So, I’m here asking you guys, should I still run for student body class president like I’ve always wanted to and run the risk of losing and just being a member of student council or should I run for Vice President or senior class president. I mean student body president will look the best on college resumes but I mean I don’t know. I mean im a good student who just wants to excel and do the best I can and most I can. Please help!

682,"Hi reddit! This is my [26F] first time asking for advice here, thanks for lending an ear (or rather, a set of eyes).

I’m a software engineer. Currently I’m working at Amazon, and I’ve been miserable here. The problem isn’t the job function - I love writing code - it’s the company. It seems like people here don’t really care about their work or who they’re working with. My manager is disorganized, aggressive, and a terrible communicator/listener. It’s not just behavioral issues, I also strongly question his technical competence. The codebases I work on are poorly written and use extremely outdated tools. Honestly, my complaints are endless so I’ll spare you the details, but just imagine the worst job you’ve ever had, where every day was a struggle and a misery. That’s where I’m at.

Now that I’ve made my 1-year mark, I’m ready to get out. I considered finding another team within Amazon, but decided against that. While many problems I’m having are team-specific, there are broader issues that apply to the company as a whole. Primarily, the company’s mission is just not something I’m excited about or proud to be supporting.

So in my job search, I came across a startup building a platform to make mental health services more accessible. They specialize in therapy for women. The CEO is a woman, as is most of the rest of the team. In the engineering world, most of my colleagues are men - especially in leadership positions. The prospect of working with a mission-driven team of talented women is very appealing. My main concern is they’re a very young (just launched in March) and small (~25? employees) company and I’m worried it might not be a stable career/financial move to pursue this opportunity. I’ve worked at small and medium sized startups before, but not during a raging pandemic and global economic crisis, you know?

So, does it seem like a good idea to work for this startup? What kind of questions can I ask them to gauge whether they’ll be successful? What are things I should look out for?",24Nov2020,1

687,"Hello

I am a 34 year old person. On the outside I look like a 34 year old white man. Very tall, about 6'4"". Very large in body as well, over 260 pounds. I have long hair, and am not afraid to dress a little bit feminine for a man, but other than that if you saw me you would probably never think that inside I am a woman.

But in reality I have known for almost my entire life that I am a woman. I don't know what that really means to be honest... is it my soul? my mind? my essence? That much I can't explain, but I know for certain that I wish I looked like other women, was treated like other women, could connect with other women as a sister; a member of the same team. I don't feel especially *girly*, though, and if I ever were to transition I would probably present very similar to how I do now, butch but with a little flair.

I am in a relationship with a woman who I have not told about these feelings. We have great physical chemistry in many ways, but she does know that something is up with me as I am almost never able to achieve an erection. This is a problem I have experienced all of my life. I don't want an erection, I want to have the reaction a female body would have when it is aroused. This is something that has caused me a lot of distress and affected all of my relationships. I know she has dated women in the past, and when we met on tinder I had myself listed as a woman even though I presented as a man. But still.. she thinks of me as her boy friend. She is so girly and feminine, even though I feel like a woman she makes me feel so insecure because I am nothing at all like her. I am so terrified of telling her the truth, and then her either breaking up with me, or worse... NOT breaking up with me, and pushing me to actually transition. When who knows if that's what I really need.

I am currently secretly taking estrogen and testosterone blockers. I started taking them two years ago. I took them for almost a whole year and then stopped after I had a brief love affair. I was scared that she would find out. Lately I have been feeling so dysphoric and uncomfortable in my body I just had to take the hormones again... at least slowing down my descent into a gross adult man.

Why is it so difficult for me to even consider transitioning? I spoke with a therapist who diagnosed me with gender dysphoria a few years ago, and encouraged me to go on hormones and transition. But I have only ever told a couple of female friends, though both of whom are very supportive I have hinted at it for years, but I don't know if anybody else has ever picked up on it. One friend has acknowledged that I am womanly and feminine, which was honestly one of the best moments of my life so far.

I think what it comes down to is embarrassment. I know I am going to look bad. I know that people are just going to be polite. I have a very progressive circle, both in friends and family, so everybody I know would ""accept me"". At least accept me in a sense that they would do their best. Which is huge, and I certainly know that they are good people who are not hateful. But everybody carries some prejudices. I look like a big man. They have known me as a man. They will probably on some level always think of me as a man. Why do I care? Because I care about these people. I want them in my life and I know they want me in their life. I trust I have true deep lifelong friends. But I am terrified of ruining the friendship, becoming an inconvenience in their lives. Somebody they unconsciously distance themselves from because it's just ""too much"".

After starting transition, taking hormones, and seeing that I still looked like *me* after a year... I just don't know if transitioning will actually make things better or just make it even worse. I want to stop thinking about this. I want to be honest with my girlfriend. This is all a lot to unpack, and I really should be in therapy again, but I just can't afford it right now. Please... any thoughts you have. Thank you.",24Nov2020,1

689,"First off a bit about me. I am 26 with eight years of restaurant experience, and schooling. 
   I was offered a career opportunity at an up and coming bed &amp; breakfast in a small town, population 400 with lots of through traffic between cities and at the foot of the mountains with a wonderful view. 
   The proposition is that i would be the chef at the restaurant. The owner (I'll refer to as dave) would foot the bill for expenses and we would split the profits after the bills. Dave is planning millions of dollars worth of renovations; new rooms, underground parking, huge wedding venue, and more but still needs investors. 
It sounds like a great opportunity to me if he is successful.

691,"I (F19) and my two friends (M19, M18) are trying to get an apartment. We all come from toxic homes. I’ve convinced them to move to the city I go to college in, which is halfway across the country for them. We’ve been figuring out the details and saving money, but with covid and with them relocating, the situation is looking unlikely. We look bad on paper because I have the best credit but haven’t been at my current part time job long, one friend (let’s call him Jake) drives for DoorDash so can’t verify his income, and the younger friend (Jake’s bf, let’s call him Liam) gets a wage lower than this city’s minimum wage and doesn’t have credit. None of us have renting history. 

We have just enough in our savings to offer roughly 6 months rent upfront to landlords, which we just tried and got rejected. Because of covid, our employment is deemed uncertain. 

I’ve been so stressed this semester that I’m failing half my classes with no chance of saving it and will lose my enrollment status after this semester. I have to be out of my dorm before January. 

Jake has told me that if this falls through, I can stay with his family while we figure out, though that’s indefinite because it’s difficult to tour apartments, apply, and sign a lease from 800 miles away. 

I have a good relationship with my mom and she’s stayed informed with us trying to find a place, thought I haven’t told her of our failures or me losing my enrollment status (she knows I’m planning to take off for next semester though, which has been a plan). It would break her heart if I went back to my home state and didn’t live with her or if she found out I’m flunking. I can’t move back in with her because she lives with my father, and after 19 years of psychological and emotional abuse. After my college closed from covid until I came back for my sophomore year, I was living there again and was seriously at my breaking point. 

I don’t know what to do and I’m fucking terrified.

I’ve had a spotty career history. I’m in my earlier twenties, but I feel that I’ve had more jobs than other people my age. A few of these roles I’ve been dismissed, sometimes my own fault, but more often than not it’s not. (For instance, the last two jobs I’ve had I was dismissed for whistleblowing). 

I have recently started working again amidst the covid restrictions, and I am excessively worrying myself about my conduct at work (whether the quality of work was good enough, whether the interpersonal relationships between me and my colleagues are in good standing etc.)

I enjoy working, more so than sitting around, but constantly thinking about it when I’m not at work is driving me up the wall.

The Internet even seems to run faster at night.

Because of this, I’ve been contemplating switching to a nocturnal sleep schedule, that way I can be awake during the time I feel most like myself. I am however wondering about any negative ramifications this could have on my life. It sounds amazing when I think about it though.",24Nov2020,1

• He killed a dog with a stick
• He can fly a plane
• He worked on the PS5
• He stole a tazer from a police station in Thailand
and his most recent one
• He is working for MI5 to detect underage smoking and drug use in my school (he even has a phone and everything)

He also tells lies just for the sake of it:
• He had a game but then he decided to sell it when I asked for it 
• and others (but I cant think rn)

What inspired me to make this post is when I got a message from him over Discord this morning saying he might tell me something really important. When I met up with him on the bus, he turned my phone off and told me he went all the way to London from Yorkshire and back in one night. Then he told me why and he showed me a little phone saying he reports to MI5 with it and through out the day he has been locking himself in a cubicle and ""reporting to the government"". I don't believe him at all.

He is part of our friend group and IDK if they would side with me or all go with him. What should I do?

I would like to say that he is a good friend just too much of a liar.

So for a backstory, an internet friend of mine was very suicidal and I talked him out of suicide many times. he was depressed and in a bad mental state, and when he was very upset he would delete his social medias and come back a few days later when he cooled off. As of the last time I spoke to him, his life had spiraled down again. He had stopped going to therapy and quit his meds. It's been over a year since we last spoke. I tried everything I could to contact him (I'm fairly sure I was his only friend, and even if I wasn't, I don't want my friends to be unsafe or without someone to talk to). I've done lots of internet searches and I think I found his old inactive twitter, but I hadn't found a way to speak to him.

What if he doesn't want to speak to me and this is why he has gone a year without speaking to me. I don't want to make anything worse for him by reaching out, if it is him. I just want to know that my friend is safe. He had attempted suicide a few days before we last spoke, and I'm just worried that he could have really gone through with it.

She told me not to tell anyone and that she wants to return to campus sooner.

We don't live in the same city but I told her she can come live with me, but she said she doesn't want to bother. I told her it's no bother but she said she would be ashamed to accept, and that is custom in our country: to be taught it's a shame to take help form people unrelated to you.

Somehow when i was feeling that way and started to overthink i developed this hair/scalp picking habit and it stuck with me to the point i can't control it when im overwhelmed.
That resulted in my hair falling a lot which stresses me out even more, because i can see that my hair is getting thinner and my hair line has changed. It is freaking me out everytime i run my fingers through my hair, comb it or wash it, because it does fell a lot. And naturally i have very thick and curly hair so when i visibly see the difference in volume it scares me. I don't know what to do as my mindset is that it will get worse.. Especially if i continue with this habit of hair picking which i have been trying to reduce but it is not going to well and that's the root issue.
 So my question/concern for advice is two fold, first how do  i get rid of this habit and second what treatments, products should I start using to get my hair to grow back and be thicker as it used to be as my scalp may be sensitive and damaged due to  picking (i have heard about the alpecin shampoo, any experience with that?) .

713,"So I had originally posted this in r/amitheasshole to see if I was in the wrong. About 20 people told me no. Just ask. So here’s the post below... the real question is. HOW? How do you ask your ex boyfriends dad for a job? 


WIBTA if I asked my ex boyfriends dad for a job?

Long story short, my ex was not the greatest. Didn’t treat me as a girlfriend outside of the bedroom type relationship. I was ‘clingy’ for asking to hangout with him more than 2 times a week. This lasted for a year and a half until he moved away for university. Then he dumped me. Then he realized I wouldn’t give him sex when he returned to visit family and asked me to get back together with him. At least I was smart enough to say no. 

My ex boyfriends dad on the other hand was great. He was always very welcoming and encouraged me in my work goals as he works at a very similar type of establishment. He even set up a meeting with a friend that would help me get into this line of work. Fast forward to the breakup I took a huge step back from all that and settled for a receptionist job. I’ve always wanted to get into that job, and the dad is literally the head of the department. I don’t want anything to do with my ex boyfriend. His dad and I left off on a great note where his girlfriend even invited me out for coffee with them sometime. But that was almost a year ago. 



So how do I ask? Thanks!",24Nov2020,1

716,"First, I would like to preface by saying, I have had experience with this for so long and I still, to this day hurl my ass over not understanding this from the beginning so here we go, learn from my mistakes people, Learn from my mistakes!!!!

1. You will find people who WILL love you for you, never change yourself for someone else, be it your family or friends BUT this doesn't apply if you are toxic (trust me, you need to analyse your behaviour). It might seem like you are never gonna find people like that But trust me you will.
2. Family isn't always the kindest environment, if you can't stand your family and is constantly being put down and feeling down around them THEY ARE TOXIC to your mental health. So set down rules, like for example talk to them once a week or just reach out (keep a distant contact) and watch your life turn right-side-up
3. BE KIND TO YOURSELF!!! I cannot preface this enough, be kind to yourself because no one else will EVER, Humans are wired to be selfish. KNOW YOUR WORTH, it isn't gonna be easy, start by setting a line which no one can cross. With me, it's my body and I'm glad I've found my people who understand this. A great way to estimate is to add about a 1000% more than you think you deserve
4. DO NOT STAND FOR BULLSHITTING, do not compromise in a deal where you are the only one constantly pulling the rope to keep your relation afloat. It's a two-man job, make it a two-man job.
5. Constantly remind yourself to put you FIRST AND FOREMOST, Cant make it to a party because you need more sleep, cant make it to the party because you have a deadline?? Stay in and do what you need to do because the party will take place in the future but your deadline will only give you headaches and heartaches
6. ITS OKAY TO FEEL DOWN, do not expect to feel uppity up all the time because even the mind gets tired of running. 
7. TAKE SOME REST, Never run on less than 6-8 hours of sleep. You treat your body right, it treats you right.
8. DRINK LOTS OF WATER!! try to get in a min of 2 litres and at least 3-4 litres of water.
9. THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WILL ALWAYS FIND FAULTS. what should you do to them?? U-haul their ass to a different dimension called ""toxic friends"" A.K.A DROP THEIR ASSES.
10. REMEMBER THAT I'M PROUD OF YOU, yes a random Person probably on the other end of the world from you, I am so very proud of you, even if you ate today, you laid in bed, if you binged, if you are trying if you are breathing I am and I wish you all the best in life

717,"I am happily married for around 2 years (we are 4 years together). The relationship I have is perfect in my opinion. I live in Europe, but not my country of birth. I live in this other country for around 9 years and so far I always liked it a lot. I have a well paid job in finance and I can say we are pretty well off. However, as of late, I noticed i started thinking more and more of returning to my home country. 

My country of residence is in Eastern Europe and recently there were several less pleasant developments. Which are against human rights, the goverment is stealing tax money and people who are against the government will need to face some consequences. My home country is a very modern and decent country. For that reason, I am thinking more often about moving back. 

I tried to start discussing this with my wife, but in general she just starts crying and tells she doesn't want to leave. Personally, I like the country, but the political developments are quite worrying for me. Next to that, I am not used to such things happening in my country. 

I would already like to explore moving back. With this I mean; starting my job hunt, searching for a place to live (we could live with my parents place for some time) and other formalities. My wife is not interested in this at all and for that reason I feel stuck. 

Maybe, I am acting too quickly? The situation in this country is going down hill in the last few years and for me it seems we are waiting for a civil war or other bad things to happen. Sometimes, I am just longing to be back in my country of birth, not having to deal with the current situation.

I switched to online school this year (grade 11), to be safe about COVID19 and stuff, and also because I hated high school anyways. I changed to a different school last year, and I had absolutely no friends. The few friends I have live relatively far away, so they go to different schools. I'm so grateful to have them, but I never see them in person. I made no friends last year, which is probably mostly my fault. I didn't really try to reach out to anyone because I was super anxious. 

Anyways, I'm doing online school this year like I said, and I'm really just having a hard time. I don't really talk to anyone about how I'm feeling. When I tell my mom how stressed I am, she tries to help me by telling me what I can do to make it less stressful. I know she's trying to help, but honestly I just want someone to validate my feelings and tell me I'm going to be alright. I already know what I can do to help myself feel a bit better, I just can't get myself to do it. I think I've given up. I'm behind in all of my classes and I constantly feel like I should be doing school work. I feel so stupid. I never allow myself to relax fully, because I feel guilty. I feel like I could be doing so much better, but I just don't have the motivation, so it's completely my fault. School weighs down on my constantly. I never stop thinking about my classes, especially a specific one I'm having a really, really hard time with. I break down in tears every time I try to do physics. It takes me an hour to do one math question. I used to be really good at math actually. I just don't know what to do. I'm so tired of school. I wish I could enjoy learning, be interested in it like I used to. I rarely leave my house because there's nowhere to go. I'm just so exhausted. My life is meaningless right now.

 They just so happened to come for a visit on the day my sister tried to kill herself. Her daughter was taken away. When she was taken it was discovered that my neice still cuts, so the child services want to put her in a program. The first bed opens up in a month. Until than she needs watchinh 24/7. Her mom is also going into a program, to get help with alcoholism and mood disorder.
I'm the only one available to take her and watch her, since I don't have work due to Covid. I just need advice. I don't know how to treat her or help her. They used to live with me, back when she was 9, and it was horrible even back than.
I'm really uncomfortable with her having her phone. Since she uses it for such inappropriate things. I have to hide anything sharp in my house, so she won't cut herself. I'm also uncomfortable with the fact that they basically want me to hide the fact that she's going to a treatment center from her until the day I take her. 
Should I even try to correct her behavior? I don't want her to have her phone (they lived with me in the past and there was a whole lot of disruption thanks to what inappropriate things she did on it. This was when she was young, I can't imagine what it's be like now)  but I also get how it would be horrible to loose all of her friends and be uprooted for the next few months. 

Would it be horrible of me to take her phone? How do I address the cutting, and violence? I don't have kids, I don't have any experience in this area. I don't mind taking it on, I love them both, I'm just so damn nervous.",24Nov2020,1
727,"So for you to understand why he blocked me i have to explain some other things. A little over 6-7 months (idk the exact date honestly) i came out to my family as Transgender, with the encouragement of my cousin who i will call- James(the one who blocked me). I came out to him like a month or two before coming out to the rest of my family, he supported me, and that was something i had never had. I was close to James, he invited me and my grandma to his house out in Washington state and we had a blast, as the months after i grew closer to him, i considered him more of a father figure than my own actual father. We talked constantly he giving me advice on how to stay strong and keep going, he was a huge inspiration because low and behold he went threw something a lot similar to my situation as a kid, he was apart of the LGBTQ+, he had homophobic family, and all that jazz... So i went to him for advice, and he gave me dead-ass answer many never gave me. Most of my family thinks he's a pedophile now, because my friend told them that he supported me, and of course now we cant have that(\*sarcastic\*)! but so they banned all contact with James, i was no longer allowed to talk to him, but i didn't take no as an answer i remained in contact with him, telling no one, not even my therapist who's under legal contract and cant tell anything of what we discuss. We talked a lot, i never let him catch a breather, and i was just a very selfish little brat. I've come to realize that now, but i took it so far just to talk to him, that i told him his Aunt who he's very close to was talking bad about him behind his back. which was true i didn't lie to him, but i had no right to tell him that. i made the situation worse with my aunt, it wasn't a big deal, but i made it seem so. And it broke his heart, he ended up blocking me, which is understandable. Its been a little over three months (maybe)  haven't heard a word from him, but he told my Aunt he knew what she was discussing about behind his back. and told her everything i told him. i got in trouble, exposed for talking to him, and yeah. James and my Aunt sorted things out in the end. Now my family keeps a update on if i have him blocked or not. i don't. i want to apologize, that's it.  I got to apologize to my Aunt and i think James deserves his. I've been extremely upset about the hole situation, to the point ive come to suicidal thoughts, but its just thoughts, i cry sometimes, sometimes i think I've gone mental. I've come to the conclusion where never gonna talk again. but i don't want that. and i don't know if he does either. we were very close, and had a strong bond, but sometimes i guess people need a break, which yes he does, i annoyed the heck out of him i knew that sense the beginning but i was only worried about myself and took him away from his family for that matter...but all i wanna do is explain myself, and no further talk if that's what he wants. i just need advice in that area, how do i get in contact with him? today when my grandmother gets home, im gonna go check her contact for him to see if she has an email for him that i might be able to email or a house phone number i could call the next morning, do you think those are good ideas?? or should i give him some more time to breath? help please :p i miss him enormously much, but i dont wanna annoying him any longer, just an apology and some time to explain myself. thank you if you read this- your very kind uwu. good day C:",24Nov2020,1

732,"so i’m (14M) in a small group with 5 people and i used to be really close with the friend i’ll call J. in our group we also have a friend who i’ll call C. 

Me and J were really close and told eachother everything and when we were friends she was in a pretty bad situation at home, and still sort of is. at this time she started self harming. she cut mainly on her wrists. i was never really sure how much she’d done it, and i couldn’t get her to stop. she’d sent a few blurry pictures to me when she was worrying if they would scar. (by now they have scarred). (we used to be close, but that’s because we can hardly spend time together anymore and not because we fell out or anything)

our friend C has only been in our group for about a year but he’s started more drama in our group than we had before. he’s *always* the centre of attention. me and my friends do so much for him and made so many sacrifices for him, and he really doesn’t appreciate us. lately C  has been *really* annoying because J got a boyfriend and because C loves the attention he started arguments and stuff with J’s boyfriend. this part sounds irrelevant it it’s important later on. 

around last week, C somehow found out about J’s self harm. he’s been acting like a prick and in front of everyone, taking J to the side, whispering something to her and then returning to the group. he also keep boasting about their “private texts” even though i found out from J that they only had one, and he talk about it like it’s a frequent thing.

C keeps making stupid jokes about depression and stuff and then waiting for a reaction from J. and he also keeps bringing up self harm in conversations and hinting at J doing it and stuff. every time J does nothing and ignores it, but looks very uncomfortable.

today at school we were outside and he took J away from the group in the middle of a conversation and then came back with J looking embarrassed and quite nervous, and then said this: “guys i have a game lets all roll up our sleeves! let’s show all our wrists!” of course we all said no. C rolled up his sleeves, then tried to get J to do it. she said no, then he whispered something to her and then she started rolling up her sleeves, where her scars were. i then said “ no this is a stupid game we’re not doing this” and he then held J’s wrist. he saw that i saw and then let go (he knows i am quite protective of her and saw i was angry at him so that’s why he let go). i moves closer to J to stop him if he did it again, and said “C, stop being a dickhead”. he stopped smiling and laughing and then went to get J’s bf who i will call K. he whispered something to K while looking at me and J. (i couldn’t ask J if she was ok because we were with our other friends who don’t know about it and i was trying to be subtle about it, and they hadn’t really noticed because it was really loud and there were people moving about everywhere). 

then the bell went so we had to go in and in the huge crowd of people i heard him say something about cutting to K and J because he thought i was gone (he talks really loud) i didn’t see anyone after this. i had to get out of school as quick as possible because i needed to cool off. (i couldn’t ask J if she was ok after school because her mum and step dad took her phone)

i’m really not sure if i’ve explained this well enough, but from everything i’ve seen it looks like blackmail. i think he’s threatening to tell people about her cuts.

is there any way i can resolve this without anything getting too heated? he has seen me get really angry a few times before and he knows how protective i am of our other friends, especially J. i’ve been trying to control my anger more so if things get too much i have to walk out, and he just follows me and makes it worse, and i don’t want to have to use violence to make things stop like i used to. he makes fun of me for it.

it’s always me and C getting into arguments about things because J tries to solve things and our other 2 friends are really passive and don’t back anyone up even if they agreed with them. the other 2 also don’t know about J’s self harming so i can’t talk to anyone about it.

what should i do to try and stop C from doing this? he never listens to anything i say. and what do i do to try and help J?",24Nov2020,1

He doesn’t ask anybody else, like maybe a few times a period he’ll ask someone else(this is referring in overall amount of kids, as in everybody in the class combined), but he asks me questions everyday about 5-10 times (these are not questions he asks about the material for class participation, he just chats with me and nobody else, I also have an A+ in his class so I don’t need help by any means). Which is weird on its own but I can get over that, I could just be his favorite student, wouldn’t be the first time. Right? Today I was on Zoom, he never talks to the people on Zoom, unless it’s me or he’s checking if they are there (just so you are aware). So we are doing a little race to see who can get their work done the fastest because it’s the day before Thanksgiving break and we are all going to get little certificates, I finish first, then he asks me what I’m going to do with my certificate and I say, “I’m going to put it on my shelf with my other certificates”. Which is a lie, my certificates go in a certificate/ribbon box in my attic. He then asks me, “Can I hang it up?” He doesn’t ask ANYBODY ELSE. 

I say, “Sure?” in response.

Early in the pregnancy he quit smoking cigarettes and just smoked weed. I was fine with that but tried to implement some boundaries around his weed smoking such as not smoking around me and smoking outdoors. 

Recently, he has been smoking cigarettes a lot (mostly at work and 1-2 while home but outside) and smoking weed indoors. He doesn’t seem extra concerned about it. I have tried talking to him about 2nd and 3rd hand smoke. I have sent him articles about the effects of smoke on infants and pregnant women. He justified his behavior by saying I loads of people around here smoke weed and cigarettes and there children are fine. Or saying that I drive my car all over and that’s just as dangerous. Just loads of bullshit and not backing.

To try and keep things short, a bunch of drama happened where the rest of the group felt he gave me favoritism. I stayed neutral because I could see valid points from both sides, and since I wasn't around for a lot of the stuff they were upset about I really couldn't comment and felt it wasn't my fight. I also think both sides were doing shitty things, he had said some bad things I felt he should've apologized for but they were also being shitty and childish by talking behind his back instead of confronting him sooner. It went on for a while and his exit message to the group was honestly shocking and hurtful.

In an emotional state, I wrote him a message and unfortunately brought up something from his past I  really knew nothing about and had no right bringing up, making horrible false assumptions and implications.

764,I am a minor and less than a week ago I called a help hotline to try and get advice about what to do in my situation. I explained that there might be abuse going on and now cps keeps calling me. I did not give my name but the lady I talked to must have reported my number. Cps has called 3 times and left voicemails simply saying they are trying to reach the owner of the number and the last time (a few minutes ago) they said this is their last attempt to make contact. I’m now worried they might go to the police with my number or find a way to find my address. I have no idea what to do and I am freaking out. What should I do? Would they report my number? Can they find my address using my number? Will they continue to find a way to make contact? Can I just ignore them?,24Nov2020,1

767,"I was trimming my hand nails today and all of a sudden a piece of one of my hand nails went into my right eye and I felt a sting. I freaked out and looked in the mirror to see if it lodged into my right eye ball,but my eye was clear. I still feel a weird sensation, and a slight sting at times, and I'm a bit worried. I think it hit directly on my eye ball,but it bounced back out. It was so fast i think the blinking reflex of my eye couldn't keep up with it.
I had to go to work, and even thought of calling in sick to go to the clinic, but decided not to.
Should i be concerned about this? I can still still see fine through my right eye,but I still feel a weird stinging sensation sometimes. Should I get it checked?

768,"I'm (25f) debating on accepting a job offer or to keep search for a job in my current field.

I work in accounting and have an associates. It's a safety net type of job for me. I'd put my skills entry to intermediate still places of improvement. Worked at my families company for years which is how I learned. Last year I worked 2 temp jobs and gained new experiences.

I reached out to a company that I had a good experience with recently, and asked if they had any openings ideally for accounting. Unfortunately they didn't, but the owner asked if I would willing to meet up. He offered me a different job. They offered me a customer support type of job that would most likely evolve to scheduling and other duties. He offered me a good rate, $19 in the PNW area. (minimum wage is 15) I already understand their system, so transitioning wouldn't be too hard.

So, I'm currently debating on taking a job with a company I love, but try a different field. But I'm nervous since its a different type of job then I'm use to. I don't have a lot of customer service exactly... I do have receptionist experience. Might be good for me to try something different. 

Might also be better for me to stay in my current field  and continue building on my resume. Any job I've worked for I learned pretty quickly and worked diligently. I could probably find an ideal company if I keep searching, but not sure. Plus the pay rate for my field is pretty good. Start out at 17-20 and work  my way up. 

I'm a bit anxious, worried I might be settling. I'm worried of making the wrong choice. I don't want to hurt my resume. Like if I take this job, could I get back into accounting type field (AP/ bookkeeping)... I'm still young and honestly haven't worked for a wide variety of companies. Spent 5+ years with my families company which was a huge privilege and blessing.   
I am considering switching fields in the next 5 years anyways. Planning on learning some code this next year and hopefully take some classes at a local community college.

I have anger problems and have ever since I was a kid. I will lash out and hit people or break items, I will manipulate the other party to think it's their fault entirely. I believe I'm a product of my environment as my adopted parents were like this also. I have now ruined my marriage because I lashed out on my husband for telling me to stop drinking when I was already too drunk.  I couldn't control myself. I hit him multiple times, I fought for over an hour ... Not realizing the consequences that would follow.
He now wants to leave me, actually I have to leave because it's his house. But, he threatened to take my child away also. He's 3. I understand and take full responsibility for what I have done and I praise my husband for sticking around 5yrs during times similar to this. This time being the worst. I've been physically violent in the past I always promise to change and once I'm triggered, I can't control it. 
It's time to gain myself and my life back. I have caused alot of hurt and pain onto him. My child has watched too much happen and I don't want this cycle continuing. I feel very very guilty. 
I am in search of anger management help and therapy. I truly want to change . But I'm so scared that once I'm triggered I won't be able to control my outburst. The last thing I want is to lose my kid. I have lost myself in this life. I do not have an identity anymore and I've felt very lost for a very long time.
I feel very alone and very sad and guilty. Since this happened he is working out, cleaned his beard up nicely , logging into old accounts that previously he got rid of due to chatting with women and flirting. I'm really trying to tell myself he deserves to do what he wants since he's ended it with me. But I can't help to feel overwhelmingly jealous. I did do this to myself and I take full accountability. But dammnnnnn this is hard.. 
If anyone has anything positive to say, any realizations I should take from this, anything. I am open to it. Where do I go from here? How do I get myself right again? How do I not feel jealous? How do I get over the guilt and forgive myself? I'm very hurt by what I've done.",24Nov2020,1

775,"Long story short: I (21F) told my mom there needs to be boundaries with the way she talks about my father to me.

Long story not short:

My mother hates my father. He cheated on her when she was pregnant with my oldest brother, and was an alcoholic. I know this because I sat on the living room floor as a child, listening to her explain in detail to her mother-in-law how she caught him cheating on her with his brother's wife. Then I witnessed them argue, him throw a glass candle, and her call the police on him. Then I visited him in some hospital when they were separated and he was in AA. I think it was a hospital. I have no idea.

I've heard them fight in the middle of the night as a kid. I'd cry and throw pennies at my wall to try to get them to hear me and to stop. I'd yell ""get a divorce"". When I mentioned how I have those memories she said ""all this time I was glad someone else was able to hear it, and you're saying this to me"". Like I am at fault for saying it was not right of her to talk bad about him to me when that's what I'd witness growing up.

She says he abuses her. I've never witnessed it. I know they've both been physical in the past before they were separated, but now she'll feel like her face is burning and passive aggressively accuse him of putting chemicals in the room. He'd obviously pick up on this, and get mad that she'd accuse him of this.

Two years ago I begged her to stop talking about him to me because it's ruining my perception of relationships. She hasn't.

When he stopped drinking he picked up RC planes as a hobby. Today, after complaining about this hobby 3 times, she reads the credit card bill to me. I guess he got a new RC plane. She says ""I want out so so bad"". (She doesnt have a job). I flip. I say ""I can't take this anymore. I've been trying to have boundaries for years"" she gets mad and says she's been trying to get help. I say it should never have been put on me like this my whole life, that it's not the children's burden. She says something like ""well if I never had children..."" I did not hear what she said but i'm assuming it had to do with being trapped him a marriage. I mention it being unhealthy for me to feel like I'm in a bad marriage myself at this point. She tells me ""don't say shit like healthy unhealthy especially when you have told me I need therapy and help"", and I said ""you do."" She goes on about how there are people with cancer and there are people who grew up when America was shit and involved in World Wars. I said that if people don't fix themselves they pass it on for generations. Then I said that I'll be certain to seek therapy (I already have and will again) before having kids because I wouldn't want them to grow up in a broken home. She laughed and just repeated the words ""broken home"" and then walked away. 

We've had arguments where she said ""you're not my daughter anymore"" or she's mentioned her dad dying of cancer when she was 9, and often times bring up stuff that are my symptoms of my depression as a way to win the argument. I never mentioned being depressed, I kinda wish my parents were able to see that wihtout having too,  especially when they'd mention clear signs. I once cried and told my father ""nothing makes me happy anymore"". He said that scared him to hear, but a month later made a joke about it. I don't know what to do. I'm starting to hate my entire family, but cutting them off with make me feel guilty. I just wish they would get their shit together, because that burden makes it hard for me to feel the strength to get my shit together. Makes me not trust people I date. Makes me envious of my best friends just for having a healthy home. Makes me emotionally unavailable people because I \~relate\~ to them. Shits hard.",24Nov2020,1

777,"This may be a lot. I recently moved in to AK in a cute apt with my gf of 3 years and her bestie from 8th grade up until now. Everything's been okay and the apt is coming along nicely (we're all home bodies and want our place to feel like home so we make a lot of art and shop together for our space to feel nicer)

I love them both so much, they're both amazing people

Before the situation that I'm about to embark on, let me give you one backstory to why this might be occurring. We recently banned her FWB from coming over because he is openly verbally abusive to her in front of us. This guy has said some FUCKED up shit to her, to the point where we lay awake at night wondering if we need to go deescalate the situation. Hes nice and charming and then hes not, talking about her appearance negatively all the way down to ""it's so easy to make you cry, it's so easy to crush you, I have no feelings"" blah blah blah .. weird guy that gives us great discomfort. She is ""in love"" with him (which is cool, I understand being infatuated with someone) but I'm positive shes just been abused to the point where she believes it's TRUE love. We let her know ""I'm not your mom, I'm not gonna tell you to not hang out with him, just please dont bring him around the house, hes now banned from our home""

She took it pretty well... I think? She understood and cried a bit to us and we held her

SO... 

Last night I got stoned (it's legal here in AK) and did some house chores. I was gonna make my gf a snack and forgot what i was doing in the kitchen when I saw the dishes were way out of control. So I cleaned them all and placed them all in the sink, everything is fine everyone is enjoying life at this point. The sink is gross and cleared of any pots pans dishes etc. So I turned on the garbage disposal.....

I turned on the garbage disposal.....vwithout putting my hand in it first to check and see if there's a fork..
I have... goofed.jpg 

What a grave mistake....
It IMMEDIATELY broke. just 2 seconds and its fucked up. I turned it off and smelled a fire. I got scared, called RM over to see if she smelled it too. She did, she checked and pulled out a fork from the disposal and immediately got SO pissed at me. (We rent and our landlord is cool and most likely will fix it, we have a good relationship with him)
Shes so angry. So angry. Talking about how bad its gonna smell. Talking about how you always have to check. But after 10 minutes of me trying to deescalate the situation and explain ""hey this will be fixed in a few days, we cant change the past and sometimes we make an oopsy"" she was still on the angry loop of ""you fucked up, you're supposed to check, you fucked up, this makes me so annoyed""
I ask ""I cant tell with your current tone if you're mad at me or if you're just mad at the situation."" She angrily replies with ""not you, just the situation"" I'm like ""I'm so glad because I love you and I know in the grand scheme of things this is such a small problem. Itll be fixed soon dont worry our landlord is cool"" she loops back with ""you're supposed to.. just. Check. And make sure. There isnt anything in it."" At this point I get actually frustrated with her and not just myself. It's been a while and we argue. I laugh a little to try to help it by saying ""I can go buy a sink cage so this for sure never happens again"" to lighten it up, but she loops back onto ""NO. I'm not using that because I shouldn't have to. Itll stink. I'm not using that dont fucking buy it. Just. Check. Always. Check. You should have. Checked..."" this is not helping anyone. I've already owned up to my mistake multiple times, apologized, so now I am actually angry again and matching her energy perfectly. 

It's to the point where I'm putting my boundaries up for this, so I ask ""why not a cage? Itll help make sure forks dont go down the drain when you guys decide not to clean your dishes and put them away. I clean mine and put them in the dishwasher. Why is it so hard for you to""

Obviously I'm not helping the situation anymore either.
Another loop. ""Check. Always check.""
Angry and tired of arguing, I say ""I'm gonna buy one anyways doesn't matter"" she screams some shit. I say ""jesus christ dude. I wont buy one then it's fine. I just dont want to argue anymore I'm tired"" She turns around and walks away saying in a very authoritative tone ""we'll talk."" So I walk into my room too, and talk to my therapist over a call. I get interrupted overhearing her and my gf argue now. 

""How can I talk to her if she just walks away!""

Upon hearing everything from my gf afterwards
I learn
She has COMPLETELY changed almost EVERYTHINg that happened. I'm the one who walked away first now. I also apparently argued that I'm going to her old house to find a sink drain (which makes 0 sense and literally is not possible, A she didnt have a sink drain there and B her old place is on a military base and is already rented out I'm pretty sure) I also was unrightfully and unjustly mad. And I am punishing her for my mistake..

I now know my place is to not try to argue with her again because it takes soooooo much energy. And the loops... the LOOPS. Could drain anyone.

I dont know how to approach it and part of me actually wants to voice record it so she can listen to herself and hear her tone when I am trying to regularly have a conversation. But I think anything I do will actually gravely upset her.
My girlfriend is cool and doesn't pick sides
She doesn't care and she also tried to fix the disposal by pushing the reset button. I'm pretty sure the blade just isnt spinning though bc it's still broken today. 

I want to be the bigger person so badly. I just want it to blow over. In reality I didnt think the garbage disposal breaking was that dire so it didnt mess up my night but the argument sure fucking did. 

Any advice on how to approach something like this without pushing buttons",24Nov2020,1
778,"This is my first time posting so sorry if this is unclear.
I graduated university in June and have since got a job as a TA which I really really love.
I really want to be a teacher and am trying to apply for teaching grad schemes where I can gain a PGCE while earning.
The problem is I can only find one grad scheme anywhere near me that is paid, all the rest for my subject are unpaid.
I’m really struggling to cope with what to do because I don’t think I can bare living at home for another year.
I have a very strained relationship with my parents who are extremely religious and put a lot of pressure on me to conform to their beliefs even though they know I don’t share them (for example, they have told me multiple times to break things off with my long term partner because he is not religious)
There are many other reasons our relationship is strained which I don’t have time to get into, but I think I should also mention that my strained relationship with my parents has really impacted my mental health, which I’m worried will worsen if I have to live at home again next year. I have been prescribed antidepressants and am on a (long) waiting list for counselling. The only reason I am somewhat coping with living at home at the moment is the fact that it was only meant to be temporary.
I am obviously going to apply for the one paid scheme I found but chances are I won’t get it, and if I don’t I have absolutely no idea what to do.
It feels like I’m going to be forced to do an unpaid grad scheme and apply for another student loan, but I don’t think the loan would cover living costs and I know my parents won’t send me anything (they didn’t while I was at University)

779,"I think that my dad being very into conspiracy theories is detrimental for his mental health, and I’m concerned.   
 It started many years ago, but I’ve noticed that these last years, it’s become way worse. With social media and more accessible information, he’s fallen into the typical alt-right narrative and believes stuff like Bill Gates wants to control the world population with vaccines, 5G causes Corona virus and Joe Biden and Illuminati wants to take over the world. To a degree this is all harmless and just theories but he has however fallen into more beliefs that are a direct danger to his health like staring into the sun being good for your mind, eating seeds containing cyanide, also claiming it’s good for your health and spending too much money on natural suplements.       
 

He’s become incredible aggressive, not to the point where he’d hurt someone physically but he yells a lot and he has throughout the years destroyed many friendships; not nesscesarily because of his beliefs in conspiracy theories, but it’s played a big part. He has always been kind of awkward around people and is usually hard to be around because of his stubborness. He’s currently unemployed and lives on welfare. My mom does however work and has a career but she doesn’t seem to have any say in any of this and my dad always talks over her. I always tell him to go out more and actually talk to people instead of just sitting in front of the computer all day and read these conspiracy He doens’t really have any IRL friends and is actually a very lonely person.

781,"( i also posted this in another sub, sorry if that’s bad)

hello there, i’m sorry that the account is so new :) and also sorry for the length, tldr at the bottom 

today in school i was sat with three of my friends, all but one (who isn’t a part of this) are younger than me. i am 15 and will only be turning 16 in about a month. basically i am legally a minor and very much under the age of consent (in the uk). the two friends this is about are both significantly younger than me and will only be turning 16 late next year.

we were talking about the different “sides” of twitter and one of my friends told me that the reason the names were crossed out on some of the things they sent me was because it was from the two of my friends “nsfw” accounts.

i’ve never really experienced what the nsfw parts of twitter are like cause quite frankly, i have no interest in being a part of it. but i can infer what sort of things go on by the name and also some of the strange people i have come across.

i’m worried about them both. they are both minors and they are using these accounts to gain followers, interact with people (probably older than them) and “make friends”. the only way i can see this ending is badly. 

i can confirm that one of them has posted a few pictures of their face, i know this because one of them showed me their account (i don’t follow them or know the account names right now). 

i’m really worried about them but i don’t want to bring it up to anybody as they’d know it was me that said something and they aren’t exactly the nicest people to me already so i’m scared of how they’ll react. can anyone please give me some kind of advice?

thank you :)

tl;dr two of my friends that are minors and under the age of consent have recently made accounts on nsfw twitter. they interact with other people, and try to make friends with people who are probably significantly older than them. one of them has posted pictures of their face already, i’m worried about them both.

update: i found both of their accounts,
the one that’s posted their face uses a fake name but the other uses their real name. i know people should be able to do whatever they want but i’m super worried for them.

also it’s really uncomfy seeing what actually goes on with nsfw twitter and seeing what sort of things my friends (who are children) are doing. i feel like this is a really dangerous situation for them to be in. i just want to help :(",24Nov2020,1
782,"I'm sorry if the formatting is a little strange, I don't use Reddit that often but I don't really have anywhere else to talk about this. I'd also like to apologize if this has been posted before, no one responded so I figured it might've glitched which is why I'm reposting this. 

Basically, my parents want to continue with thanksgiving anyway. My mom is inviting 7 people who don't live with us to our house. 1 of them is my grandma who lives in another state, then there's my Nana who's more at risk from years of smoking (she sleeps with an oxygen tank ffs), my aunt on my mom's side who just recently recovered from covid, my cousin who works at the same place as my mom and aunt along with her boyfriend, and my cousin who is currently pregnant along with her boyfriend. Not to mention that my mom is high risk since she takes immuno-suppressants and my dad is high risk because he has been smoking for pretty much 30 years.

My mom was around a lot of people who got covid, but her test luckily came back negative. I myself, am fairly healthy even if I'm a little overweight. I had a very short run-in with my aunt on Halloween, but that was before we found out she was positive and my test came back negative. So no one around me has it, but I'm have an awful feeling in my stomach about this. I'm not good at confrontation since I have anxiety, so I can't really challenge my parents about this. If I did, they'd just yell at me and I can't really take that right now.

Both of my parents are very conservative and even though they're not explicitly anti-mask, they still play down just how dangerous this virus is. My entire family kinda does this with the exception of my uncle on my dad's side who's on the more liberal side of things. My parents were thinking of inviting him, but he declined and told my dad through a text to stay safe. To which my dad grumbled out loud something along the lines of ""i don't live under a damn rock."" and more complaining about how covid has taken away all of his freedom or something like that. And if he's reacting that way about it, then his reaction would be ten times worse if I said ""Hey, maybe inviting 7 people to our house in the middle of a pandemic isn't a good idea. We should be thankful that we can still talk to them online and not risk anyone's health."" I can already imagine just how much yelling would be thrown my way.

So with that said, I can't share my concerns about calling it quits with my parents. There's no way that they would listen to me. If I could, I would take one of the cars and go for a drive the entire time everyone was at the house. I live in a more rural area on the outskirts of town, so I could probably find a long back-road to drive on. I really love driving so it would ease my anxiety. Plus, there wouldn't be anyone in the car telling me how ridiculous I'm acting for being scared since my parents have done that too. But that idea falls apart almost immediately because not only do I not have a driver's license yet, I don't even have a permit. I'm 15 and 1/2, I can get a permit, but my parents lost my social security card so I'll have to wait to get a new one. The best option for me would be to leave the house and isolate alone, avoiding people that don't live there, but that's not an option either. So I have to stay in my house and I can't try to reason with my parents about this since they've made up their minds.

The only thing I can think of to do is hide away in my room as soon as everyone gets there, but I'm not sure how they'd react, of if they would even let me. My door doesn't have a lock but if I got desperate, I could just push my bed against the door to get the message clear. I know that it might damage my relationship with my family, but I don't want to risk getting it again, the close call I had was bad enough. Even if I was fine, my parents wouldn't be. I'm already lucky that I was negative the first time, I don't want there to be another situation where I'll have to get tested. My family is absolutely NOT going to understand why I'm doing this if I end up doing it. And after everyone leaves, I can imagine a screaming session from my parents, maybe my mom guilting me by saying something like ""Do you not love your family enough to spend time with them?"" Or calling my isolating as an excuse not to spend time with them since I'm naturally anti-social anyway. I just know that the feedback I'll get from my parents is going to be dreadful if I isolate myself from the 7 guests and I don't know if I can prepare for that. I mean, our relationship is already not ideal and if I want to get a higher education after high school, I can't do anything to push them over the edge.

But If I don't do anything to isolate from anyone, there's a chance that I'll get it. It's not like I'm going to be happy around anyone anyway, I'll be too nervous thinking about the situation at hand. I probably won't be able to hold a normal conversation with anyone there because my anxiety is going to go haywire thinking of everything that can go wrong. I won't be surprised if I have a panic attack thinking about how someone could get sick. And then I would blame myself for not being able to convince my parents to cancel. If anyone gets sick I'm going to be overcome with guilt. I just feel like the guilt is going to be a lot worse if I don't isolate myself.

Plus if I get sick, my grades are going to fall behind. I'm trying to go to medical school, I don't have time to catch a plague. I barely hung on during freshman year and sophomore year's not going too well either. I'm going to try to catch up and get better grades when the break is over. If I have a virus that has killed over 250,000 people, I won't be able to focus on school. And what's going to happen if I can't get good grades? I can kiss medical school goodbye and I won't know what to do with my life. It'd be even worse if I died because dead people can't go to school either. I probably wouldn't die if I got it, but I might as well be dead if I can't achieve my dreams.

Ignoring that school rambling though, I can't imagine anything good from having so many people over during Thanksgiving. I'm worried about my aunt because she could get it again and it would be worse. I'm worried about my cousin because she is pregnant and I'd imagine that it would make covid way harder on her. My Nana's lungs are very weak. My other Grandma is also high risk since she'd older and it doesn't help that she's coming from another state (which arguably handles the situation better. Of course though, my parents have been complaining about their governor nonstop, furthering my doubt that they would listen to my reasoning). My dad has been smoking for twice the time I have been alive, his lungs might as well be charred steaks at this point. My mom has a much weaker immune system because she is chronically ill and her medicine makes her weak. The only people I'm not worried about are my non-pregnant cousin and her boyfriend, and my pregnant cousin's boyfriend. I'm losing sleep thinking about everyone else.

I'll wrap it up here since this post is getting a bit long and I've said everything I need to say, so thanks for reading this. I'm completely lost on what to do and Thanksgiving feels so hopeless right now. Any advice at all will be helpful. Even if no one has any advice, words of encouragement will also be greatly appreciated. Wish me luck (since I'll need it) and PLEASE stay safe for Thanksgiving if you can. Thanks to everyone reading this and if you need anymore info just let me know.

783,"I've been trying to plan my day out for a while now but I always just go off track when I'm bored. I can study, but I only do for hours at a time when I'm really focused, but I still have to stab myself with a pen when I get distracted.

After I realise that I don't have anything interesting to study I start maladaptive daydreaming or just read and be on my phone, but even that's getting boring now.

784,"I have been working at one place for several years. I'm getting tired and I am getting sloppy and a idc attitude. This has peeved newer staff and they put in a complaint - although very diplomatically worded - isn't hard to see who their problem is. To try to sum it up it's the amount of swearing. Admittedly, yes. I am in the wrong, and know that it is not very professional, but I do not swear when serving or dealing with clients, and no one has ever said how major of an issue this is before. I have wanted to quit for a while now as I know I am not a very good fit and I want to go back to factory work but seem to always get talked back into staying. Because of this, I am adopting the I don't care attitude which is making it worse and I am finding it hard to not fall into this habit but I do anyway. If I quit, I let down several people who I do get along with, and leave them short staffed, but if I don't, I will probably end up just making things just worse and I don't want that either. On top of this, I know another staff member is leaving soon but hasnt put notice in so quitting now would put them in a hard spot as well.
I cannot confront the other person about this to rectify any issues they have because I should not even know this to begin with. I honestly want, and feel like I need to leave, but I don't want to annoy anyone any further than I have. I don't know what to do, and honestly don't even want to go back into work tomorrow at all.

786,"I've been with my fiance for just over 2 years. I told him about my mental illness in the very beginning, even before we started dating. I am diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I don't cope well with life in general, I fear humans, rejection, abandonment, betrayal and any of these things could kill me, literally. My mental illness is almost unbearable to live with and no doubt, it's hard for my fiance to live with me also. I know I'm not easy to live with :( but I have so much love and want to do right.

We were planning to have a baby, he always told me no matter what he would never leave me, with this reassurance my BPD was in order, I was calm and able to love fearlessly. I'm now 2 months pregnant. Just before I found out I was pregnant, I found out he had cheated on me a year ago, it shocked me to the core, he is the first person I completely trusted in my whole life, he always promised me he would never cheat on me and I believed him. I've not dealt with the infidelity well at all, I reacted with revenge and went and cheated on him and I verbally assaulted him very badly. This was all before I found out I was pregnant. But a couple of weeks ago, he broke up with me, saying he can't recover from the nasty things I said to him and that he doesn't love me anymore. 

I haven't been coping with the abandonment and fear of being a single mum. I've felt in such deep hopelessness. I'm all alone through the days while he goes to work, I have no support here and there is no medical attention here in India.

But just today he has said he wants the baby but doesn't want to be in a relationship with me but he will stay in it and give it a try for the baby's sake. He said he can't guarantee that it will work but he will try.

But I'm so scared. I'm scared that he had the ability to break up with me while I'm pregnant so he will easily break up with me later in the pregnancy or after I have the baby and I don't think I'm capable of being a single mum. 

I'm petrified. I'm sleeping about 2 hours per night. I don't know what to do.

Also, I'm feeling a LOT more crazy (mentally ill) because of the pregnancy hormones and I'm still devastated over the infidelity/betrayal and keep having PTSD style visions of them together - and because of all of this, I feel me having another BPD episode is imminent but I know if I do, he will leave me.

I'm not coping.

Is there any medication that can minimise the BPD reactions that I can have during pregnancy?

I would be so grateful for any advice.",24Nov2020,1
787,"A few months ago, my gf and I split. We are in the same friend group so overall the breakup was not that bad and was pretty clean. We remained friends, occasionally dming each other. At the beginning of November, we were dming and it got kinda flirty, and from there we started sexting. Now at the time I was all for it because quarantine diminishes any opportunity to meet with people (if you follow regulations anyways). We have been sexting occasionally, maybe 6-7 times this month. But the more we go in, the more I want out. The thing is, she’s been sending media whereas I haven’t. I haven’t due to my own insecurities and she is ok with that.

788,"So, hear me out. I'm 20 years old and I'm currently majoring in Marketing communications and PR.

Back in May I got a drawing tablet as a present and started drawing digitally. I always liked to draw but I would take months of breaks between art and trace and just... did it for my own enjoyment rather than improvement.

Now, since I got the tablet I started drawing and I liked it so much.

Right now I'm starting to get into SMM as a job and my favourite thing is... designing the posts. I also accidentally got a one time design job at this company and got paid for it. And yesterday I got into an illustrator/designer team for this online magazine in my university.

I was always sure I wanted to do marketing, but now that I'm studying it I feel more and more drawn to the visual aspect of it. Designing social media content, logos, choosing colours and fonts. Discussion of the overall ""visual concept"" sounds interesting to me.

I don't have any education on drawing, it's simply my hobby and I can't say I'm that good. I would post a few of my works but reddit won't let me 😅

Basically what I'm asking, do you think it's possible to branch out in the visual sort of jobs or should I pursue marketing? I'm planning on changing majors or anything. It's more a question for myself: is it possible to change a path now? Or will it be a waste of time?",24Nov2020,1

790,"I’m a 17F in USA. I’m a senior in highschool and I have a twin sister.

My parents said to both of us that there’s enough money for both of our college tuitions but under certain conditions. One is that we still need to apply for scholarships and financial aid if we can. And second, that we need to major in something STEM or Finance related.

My sister is fine with this cause she’s gonna major in computer science but what I really want to do is being a teacher. I’ve always worked as a volunteer with kids, as a babysitter too and my dream has always been to work with kids in a classroom. I seriously have a passion for education since I can remember.

My mom and dad said that teaching is a dead-end career with terrible salary and job prospects and that if I want their money I’d need to major in something science related. I also suggested psychology but they said it was a worse option.

My only option is to take a loan but I know that it can be hard to pay it back with a teacher’s salary. What could I do to go to college?",24Nov2020,1
791,"I’ve always had a strong bond with my son. His dad walked out before his first birthday and it was always just the two of us. He is currently living in a shared space with some of his friends but up until our dispute, I would see him multiple times a week. 

Last year, I married a wonderful man who’s just a year older than my son. He was initially upset upon hearing the news but eventually came around, telling me that my happiness meant the world to him and that I deserved to finally be happy with someone. The relationship between my husband &amp; son has been a bit tricky. They are both rather reserved individuals and don’t say much to each other. That being said, neither has ever bad mouthed the other and everyone gets along fine. 

We have casually been trying for a baby since our wedding and found out over the summer that I’m expecting. I announced the news to my son a few days later and his reaction was not what I expected. I figured he may be shocked but I didn’t expect him to lash out. He instantly began telling me all the risks I was taking by opting to have a baby so late in life. He lectured me that it was be unfair to the baby because I will only be around for a small portion of its life.

I feel he was using these reasons to hide the true reasons why he was reacting the way he did. I feel that my son feels that he will be ‘replaced’ when our daughter arrives in February. I assured him that this changed nothing with our relationship and would only make it stronger but he was unwilling to listen. I also feel that my son has now realized my husband is not just a fling. Even though we are married, I sense sometimes that he felt, or even hoped that we wouldn’t last. Knowing we will have a baby together assures that he will forever be a part of my life regardless and I think that my son is having a hard time accepting that. 

We have not been speaking nearly as much since all of this went down. I have seen him a few times, he has been very sweet, telling me I look great and taking extra care of me everywhere we go. However, there is an obvious difference in his mannerisms and he isn’t opening up to me as much as he usually would. 

As he does every year, he will be coming over to our place for thanksgiving and I can’t help but feel that this is the time to bury the hatchet. I don’t want this dragging any longer and certainly want this settled before our little girl arrives. Due to various factors, I haven’t seen my son in person in well over a month and my belly has really popped since then. I fear that he could lash out again when he sees me and realizes that he’s really going to have a sister in a few months.

I adore my son and hate having this tear us apart. I have also always wanted a daughter since I had my son. I never thought I’d get a chance to parent again and yet here I am about to welcome a baby girl with the man of my dreams. It should be a super exciting time for me but my sons behavior has really put me down. 

How would you all suggest I go about handling this? Do I pull my son aside over the next few days? If so, what do I say to make him feel better? Should I try to get my husband more involved with him so that he views him as more than just his moms husband?",24Nov2020,1

The only reason I went back was because I was feeling a lot of pressure to pick something, and my loans were coming out of deferment so I panicked. I now am a registered dental assisting (still looming for a job), but I hate it. I want to move out west and do something with the outdoors possibly a park ranger, but I have no idea how to even feel passion for something. I’m really confused and have made some pretty irresponsible mistakes. I see my options as follows: possibly go back to school and use what credits I got from my university as pre recs for my associates or suck it up and work a 9-5 that I hate.

I was really depressed and sometimes would say things that were rude to her after she got into a relationship.

She used to like me before having the boyfriend but I didn't have feelings for her. So I really just valued the friendship and company. One day I said something to her that was about her boyfriend and it was rude so she cut me off. (Sorry if the grammar is messed up in this.. I'm voice texting) anyways, she had me blocked on all of her social medias so I made a new Facebook and sent her a message apologizing about what I had said and told her I quit drinking. I told her to call me and she did. It's been a year since I had spoken to her and I felt like she was rubbing things in my face. She kept emphasizing that she was very happy with her boyfriend. I don't really know how to explain this but it seemed like she was trying to say she was better than me in a way. That's the way that I felt at least.

800,"I’m 26 years old and live a decent life. I have a good job which I enjoy and I’m in a long term relationship. However, something has recently turned my mood sour. 

I grew up in a town that was huge on high school athletics. Pretty much every boy was expected to play something or else they were treated as weird. I’ll be the first to admit I was a ‘jock’. I played 3 sports and was the ladies man throughout my teen years. 

Each year, my school would hold a massive pep rally a month into the school year. The pep rallys were an all day thing that would feature multiple events. The biggest event of them all was the athletic competition. Hundreds of students would compete in multiple activities and would be eliminated one by on

I had won the competition during my freshman, sophomore, and junior year. In the 50+ year history of the event, I was the only student who had ever won three straight competitions. I was fully prepared to win a fourth straight and complete the ‘dynasty’. The athletic director had told me the school would gift me a scholarship fund if I was able to win it all one more time. 

As usual, I breezed through the competition early and comfortably secured my spot in the final round yet again. This time my finals opponent would, for the first time, be a girl who just happened to be a freshman. She was tall and lanky and posed no real threat to me off the naked eye. The final round would consist of a basketball shootout, first to 10 wins. Basketball is my best sport and I felt as if they were almost gifting the championship to me. I took an early 5-0 lead but she ended up getting into a lucky hot streak and won 10-7. She defeated me and became the champion. I was humiliated and went into a massive depression. I know that I deserved to be the one holding that trophy and seeing her hoist it up killed me. The rest of my senior year remains a blur to me. To put even more salt in the wound, the same girl that defeated me would go on to win the competition in her 10th/11th/12th grade years. She got the dynasty that she denied me of. 

Last week, I came across the Instagram account of the girl who defeated me. I found out that she came out as gay and is now married to a beautiful woman who’s pregnant with their first child. Both of them have a ton of followers and she appears to have a high paying job that allows them to live a luxurious lifestyle. I thought I had it good but she’s really living an amazing life. 

I’m extremely jealous of this woman and I can’t help but to think what my life could have been if I had just beaten her in that high school competition 9 years ago. I know it’s silly because I’m 26 and she’s 23 now but I just can’t seem to let go of the past. I know it’s unhealthy to be this envious of a person, but I can’t help but think about it each night. I toss and turn thinking about how she’s better at life than me in pretty much everything and how it could have been prevented had I just won.",24Nov2020,1
801,"I know how crazy this sounds, but let me explain. 

My father's been incredibly racist my whole life as well as abusive. Just to highlight a couple of things: He told me to fill out my race as Caucasian in my standardized testing as a kid and hid his valuables when my black/hispanic friends would come over, openly stating how ""you cant trust the ghetto"" in them. He would HATE whenever I got my hair braided in ethnic styles or if I celebrated my black heritage, so as a child I didn't because I didn't want to get humiliated/verbally abused by him. He had also made incredibly racist comments towards my mom in their last few years of marriage, saying stuff like ""ill send the KKK to come after you"". (If anyone is wondering why my mom married him, he didnt act like this initially when they were together. And I think she was in serious denial and thought he wouldn't treat us the same way. My brother and I also kept a lot of the things that were said at his house a secret from her). 

My brother, I found out later in my life, got the worst of it. When he was four my dad called him the n word for the first time and when the Trayvon Martin case happened, my dad screamed at my brother for getting Arizona ICE tea because he thought my brother was making drugs from it. (I have 2 white stepsister and he never got on their case about it). The last time I saw my father he called my brother (then 21) the N word again, causing my brother to snap and a physical altercation occurred between them. Being the coward he is, my dad tried calling the police and the police were remarkably on our side because, get this, they had WARNED my father to stop calling my brother slurs. Multiple times. I escaped with my brother, blocked him on EVERYTHING, and never spoke to him again.

Fast forward to now. I havent had a good nights sleep since then and I keep getting nightmares about the situation. Im in grad school across the country and I'm actively avoiding jobs in my home state because I'm that terrified he'll find me. He found a way to reach out to me to send me money on my birthday and asked for us to ""talk things out"" and I wanted to vomit. I plan on sending this money back to him and blocking his account, but the fear is back tenfold. Im disgusted and terrified. But more importantly, im angry at myself for being so deep in denial my whole life and potentially endangering my friends of color by having them come over to his house.

I just started this job a little under two months ago. I already feel like I don't want to work here. I don't know why, I've heard from other people I know there that there's a lot of drama at this workplace. I feel like the managers take out their frustration on us. I haven't experienced this directly, but I'm getting glimpses of it. They're still careful because we're a team of people that just began working there.

Thing is, I don't know if I should keep looking for another job. My mom and sister say I should stay put and I should be happy to work there because it's a big global firm and they like bragging about it to people they know. But honestly, the pay is not that good. And anybody could get that job, you didn't even need a degree (which I have, so I'm overqualified I guess). Also, there's a lot of stress at my job. Seriously, it's slavework considering the amount I earn each month for what I have to deliver.

I don't know what to do. I found a job that I liked online, it sounded interesting. I want to send an application, but I'm worried employers will ask why I'm switching so quickly between jobs.

I study a lot so I am often home, and sometimes she just shows up unnanounced with snacks. Because of this, I still keep any plans I set before she shows up such as hanging out with friends and so on. She is about half a foot taller than me and plus sized. 

Because she shows up unannounced, she's usually not dressed for any plans that I make. I don't offer my clothes but she suggests it herself. I mostly don't mind lending my clothes except that I noticed the ones she has used, have either stretched out or ripped. I was especially frustrated after I saved up for an athletic clothes haul and she grabbed a brand new sports bra, ripped the seams, dislocated the breast pad, and stretched out the lining, then completely destroyed the waistband of my leggings. As she put it on I asked her to just wear her clothes, but I don't want to flat out say she's destroying my clothes. I have mentioned before when she goes into my closet that ""oh that's a small/extra small"" or that ""fits me snug so it may not fit."" 

I never treat myself to anything, so the shopping haul for me was very exciting. To watch her rip open one of my new items while she tried to squeeze in did not make sense to me. I don't have the assertion to say no and when I do I'm often not taken seriously, not from her only, but everyone. I stopped inviting her over weeks ago, and she still shows up. My house has an entry way from behind and she knows once you enter the gate the pool entry allows way to the house. I don't know how to make it make sense to her that we are completely different sizes and she's tearing up my clothes.

About 2 months ago, my brother and I fought over something so small -- that is, not taking out his garbage. It was getting really dirty and I was merely reminding of him to take it out and that he can't have his way all the time. Fast forward 10 mins later, this small discussion triggers a big fight. First, he takes his shirt off to probably show his strength, and then proceeds to say something like ""Ok, what the F are you gonna do? You f\*cking scrawny ass! Yeah, f\*ck you. I am not gonna do it!!!"" but in a really aggressive way. You could take one good look at his eyes and see that he does not give a F what happens. After that, I look at him and say ""Ok, there is nothing you can do either"". And I try to go to my room and then he blocks me. Moments later, he pushes me and starts attacking out of nowhere, while I try to defend myself. Keep in mind that he is like 200 lbs, but doesn't really look that fat and I am about 120 lbs, so there really is no chance I can ""win"". However, I need to do whatever I can to protect myself. The result of the fight: I get cut in two different places. I don't know how but that's what happened. My dad was there the whole time, and when the fight happened, he tried to stop us but there wasn't much he could do. Because well, he's bigger than my dad. In the end, I just went into my room and was crying for a while cos I felt like no one really cared what happened to me. I was just thinking ""How can he do all this and still be okay?"".   
Something of this caliber hasn't happened in the past 2 months, however, there have been times where he starts saying similar things which lead to the past fight. I just don't engage anymore, and watch my words (although I didn't say anything bad last time either). I am just wondering what the best course of action would be. What would happen if I were to call the cops? What could I possible say to them? Could I say ""basically this is what happened, could you remind him that doing this further could have repercussions""? Would they trust me? My dad really values his pride, so he advises me not to go that route. But really, would you care about your pride when your life could possibly be in danger?",24Nov2020,1

812,"I honestly have no idea what to do. I dropped it off because it wouldn't show picture. Only a dark blue screen that would blink. They never called me to say they checked it out or that they fixed it. Decided to call today, about 2 weeks later, and voila: they fixed the issue but the guy tells me it has a streak. Still not sure if it's a crack or a pixel issue. Either way, it wasn't there before.

Obviously I won't pay for the fix if they broke something else. I don't want them to keep it either since they'll probably use it for parts. So what now? Should I get them to pay for the whole TV? Take the messed up TV home without paying for the repair and count it as a win? It's a 72"" 4K TV so it's hard to just be cool with not having to pay $140 for the fix when the TV screen is now fucked beyond repair.

813,"
So I’ll try to keep this with as much context as possible. A manager position had come up that is right by my house and actually a location I was currently working out of. I had felt this feeling that I really didn’t want to go for this however with some words from my current manager/my wife really encouraging me to go for it I had ended up applying. In hindsight I do regret this as I loved my current job however the external pressure/family pressure made me decide to apply. I was offered the position of manager from assistant manager about 3 months ago after I had applied and done the interview. I never had taken the time to think when I was offered I just accepted on the phone call after being offered. I had actually ended up turning this down about 2 months after accepting position due to the anxiety I was feeling with taking the position as it had resulted in a lack of sleep (basically went two months without sleep without even actually doing the job itself). I just physically was not myself and not present in life really. This was not a good period and I found it so odd as I have never experienced any severe anxiety with any other job however this seemed to cause it. I feel that it is so much responsibility and I don’t know if I can really handle it at this point. I will admit after this happened it resulted in quite a bit of issues with family life as it had put a strain on my relationship with my wife. After I had turned it down I started to feel a sense of regret as it felt as though anxiety had really gotten the better of me vs really what the situation is. I as well felt the regret from the standpoint of it benefits my family quite a bit. The position itself results in 4 weeks of vacation per year and as well a 20k increase in salary plus potential for way larger bonus. To put this in perspective it basically means our family will be quite secure and able to even more afford a house we had just bought a few months ago. It would give us the room for a lot more freedom.

Now after I had turned down the promotion I was not able to go back to my old job, however position remained the same. I am now commuting about 25/30 minutes away from home and went back to my old salary with no increase in pay obviously. As well this location is a bit different so it has been an adjustment, it is in a more rough area. So now the exact same position has come up again as the person who was in the role is actually leaving in a few weeks. I had kept lines of communication open so the individual who is the area manager has reached out again asking if this is something I would want to do or just stay in my current role that I am doing. I am now struggling so much with this decision as I feel honestly so much rides on it. I really wish technically I could go back to the very beginning and never even apply for the job however that is not possible and obviously the old position does not exist at the previous location anymore. As well too it was a good learning experience to not give into pressure when it comes to career choices and to take time to make a proper decision vs knee jerk. However now I’m struggling as I feel neither choice in the scenario feels good. Either I feel most likely very stressed with the new position as it is a huge leap for me and I don’t know if I can really handle it and really don’t want to feel the anxiety/stress I had experienced before where I couldn’t sleep/function. Or I continue with my current position which means less pay, a commute compared to being less than 1 minute away from work and also the potential of never really knowing when that next opportunity will come up, as well obviously the financial implication of everything as well.

I’ve never been struggling with a decision so much in my life and I really have no idea what to do. I am just so nervous for whatever the outcome is and as well any impacts from the decision. I am just worried that if I take the position I may never get away from this severe anxiety and will be so completely miserable constantly. Or if I just stay with what I’m doing my relationship with my wife may never be the same and as well we will potentially struggle financially and have that as a huge stressor.

I just need some help.",24Nov2020,1
814,"Hi everyone,

As you know now we are struggling with COVID-19 and it is hard to find a job. I have received (finally) my first offer since long time already but it is 25% less than what I need and what I was expecting. It sounds to me that I never learnt how to ask for a salary at the first place 😔The company asked me how much would you be looking for and I said I'm open to the number because I'm really in need for the position and they insisted to know a number not a sentence so I googled an average salary (it is relocation offer to different country so I don't know the cost of living etc) and I said this X is what I found on the internet.

Now I have the offer slightly less than the X but even X wouldn't be enough for me to have a good living as I have discovered that the cost of living there is very very very very high.

Can someone help me out on how to tackle this issue and how to ask for 25% extra over the offer, is it possible? would company agree to negotiate? is it something usually happen with relocation offers? and is there any other things you might have been through you could share with me

Thanks in advance",24Nov2020,1

817,"I am happily married and have been for a few years and this particular friend knows that well. They came to visit a few months ago and I was excited as I hadn't seen them in a long time. They longer they visited though, the more strange things seemed to get. They would complement me at random moments, which I suppose isn't that weird, but it started making me a little uncomfortable. They were making ""jokes"" about my SO disappearing or leaving me and my friend staying with me instead. They kept making strange comments in regards to my body and my hair. It was like they wanted to be with me, but didn't want to actually come out and admit that. The whole thing left both me and my SO extremely weirded out. 

After they left, I told them how I felt and how uncomfortable I was with some of the things that they said. My friend denied they said them at first, then claimed they didn't remember and then said it was a joke. I didn't really believe that was the truth so I cut off all communications with them immediately and haven't spoken to them until recently. 

I just happened to be thinking about it and pulled up their contact and saw that they had called and messaged me multiple times everyday for about a week. Some of the messages would just say ""hey"" and others would say ""I'm sorry."" I decided I would respond just to see if maybe they would explain why they said what they did. Instead they went back into the ""I don't remember, it was a joke excuse."" They did apologize for making me uncomfortable, so  I talked to them for a little bit longer and then I stopped replying because really the conversation seemed to be done to me. This person continued to try and make conversation by sending multiple messages before finally giving up. 

I just don't know what to make of this situation, or what to say to them. I have known this person for a really long time and never really had a problem before, but now I don't feel comfortable with them really. I thought maybe a simple conversation would help, but it really didn't. I just don't know.

818,"I can understand being proud of your child but lately the competitiveness from my parents has become incessant. Somehow, in every social gathering, my parents find a way to list off my resume of accomplishments to anyone and everyone. Recently even, it has spread beyond our friends and family to pretty much anyone we come into contact with. Does my dentist really need to know that I'm the class president?

My parents say they are telling everyone because they care about me but to me it seems like an imprudent ego-boost (even if it's unconscious). Although they won't admit it, they are *very competitive* and it shows through their actions. For example, let me tell you a story. It was a couple weeks ago and I had just finished my cello recital. I was one of the better cello players there but there was this one kid who was AMAZING; he had been playing since he was two and was leagues above my skill level. Right after the performance, my mom came up to me without congratulating me but rather insisting on how I had not been playing cello enough and I needed to practice more. I told my mom about how I was already in 6 AP classes, 4 clubs, playing 2 other instruments and playing a sport but she insisted that I needed to stop making excuses and that she'd heard enough.

I have tried bringing up the fact that they are competitive but it seems to just go over their head. Whenever I bring up how overwhelmed I am and that I need to drop one of my various activities they quickly shut down the conversation with the classic ""I'm not having this discussion with you right now.""

 When I got to 6th grade we got new teacher he was really cool, everyone loved him (everyone had A's and we could do what we wanted in his class). Kids made jokes that he would watch porn on his school computer in class, he would call boys f*gots, and overall say really inappropriate things. But nobody said anything because he was everyones favorite teacher.

Beginning of 7th grade he tuched my butt multiple times in one class, first time I tough it was on accident but it happened again. When I got home I told my mom and she reported him to police.

Constantly, no call backs for months now. Thing is, 3 days ago my SO of many years blindsighted me with a break up. I already have a history of depression and anxiety. This break up was soul crushing to me. I can barely get out of bed or eat, I keep having terrible panic attacks, and I feeling off and on sucidial. Last night I was curled up in a ball shaking, crying, and more or less screaming. No, I do not have the option to see a therapist, although I'd love to. 

Anyway, today I woke up to an email for a legit seasonal job offer (odd though since I didn't even interview, but guessing they aren't being picky). They are ready to start a background check, and I'm supposedly waiting for more emails. The timing makes me sick to my stomach. 

I need cash, I need any opportunity I can get, I'm so poor and with little resources, but already starting a new job is anxiety inducing to the max for me.

He's been getting increasingly frustrated and upset that he's not able to get a relationship.

838,"Hey!

I'm a first year student (18F) in Sciences of Life &amp; Earth at uni. I live in the south-east of France, and from time to time I wonder if I'm doing the right thing.

To explain more, I LOVE nature, I LOVE animals to death, and I LOVE drawing (both traditionally and digitally). I've never been interested in science until my 16 when I started my second year of highschool in Sciences/Technologies of Laboratory/Biotechnology. My last year of hs was the best of my life, and that's when I trully felt in love with science and studying life beings.

I want to become a wildlife scientist and/or biologist and/or marine biologist and/or zoology. I want to travel around the world to study all kinds of animal specie, see all kind of environment, from jungles, to deserts, to volcanoes.  
On the art side, I've always been drawing but I seriously started a few years ago. I want to become a wildlife/animal/creature illustrator.

My parents are super supportive in whatever I do, that is not the problem. The problem is that uni is SUPER difficult. I fail in every class, I got NO irl friends to support me on personal and life things. I have no idea if its normal for a first year student to fail this much (most are under 5 out of 20 on exams). I can't contact second year students for experience and help because I know no one and knowing the current situation it's not possible.

I had huge issues in self esteem/self worth/self trust since I was 5 until 1/2 years ago. I'm not someone who's used to hardwork school stuffs even I had really good grades during my last years of hs. I'm super passionate but uni feels like its dumping me down. With the lack of social contact and the absence of that feeling of ""family"" among classmates is horrible. i hate to call myself a lazy person, because I can be a extremelly hardworking person when I get the support and hope.

I want to do both. Professionally. I wanna be able to earn money from both. I don't know how, I want to cry lately because maybe uni is not for me, maybe I shouldn't go in science.. I think zoology is what I want to do especially, but how?? I HATE IT when I can't do it, so knowing i'm failing rn is devastating.  
Does anynone know if it's possible to have BOTH as a career in science and art? I can't find people who do both ; are able to balance between those too and earn money from both. 

I thought about working for BBC Earth, WWF and Natgeo too.

I don't wanna just be a illustrator for scientific magazines and books. I want to be able to observe, sttudy, and conserve species. Work and travel with people whos goals and interests and the same as me. That is like a second family.

I'm lost on if I should continue uni or not, any advices on staying motivated on that? What should I do? I'm not sure if I properly study and spend a good time on that.  
I thought.. should I take a gap year? I'm scared I'm too desorganized for that tho... 

Spending my life drawing and painting animals for a living, both for the animation industry and others ; and spend my days driving in a 4x4 through the savannah on  a sunrise is what I wish for. I just can't see any hope atm.  


Any advices?

839,"I'm debating on buying one right now. I've found one on marketplace for 800, in the box. 

I'm having trouble convincing myself to pay this much though. Heavily on the fence.

I guess I'm wondering if the extra 300$ is even worth it If the PS5 will be readily available soon..

Question is, how soon will that be? 

If it will only be a week or two, I'll just wait. If it's months, I'm buying the scalped one.

It's just so hard to get one retail priced now. I tried to buy from Walmart last time they got stock and the website straight up shit the bed and by the time it unshitted all the stock was gone. Fuck.

So, should I buy one scalped? How long will it be before I can just go to the store and buy one legit?

840,"I’ve always had a strong bond with my son. His dad walked out before his first birthday and it was always just the two of us. He is currently living in a shared space with some of his friends but up until our dispute, I would see him multiple times a week. 

Last year, I married a wonderful man who’s just a year older than my son. He was initially upset upon hearing the news but eventually came around, telling me that my happiness meant the world to him and that I deserved to finally be happy with someone. The relationship between my husband &amp; son has been a bit tricky. They are both rather reserved individuals and don’t say much to each other. That being said, neither has ever bad mouthed the other and everyone gets along fine. 

We have casually been trying for a baby since our wedding and found out over the summer that I’m expecting. I announced the news to my son a few days later and his reaction was not what I expected. I figured he may be shocked but I didn’t expect him to lash out. He instantly began telling me all the risks I was taking by opting to have a baby so late in life. He lectured me that it was be unfair to the baby because I will only be around for a small portion of its life.

I feel he was using these reasons to hide the true reasons why he was reacting the way he did. I feel that my son feels that he will be ‘replaced’ when our daughter arrives in February. I assured him that this changed nothing with our relationship and would only make it stronger but he was unwilling to listen. I also feel that my son has now realized my husband is not just a fling. Even though we are married, I sense sometimes that he felt, or even hoped that we wouldn’t last. Knowing we will have a baby together assures that he will forever be a part of my life regardless and I think that my son is having a hard time accepting that. 

We have not been speaking nearly as much since all of this went down. I have seen him a few times, he has been very sweet, telling me I look great and taking extra care of me everywhere we go. However, there is an obvious difference in his mannerisms and he isn’t opening up to me as much as he usually would. 

As he does every year, he will be coming over to our place for thanksgiving and I can’t help but feel that this is the time to bury the hatchet. I don’t want this dragging any longer and certainly want this settled before our little girl arrives. Due to various factors, I haven’t seen my son in person in well over a month and my belly has really popped since then. I fear that he could lash out again when he sees me and realizes that he’s really going to have a sister in a few months.

I adore my son and hate having this tear us apart. I have also always wanted a daughter since I had my son. I never thought I’d get a chance to parent again and yet here I am about to welcome a baby girl with the man of my dreams. It should be a super exciting time for me but my sons behavior has really put me down. 

How would you all suggest I go about handling this? Do I pull my son aside over the next few days? If so, what do I say to make him feel better? Should I try to get my husband more involved with him so that he views him as more than just his moms husband?",24Nov2020,1
841,"So I'm f16 and living with my parents. As a background, my dad has anger issues and my mom may be undiagnosed bipolar- I have no proof of this but I have suspected this for a few years now. (this will be long)

Today I had to go to school for testing (I'm normally an online student) at 8 am and finished around 9:30. I asked my mom to come to get me but she was still angry from another fight the night before and didn't answer me. So I asked my dad, and he said he had a meeting for work. (They both knew full well I'd need a ride home,) I told him that was okay and that I could wait a bit if needed. I said not to come. I then put down my phone and didn't check it for a few minutes (less than 10 minutes) because I was in the middle of doing homework so I wasn't wasting my time, I was on vacation and needed to complete the work I missed. (My parents are also very naggy and sometimes hurtful over grades and it stresses me out.) I opened my phone about 10 mins later to like 10 text messages from him all getting increasingly angrier and saying where was I he was missing his meeting. (Note: the school is 10 mins away from my house and he works from home so he would have just then arrived at the school.) I immediately jumped up and got my stuff and started walking to where he was. I explained to him while I was walking that I was walking as fast as I can and that I was doing homework. He started yelling over text ""GET THE F OUT HERE"" - he likes to not swear by using the letter f to make him not look bad I guess- and when I got out there he was gone. I texted him and asked if he had left and he said yes. He word for word said, ""have fun walking home."" He also called me a selfish ignorant little brat among others. All I told him was that I believed it was his fault as I told him not to come and that I believed he was not ready to parent me as that was a very inappropriate way to talk to me. I said it very calmly and politely.

Note that the walk from the school to my house is about four miles and almost an hour walk. It was 38 degrees at the time. Along a very busy road, as well. We aren't in a bad neighborhood but not an extremely safe one either, there are still r\*\*\*s, kidnapping, gangs, and lots of shootings and robbery. 

At that point, I decided to stop at my boyfriend's house because it was 3 miles away instead of 4. My mom was aware that I have been going there at least once a day because he is on vacation and I am feeding his pets and checking in on his grandma and walking his dog. I walked the dog and then did homework as I talked to his grandma for a few hours. When I went home, it was around 1:30. I walked the final mile home and I went to my room. However, over text on my way home, my mom confronted me and said she wouldn't believe me without proof. My father lied to her and said that he was worried and waited at the school and that he told me he was on his way etc. when none of that happened. I sent her screenshots but she insists now that I got home I ""edited"" them and that she must have my phone to see for herself. I told her no because I said 1) they are known for invading my privacy and breaking trust and 2) I thought it wasn't fair that she didn't believe her child first as I do not have a habit of lying yet they accuse me of it constantly. 

I told her I believed making me walk 4 miles in 38 degrees was abusive especially with the name-calling. She fired back and told me that I was verbally abusive for criticizing her parenting in the past??? 

They both have a habit of exploding over small things and blaming me for things that are not my fault or that I cannot control. I don't feel comfortable in this household but I just want advice on how to process this as walking that far was scary and I feel like I am always getting yelled at here. However, they only let me get a small part-time job this year and I make less than $100/month, which I usually need to spend on school expenses so can't save. I also don't have my license or a car, I have my permit but they fight too much over who gets to teach me soI never learned. I am worried I won't have enough money or any access to opportunities to go to college or move out. Does anyone have any ideas of advice or thoughts on my situation???",24Nov2020,1

845,"for some context, I'm 21 years old and my fiancé is 23. We just got engaged this past Saturday and are starting to look into venues and budgeting for a wedding. I am still in college and I'm expected to graduate in this coming spring semester.  My family has decided this past summer to move over 500 miles away to North Carolina. I decided to stay back in Pennsylvania at our family home so I could finish my degree and be close to my then girlfriend now Fiancé. My Fiancé has a full time job as a teacher and is working on her masters. This summer I am looking to attend the Police academy so I could start looking into departments for the fall of 2021. Life has been crazy this past year for me, even without Covid. 

Now for the situation I'm currently in. My father and I do not get along well and he has been back and forth between PA and NC for the past three months. The rest of my family has returned to PA for a week for Thanksgiving and to say it's been hectic is an understatement. My mother, father and sister are permanently moving down in North Carolina after their visit and will not be returning to PA unless for an emergency. My father is an ex Cop and has extreme mood swings and frequently throws things and yells. whenever you even bring up the idea that he may have a mental issue, he shuts it down and blames me for being an issue and point out my flaws and goes on a long and violent tangent around the house and sometimes just leaves for hours. He does not want me and my Fiancé to get married until 2023. He does not think that we can do it because ""we don't have money"". Even though my girlfriend has a full time job at an amazing school and that I will be starting my career in the fall. He doesn't even want us to start planning or forming a budget for the pathetic reason of ""you two need to focus on other things first"". While I understand that this coming year will be a busy and hectic for me and her, it's not like it hasn't been for the past two years of my life. 

He and my mother do not want me to move out of our old family home either, because they want to keep it in the family, and want me to take care of it. Its an old farm house that was built in the early 1900s and has many issues that need to be addressed if I was to continue living here and raise a family here. My fiancé is not fond of the idea of living here either and for valid reasons. we both would like to start our lives fresh and inside a new home or apartment. On top of all this, I was just woken up today at 5am on my day off because my dad suddenly had the epiphany of an idea to charge me for any bills that come to the house. I understand that it makes sense for me to pay bills, but they do not want me to cut anything such as cable, phone, etc. The deal with them moving to North Carolina and me staying behind and taking care of the house for a year, was that they would pay for any bills because I was still a full time student and part time worker. I already pay for tuition and winter classes and paying for bills on top of that will basically put me in debt until I can get  either a better paying part time job or until I can finish school.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a stressful few months for me and this week is reaching the tipping point for me. I've had thoughts of just packing up and leaving without telling them it's so bad. I need some advice on what I should do. Sitting down with him and talking is almost impossible without him getting fired up and angry. I honestly can't wait till they are permanently down south so i don't have to deal with him and his antics anymore.

TL;DR My parents moved 600 miles away and I stayed in PA, now they are trying to force me and my fiancé to stay at the family home for several years, making me pay bills even though they said months ago they would cover them because I'm a student, and are trying to force me and my Fiancé to not plan or budget, let alone not have a wedding until 2023, when we are planning for 2022.",24Nov2020,1

848,"I’m 26 years old and live a decent life. I have a good job which I enjoy and I’m in a long term relationship. However, something has recently turned my mood sour. 

I grew up in a town that was huge on high school athletics. Pretty much every boy was expected to play something or else they were treated as weird. I’ll be the first to admit I was a ‘jock’. I played 3 sports and was the ladies man throughout my teen years. 

Each year, my school would hold a massive pep rally a month into the school year. The pep rallys were an all day thing that would feature multiple events. The biggest event of them all was the athletic competition. Hundreds of students would compete in multiple activities and would be eliminated one by on

I had won the competition during my freshman, sophomore, and junior year. In the 50+ year history of the event, I was the only student who had ever won three straight competitions. I was fully prepared to win a fourth straight and complete the ‘dynasty’. The athletic director had told me the school would gift me a scholarship fund if I was able to win it all one more time. 

As usual, I breezed through the competition early and comfortably secured my spot in the final round yet again. This time my finals opponent would, for the first time, be a girl who just happened to be a freshman. She was tall and lanky and posed no real threat to me off the naked eye. The final round would consist of a basketball shootout, first to 10 wins. Basketball is my best sport and I felt as if they were almost gifting the championship to me. I took an early 5-0 lead but she ended up getting into a lucky hot streak and won 10-7. She defeated me and became the champion. I was humiliated and went into a massive depression. I know that I deserved to be the one holding that trophy and seeing her hoist it up killed me. The rest of my senior year remains a blur to me. To put even more salt in the wound, the same girl that defeated me would go on to win the competition in her 10th/11th/12th grade years. She got the dynasty that she denied me of. 

Last week, I came across the Instagram account of the girl who defeated me. I found out that she came out as gay and is now married to a beautiful woman who’s pregnant with their first child. Both of them have a ton of followers and she appears to have a high paying job that allows them to live a luxurious lifestyle. I thought I had it good but she’s really living an amazing life. 

I’m extremely jealous of this woman and I can’t help but to think what my life could have been if I had just beaten her in that high school competition 9 years ago. I know it’s silly because I’m 26 and she’s 23 now but I just can’t seem to let go of the past. I know it’s unhealthy to be this envious of a person, but I can’t help but think about it each night. I toss and turn thinking about how she’s better at life than me in pretty much everything and how it could have been prevented had I just won.",24Nov2020,1

852,"So I work a retail job as main cashier. I used to have a bit of confidence but now it’s really plummeted because of a few things. 

1. I made a stupid mistake about a month or so ago where I didn’t ID someone for cigarettes and my manager found out. But what she didn’t know was that I had seen her ID before and because she was giving me a hard time and I was becoming a little emotional because of it, I decided not to ID her this time. 
Well, I tried to explain to my manager what made me do it, but because I get anxious when I’m confronted with certain things, I told her that I had noticed that others hadn’t been ID-ing people all the time either (which was true, but i should have told her that I had seen her ID, vs making it seem like I just gave them to her without ID-ing her at all). I apologized for it and she told me we both could have been fired because of it. I don’t know how to move on from this because I feel like I can’t redeem myself from it. 

2. I misunderstood my responsibilities as a main cashier. I was told a few times that I needed to keep a close eye on the register. However, what would happen is that we would also be given these items to put away at the same time. So sometimes I would be away from it for a couple minutes trying to find where something goes and I would miss a customer. Then my co worker would end up checking them out, and then even though I would be keeping a close eye on the register, another one would just sneak up and go to the person already at the register while I was looking away. There have also been times where I would be RIGHTT THERE and someone would say “I got it” and so I would end up going back to whatever I was going. And then I would get told later that I needed to keep a closer eye on the register. 

First off, I didn’t realize that I needed to stay at close to the register as I could. Or in other words, I should only be putting items away that are NEAR the register. I don’t think anyone properly explained that to me. Instead they would just give me a crate and say “use this one because it has items closer to the register” but then there would always be items that were located a bit further away, so I would just put them away myself, because I thought that’s what I needed to do, and then I would miss customers and get confused when others would continually take over the register. 

Now, I’ve figured out what I need to do, and feel both stupid about misunderstandings, but also annoyed because I never got training until later on because the computers that had training videos on them weren’t working. So I had to learn everything right on the main floor. 

I’ve been trying to be a good employee but it hurts when once in a while another employee gives me a bit of a hard time saying something like “(insert my name), we know where you are actually!” because then I feel stupid because it’s RETAIL. It shouldn’t be too hard to figure out. 

So, right now I’ve been feeling depressed because I noticed that I wasn’t scheduled for many hours at all. So I talked to my manager about it and at first she said that it was because of this weird insurance thing, where they could only schedule so many people at a time I think, but after that she gave it to me straight and said that she needs people that know what they are doing in the floor. And I nearly started crying at that point. She asked me if there was anything that I was confused about, and I simply told her that I thought I had it figured out better now, because I didn’t want to explain that I was confused about everything I said in #2 and feel idiotic. Probably should have just been honest, but once again, I was feeling a bit too emotional and didn’t want to start sweating out of my eyes. 

So overall, I want to do better, and I’ve been trying to do better. I do have a hard time taking with my manager and co workers because I feel like they don’t trust me because I kinda ratted them out when I said that others weren’t ID-ing people. I didn’t want to say names but my manager kinda forced it out of me. 

Is there a way I can get more confident and prove to my manager that I can be a helpful employee? I’m stuck because she only has me scheduled a couple days coming up so far, so I’ve really tried to make these past few days count by doing my best so that if I look back I can say that I really tried my best.",24Nov2020,1

18m btw. this might not even be a problem but i feel like im unable to express my emotions. sometimes i feel like i just want to cry and let it out but i just can’t. i have been a lot happier than before but recently it just feels kind of numb. i am closeted ex muslim so most of my day is basically a front so i can understand how this may affect me mentally but i don’t know what to do about it. i do feel happy but i rarely feel actually sad anymore, i just feel numb and i don’t know if that is healthy. i also struggle with anxiety and have trouble expressing myself confidently with most people but even when i’m alone now i feel like i don’t know how to express my sadness or anger, i know it’s their, i can feel it but that’s it. it just weighs heavily on my heart and mind and just stays there. and yeah i just feel bottled up and can’t open. i’m just confused about how i feel. feel free to ask questions if you want more context. what can i do?",24Nov2020,1
856,"I live in a house with family, 7 people total. There's one shower in the house, so I've been told to take showers at night since I take long showers. My shower itself isn't necessarily long, but I'm mixed raced and have skin conditions, so I have more of a routine than everyone else that just hops in to clean their body and shampoo/condition. 

I do not like not being able to take a shower in the morning; I sweat at night and I feel disgusting through the day if I don't get at least a quick rinse in the morning. Plus, most of my hair care products are for after shower use; it doesn't make much sense to even have them if they'll only be used before I go to bed. I know I can do a silk wrap at night to manage my hairstyle the next day, but still. 

Is it fine to only shower once at night? Are feminine wipes enough to be clean to start the day, or are there things I can do/products I can use in lieu of a shower?",24Nov2020,1

862,"(Sorry if this is in the wrong place.) 

For their sake (I don't know if they'll ever find this), I'm not going to identify them at all. No gender. No age (though, it's implied that they're well over 18). No nothing. 

This relationship is mentally and emotionally taxing, and I just don't know what to do with it anymore. 

Like, I care about them a lot. I and my family love them to pieces, as we've all grown up together in the same house and shared many experiences. But, a lot of family-based struggles have been made because of them. They never seem to learn from their mistakes. They just say they'll do better, but then do the same or even worse actions again. The worst part is that they are older than I am. In fact, in our family, they're older than most of the ""children"" in the family. People are suppose to look up to them, but they keep playing the victim, keep complaining that people's expectations of them are too high, despite the fact that they can legally live alone.

Everyone always tells me that I'm the closest to them, and to an extent, I am. But, for that reason, whenever I try to tell them that they need to act their age, they get defensive and hostile.

""I sound like everyone else."" 

It's tiring and frustrating. I wouldn't be so much at a standstill with them if they just got their act together. They have it so good because of all of our efforts. We've given them everything they could need, yet they still choose to bring nothing but anguish to our family. 

They never take accountability for their actions, and when they do, it's because someone else told them to OR they need something from you. That's how shallow and silly they are. They are also lazy. They'll never go out of their way to help you with anything, but the instant you start returning the favor and stop helping them, they want to tell anyone who will listen about how you're mad at them. They don't like putting in effort and say rude things to you if you do. I played a sport for a time in school, and because another family member held it over their head that *they* didn't try as hard when they were in a sport, they told me that I should have never played the sport. All just because they were being compared to me, often for their lack of effort. 

Being compared to anyone that is around their age is also an issue for them. (That, in itself, is a story of its own.) 

For me, I've tried to stop interacting with them only to be told that we need to work together to make this work. Mind you, it's not them that ask or even acknowledge that I've stopped communicating with them. It's the rest of the family that does, and they pressure me to talk to them, despite how much I don't like doing so anymore. 

Whenever some *is* mad at them, they don't try to solve the issue. Rather, they expect others to solve it for them because they are unable to come right out and apologize for their behavior.

It just seems like I'm the one that's putting in my best effort. They're just benefitting from the fact that I can't seem to talk about this issue without both of us being yelled at. 

There are many, many, MANY really bad instances (the kind that would give an entire neighborhood the impression that you're family's broken / trashy) I can pull up with this person, including a few that highlight how they've nearly (or actually have) dragged our family through the mud with their lackluster decisions. 

But, I don't want to get into those. Despite how much of a pain they are, I love them. The thought of bad mouthing them at any point makes me feel awful, but at the same time, they seem to have some moral dissonance. Like, their bad actions don't just affect them, but the rest of our family. They're extremely selfish, and it's to a point where I don't like talking to them about anything but video games now. School? An issue. Social life? An issue. 

I'm truly at a loss. 

I love them to pieces. I just wish they would stop playing the victim, stop acting like everyone's out to get them, stop hiding in the back and praying that no one will notice them not lifting a finger to help anyone else, and be accountable. They aren't a child anymore

How should I carry out the rest of our relationship?",24Nov2020,1
863,"The title pretty much explains it. I(F18) am recovering from an eating disorder relapse, which for some reason has particularly ruined my hair. It won’t stop falling out and thinning, and heat damage has caused my already brittle hair to have different lengths in ‘chunks’.


I barely go to the hairdresser as it is, hence why I want to work on it. However, I’m beyond insecure to go, due to my hair being a literal trainwreck. What I’m wondering is, is that will my hairdresser understand my situation or judge me too much? I’m honestly so tempted to try and cut it myself, which will inevitably end in disaster. I’m beyond anxious to even book an appointment over the phone, let alone actually tune up in person.

869,"Lately I have been using people on reddit videos (like radio tts and whatever where an artifical male voice reads reddit posts) to fall sleep because I have sleeping problems and the voice helps me to doze off. My whole childhood and teenagehood i only had lucid dreams, that stopped some while ago but some years ago I started having sleep paralysis like once a month, but just for a few seconds or a minute and my morning sleep is weird anyways cause I seem to sleep walk (just do little things in my room or talk to people) and forget all of it.
Now, lately I have been waking up at like 3 am hearing the reddit voice, like that artificial computer reading voice and so i obviously check my phone and the scary part is : the video is over and goes like 15 minutes only anyway, meaning I went to bed at like 12 am, listened to the video for 5 minutes or so, fell asleep, the video ended at like 00:15 and then the video stops and i don't have autoplay, so I can't wake up from other videos again. But as said, I wake up at like 3, no video plays and the voice is reading something as always, and as I get a little bit more awake I realize that it's not actually reading anything in particular cause I'm just imagining it.
That would be fine if it would just stop, but the moment I focus on it i can hear this exact voice explaining how i (it calls me by name) just realized that that's weird and how I'm now becoming more scared, which obviously scares me lol.
Its literally so scary as you imagine since it's not like imagined, it's like i still have earphones in, which I don't, im looking around in my room like wtf is that, and it's commenting on what I'm doing and how I'm feeling and it just fades away after a while.
I don't have schizophrenia (as far as I'm concerned LOL)
And it sounds like sleep paralysis but I swear I feel super awake, super alert, I'm looking around and wonder why I'm still hearing that voice commenting on my inner world, it's super realistic and how I'm asking here wtf that is because I never experienced that.
If you read this far, congrats.
If you know what this is or ever experienced smth similar please let me know.

874,"So this may be a bit of a long one but please bear with me. I would love to hear from multiple people about what they think.

I graduated law school back in the Spring of 2018 and for a few months I just kind of sat around. For those not aware, most law grads apply to take the bar exam in July after they graduate (approximately 2 months later). I did not. I took a break and managed to find employment as a court clerk the following October. It was great; wonderful people, working in the area of law I was interested in, State benefits, public interest loan forgiveness for a massive amount of student loan debt, and a 9-5 schedule. Plus, my boss allowed me to go on partial hours when I studied for and eventually took and passed the bar exam the following February. The cons though were pretty glaring, horrible pay, a 40-minute commute both ways, and the work was all clerical, not actual practice. 

Fast forward to August 2020. I had been interviewing with a private firm who was going to take me on as an associate attorney for $52k/year doing work in my practice area. He told me he would be active in training me, be available to answer any and all questions, and would ease me into the job. The last point was a big point for me. Lots of attorneys when they start get inundated with work and are basically left to sink or swim. I did not want that. I wanted to learn how to do this job with someone willing to invest time into me; not just use me as an extra body. I put my two weeks in at the court and eventually started at the firm. 

Within a day I learned that everything the firm promised me was a total lie. They dropped a long list of their clients on me, one-third of which were set for trial within TWO months and zero work had been done on their files. No witness lists, evidence lists, caselaw references. Nothing. Additionally, when I asked where I should start, the supervising attorney said, ""read the file."" No additional clarification at all apparently. These were not run of the mill defense cases, these were complex legal issues at play that rested on things like hearsay. Finally, when I tried to call him, he shut his phone off for the day and I only got a hold of him by contacting the office manager. He called me back 4 hours later. Only two days had gone by and I realized if he couldn't keep his promises two days in then I couldn't trust him going forward. So before even signing the W4 I told him I would not be working for him. He simply hung up the phone on me after saying drop your laptop off at the office.

Immediately after quitting I called the Chief Clerk of the district to ask if I could have my job back. He told me he would put his neck out for me to get my job back but he needed to know I really was serious about coming back. I said I was and he said he'll call me back. The next day I found out that HR would not authorize me to be rehired because of a shortage of funds as a result of COVID. I was stuck. I applied to approximately 50 jobs for a month and a half for positions mainly as a lawyer to other administrative jobs. I only received one response during that time and it was a rejection.

Then in October I got a call back from my job saying if I wanted to come back I could but I would have to agree to work for 9 months. I asked for some time to think, and they gave me 36 hours to decide between trying to look around or get paid again. I reluctantly agreed because my savings were getting eaten into and I was disheartened. At the moment I'm back where I was and I truly hate my job. Love the people but just hate the work.

Finally, this past Wednesday I got a call from an old employer I used to intern for. I interned for my hometown's legal department for two summers and it was fine, nothing too crazy. I applied as a paralegal while I was unemployed and they finally got back to me. I told him I was not interested in working as a paralegal but instead I had a creative solution: promote me to an additional attorney in the office for the same pay and benefits, doing the same paralegal responsibilities while also taking on some additional responsibilities in the capacity of an attorney. He was intrigued and would run it by HR and our mayor. It really seems like it is going to happen and the job is set hours, one client, $65k/year, benefits, sick and vacation time (which I did not get at the court), student loan forgiveness, and a clear path to promotion where I could make close to or over six-figures. My problem is I've only worked two months. My boss would be furious no doubt and in fact told me when I started that if I left early then I would be destroying my legal reputation but I am skeptical.

So please, anyone, give me your two-cents, kind or mean, idc. Just tell me what you think.

Thank you!",24Nov2020,1

879,"This happened last August. My mum bought a pizza from Iceland and when eating a slice bit into a 2 inch piece of wood which was hidden under the cheese. 

This cracked her back tooth and she is now paying out for root canal which is costing roughly £1,500.

We firstly complained to Iceland, and they asked for us to send in the piece of wood in a prepaid envelope which they sent over. We sent this as instructed, however then Iceland denied ever receiving this envelope. So we have lost the piece of wood. However we have photos of the piece of wood.

We phoned again, and told them about the dentist situation. The dentist could see that the tooth had cracked because of biting down on something hard and she wrote a letter to confirm this. We have also asked Iceland for all the phone transcripts. They said they would send them over to us however they never arrived.

When i get anxious, i get really strong physical symptoms. I get nausea, but it's the type you get just before you run to the toilet, and sometimes I'm physically sick. I get diarrhoea, the urge to go to the toilet, stomach cramps, and sometimes I've mistaken my anxiety for a gastro bug. I get lightheadedness and have fainted a few times. I get physical shaking, my voice clams up, i might cry, i look like im going in and out of consciousness. I dont usually have a full blown panic attack, its the general dread that gets everything going. 


Im going into second year of uni next year and im determined to make friends, try societies, get a girlfriend. But im worried that my strong anxiety symptoms will prevent me from doing this - i might go to a society meeting/class/predrinks and be ill or completely clam up because of nausea. I've had therapy this year and its really helped me understand my anxiety a lot, and now im able to calm the physical thoughts down when im by myself, but when im actually in the situation that usually makes me anxious - social settings and work - i still get physical symptoms, even if my brain is quiet. 


I've tried medication to manage the nausea /ibs symptoms but none have worked so far. I have tried all the anxiety medications available to me - I've tried 4 SSRIs, 2 SNRIs, Quetiapine and pregabalin. According to my psychiatrist, there arent any more he can prescribe that are for long term everyday use and that aren't similar to the ones ive tried. I know theres tens of SSRIs, snris, gabapentinoids etc, but the problem is, all the ssris and snris have been ineffective, and the other types such as pregabalin, Quetiapine have helped with my anxiety, but only for a few weeks before the effect wore off and the side effects became worse and worse (sleepiness, bad dreams, brain fog). All benzos are only for short term use in the uk, and anyway, they only ever make me sleepy and don't reduce the anxiety or physical symptoms.


Im really starting to lose hope that I'll be able to live a normal life. As i am now, i can't work or be social at all. Has anyone found anything that helped their physical symptoms?


Ive changed my diet to healthy food and making sure i get the right nutrients, i try to sleep enough, i exercise daily if not more for my mood, ive tried meditation, ive found writing things down helpful for anxiety, but all these things dont prevent the issues when im in the moment. If im alone in my room anxious, its fine, but its as soon as im in a social situation things progress. So please try not to suggest random things that help anxiety in general.

Last place I wanna go to is ER bc my disease has left me with no front top teeth I have a few in the back and no bottom teeth in the back on both sides and these front bottom teeth that are were the Infection need to be extracted so im left with 8 teeth altogether after all the surgeries and work I had done failed as my teeth were to weak. I get nasty comments and horrible things said plus being judged when they have no idea the trauma ive been through.im only 35. I suffer In pain everyday and this is a whole new level. I am so worried and scared if it spreads what could happen. If anyone knows about this or has any kind words or advice its greatly appreciated. I know this can kill someone and im not taking it likely especially if say I spike say a high fever I l I need ER Immedietly. Xoxo to all!",24Nov2020,1
890,"On mobile 

I hit someone’s car with my car door this morning (the wind was especially rough) and it left three dense scratches and dented slightly. I left a note this afternoon after work. 

I figured I would do that since it left a noticeable scratch that wouldn’t rub off. 

I gave them my number and said to call if there were any complications. 
I called my mom to tell her what I did and that I thought it was right, and she said I was “not smart” for doing that because I basically just left them a confession note to use against me. 

Isn’t that the point? I’m so confused. I’ve never been in this situation before. Someone’s hit my car before and left a note and I thought it was very kind of them to do so instead of just “hit and run”. Did I do the right thing? 


TL;DR I scratched someone’s car door with mine and my mom called me not smart for leaving a note and my contact info",24Nov2020,1

894,"Just for some context: one of my close friends (m15) of 7 years has reacently began getting annoyed at me (f15) and throwing in a few mean comments about my good grades.

We are in a pretty important year in school so im really trying my best to get good grades, but my friend (lest call him Jim) keeps getting angry and salty with me because of them. Yesterday we got back my grade for an english oral assignment (english is second language) and i got the highest grade. I never brag about my grades, but if my friends ask i will tell them what i got. That happend yeasterday, we went outside for break and he asks me what i got, i was unsure if i should tell him or not, but i did it anyway. He got really mad and started almost yelling at me and said things like: ""you said you didnt even study for it"" "" you probably didn't even do that well, our teacher probably just gave you a good grade cuz you are her favourite"" ""You aren't even that good"". This really hurt my feelings so i just walked away to go to the bathroom and wipe my tears. 

I do not know why he is so mad at me, im just trying my best. Now he is always trowing in mean comments about it in normal discussions like: ""well since you are so good at everything why don't you do it/explain it"" ""oh well you do not have to worry about that test you will probably get the highest grade without even trying"" 

TL;DR  friend is mad at me for getting better grades than him and is always complaining about it.

Do i tell him to stop or just ignore him? Or is there anything else i could do?",24Nov2020,1
895,"I [M16] feel as though I have. Two years ago, I had just gotten into a relationship with an older partner. She was 18 at the time. We met at my house one night and she had brought alcohol. She drank some, I drank some, and then all of a sudden they were both empty. I remember us being naked, and not much else after. I very vaguely remember her going home but thats all. The next morning I had hickeys and scratches on my back. It took about a year for the realization to kick in, even during the relationship. I still deal with the thought today. It makes me feel so slimy and shaken to think about it.",24Nov2020,1
896,"I am the oldest of three, I have a 19 &amp; 11-year-old sister. I have always been very studious &amp; excelled in school &amp; I help out around the house as much as I can while my sisters are the complete opposite. My 19-year-old sister has suffered from a few problems in the past such as bullying, scoliosis which she has gotten surgery for when she was around 12 years old &amp; takes medication for depression &amp; ADHD. My dad uses the excuse that she can't do things such as working a job, chores, even going out past a certain time because of these ""disabilities"" despite her therapist &amp; scoliosis doctor telling them she is in perfect shape &amp; she is more than capable of doing anything. She has recently gone to the doctor ONCE again &amp; they keep telling my parents the same thing but my dad doesn't seem to listen. My 11-year-old sister is constantly struggling in school &amp; clearly has shown to have depression but my parents, especially my dad ignores this. They just yell at her and threaten to beat her every time she does something wrong. She is constantly emotionally neglected &amp; has started to only listen to me rather than my parents.

As a young girl, I was exposed to a lot of things between my parents. All they did was fight every day because of my grandmother (His mom &amp; him would talk shit about my mother). One incident that has stuck was when I was in the third grade &amp; my dad came to pick up my sister &amp; me from school, which is weird because my parents never did this. He gets us into the car &amp; goes on the highway not knowing where he was taking us. When I would ask ""Where's mommy"" &amp; ""I want to go home"" he wouldn't respond. He eventually turned around &amp; went back home &amp; I remember him just taking off his wedding ring &amp; asking me “do you want mommy to have a new daddy” &amp; I just didn’t know what to say but the obvious “no”. After getting home I was filled with anxiety wondering where my mom was while my sister was clueless because she was only 7 at the time. I saw my mom walk in through the door &amp; I remember just breaking down crying relieved that she was still there &amp; then witnessing them screaming &amp; yelling. They are still together after this but still argue every week.

My father &amp; I have never had a healthy relationship honestly. I am not going to write everything in detail about things that have happened since I was a teenager but here are some things.

* Always made fun of my weight as a young girl &amp; never defended me or made me feel better when people would say this to me (developed an eating disorder later in high school &amp; was borderline anorexic)
* Would scream in my face &amp; threaten to beat me if I ever talked back to him. The times that I did it was because he was attacking/ belittling me or being disrespectful to my mom. One time when I was 14 he grabbed me by the back of my neck &amp; aggressively shook me to shut up.
* I used to hear him talk to my mom about how I was a slut apparently &amp; always thinking I was out fucking, even wanted to get my hymen checked. This was because I used to get UTI's often in High School.
* When I would receive an award, there would be an assembly for this at my school. He once complained &amp; walked out at how long it was &amp; started arguing with me in the car.
* When I used to ask for things like clothes he would bitch at me at 15 to get a job &amp; start working &amp; when I took a year off after High School he complained, called me a bum, &amp; told me I need to have a job by the time the summer ends. **All in which I did, I have been working since I was 16 &amp; took a year off from school &amp; applied that next year**. However, when it comes to my 19-year-old sister, he has had nothing about her taking a year off &amp; hasn't once told her to get a job especially now. She just goes out with her boyfriend almost 4 times a week &amp; is on her phone talking to him every single day without doing anything, something I would have &amp; have gotten bitched at for.
* Constantly shrugs off my anxiety but takes into consideration my sister's needs.
* I am the first in my family to be born here in the US &amp; complete high school &amp; attend college. My mother doesn't speak English &amp; I always have to be on top of my family like making doctor's appointments, help with technology such as emails, phone calls, doing applications online, etc., run errands, help with my grandmother, help my little sister with school, giving them both any emotional attention that my parents don't give to them, all while taking care of my responsibilities &amp; personal things which my dad doesn't see as important. If I say no to something or that I am tired he would complain &amp; say how I don't do anything &amp; how I always complain &amp; being selfish.

My father is currently paying for my tuition &amp; constantly uses this against me. I had a scholarship that I was receiving but because of COVID they had to make some cuts and I am no longer receiving it. I really don't know what to do or feel at this point. I feel like all the weight is on me to take care of everything &amp; he doesn't seem to care or see that. My mom has tried to talk to him about how I feel but he just doesn't see it. I have thought about moving away from my family but I don't know if I am just being dramatic &amp; leaving my family with, what I view this man to be as a monster, seems so unsettling to me.

If you guys were in my shoes what would you do? How would you feel? Am I being dramatic &amp; sensitive about these things?

She’s my first girlfriend and first sexual partner.  I had a rough childhood including bullying and alot of rejection from women which explains the late start.  Over the past couple years, I’ve been doing my best to improve myself and my mental health.  However, I recently discovered that before me, she had been with 9 guys.  I know 9 isn’t alot for a 30 year old and most of you will say I’m overreacting and I should let the past stay in the past but it continues to bother me for some reason.  It makes me feel inferior and as if I missed out.  I’ve tried to get over it but nothing seems to be working.  I still have feelings for her but I also want to break up because of this.  I’ve come to the conclusion that we should just move on from each other and find people that we are both comfortable with and can accept us fully.  I’m really stuck at a crossroads because as much as I want to end things, I really care about her and I have a feeling I will regret doing so later on.  I really don’t know what to do at this point.

906,"Last night I was in bed with my boyfriend and I was suffering badly with stomach cramps. He woke up and was trying to talk to me to see if I was ok (he already knew why I was in pain anyway) but because I was hurting I found it really difficult to reply so I didn't. Usually, in these types of situations, he'd give me a cuddle and wait until I could talk properly but this time he just turned away from me and didn't say a word. I was so confused and concerned at this point that I almost forgot about the pain I was in and turned over to him to ask him what was wrong. He kept saying he didn't know and was being very off with me.

I'm a very sensitive person and couldn't stop myself from crying. I'd needed him and he'd just turned away. It was then that it was like he snapped out of something and apologised a lot. He told me it was nothing I'd done and that it was just an episode. He explained that with his depression he also suffers with anger attacks and in the moment for him, when I wasn't responding to him, he'd just sort of thought 'well fuck you then' and turned away. He assured me that it's not how he actually thinks and kept apologising, and of course I told him it was ok, its not his fault. 

We've been together for almost 3 months so it's still a relatively new relationship, and we're still finding things out about each other. We've been in lockdown together for the past month and things have been great and I love him a lot, it was just very surprising to me given that usually he's the sweetest human. I do want to say that I'm in no way worried for my safety, it seemed more like a passive aggressive episode than anything.

My mother has RA, an ankle suffering from 2 botched surgeries, and is obese. She used to be able to handle stairs fine but now she can barely move in her own room. Or to the bathroom to pee. She has bladder control issues, and ad such pees her pants frequently. She pees in buckets, or in her trash can, if she knows she won’t make it to the bathroom, which is about 6/10 times.

She has no leg strength. She has no sense of balance. She cannot stand up for more than a minute or two at a time. She can’t cook. She can’t clean. She can’t shower properly. She can’t do laundry, and she can barely dress herself. I have to help her with mostly all of these. Her joints and bones are so weak because she does not use them and she is so heavy. She falls frequently, and usually need me to come lift her off the ground. 

I love my mother. And I want to be there for her. I was a bum for the majority of my young adult life and I feel that I need to repay her by being here for her. But I didn’t ask to clean up her piss. I feel so trapped. I have goals and ambitions and I almost feel like my mother is holding me back.

926,"So I work in healthcare, the other day I woke up on my day off to a call from my company where I’m a zero hour worker at 7am. I didn’t answer it as I knew that it meant they needed an emergency shift covered (where someone very last minute doesn’t turn up). I avoid it and go to sleep again.

At 10am, I receive another call and this time worrying it’s more urgent I pick up the phone and am asked can I do an emergency shift, meaning that in 3 hours they found no one, mainly because the client is really difficult and the pay is $16 an hour over 12 hours,  Avery long tiring shift. 

My coworkers told me early on that if you don’t want to work a shift then you just say you need a higher rate of pay and qoute ridiculous numbers. That way they decline and say they will look somewhere else.

However, on this day they said yes. I quoted $30 an hour, and when she said yes, I upped it to $40 for the full 12 hours and a lyft to and from the location. 

She said she’d call back and then confirmed that it was agreeable. 

Speaking to my partner they said that this makes me look predatory in the eyes of my employer and that a future job reference will reflect that. 

I don’t know what to do?",24Nov2020,1
927,"23 yrs old and after deciding not to go through with my 3rd suicide attempt I believe I may be a sociopath. I do believe in a higher power, but not in god ,buddha, or anything like that. Simply cause a man wrote it. What comes after life aside. Here is a bit of background.
   Ever since a young age I've never really fit in. I always did well with school work but I would constantly get in trouble. One of the worst times was in pre k. I had gotten in trouble for something and was sent to the corner. I dnt remember why I was in trouble , but i know i didn't understand the reasoning back then. Due to this I got very upset and started to hit my head against the wall over and over due to frustration. The pain didn't faze me at the time. Fast fwd a couple yrs my junky of a surrogate is outta the picture and my dad gets hauled off to jail for p.o. violation. His  gf at the time took care of me for a bit till I snitch on her. I didnt really understand what was going on when I ended up with my aunt and uncle. They showed alot of pity so I acted sad. I lived with them for a good part of my childhood. Uncle was an a-hole to me and his son but he was a good man didnt get excessively aggressive and only beat use when we fked up. Dnt think I ever heard an I love you from him? To anyone..but he fed us well and rewarded us for good work in school and around the house. Aunt was nice but she obviously had bi polar depression. So that was kinda weird .They were junkies too but they hide it rlly well didnt realize for a few yrs. Couple yrs like this ,alot of suspensions and ass whooping. The former all understandable,  later less so but I heard of much worse. And saw slightly worse when his son got in trouble. Except for the time that me and lik 5 cousins are having a sleepover. I'm the youngest and the newest to the group since my dad didnt talk to the family much when he was around. Well after a bit of rough housing in the basement me the other youngest are pinned and had to promise one task to do. Didnt seem like a big deal till later when we are brought to the bathroom where the older brother to my unlucky cousin pulls out his ... Me being the fked up kid I was  had already seen porn and knew what girls could do for guys ..he didnt . Once I woke up from my shock as to what was going on I ran and lucky made it up stairs to snitch. I still dnt know if he went through with it and tbh Idc since I avoided it. They got the shit beat outta them right off the bat. I laughed while watching and after that didnt care. I didnt even avoid them.just didnt trust them. Fast fwd couple yrs I snapped on a bully in school.. blacked out while I had him in a headlock and came to in the principal's office. He almost died apparently but all I got was 3 day suspension since it was ""said"" to be in self defense.Add in he was known to pick others and I got away with attempted murder in a sense. In reality he hadn't laid his hands on me at all that day. I was in a horrible mood and all started cause in kickball he hit me in the face with the ball.So I waited till no one was looking latter during recess and punched him as hard as I could outta no where then snatched him up. 
 Dad gets out ,move back In with him. Still always getting into fights just alot less at school. He keeps living how ever he wanted fond a stripper with 8 sons to play house with for a bit b4 another p.o. violation. Now I'm living with my new mom and 8 older step brothers who almost all have different dads in this shitty 4 bedroom trailer in the hood. . My dad's in jail I dnt reach out to my aunt and uncle cause I haven't talked to them since I left and they got into it with my dad. Now I'm 10yrs old running the streets stealing bikes breaking into cars and getting high like my older brothers it was a fun time and I'm lucky I didnt end up in juvie.  A couple of them did later on .. but who cares they weren't my brothers by then. Step mom cheated on my dad a bunch  I didnt say anything since ik he did too and I was in a situation like this b4. I didnt feel like moving so I didnt snitch on her like I did the gf. At least not right away. Nope I waited almost a whole yr after I was finally sure. During which alot of things happened that I brushed off one after another.we got in a fight and I ran away for a few days over the weekend and stayed with someone she didnt know. She  flipped out and beat the shit outta me which lead to me running away again for 2 days ,but she didnt flip out since I went to school still. I got accused at 12yrs old of sleeping with my 17yr's step brothers 25 yr old gf .. ya he was tripping on something but he really thought I did like locked me in the bed room and tried to tie me up serious. But a kick to the balls and me breaking the window to jump out caught the oldest bro's attention. No convincing needed on my part for him to see he's tripping out so he got beat with a frying pan off the property. Later he apologized and realized I wasn't banging someone twice my age ..shocker. I slept with a kicken knife for months just in case tho. There's plenty more b4 I finally told my dad but I'll move on. He found out , she acted weird around me for a few days but didnt bring it up. That week I got picked up from school by an aunt and cousin I'd never met . Moved a few towns over and just acted like everyone of them died. Things didnt really get better this set of aunt and uncle where great ppl at heart and didnt do anything crazy just rlly poor had 2 shitty kids and lived in a even worse part of the hood. Now I'm getting bullied and beat up cause I'm the only white kid in town. I had always thought I was a good fighter but I was wrong just had a high pain tolerance and was strong when mad. So till I learned to fight it was pretty rough but after you finally tune one up things change. Sadly by then I caused too much trouble for those sweat old folks. Now I had to go back to the first aunt and uncle. Things change tho when you dnt talk to someone for yrs .. now I felt like I didnt belong there and it only grew worse. Now that I think abt it I probablyQ hurt my aunt by never talking to her and that probably
pissed off my uncle. Hence even if not meaning to the distanced themselves. Buy the time dad is abt to get released in Tx I no longer feel like a have any home to turn to in IL. I assumed they saw me a a burden . I acted like I wanted to go to Tx when rlly I just wanted something to change. I got what I wanted and didnt know how to deal with it. I was happy in a sense but not really. New was exciting,  and after being away for so long he's trying his best to buy my love. Slowly I start to realize things were alot better with my aunt and uncle. They had drug habits too but it was different. It never once effected me . Idk abt their kids but ik it never made me go without. Even tho I didnt have many friends I still had a few now I'm in a 5a school vs a 2a school like 200 kids a grade to 1000+ . I got in so many fights.. then once things settled down. We moved into his new gfs townhouse. He found a good one she's been my mom since , but sadly that didnt change much. I mean what is she to do with a 13yr problem child with trust issues a mile long. Not to mention she wasn't aware of how bad his habit could get. I get caught getting high with the kids in my neighborhood. That became an ongoing source of issues every couple of months for awhile. Then I'm not sure y but they started smoking k2 that fake weed. Then one day not sure if he offered or I asked but I got high with my parents. Really really fking high. One time too much and oded at 14yrs old on k2 tripped out pretty hard and swore I saw someone watching g over me during that time still not sure what to make of it. That killed the k2 thing for awhile. We moved again, to a better town this time . But first day I end up fight the biggest corn fed fking Texan I find all over a stupid comment abt the highlights I had in my hair over the summer...didnt get my ass beat surprisingly but it was an easy 60 40 b4 we got broke up. So now I have to beat up a few smartasses that dnt realize that corn fed mf could eat them let alone beat their ass b4 ppl stopped making fun of me. So I set great first impression for the next 3 yrs that was my jr high and high school experience .Come that summer i was shocked to find out they wouldn't help me go to 500$ church camp but I didnt bitch I saved the money up and went .I did the same next yr aswell but got in alot of trouble b4 the trip so he wouldn't let me go... I never saw that money and he never was willing to talk abt it.. 7th was horrible, 8th ok ,9th not bad but sadly I didnt realize itd be ok and said fk it and got a GED b4 10th so I could work fulltime and party. Had a part time job but i wasn't just covering my own habits pops got me for plenty of money too once his kicked up. Moms a highly paid nurse and he gets disability due a work accident along time ago.
But for some reason after we got to Texas he didnt hustle side construction jobs anymore. Now I'm 16 paying for my part of everything while living with them. They decided to move outta the house to cut costs .. in reality rent for a big house doesn't seem logically to junkies. Let's be honest. I said I'm ok with the move but once again I just wasnt happy so I figured y not change . Well once again I was wrong not anyone's fault but my own. 50 min away from my closet friend and I'm working a fulltime labor job and dealing with my depression I never wanted to make the trip and that was the worst choice of them all I think. Now a few months later I have no friends , no goals , all I do is work smoke and game to ignore anything else. Me and my dad continued to have on and off issues do to me not letting go of the past, both of us being ass holes , and me being manipulated into supporting his habit. He's a conn man at heart and I dnt think he means to but that's how it plays out. Only ever crossed the line once and choked me for just a bit and I did push him but that changed things. Now I dnt push when we argue as much to piss him off . Cause I'm worried i will do what i thought abt and continue to consider when he gets aggressive and that's to attack his bad leg. I'm not big, I'm not strong , but I know I can be ruthless. How else could I burn myself with cigars to calm myself when I was younger. Cutting wasn't as effective and it was so much harder to cover up during the summer. Even through all this I still didnt cut off my dad . I ended getting a trailer of my own and saying at the same park . Later on we buy property together. Skip a couple yrs he gets sent back to jail . I'm with this girl who I think I love but honestly I doubt I truly understand what that means even now. We had a pregnancy scare abt the same time I caught her sexting g someone outta state so even tho ik itd be mine I was crushed but I'm not sure if it was due to a broken heart , or something twisted like losing my escape from what was going on . That scared me I wasnt sure if what I felt was love anymore or more of an obsession with escape. I didnt know how I felt but I knew I wouldn't want a child to have to deal with all the shit I did so I told her regardless of what happened I'd take care of my child. That lead to her thinking I dnt want to be with her or something like that, even tho I hadn't broken it off yet.. and that was my last serious relationship.  Few flings later I just stopped looking  and now 2 yrs later still not. I want to but the same time I dnt want to end up with someone depending on me when even I cnt . Sigh whatever I got emotional and just started typing no one should be able to know who this is so fk it I'll post",24Nov2020,1

930,"This is gonna be long, and I'm not even sure if theres anything I (13M male) can do about these problems. Some of these problems tie into each other.

For starters, I'm becoming really horny, love is an emotion I've only ever felt once briefly, but now I'm just generally horny. I keep seeing female friends in my dreams and I'm having intrusive thoughts about them, and I hate it, I want it to stop because it makes me feel like a creep. I just have this feeling of loneliness and I guess I want a girlfriend? I'm not even sure anymore what my sub concious is doing anymore or anything in my head really.

Even if I was 100% sure I wanted a girlfriend, it just wouldn't happen. I'm a tall chubby guy with a birth condition that makes my skin rough and red, and I'm covered in scars all over my arms. I just feel so ugly and even if no one else cares or notices, it bugs me personally and I'm just not sure what to do anymore. My personality probably doesn't help, I'm a larger than life sorta guy on the surface but I'm a scarred traumatized person that likes dark humor and hating things, I also have a very intimidating  demeanor despite being calm and easy going.

I also feel excluded. I'm about as uninteresting and not unique as it gets. I'm a straight male, who just doesn't do anything interesting. I almost never watch movies or TV, I do like reading although never do, I'm into knowledge but that just makes me a nerd.

It feels like the world is purposely trying to make me feel horny, everywhere I go no matter how hard I try to ignore it, theres always something suggestive that triggers it and it just pisses me off. Its like being told you should be free, when your locked in a cell.

I don't know how to close off this post besides saying I'm lost and I need advice with these problems.",24Nov2020,1

I don't think I make enough money to live on my own and I have no credit so I wouldn't be able to pass a credit check anyway. I don't even have a car, so I would need to quit my current job if I wanted to move somewhere too far away.

935,"So on Saturday, I made a really stupid mistake at work.  I work at a pizza place and I do carryout.  My manager told me to go bring this person their food and I did.  I didn't realize that this person didn't pay and they drove away without paying.  My manager got really frustrated with me and I understand why but the thing is I didn't have a highlighted ticket and where I work there are always two tickets with an order.  A customer copy and a merchant copy and on the merchant copy the owed amount is always highlighted and once an order is paid the highlighted ticket goes in a box next to the cash register.  So I assumed this person paid.  My manager also swears she told me that this person owed money but I do not recall her saying this.  When she was yelling at me I didn't have the courage to say that I didn't have a highlighted ticket because I didn't want to talk back.  I apologized for the incident, but she was still disappointed in me.  

I've witnessed this happen with two other co-workers before and my manager did not yell at them.  It was the third time one of my co-workers did it and my manager said it was okay.  My brother also works there and today she told him about it.  I'm very upset that she is telling my brother about a mistake I made at work.  I've only been working there a month and I already want to quit.  Do you think it was fair for her to tell my brother this because he confronted me about it and it made me feel 20 times worse than I did before?  It's just one mistake and I can't stop crying about it and I think my brother is kind of ashamed of me.  Should I find another job because I honestly feel uncomfortable around her now?  I work on Saturday and I really don't want to see her after knowing she told my brother about my mistake.  I kind of feel like she told my brother so he would confront me and make me feel worse.

939,"I’m in my 30’s and currently just began a new job with reliable pay. My family let it be known to me that I’m being a burden. It wasn’t said in so many words. It’s the subtle mumblings, the snark, and verbal jabs. 
My problem is that rent is too expensive on my current salary. Apartments are about $800-1500/month here. Throw in utilities and other necessities like food and whatnot, and that makes things more difficult each month as a household of one. Top that off with bad credit, and it complicated things. 
I’m hoping to find other people that wouldn’t mind rooming with another nerd/geek. I’m not looking for a relationship. I just need to room with reliable and safe people. No racists please. No sexists. No animal abusers. 
My problem is, when I look for a place in my local area, I find ads that are looking for live in partners, people who barley speak the language and sound like they’re participating in some illegal con act with their rental ads. 
Any advice on where to look online to find people to room with, and not just a place for rent? Are there any subreddits for finding local roommates/rental mates?

\- I really struggle to concentrate in these online lessons. I've tried everything I can to get myself to focus but nothing seems to work. All it is is a lecturer just reading from a screen and us students just sitting there. I also seem to find it hard to study at home with all these distractions around me such as PS4, PC and food

\-I started my course 2-3 weeks late because my university took a long time to change my timetable. This made me miss quite a lot of content and I have been struggling to catch up ever since

\-A major reason I am considering this because student life is dead. With lockdowns, social distancing and no clubs and bars. COVID-19 has taken away what made me love university the most: Student life. Because I live with parents back at home, I barely have the freedom to do anything and going out in my area is rubbish compared to university where there is way more venues and things to do.

If I was to defer for now, I had a plan to learn some new skills, get in shape and most importantly, work on my mental health which is in a bad way. I feel as if I have a lot to work on as a person and this would greatly benefit me for starting the new semester in September.

It was to the point that the only thing he would help with in a week would be maybe making the kids breakfast once or twice and that’ll be it. I would get on him about not coming home and helping out and he would come home less and less. I got tired of fighting and forcing someone to be a dad. So I left. Now he acts as if none of us exist. I don’t understand. It hurts. He always talked about wanting a family and how he could never see himself with anyone but me. And now he moved on to someone else.

This has been an issue for both us years before we even met each other, but we've gotten to the point where we realized we have no one but each other to share monumental life moments with.
Neither of us have really put the effort with the people that we did consider friends, and we were apart of multiple friend groups but not for a substantial amount of time..but we want to change this.
So, I guess what I'm asking is, how do we go about meeting new people at this age, or other couples, without seeming like we're swingers lol.
We really just want to be able to develop genuine friendships, which is really hard at this age..
We understand we should've put in effort before, but like I said we're trying to change that.

He hasn't talked much about it either, but he's obviously upset. What should I be doing for him right now?",24Nov2020,1

957,"He's a covid denier and so is his entire side of the family. They are hosting a pretty big gathering and it probably won't have any precautions or people who are concerned with the pandemic. I've never been close to that side so I wouldn't go but since he's going to come down (he lives 11 hours away) I want to but I really don't want to risk contracting covid. I'm not even worried about my safety more so my mother and siblings. If I get it they'll get it due to living at home and my mom isn't the healthiest. And my mom on a sidenote is having a gathering. But they don't deny covid and the only people coming get tested for work, plus it's a smaller gathering than my dad's gathering would be.",24Nov2020,1
958,"My life is a mess. I am 17 and have 0 motivation for my education.  I don't ever do homework, unless i copy from someone else or do it about 10 minutes before the lesson starts. As i'm writing this i have 3 pieces of homework for tomorrow and it is 1am, yet i still can not bring myself to start it despite me knowing i have to do it and that i want to get it over with.

 I also never revise for tests leading to me either trying to copy from the person next to me or either it is a fluke and i get a good result or i just get a lacklustre result and become disappointed. 

This is the same in lessons as-well, i almost never do work in them, i either talk to my friends or even go to the point where i act like i am working hard so my teachers do not get mad at me. Which basically leads to me pretty much understanding nothing, as i never listen in lessons, always focused on something else, even stupid things like how my pen looks for example. I just cant force myself to concentrate without becoming incredibly bored. In which i don't have the patience to bear.

I also feel like a fraud in my school, i am in the top school in my country but i did not work to get there nor do i deserve to be here. I solely base it on corona virus that i got accepted, as i got teacher predicted grades instead of actually taking exams due to the virus. So it doesn't help that i feel like everyone around me is more clever then me. It probably is due to them putting about 10x more effort then i ever do. This leads to me pretty much always being in a down state of mind, all from my lack of commitment and motivation. It just seems like i can never will myself to do anything i don't enjoy, which is a terrible mindset to have. The only things i truly enjoy doing is gaming, but i am not entertaining enough to become a streamer and not good enough to become pro. So i know me playing games will never help me in the future, i just use it to enjoy myself and take my mind off of my heaps of other problems.

So i come here to ask for any advice, how can i fix my motivation issues, i just want to be committed as everyone else but can't bring myself to do it, ever.

Any advice would be truly appreciated.",24Nov2020,1
959,"I'm 21, a junior in my law undergraduate. I've been terribly anxious for the last 5/6 months. I'm not me. I moved back in with my family in March. I get along great with my parents and little brother but I miss college so bad.  I had a social life. I volunteered in a charity shop. My only 2 friends in my hometown live abroad now. I will not be in college again until fall 2021. I only speak to my college friends once every 2/3 weeks. These aren't deep friendships and I really have nothing to say to them anyway and thats so sad. This year I only have online lectures. 

I feel like someone pressed pause on my life last March. I got a bartending job 8 weeks ago and the day before my first shift we re-entered lockdown. I'm serious. I've been stuck at home and in my head for 8+ months. I was OK the first 2 months of the pandemic but now I feel like it'll never end and I'm missing out on my youth, like what if I only got to enjoy 1.5 years of undergrad as opposed to 4?? I feel robbed of my time. I struggle to sleep until 2.30am with anxiety and wake up at 9am, sometimes 10. I'm tired in the day and I shouldn't be considering all I do is 2/3 hours of college, walk for an hour and worry for the rest of the day. I can't enjoy anything cos I'm always worried about my next problem. I have terrible health anxiety and have convinced myself I have brain/skin/breast/throat/ ovary cancer or heart disease and that the possible asbestos paint in my house guarantees I'll die in 20 years. I waste my life on my phone now, often just Googling every single sensation or thing in my body incase I'm sick and don't know it.

 I also worry for hours a day about my relationship. I don't even know if it's a bad or abusive one. We fought a lot in the last 6 months. He gets disgusting and immoral sexual intrusive thoughts. He doubts his morals too, e.g. how do I know I wouldn't masturbate to my friends ex GFs nudes if I were single? and other worrying stuff. He blames it all on his OCD, which is yet to be diagnosed. He has unloaded a lot of this on me, even his OCD doubts about me not being hot/popular enough. He refuses help no matter how much I begged. I wanted proof all these evil stuff was OCD so I could feel safe.  I stopped asking and I'm almost apathetic towards us, where once I wanted this to last forever and ever. We still get along well but I feel so much resentment and have this scary fear of what if there's someone who wouldn't burden me like he has over and over? At the same time, leaving could be the biggest mistake of my life.

Is it possible I'm having a quarter life crisis?",24Nov2020,1
960,"Long story short: several friends I tried to make ended up being girls but because I'm naiive I didnt realise their intentions.


One of my closest friends in our last year of high school convinced me to go to her party (I dislike parties) but she kept giving me alcohol all night. When it was time for everyone to sleep she suddenly had only one bed missing so I had to go sleep in her room. I barely remember what happened but I know I ended up on her snapchat story and she bragged to everyone that she fucked me.


Well, the next day at school I went back to my usual life where my friends barely pay attention to me and seem to dislike me.

When I started university I made a guy friend and a girl friend. They both ghosted me and when I asked why they both mentioned it was becaus they had a crush on me (turns out the guy was gay and I never picked it up) but then they found out I have a girlfriend.


This is a recurring theme in my life. I cant seem to make friends with people but when i do I must be doing SOMETHING wrong to give off the 'vibe' that I'm flirting. 


Lastly, both my girlfriend and my one friend (though we are very close) say they'd rather not invite me to a party or anything with a group of people because I come off as unfriendly, disagreeable, tense, and serious. However, they also often add me to their pictures and are happy to talk about me to their friends.


All these clues seem to make me sound like I'm just an autistic person who happens to be very good looking. In fact, I've often been called mysterious, which is like weird but for good looking people.",24Nov2020,1
961,"I can't find a job, my family is in debt they both work too but they don't earn much either.

I can't buy my own clothes I just wear my cousins old ones.

Even if I have a job I don't want to work 15 years just to own a fucking house.

I want to have hobies but I can't becouse I live in a 3rd world country and the currency of the country is very low in value. I just wanted to have a guitar.

I can't speak with girls and never dated ever, I'm afraid of being rejected. I want to be loved too. 

I have very few friends and now we can't hang out much too thanks to covid. 

I hate my own country,  politicians just fight for their own interests. They don't think what's people doing. The rich get richer the poor get poorer.

I hate my own people, they do nothing but criticize you, most of them are idiots just thinking nothing but religion.

I feel like I'm wasting my life. I wake up late and do nothing but play computer, I feel hopeless, I just watch videos of people who live in a decent country and I envy them. Sometimes I just want to be a soldier and have friends who care about me and I care about them, shoot whats in front of me without thinking.  Maybe I would have a purpose like that.

I don't know what to do, I just know I don't want to die yet but part of myself says kill yourself to me. Please give some advice to me.",24Nov2020,1
