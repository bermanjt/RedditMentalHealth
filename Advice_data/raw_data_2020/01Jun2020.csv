0,"          So to start this all off, I love my best friend, and would never want to hurt him. He has made had decisions, but everyone does. Whatever I say, is not out of hatred of him or their relationship. I originally was the one who met her first, it was obviously through school, and I would often talk to her about personal problems and such. Well it turns out the following year, he and her have the same class as me, and it brings them together. We have tons of fun and I have started to feel a connection since last year. I really wanted to ask her out, but it just wasn't time. 
            Well after a while he asks her out and she says yes. I then have to deal with the misery of seeing them dating and hanging out with each other, and I can see that he's trying to push me out a little so they can have their own time, which I see and understand. She still wants me to be around but only drops hints, so I stay. Their relationship is very weak, and is barely anything. He complains in private about her views, religion, and all of that shit. I am completely okay will all of those things, his views and hers, even though I have the same views as her. The loss of connection leads to him talking to other females, mostly via the internet, collecting some nudes and such. (He brags about this sometimes).
             Me, still being hurt since I know that she likes my personality and most likely not my appearance (I'm very fat to be blunt with you), and that I can't do shit to end the situation, end up slowly losing our friendship with him. We only talk through other friends, and I still feel like the world fucking hates me. I often spend hours of my day wondering what can I do, and that I wish I didn't find such an amazing person like her. I slowly drag myself further away from her because I know that I'm not good enough for her and she shouldn't have to put up with me. I sincerely don't know what to do, this isn't just some crush, I have very strong feelings for her, nothing like I've had before. Please help.",01Jun2020,1
1,"a friend of mine that i haven't spoken to in about 2 years recently followed my instagram so i followed her back. Every time i post something, she likes it but then unlikes it about an hour later or so and it's really weird and irritating that she just does this everyday. Is she just trying to mess with my head or something or what? Should i just unfollow her? by the way, i'm 19 and a dude.",01Jun2020,1
2,"So over a month ago me and my boyfriend took like a two week break. It was really hard for me and a lot happened during that time that kinda destroyed my self esteem and trust in him. I’ve genuinely forgiven him for everything that happened. No he didn’t cheat on me just said some hurtful words and etc. I’ll go into more detail later on probably. But in the end no matter if I’ve forgiven him or not it’s had lasting effects on my self image and my trust and certainty in our relationship. 
 
We took the break because I am not a completely mentally well person I’m very anxious and am prone to depression. I have a therapist and we’re even discussing the possibility of me being bipolar and have been working on myself for years but I just genuinely spiraled with all of the corona stuff going on. I was getting very sad almost daily. I was very sensitive and honestly I really didn’t realize how much I was affecting him. I’ve always been someone who took care of other people. He’s been amazing to me and I felt like I could let down my walls and let him help take care of me. And I didn’t keep it one sided I always went out of my way to make sure he was okay and do things to make him happy if I knew he wasn’t. But in the end he wanted to fix me I guess. And even tho his support and his kindness made me feel better it didn’t always work and in the end made him worse off himself. And he needed a break from that. Which I truly understand. 

But instead of calmly talking to me about it he let the bomb drop on our anniversary. He didn’t ask my thoughts he just said he was doing it. I reacted very poorly. I wish I hadn’t. But I assumed we were over. I was hurt and just went off on him. Later that day we talked. And came to terms with it a bit. The first week was no communication at all except good morning good night. The second week we talked every day for an hour or two. And then at the very end we had a huge fight. It was incredibly bad. We both said and did things that were extremely hurtful and extremely not okay. I particularly was in the wrong. We broke up. But we got all emotional and we just really didn’t want each other out of our lives so for the first week we talked everyday and we were still kinda deciding what we were. 

In the end we’re still together but our relationship has changed significantly. I used to feel very safe with him. I felt wanted and loved and I never doubted it for a second. Then all of this happened and he said things I can’t get out of my head like how I’m selfish and etc. He won’t talk to me about how he feels ever. At first he hardly spoke to me. He would disappear for hours with no word and no explanation and once again were long distance so consistent communication is important to me. Directly after the break I felt so horrible about myself I was determined to make this transition as easy as possible for him. So I’d let things slide that hurt me because I thought I was the one who needed fixing. I changed so much for him. I sucked up hurt feelings for him. And then I couldn’t take it anymore. 

After the break he was less consistent didn’t talk to me as much. He seemed less interested in how I was feeling and my day. He’s not as sweet and caring as he used to be. He used to hit on me so often it got exhausting now when he’s really sweet I instantly assume somethings wrong. He’s not as interested in nsfw stuff anymore. Like he is but only on his terms if I start it he’s not into it. He hasn’t called me in over a month. Not a single phone call. Just texts. He used to voice message me really often and he doesn’t do that either. He also doesn’t send me pictures of himself. He goes from being sweet to being short and sounding distant in a few seconds. He just now is starting to call me his gf again. 

Two weeks ago I told him he needed to be more attentive to me or I couldn’t do it anymore. And he has done better about all those things but. It’s honestly still not enough to make me feel wanted and stable in our relationship. In the end I really love him. With my whole heart I love him I do. I’ve been doing my best to make him happy. I’ve gone out of my comfort zone I’ve suffered in silence because sometimes that’s just something you do for the people you love. But it can’t keep going on like this. And I know that. I’ve tried being honest and open about it. But while small changes are happening idk if it’s enough for me. I’m scared he doesn’t think I’m worth his trust and effort anymore. And I’m scared if I keep bringing it up it’s just going to push him even further away. 

I can’t decide if this is just a rough patch we’re gonna have to slowly asf work our way out of or if this is what our relationship looks like now. I don’t know if I should keep trying or save myself the heartbreak and say goodbye. I think he’s so worth all the trouble I just don’t think he feels the same way. I feel so unfulfilled in our relationship now. I don’t get the things I need and want from him anymore. And I’ve tried giving him time and my understanding. But I only have so much left. Am I wrong for getting sick of waiting? Am I selfish for this? Any advice on what I could do? At this point I’m not sure about anything anymore and it’s killing me.",01Jun2020,0
3,"Can Someone With Dual Citizenship Escape To The UK?

A friend of mine (15F) is a dual citizen (UK and UAE). 

She currently lives in Dubai but wants to leave. She has been getting sexual abused by her brother and her dad has been beating her (most recently 27th of May when he broke her arm).

I’ve spoken to places in the UK and they have said that once she gets into the UK they will help her be safe.

But last night she messaged me (on google word since her dad doesn’t let her have contact with anyone outside the house. She has a school laptop because of corona and thats how we talk) telling me her brother has done it again and she can’t take it anymore and wants to leave. 

If she reports it and her dad or brother find out they told her they would kill her and then they beat her as a “warning”.  Her dad is a powerful man with ties with judges, lawyers, and police. She knows she won’t be save if she runs away in Dubai. 

Is there anyway way that she can come here? Like maybe using the British Embassy?

5,"Now to get this out of the way I do love my family. They are incredibly nice christian people, but that's where the dilema is. I left Christianity a few days ago due to my personal convictions. I can understand the people who do follow it, and it's fine that they do I just thought that it was not for me. My grandmother also died a few weeks ago in a tragic heart attack. I prayed at my Great-Grandfather's and a few family friends funerals before when I was ten, but now I find extremely hard to say prayers now that I don't believe in it. My Grandma raised me my whole life and was a very strong christian so she will have an extremely christianity orientated service. That's not the problem. The problem lies in that before she is laid into the ground it is a tradition that the youngest of the immediate family is to say a final prayer for them. She was a very important person in my life, so I want to send her off well, but I cannot find the words to pray anymore.  I am 15 so is there anything I can say or do to get someone else to do it? Or should I try to attempt one myself? I know this sounds incredibly stupid but I really want help.",01Jun2020,1

11,"It’s extremely windy and there’s lots of rain outside right now and my parents left their window open, so I went to go shut it for them. There’s this box, I used to store my rings in there before I moved out. I got excited to see what I would find and I noticed money was on top of it, I moved the money, and this is when I made my discovery. I was hoping I would see a ring so badly and I mindlessly moved this baggie to the side (didn’t even bother to see what was in it). I then discovered a razor and another baggie. Shocked, I stood there staring at it for a few seconds before I quickly packed it back up. Both bags had white powder and I am assuming this was cocaine.
We had some drinks this past week and they told me a lot of other things. They said that they’re close with some bad people, she showed me her bar of Xanax and another circular blue pill, she wouldn’t say what it was. (If you have any ideas please tell me.. I need to know what’s going on) they also told me that someone came to the house with a gun in the summer.. They also drink a lot.
I really don’t know what to do.. my parents and I have never had a solid relationship, we are finally starting to be able to get along and now I find this out. It felt like everything was finally going good... I’m scared that if I confront them I’ll get in a lot of shit with them or I’ll have to move out. I don’t know if it would go good to tell them.

A friend of mine is celebrating her 18th Birthday on Tuesday and she invited me.

The thing is she invited about 10 other People as well, and she wants to go eat at a restaurant together.( I know REALLY bad Idea because of COVID..but telling that I dont wanna go because of that is not possible since there have been 0 cases in the last few weeks where I live so she wouldnt understand me not wanting to go because of covid worries..)

Now ive been really anxious to go, since every inch of my body doesnt wanna go and honestly just the tought of going makes me wanna vomit. My Head is just playing scenarios of how I could embarrass myself or how weird and quit I could be perceived as.

Just to add: The other People that are coming are ex classmates of mine (I changed schools). So they already knoe that I am the quit kid, which I frankly think will only make it more akward :/

I really dont wanna go but its her 18th Birthday and ig its really important for her that I come, so im stuck.

Does anybody have any advice? I dont think my friend really understands my social anxiety. I think that if I told her that I couldnt go because the thought of it alone makes me shoudder uncontrollably, she wouldnt understand.

I told them that there was nothing wrong i just don't like most of the ones in my school because of the way they act and i try to stay away from them.

Although not all of the toxic girls were black. My mother and aunt has a similar personality to them though. Anyways, they started making all of these racist claims about my girlfriend and about white people in general and when i started to defend them they came out and said im racist towards my own kind.

I hope this is not a waste of time and I hope that you maybe answer the more important Reddit posts than mine. But anyway I wanted to get a gaming PC, however my parents are against the idea. Not because of financial reasons (sorry if i sound snobby at all) but because of what happened to my brother. 

My brother would be 24/7 on his computer just playing games. He did not have a stable job (eventually he did get one but would later quit it). He can be mean at times but overall he's a good brother. However, he has a milder form of autism, while to my knowledge, I do not have autism.

24,"This is a pretty tame problem but just wanted a second opinion. I am a Teenager and I have a very small room. It has very little walking space and I have a bed, dresser, small shelf and a wardrobe. I tend to do everything on my bed. From homework to sleeping to doing my hobbies. 

I have a lot of sleeping problems and part of it, I think, is the fact that I do everything on one space. I try to do most of my stuff on the opposite side of the bed and that  helps but it still affects my sleeping. I have an idea to get rid of my wardrobe (It only has old clothes in it and is rarely used for anything) and buy a small desk! It would give me a lot more space to do my hobbies like painting and drawing and would give me that separation from when its time to be active and when it's time to sleep.

I've mentioned it to my parents briefly and they are reluctant because getting rid of the wardrobe would be a big chore.

Background:

* I have some issues that home that make it difficult to live. As a result my girlfriend discussing about my situation, her family offered me to live in their spare media room.
* Her father say maybe 2 weeks while her mother say as long as I want. ( I'm still conflicted what does this means).
* Food and rent or any expenses are covered.

**Concerns: Things are the things I'm worrying about and need advices on**

* A bit worried about how my relationship with her will play out now that I will live with her.
* My fear of how her parents' view would change now that they will see me every day.
* How should I act to help deepened my relationship with her parents to make them like me more and view as a family?  Yes I understand ""be myself' but what else?

39,"When I was 14 (I’m now 18) I was very depressed and contemplated suicide as I was dealing with abuse at home and got myself into a lot of difficult situations. I needed validation from guys so would often send nudes because they told me I was beautiful and they loved my body and told me I was special and strong because of all the shit I was going through. 

One of the first guys was 34 and lived in America (I’m from the UK) at first we just became friends on Instagram through a fan account for a band and we got talking and would snap every single day and it turned into him sending nudes and asking for them back (I was 14) and I did and as a ‘reward’ he would gift me £100 amazon vouchers and stuff like that. At the time I was so depressed and numb that I didn’t really see a problem. Yes it made me slightly uncomfortable but I just went with it and accepted the money because I felt like that was ticket out of my abusive household. 

The second guy also found me on Instagram he was a 19 year old university student (I was still 14 but almost 15) I poured out my heart to him and told him about how disgusting and down I felt and all this shit I was going through at home. He comforted me and made me feel good about myself and it escalated and got sexual. After exchanging nude pictures he eventually asked me to meet up with him. I agreed he picked me up in his car, he parked up and he made me suck him off. Again (stupidly) I went along with it as he held my head down and made me pleasure him. I remember tearing up and him dropping me off on a street corner after I finished. He never called me again and made me feel dirty and ugky and I blamed him not calling me again on the fact that I was ugly or that I wasn’t sexy enough. 

This last one still scares me to this day. I was sitting in the park smoking and drinking and two guys came up to me sat with me and we just got talking. Eventually they offered me some weed and I went with it. I was sick of my life and wanted to get High and not feel anything. Idk what they gave me but it definitely wasn’t weed. I couldn’t stand up properly I fell asleep and I just remember being surrounded by about 15 guys all older than me (some were 18+)  touching me inappropriately and one of them forced me to make out with him while he grinded on me. I tried to leave but they pulled me back. After this I just didn’t leave my bed for weeks. 

I still think about all these things and I do blame myself because I put myself in these situations. I don’t know I just kind of wanted to get things off my chest so yeh",01Jun2020,2

41,"19F Asian American who grew up in the suburbs of the Midwest. My Chinese mother is racist. She’s a trump supporter (which that in and of itself is not a sign of racism) but she doesn’t condemn the numerous of inappropriate tweets. Just got into a massive argument with her about racism in America. I SHIT YOU NOT, these are some of the stuff that she argued:

1) George Floyd’s death was not completely caused by the police. It was a combination of brute force but MORE the fact “he was on drugs” (according to Candace Owen’s baseless tweet as support).

2) Black people are not profiled in the US. And even for those with racist tendencies against black purple aren’t at fault. BLACK people are at fault here. Because of the high black on black violence reported in the news, etc. its not our fault we (as a society) have these racist tendencies. 

3) Chinese people have faced the same level of racism as black people in America. I argued, yes, the chinese have experienced racism, to no degree is it similar in brutality or danger as black people. Black people have to face much harder racist conditions. She disagrees.

4) like athletic differences between black people and asian people with black people tending to dominate in athletics because they are genetically blessed at the top, asian people are genetically superior in smartness/cognitive ability whereas black people are genetically not as blessed in smartness. My argument was that most of “smartness” in a subject comes down to working hard and the environment a person grows up in, not genetics or race. 

5) the reason for the black community being where they are today is mainly their fault. Her argument, “chinese people were immigrants and faced racism like them but look at us now! We worked hard and got where we are today!” And Black people need to work harder. 


Just a few of the heated argument main pints we started to argue about. Got super overwhelmed and emotionally upset about all of this because I have so much sympathy for the black movement/race overall. Have a lot of colored friends and it felt almost as if she was criticizing them personally.

48,"I've always dealt with a tumultuous life. Due to this, I had to grow up very early. I became the parent to my parents, and little brother, while being a teenager (18/19) going to school and work both full time. I've always prided myself on my ability to keep my emotions in. ~7-8 years later, a ton of introspection, and a lot of other experiences later have led me to where I've been trying to instinctively let my emotions out because I feel that's a big part of what makes me, me. I'm not just logic and analysis.

I have a history of lack of love and compassion on almost all fronts, and the one real relationship I had (until now) left me devastated for a few years. I know now most of that was separation anxiety, as the person she was definitely did NOT match me. But now I'm with another woman that I've been with for 7 months and I let myself try to love again. I have a good grasp on myself now though so I can see negativity in real time..

Well this is going longer than I want so I'll get to it. Her and I have had a lot of pretty bad arguments, that always result in us getting much closer. Literally today I left her to drive 7 hours away to go to school for a dream I never knew I could dream (3 months long), because I finally escaped from my past anchors and decided to spend what little savings I have chasing this dream.

I cant even explain the maelstrom of emotions I have right now. I miss her so much, I just want to tell her I love her over and over again, I think I have anxiety about starting this school and might be pessimistic about the results, the place I'm staying is overpriced, and Idk if my savings will hold up.. I never fucking cry but today has hit me so fucking hard that I want to.l ball my eyes out.

I've been living at my current apartment for four years now. I was planning on moving when my lease was up at the end of Summer but with the current viral situation, that unfortunately got canceled and I'll be extending it for another year, much to my utter dismay. 

The apartment is neat. Management is cool. Nothing to complain about except the neighbors. My downstairs neighbors to be exact. I've lived in apartments for a long time (15 years+) and never have I encountered anything like this. My family and I live on the second floor off a three story building. 

The downstairs neighbors moved in about a year after we did. The first night? They had the music blasting until 2 a.m. I walked downstairs, knocked on their door and they were really apologetic about the noise and shut it down. They played it really loud again during the next day and again, we asked them politely that while we live upstairs the walls are connected so the noise TRAVELS. 

Had awesome conversations and we left it at that. All was good for a year or so plus. Then all of the sudden a couple of months ago, I hear really REALLY loud music just THUDDING. The picture frames on our walls shook and I could hear the words, feel the vibrations on my feet. I was gobsmacked. Thinking another new neighbor moved in, I walked downstairs and knocked again. Nope. Same neighbors. We chatted again, they were cool and lowered it. 

Then the virus comes around and we were supposed to be social distancing. We're all at home. Pretty much all day.  

2 months ago all the sudden, starting at 10 p.m. the music just starts BLASTING way wayyyy into 2:30 a.m. I was so tired and not wanting to have a conversation at 2 in the morning, and seriously fed up, I called the cops. They quieted down. I felt bad but I was so tired of their shit. 

It got quiet for a week or so then BAM. Floors and walls shaking, the works. It starts at 8 p.m. and around 11:30 p.m. I couldn't deal with it and called the cops again. 

I'm thinking-- if you have the cops called on you twice. You'd, I don't know, at least be considerate and NOT PLAY THE MUSIC SO LOUDLY? 

It was good for another 2 weeks and now? They're blasting their music again and I don't know what to do anymore.

They're not high school or college kids, they're a family of four or five (not 100% sure) with teenagers and I'm seriously confused as to why they are continuing to do this. They've had no complaints about us, all was reasonable and then BOOM. I know that they KNOW how loud they are. 

I've tried looking up the city noise ordinance laws ( I'm in Texas, in case anyone is curious), rules and the cops just say if the noise is excessive, just call them. And that's what I've done.

It's barely 8 p.m. here and the music has been thudding for an hour now and I'm at my wits end. I don't want to talk to them face to face anymore because it doesn't help. The fact that we have to live with this for another year is making me want to break down. I've tried buying noise canceling headphones, white noise machines, ear plugs but then I wonder...why do I have to continue living like this at the place I pay? I know what apartment living is... but this is excessive.

If they were loud, before the virus, I'd go out. But I can't do that anymore. I was planning on moving but with the finances tight, I can't do that anymore either. 

What can I do at this point? It may not seem like much for some, but the bass, thudding is driving me up the wall. And I'm in my early 30s, if that matters. 

I don't hate music, thats not the point here. I just would like them to give me the same courtesy as I've been giving them. 

The cops are not having any impact.... so... what now?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",01Jun2020,2

I let him know that the roof has been leaking since we moved in and he always replied he would get around to it “next fall” well, there was a big storm this weekend and my roof was not just dripping, it was steadily flowing out of my ceiling. So I recorded multiple videos and sent them to him and so he is now currently at my house. 
He went into the attic and pushed onto the ceiling and left it with a crack. He then went outside to the top of the roof and started banging around and then my ceiling collapsed. There is black mold everywhere and I have asthma. Since the part of my ceiling came down, (about a 3’x2’ area in my kitchen). My landlord is currently placing a 2x4 drywall sheet to cover it up.

63,"This will be a wordy and unconvincing rant but ***please*** hear me out:

Because I breathed out a few words, I've faced backlashes from the political people whom I once knew in high school. Sure, I apologized for my poor choice of words when speaking out about how the pro-Floyd rioters have gone a little too far with their actions **(this doesn't include the peaceful marchers and protestors... and from the videos seen on** r/Minneapolis **and** r/PublicFreakout, **even those poor souls were kicked down by the police force)** — I may have been too emotional with how I've described the violent (**ONLY** the violent) rioters as ""chimps"" (I wasn't referring to any race because that would be ***beyond*** hateful and bigoted) because I, too, have been tired of how politicized everything must be.

But it's too late to retract anything, really, people here will probably advise me to ""move on with life and look forward to a brighter future"", but due to how sensitive this George Floyd incident is for many people, they'd easily vilify me as a hateful racist, bigot and ignorant fool, for holding a different opinion from the rest. I even tried to explain myself but no, they're pleased with this hostility. I hate to say this **and I know it's wrong to feel like this**, but it's like they want to keep pouring their lava of emotions onto me until I melt, and forever treating me as someone who cannot change.

I'd thought about unfriending or blocking them (my **high school peers** who antagonized me), but that'll only prove their point of me not refusing to change, thus further fueling their anger. Another advice is to not give a fuck about them and just remove them from my life, but it's futile now considering (and **I do admit**) how much in the wrong I am for even insulting the rioters. I'm planning to stay away from social media for a month or two, but they'd probably never forgive me... and just their presence has me fearing that they'll try to get everyone I once knew to break away from me (it's a stupid fear that probably wouldn't happen, but the thought lingers on).

I'm just so done with getting into politics at all because I get shit on for being myself and voicing out my opinion (even if I clarified myself to avoid any serious misunderstanding), yet I'll still get hated on for remaining neutral.

**Edit**: Long before I made this post, I've already apologized to my old peers for the pathetic and scummy terminology used against those rioters, and am currently questioning my own values and beliefs.

66,"My (21m) parents are toxic and they have put me in a terrible situation

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so, for background, I have always been kind of the quiet one in the family, and because of that I never really got the same attention as my siblings. I got a girlfriend last year, and she has been so helpful and supportive and good for me. She has helped me grow into a better person. Because of this, as I went back home during certain points in the school year (sometimes with her), I started to see that the ways that they were treating me were wrong. They never asked me or cared about how I was feeling, they always put my siblings over me, and they didnt like my gf from the start, although Im not sure why. As time went on, things got worse. On thanksgiving, my girlfriend and I had a very difficult time at my house due to a few different factors, one being the way my parents were being passive but kind of judgy when she was over. In December, my family and I went on a vacation to Florida (without my gf). I went back and forth on whether I should even go, but I decided I should. 

In Florida, I grew tired of my sister's control of everything we did and I started to go against it. My parents didnt like it, because they never take what I say into consideration. They only ever go on the defensive, and so they went to her side, even though she is manipulative and just a mean person all around (she has been the bully of the family since I was born). In the end, she gave a fake apology and I just accepted it because I was tired. I wanted things to be more equal in my family, but they were always going to support her. Then, my girlfriend's family invited me to visit her house when I left Florida in order to get to know me better. My parents refused, because they ""wanted me to focus on getting a job"" (a big problem with my parents is that they dont see me for me. They only look at me as somebody who needs a job, even though I am in college AND actively looking for work. Every conversation with my father is about money. Its never about me or about anything else. Also, they have started not to like my gf because her perspective is showing me that there are a lot of problems that I want to try to fix.) I left the issue and just went back to my apartment in the city. Then, COVID-19 happened. 

My girlfriend and I came home to quarantine, and she lost her dorm so she had nowehere to go until she could get a flight, which her mom could not afford. Over the course of quarantine, they began to act worse and worse, blaming us for things like disrespect because we were always in my room (her working on her job and school, and me working on school) and expecting my mom to cook dinner (which I would never force. Im the only kid in the house who 1. Does his own chores and 2. Cooks for himself. I never asked her to cook for me, and my other siblings always did). Early on, my gf got a gift of chocolate from her mother for graduation. My dad (who loves food), seeing this, commented on it, and I told him it was hers and he couldnt have any. He started mumbling to himself about how he pays for my apartment and school and then he took me into my brothers room and berated and yelled at me for ""disrespecting him"" even though it wasnt even my chocolate to give. My mom let it happen. Later on, things escalated further and my gf and I bought a flight to her home to escape. Meanwhile Im discussing this all with my therapist. All four of us (parents, me, gf) had a shouting match about how bad they were to me (we used the word 'abuse' a lot)about holding my apartment and college over my head all the time and my dad yelling at me and not trusting me with my life (etc.) and they were saying how ""disrespectful we'd been"". 

Afterwards, my gf and i went to my apartment, and due to my parents threatening the apartment, I had to stay while she left. Still, she had a job where in the city I was from and she would need to come back soon, although she could not afford an apartment. I mentioned that she was always welcome to stay here. I also tried to start de-escalating with my parents just in order to protect myself. Meanwhile, my parents, instead of trying to see things from my perspective, were trying to look for legal help to defend themselves, even though I never planned on making it legal and I made that clear. All they were doing was trying to defend themselves instead of listen to my concerns.

Around this time (today), my lease on my apartment (with a friend) was set to be renewed. My parents have been holding back talking to me while saying that we needed to discuss it (because of the possibility of remote schooling and remote working, they didnt think it would be worth paying for. meanwhile, I was there to escape them, and was and still am actively looking for work), but I called my dad to get him to talk to me about it. He proceeded to tell me that, because of how my girlfriend acted (in defending me), she would not ever be allowed to stay at my apartment, to the point where my dad wanted to involve a lawyer in order to legally prevent her from staying there. He also said that they found her diary in the garage, and brought it to their therapist for her to read. They didnt read it themselves, but I still think this was wrong. Their therapist said there were bad signs of 'emotional instability. For background, my girlfriend has really bad anxiety, and OCD, but she controls them amazingly. Seriously you would not even know she had them if you knew her for a while. Those notebooks are solely for her to get out her difficult thoughts and not at all based in reality, and she knows that. My girlfriend is an amazing person. My parents think she is brainwashing me and refuse to allow her to even enter the apartment. The problem is, she has a flight coming here in a month, and she has nowhere to go if not here. I wanted to possibly even live with her just while she makes the money to get her own place (with her paying a third of my rent alongside me and my roommate) but my dad refused. I know that was a stupid thing to ask but I wanted to help her.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do? I'm afraid to tell her about this because my parents have hurt her a lot. They might take away my apartment if she stays here but she needs to and I dont have much money. I dont know what to do and Im so scared. Thank you for reading this",01Jun2020,2
67,"Hi there!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 27 year old guy who 's never had a girlfriend and has already accepted his fate to be a crazy cat lady and die alone. I've had extreme social anxiety growing up, it's a lot better now than before but it's still basically there. I've had crushes and stuff but never amounted to anything, I'm assuming because of how I look or how depressing I can be when they hang out with me. I actually had one crush where she liked me for years and for some reason I still made it fade away because of social anxiety and paranoia that I will destroy it all. I also feel like I'm very well composed and calculated, and I have a decent maturity within me. Except when I have anything that remotely resembles feelings, then I turn into some cringy romantic goop that don't know how to express things properly. I'm also used to living a mostly sad, lonely love life (I am very lucky to have great family members and friends but this is specifically about romance) that now that I'm feeling happy I don't know what to do? Or if it's even real?

&amp;#x200B;

That's the background around me, now here's the backstory for the specific thing I need help with.

&amp;#x200B;

Met someone online, she added me on snap, we haven't talked much until she posted a story that made a joke and I messaged her about it, asked how her bf was, she said he cheated, I said sorry to hear that then we talked and we just connected so well together.

This is literally our 4th day talking and we told each other how sweet we are, how amazing, she said how others should be more like me, and that she enjoys talking to me so much and I do her, said she wanted to cuddle with me when everything opens up (I live in Canada, she's in the US), tells me she loves me, I said I'll wife her up and she said she'll husband me up, I told her don't tell me that coz I'll take it seriously and just said I was so cute, and I don't know if she's taking it in stride and doing it in a flirty joking way or is it real, coz I honestly haven't been this happy in my life, and she's so beautiful and cute and nice and I'm 500% out of her league, and now I know my goopy lovey dovey cringe brain will make my emotions overwhelm her and push her away and destroy all of it before anything even starts.

So um what do I do? Am I doing things wrong? Should I keep going? Am I dumb for thinking this is even something that would ever happen? Am I dumb for even asking this question? Haha I need help.",01Jun2020,1
68,"Hello, I have made a reddit just for this, so sorry if the formatting of this post is a bit wrong. I am a 19 year old, white female (this matters in this context) and I am the youngest of seven children in my family, all of which are extremely conservative and very racist. I have dealt with the embarrassment of my families political views my entire life. I myself am not racist nor do I hold any of their beliefs. So since I am the youngest of the group (most of them are in their 30s, late 20s) I grew up alone in my house and because of that I was (luckily) not influenced by their ideals. I attended a very liberal, arts high school, and have surrounded myself with great open minded friends. I have learned a lot about myself  throughout my younger years and have built my own belief system, one where I fall into the socialist / liberal view side of things. I have been tolerant, to say the least, and have spoken out when I feel they have been openly racist or ignorant. But in 2016, when Trump was voted into office, it all became much worse. I had known they were conservative, but the racism and mysogony just intensified, meaning more arguments and me feeling more outcasted from them. I have always forgiven them and hoped that they would change as they are my family, but their egos have become worse and they take advantage of this. They also tell my father what I am saying and since he is just like them, he gets very angry at me and it causes me to get into a very low mental state. They also comment on my instagram stories when I share any political view about the BLM movement and or other topics related. They also share their views in our family group chat, which I have muted. Though I have tried having conversations about these issues with them, it never ends well for me. So, now I have just started to avoid them because I cannot take the constant gaslighting, hateful speech and ideals.

But ever since the video of George Floyd being murdered by police surfaced, I find myself more mad at them and disgusted with even being related to them. They are being unreasonable and completely ignorant.  I cannot tolerate anymore racism from them and I cannot take them being hateful towards black people and anyone who isn't liberal. I do not know how to stand up or how to get away from them as they try to actively be involved in my life. I need help with this please, I want to stand up but they constantly bully me and make me miserable, I do not know how to get away from them or have them respect my views, let alone respect other human beings.

I just need some helpful advice,",01Jun2020,5
69,"So today I was riding my bike on a trail around a park where I live (a big urban area) because I was bored and wanted to get out to enjoy the nice day.  

As I’m coming around the bend I see a lot of my friends having like a picnic and chilling out with blankets having fun.  They were pretty far away but I’m confident it was them.  

I just kept going. 

I would say I am pretty close to most of the people I saw, so it kind of hurts.  Close enough for me to figure I’d be invited.  A few weeks ago my best friend (who is a part of this group) texted me asking if I wanted to go on a bike ride with a few others.  That day we all (5 of us) went for the bike ride and drank at a park.  At the park 2 of them, who live together, were talking about how they were having a get together that night (I’m cool with them, but not super close). 

After that 3 of us went back to my friends place (2 out of the group live together, 1 my best friend) to order some food and then everyone was pretty tired so we took a nap and I crashed on the couch.  The two having the get together later that night went home.  The last other went home.  When I woke up, one of my friends came out of his room and was like, “just a heads up me and Jason(my best friend) are headed to mike and Todd’s in like 10 minutes.”  And I was like oh okay.  

Then he went to shower and as I was sitting there I was like wtf I guess that means I’m not going.  So while he was showering and my other friend was in his room I just left without saying goodbye.  Then after he showered he texted me saying that that came across rude and he was sorry.   

I texted Jason a few hours later who I’m closer to asking, “was I not invited tonight?”  
He replied right away with “????”  “We didn’t have like a thing going on”.  And I just went to bed.  The next day I said sorry for inserting myself and he was like, “it’s not something you have to be sorry for.”

It turns out everyone went from that day but me, plus others I’m guessing.  So as much as it hurt inside I kind of tried to move on from it because I enjoy their company and they seem to enjoy mine.  

But then when I saw them today without me those feelings came back and I couldn’t even go up to them naturally bc i felt like, if they wanted me there I would have been asked.  

So after I got like a half mile away I texted Jason to ask what he was doing today, even though I knew to kind of test the waters and see if he’d maybe tell me to come.   

He said just chillin, hbu.  And said he was at the park. So I was like oh just riding my bike on the trail, was gonna see if you guys wanted to get food or something.  

It took him a bit to answer but after like an hour he was said hey sorry, I’ve already ate. But maybe sometime this week.  

So I’m just wondering if you guys think I should talk to him about it, because me and him are able to talk about deep stuff but I don’t want to be too much.  

Should I just express how I feel something is off, or even tell him how I saw them and couldn’t approach bc of what I was feeling?",01Jun2020,1
70,"I'll try to sum this up and hopefully this is the right place for it.

As a child life was great.  I had parents who supported me and felt I could talk to and trust.  Had a solid group of friends.  Aside from being a little on the quiet side, I was pretty much a normal kid.

And then life went to shit.  My dad, who was an airline pilot, became ambitious and wanted to start a business.  My parents decided to get in on a franchise business (franchisee?).  To do this, we had to move to another state across the country. In addition to getting this started up, my dad kept his job as a pilot, while also trying to build his own house, and essentially do everything himself(from landscaping to all the mechanical work on the 4-5 cars we had).  Trying to save a penny whenever he could. 

The business struggled despite a promising start, and after 5 years of breaking even we closed it.  Those 5 years were the worst of my life.  My dad became emotionally and sometimes physically abusive.  When he was home from his pilot job he needed my help with projects around the house. At first I gladly jumped in since I saw the necessity of it, but working with him became a nightmare -- I was constantly berated. Couldn't do anything right, even when I did exactly as instructed.  I lived in fear that anything I or the rest of my family said or did would set him off and have him storming out the door.  He was (and still can be) incredibly hard on my mom, and its painful. 

School wasn't easier.  In the past it took me a few years to develop really good friendships.  I never made new friends after I moved.

When we closed the business, my dad lost a shit ton of that stress, but the damage had already been done to me.  I was depressed, had extreme stress/anxiety (even today, some 8 years later, I have nightmares about embarrassing situations that happened at school), trust issues, little motivation, stopped talking, etc. 

At one point my dad realized he was too hard on me and has ever since tried playing nice with me, but I try to avoid him and often play stupid with him just so I don't deal with him more than I have to.

Anyway, I've barely left the house since high school, ~8 years ago.  In that time I tried to get a graphic design career going, but I live out in the country, no drivers license, and little motivation to do anything with it.

Right now I can tolerate living here since my dad isn't quite the asshole he used to be.  I thought I would have had my drivers license a long time ago and them my life would start, but evidently I put too much stock in that and now my mind is in haywire trying to figure out why I can't move on like a normal person.

Coronavirus is the only thing keeping me from taking the drivers test.  My plan, once I get my license, it to drive around the state and region and meet with people in various industries to get inspiration.  I have no idea what to do.  At this point I feel like either going all out on the one thing I enjoy doing the most (filmmaking),either succeed or fail, or start afresh in the wilderness and become self-reliant and away from the modern human bullshit.


I don't want to keep this post going on forever, so if you want more details I will provide them. Theres a mountain of bullshit I didn't even get to.

Edit: forgot to mention no one in the family communicates very well.  Since I don't talk that much anymore, my dad believes I am autistic (this is a whole nother post that pisses the shit out of me, but the short of it is that I was tested for this at 18, and I didn't even qualify to be on the spectrum.  I don't talk with him because he's an asshole at heart and I want him to get out of my way. I feel like I have no agency of my life and am completely incapable of making it out on my own.

Also should note I have never had a paycheck.",01Jun2020,1
71,"So in the next town over, there were some George Floyd protests. I was walking by, observing it while trying to get to my car. I'm not really a part of the Black Lives Matter movement because in my opinion, everyone already knows black people matter just as much as everyone else and the few sick racist fucks who think otherwise aren't gonna have their twisted little minds changed by me saying ""y'know, Black Lives Matter"".

Sorry if I got off-topic, but anyway, I was walking by and I see MSNBC with a camera. They were interviewing some black woman who was talking about how ""Trump is sick and needs a psychiatrist"". When I see there's a camera, I try to avoid it and walk away. But my long hair was flying all over my face and I was struggling to get it out because of the wind and I probably looked like a complete idiot on camera. I had a really hard time seeing what I was doing or where I was going. I was finally able to walk away.

After leaving, I went home. It's been hours and now my mom is getting messages on Facebook that I was on the news and on TV. I cannot find any place to watch live TV on the internet - let alone a place where I can rewind it. I don't know what channel or whatever. Everyone's laughing and asking questions.

Fuck the news. I never asked to be on camera, I never asked to be a part of this George Floyd bullshit. All I wanted to do was get to my car. But what am I supposed to do? I can't erase it. I am a minor so maybe my face was blurred out (by my own fucking hair). But in all seriousness, I don't want to be made fun of or harassed over this shit. Is there anything I can do?",01Jun2020,1
72,"So when I was 16 I made a mistake, was way too eager and bought a car way too soon. I admit I was way too excited about driving and just wanted a car. Now, two years later, and I do not enjoy the car I drive. I know, most people would say who cares? But I’m going to college for automotive technology and seriously enjoy working on cars and driving them; it is my only hobby besides sitting around and staring at a blank wall. I am dying for a new platform to work on as I have literally done every upgrade possible to my current car. I have cash I have accumulated, and have found cars that are of near the exact value of my current one, so I’ll lose little to no money in the selling and buying process. Only problem is, both of my parents won’t let me get it. They claim I’m not responsible enough or need to get though some college or that they’re the parents and they get to decide. Well last time I checked, since I’ve turned 18 I can legally obtain a title to a car without needing any help or approval from them. I’m honestly at the point of saying fuck it and showing up with a new car because they never listen to what I have to say and it is the same bs excuses every time I bring it up to them. I just came here to make sure they can’t pull some legal bullshit out of their ass and force me to give up the new car or something. It will be bought with my cash, and will be in my name only, so I can’t think of anything they could do to force it out of my possession.",01Jun2020,1

74,"When I was 12, there was this 15 year old boy from my school who I thought was rather “cute”. I ended up getting his Snapchat, and we became friends. One day, I confessed that I had feelings for him, and he said that he liked me too, and that i was really pretty. I was quite flattered since these things were coming from an older boy. It made me feel good. The next day, he had said that he had a wet dream about me. I didn’t exactly know what a wet dream was, considering I was 12, so I just said “aww”. He had continued to send me explicit messages, some being nudes. He also asked me to have sex, but I denied. After a while, I had learned how to talk “dirty” solely because I liked the attention I was getting from him, considering he was an older boy. We exchanged very explicit messages, and he send me his genitals (once again). This time, he said “your turn”. I didn’t know how to react, so I gave in. I sent a picture of my “private area”, with my hand in the way of it, so you could really only see part of my “behind”. Mind you, I was **twelve**. The decision making part of my brain wasn’t even nearly developed. Afterwards, I had expressed to him that I felt weird about having sexual relations with him. He blocked me on everything, we haven’t spoke since.


This had become so normalized to me, that I ended up meeting even more boys on Snapchat when. I was 13. Luckily, I didn’t send any nude photos to them but they were very suggestive pictures. For example, pictures of my “ass” in tights, my underwear through my pants, and pictures of me in a bra and leggings. I had ended up sending about 7 pictures like this to guys that ranged between ages 15-22. Disgusting , I know. 

**Luckily, I hadn’t put my face in any of these pictures that I talked about**

*I deactivated my Snapchat account, and blocked all of these boys*

These stories were eating me up recently, and I felt so down, scared, and degraded that I had done this. I told my mom about this, and she said that I was lucky that my face wasn’t in these pictures, and it’s very unlikely that anybody would find out about them considering all the snap logs have disappeared due to my account deactivation.",01Jun2020,3

76,"Hi!

I'm going to try and keep this as short and simple as I can :) 

My first option is before the entire shutdown, I was on track to go to university in Nevada, moving from California. The question of my family moving with me or not was always there, but it's been much harder for us to determine what we can do during the shutdown. Part of what we needed to help us decide was me potentially getting residency in Nevada so I could have cheaper tuition, but that couldn't happen because the DMV shut down. 

The other option I have is to stay where I'm living in California for another semester and keep taking classes at my community college. I've taken college classes since last year, which allowed me to graduate high school a year early and enter college as a sophomore. I was in 10th grade last year, 11th and 12th grade this year, and between the two, was able to rack up 30 college credits, essentially skipping freshman year. My preference is to still go to university in the fall, even though I won't have residency and I'll be required to live on campus. Obviously, there's a huge difference between prices of community college and university and please don't call me spoiled or entitled, but I don't really want that to be a \*huge\* deciding factor on where I go. I've already skipped a year of high school and a year of college, I'm ready to go to university and I'm prepared to work a job and pay off the necessary loans. I'm not expecting my parents to pay for my education, they said they would help me if they could, but they really aren't in a position to right now. 

In our past discussions of this matter, my parents (especially my dad) have leaned towards me staying in California for another semester, doing online classes, and saving some money. We've had some discussions about this but today, they sat me down and told me that they're going to list our house for sale in July, it might sell fast, it might not. We own and operate a church, my parents are pastors, so finding some people to take that over is also a factor in them moving. They said that if the house sells fast and they have to live in an apartment here or over there and drive back and forth for a few months, they'll do it. 

However, they're now giving me the option to decide for myself what I think is the best choice and they'll support me no matter what, if I choose to take another semester of community, or if I choose to go to university. They said I should pray about it for a few days and really think it through, but that it's my choice. This is honestly very shocking for me, because I was expecting them to lay down the law, say 'my way or the highway' and tell me what was going to happen. 

I know this is probably super confusing and I left a lot of little details out, but I wanted to get an outsider's opinion on this. I'm not going to base my decision off of what strangers say, but I'd like to get some different perspectives. Feel free to ask me any questions for clarification :)

TL;DR My parents gave me a choice to go to community college or university and I don't know what to do.",01Jun2020,1

Lately, for the last couple months there’s been a distance (understandably due to social distancing), however whenever I try to reach out there’s either no response or a response many hours later but through randomly scrolling I’ll see her active on Facebook. 
This isn’t like her to ignore me, so of course I think the worst. Whenever we do talk, it’s a quick conversation and she has mentioned to me that she’s not too busy at home while working. I decided to start letting her reach out and sadly, she didn’t at all. 

It’s been hard making a shift of having a close friend to someone who has grown so distant that it just doesn’t seem like the friendship connection is present.

79,"A little background:

I’m going to be a sophomore at college next fall. I lived in a dorm room last year, and even though I really enjoyed it, I’d prefer an apartment next year. 

I have a friend, who’ll we’ll call L, that lived alone all last year in a 4 bedroom apartment. I talked to him about it a little last semester. I said that if he’s looking for a roommate next semester, I’d be willing, and he said that he liked that idea. 

Today I asked him for the address of the place so I could start sending my mail there, and he said that he wasn’t looking for a roommate anymore. I guess L told me that he might be looking for a roommate, not that he definitely wanted one. 

L is a great guy and I know that he meant no harm to me. It was just a little misunderstanding. 

Here’s where I need advice: 

I had been telling my family that I’m all set to live with him since last semester. Now since that’s a no-go, I can’t decide when to tell them about it. 

If I tel them now, they might worry and panic about it a little, my parents especially. I love them very much, and they are already pretty stressed, so the last thing I want to do is give them something else to fret about. 

I’m personally not scared about it. I think there’s enough housing in my college town that I’ll be able to find something soon. 


So should I tell them about it now or until after I find an apartment for myself?",01Jun2020,1
81,"#[LONGISH]  

Hello all, my girlfriend called me spoilt and it’s got to me lol. For context, I’m a 17M sneakerhead who’s also very into fashion, but only buy pieces I like on myself. This whole thing arose when I commented on the nice comfort of her jumper she gave me from primark, then I said I had never even been in primark really. That’s when she called me materialistic and spoilt. I just wanna give someone backstory and hear everyone’s opinion really.  

So growing up I’ve always worn what was given to me, never one for brands or anything, I would always wear H and M and stuff like that, then as I got older would be like superdry and hollister. The biggest brand I’d wear would be shoes, even then would only be like £40 Nike’s. I was always into shoes and the resale game, but obviously I would just follow it as I didn’t have a penny to spend on it.  

I’ve had an easy life, never ran into any issues, parents covered most fees. We’re comfortable and they work hard. I’d get £15 a week for bus money and I get to keep any left over. I was never one to ask for things, literally never, because I never liked them spending unnecessary money on me lol. I have a savings account, but I think I always saw us to not have money to throw about. Turns out that’s not the case, we’re just sensible. Well, “we”.  

Anyway last year I got my first job, at McDonald’s, I remember after my first payslip I bought a nice north face jacket I liked the design of for £20, and a pair of hyped shoes (Pharrell nmds for you sneakerheads) for £60, both on depop. I was chuffed. I remember the first day I flipped them for £130, all my reseller dreams were coming true. Anyway since then I’ve been buying and reselling shoes, on top of my money from work. I’ve taken hits, been scammed, and always looked for money making schemes and projects on the side. Now I’m buying more shoes, some to keep, some to sell, and buying more hyped clothes. But never for stupid prices, I always manage to get them like less than half price.  

Now, does any of that make me spoilt? Like I understand I’ve had an easy life growing up financially, and I was happy with what I got. She said I like to wear these expensive brands to show people I have money. I guess yes that’s the case with my shoes, but people round here won’t even have heard of half the brands I wear. Is it bad that I like to show that I’ve worked hard for what I’m wearing? It’s never showy buts, like I wouldn’t wear a big supreme hoodie or flashy designer piece, just subtle. Things that even if I only know about, I still know I’ve worked for it. It’s a shame my hobby and passion costs a bit, but when I’ve worked for this money does that make me spoilt?",01Jun2020,2
83,"I was 14 years old. I was depressed and was having a lot of self esteem issues with the way I looked. Never had friends, so I made friends online on a site called meet me. I met a man that I no longer remember the name of... he said he was 17. I thought that was cool because I wanted to grow up so fast and just be done with puberty and being done with being depressed. So I wanted to make him my friend...
We started chatting a bit, this went on for a couple weeks and then he reviled that he was actually 24.

I told him it didn’t matter. I was still 14. 
A few days later is when we finally decide to video chat on Skype. We started talking a bit more about what he was looking for and what I wanted. I remember telling him that I wanted a friend because I had non and it was making me depressed. He told me that he was okay with that and wanted to meet me. I agreed. 

I met him in a public place downtown. He took me to a restaurant and then I said I’d rather not be in public, he agreed. So we went to Subway and went to his house. 
At his house, we played video games and just hung out for a couple hours. He then started touching my thighs and then he suggested that we play pool on his pool table. I agreed.
He started being behind me a lot and holding me and touching me and calling me beautiful and soft. I felt good and needed from the things he was telling me.

I enjoy it very much and have adopted it myself, it is not offensive but can poke at people and make fun of them. Recently my old girl friends, who before would never make jokes at the expense of people have become friends with my new friends. I am usually the one driving the conversation and the joker, often making self deprecating jokes as well as poking mild fun at others. However ever since my old girl friends have become friends with my new guy friends, they have started to almost gang up on me sometimes, and they all make jokes at my expense or make fun of something I may be slightly insecure about. Just because I self deprecate for a joke and am considered class clown doesn't mean I don't have feelings.

94,"I have a matriarchal family in which my grandmother, mother, and aunt are considered the ""authorities"". Recently my wife shared some thoughts on the recent protests which my family took offense to as many of the males in my family are in law enforcement. My wife explained her thoughts to them via text, and tried to communicate that recent events are not directly connected to my cop family members but they are deliberately not responding. I reached out as well as I am the one directly related to the but I was met with hostility.

I finally reached my mother, who despite saying it was normal to have a difference in opinion proceeded to insult my wife as a ""young idiot"" for her views and said several racist things I cannot abide. She was on a rant about how ""black people don't own property so they don't mind looting"" before I cut her off and she got furious. 

After I expressed how upset I was at what she said, I hung up on her and word from other family members is that I am basically excommunicated from the family. I know in my heart that I did what I felt is right, but I am sad to say that I have trouble thinking of never being on good terms with my family again.

95,"I (24f) have been struggling with myself for a while now every time something good happens to my bf (24m). What triggers it more is knowing that nothing bd really ever happened to him. Not that I wish that for him,  but I just feel very bitter, envious, and I feel betrayed and mocked by life. I have been with him for 3 years now and he knows this. He knows how I feel about him always being better.

Here are some comparisons that kept haunting my mind:

* I was born lower class, and then my parents worked hard and now we are middle class. He was born rich and his family is getting richer.
* I have unsupportive and verbally abusive parents who always think I am not enough. He has such loving parents, even though he should have graduated last year but they never nagged him about it, let him live his life.
* My parents fight all the time ever since I was a child and I had to deal with the psychological impact of it. I remember when my mom was chasing my dad with a butcher knife. His parents are just wonderful. So loving and supportive of each other. Never heard them raise voice on each other, not even a bit.
* I have several medical conditions. Nothing too crazy but I relapse once in a while and it was the worse. He is as healthy as he can be.
* I have mental/psychological issues. I battle with many self-doubt, self-hatred, binge eating + bulimia, and suicidal thoughts. He is so confident, never had depression, life is just easy for him. The only time he felt sad was when he lost video games.
* I have to work so hard to get a job, sending applications here and there, getting rejected, feeling insecure, etc. His parents do not spoil him and he does have to work to earn money but he just works at his parent's place. No application and he can just go anytime he likes.
* Similar to the first point, basically when I want to buy something ""fancy"", I had to save up for months, and plan things out. While whenever he wants something he just buys things immediately. This was my trigger for this week. He has been buying expensive electronics/gadgets this month. Always something new. He would tell me he is planning on buying it, and I would just listen and nod. And the 3 days later, he got the thing.

I know I should be happy for him, and I of course understand how exciting it is to get new things. But all I feel is bitterness. I am so envious and salty about how easy his life is. All these 3 years I have been with him he never has any problems. Even for smaller things like video games, we both like to play ranked matches and he is climbing constantly while my rank is dropping and that even triggers me. He likes to play video games with me but every time he invites me, all I can think about is ""no, you have a good life and you can play all you want. I need to work harder, build more personal projects for the portfolio because I wanna be rich like you"".

And what I feel is worse (for me) is that he is so kind about it. When I told him that I am jealous of his life, all he does is be sweet about it, and tell me that he knows I am a hard worker and that he believes I can achieve all these one day in the future. He was never mad about my saltiness.

I want to change how I behave and feel about all this. I am being toxic. Yet somehow I feel like I can't help it. All my 4 best friends have issues and so I never had problems with them. My ex bfs also have some type of problem. I don't know why I am so stupid, why I can't handle him. Right now I am hiding from him because I don't want to be obviously bitter. He just bought a $2000 laptop last night. And that's more that my gaming PC budget that I am planning to buy 4 months later after I saved up...",01Jun2020,1

I only waved back the times he saw me because I did recognize him, but we never really had a conversation. I got a friend request from him not too long ago and didn't think much of it until he sent a message saying how he hasn't seen me in so long.

I kept my guard up, responded politely (but not flirty or overly friendly), but even if the conversation comes to a close and I don't respond, he'll eventually send another message. It makes me feel awkward because I get the sense he's not messaging to seek friendship. He seems like a nice guy, but I am just flat-out not interested. Plus I dread small talk and that was the majority of the conversations.

98,"I’m 25, have a steady job, good handful of hobbies / activities I like to keep up with. Pretty much all my life all I’ve really done is fuck around with a lot of different girls as opposed to pursuing relationships. Now I’m at a point where I’ve slowed down. I really just hang out with my family most of the time, and a couple of close friends. Thing is all my siblings are married, one of them has a kid (who I also spend time with) and my friends have partners as well. I don’t feel like I NEED a girlfriend but I’d kinda like one as I value having genuine relationships and I like the idea of having someone to share my life with at this point. 

COVID makes this seriously difficult though. I use tinder / bumble a lot, and I get a lot of matches but I’m not the funniest so it’s hard to spark conversations that get responses. The ones i do usually end up fizzling out because of COVID and not having a lot of options of things to do. I also live with my parents for the time being (just moved back to my home town and they’re letting me stay with them) so I can’t really have anyone over.

101,"I’m on mobile so formatting will most likely be crap.

But I’ve been working at my place of work for a month but I’ve been realising there are a lot of issues regarding health and COVID-19.

For example my mom is a key worker (carer and teaching assistant) so she needs to be very careful. The person who she cares for has another carer for baths etc as she’s not trained. But that carer came down with symptoms of COVID-19 and didn’t tell the man she cares for until she got tested. After she told the man, obviously he told my mom BUT he only told her after the cleaned where he lives. So both of them have a chance of having it. As I live with my mom, who has a chance of having it, I clearly cannot leave the house as well just in case. But just my luck, my phone broke and had no way of contacting work, I had to walk to work at 5am just to tell them I can’t come in because I work as a cleaner in multiple areas, on this day I had to clean at a police station. When I told my college (also ex-supervisor) she said it’s fine, told me to come in to work, if I didn’t I would have been written up as a no show and said she had masks. Then proceeded to get into an elevator with me and also the 2x4 office before giving me a mask and made me work 3 hours in offices next which were full of people. Am I over dramatic or does that seems very dangerous. 

AND THEN turns out my mom was showing symptoms so I couldn’t go to work (at this time I had a be phone so I could contact). But then my colleagues put me down as sick, even though I’m not sick. Like I get that I’m not at work but it’s not like I have a choice to go in because if she has it and I get it, I could pass it on to a whole station.

So the thing I’m asking is, how do I tell her that I feel like she’s not putting safety as a priority, especially at a time like this. Because I’ve just past my first month of working there, I’m very easily replaceable. I’m sorry for the long post but I’m genuinely confused on how to do this.

Quick edit:   when I went to tell them I couldn’t go into work (the time I had to walk because of my phone) my colleague declined when I asked her to bring me a mask. And threatened to fire me right there on the spot if I didn’t come in to work.",01Jun2020,2

103,"Long, but I’m just confused, so asking you all to read if you can. But tldr has at the bottom. Thanks

For context (not rlly needed but...) I’m a 20M college student, studying nursing and social work, Asian immigrant in America. Its summer break but I have daily academic reviews, daily association meetings, and daily (online) family commitments in both America and native families, and experiencing some internal family stress from self-quarantine/pandemic. 

With the ongoing riot and unrest about racial injustice; a lot of people in my feed/friends are posting on their IG’s and stories about constant support. However, I do not. Before the beginnings of the racial injustice postings, I post on my social media food I cook. But people are posting “oh, if you only post food and not repost BLM, you are ignorant” etc. etc. 

BUT, I am educated, and continue to be. I am passionate about social issues (not just racial, but special needs, education, etc). I do heavily recognize my privilege (I’m an Asian immigrant, but not American). And I study cultural competence and uphold this practice. To offer my support against racial injustice, I donated to the NAACP and other platforms, I told my mom the platforms her friends can donate to (bc she asked for help), signed petitions, I continue to educate myself, I volunteer in my local community in various ways, and I value/practice social participation. However, I do not share these actions in my Instagram like my friends do. My friends posts their donations, opinions, and other related postings about the riots.

But, I do not post (except continuing my food posts), not because I am a coward, ignorant, or lazy. It’s just not my preference to show my donations and other ways of social participation/activism. And I think that posting it won’t further the movement if my followers/following have seen it already, and I believe that posting it just doesn’t do anything for the sake of posting it. Yes, my close (4) friends, not all know, know I volunteer to visit juvenile inmates, cook and interact w/ homeless, I even helped create a possible policy for our local community for immigrants/homeless (for a class, but I took it for the sake of participating in the community), help fundraisers for kids affected by cancer this school year, and I value justice. But I fear that people might misunderstand my “Instagram-self” versus my actual self. I’m assuming that people who know of me knows “who I am” and what I stand for, but I’m just a private person who does support BLM and present my activism outside social media. I’m just concerned that they’ll misunderstand and I hate confrontation, especially online. 

TLDR: I post a lot of food stuff in my social media (even prior the riots from George Floyd’s death) and not BLM posts because I am a private person, not my preference of activism and social participation, and believe that random posting of BLM would not benefit the movement if ALL my followers/following are posting the same thing. I am just concerned that ppl might misunderstand my “Instagram-self” vs the real me. 

What are your advice on my social media presence versus activism? Also, doing you think I should be more present of BLM in my Insta? More importantly, is my reasoning to omit BLM in my social media acceptable for the movement and POC’s?

107,"Hello everyone, this is my current life situation. I just finished my freshman year of college and had a lot of trouble making friends. Some of my friends in high school go to the same college as me, and I found myself hanging out with them a lot. I noticed that I was hanging with them almost too much first semester, so the second semester I decided to rush a frat. When I was pledging the fraternity, I found that I was meeting new people and definitely making friends, but I ended up dropping my bid. I regret doing this because I don't talk to anyone in the fraternity anymore, and I feel like I lost out in making friends through that. Fast forward, the virus hits and we are forced to quarantine in our homes.

 I have a couple of friends from my town, but the issue with them is I have problems with *some* of them. We get along on a friendly basis and they're cool to hang out with, but my values and their values are unalike. They behave immaturely, and when around them I feel like I have to act a certain way in order to satisfy them... I have that feeling that I need new friends. I want to meet new people that will make me a better person and to make life more enjoyable, whether that be through a relationship with a girl or friendships I don't care. I wouldn't even consider myself anti-social or an introvert, I'm a pretty outgoing person and I like being social it just feels like I haven't found my people.

109,"I (31M) have my own house in a nice part of my city. The house next to me is owned by a couple, probably the same age as me. 

So a few weeks ago, I was getting home, and my neighbors were in their yard. While walking up to my door, my female neighbor stops me and asks ""hey. Would it be ok to plant some flowers over here?"" (Pointing to the area in between the side of my house and their concrete driveway. It’s about 5 feet wide, 25 feet long).

I said sure, that sounds fine. Thinking they would have a small patch of marigolds toward the back or something. 

But now, they have built a raised garden bed and are tearing up the grass all beside my house for about 20 feet. It's MUCH more than I anticipated. And they had friends over pulling up the grass yesterday while I had my blinds open, and they could see right inside my house. 

I don't want to be petty. But it makes me uncomfortable having them lay claim to so much of my property. And i don't know if they were purposely deceptive about just ""planting some flowers"". But I feel like they are taking advantage.

I also can't even begin to think of starting a game design company because a fast food wage ($5.25 ish tipped, $8.25 non tipped) in Florida can't give me enough to save up to start a company or even think of hiring a friend at a crap wage. What should I do to better my resume/get a good job/get a leg up the ladder in this industry I so love?",01Jun2020,1
125,"Around November a girl handed me her number at work and claimed she liked me. I didn’t respond for a couple months because i had some personal issues that needed attending. I ended up talking to her a couple weeks before quarantine really started. She still proclaimed then that she liked me (and still had now 3 months later), but there’s one thing that worries me and i need advice on.

She’s not allowed to hang out and hasn’t been able to hang out for almost 4 months since quarantine started. She revisits the discussion with her dad and so far, the answer is no. We text, we snapchat, we instagram dm, but no facetime. I brought it up before and asked to facetime. She said she would and then bailed because she said she’s still not completely comfortable yet. I have no reason to distrust her because she is genuinely a shy girl. This conversation happened early May. We instead snapchat video messaged later on. (sending voiced messages through snapchat). Yesterday night i decided to ask her if she wanted to facetime. She said as long as she’s not super tired from work sure. So i revisit the conversation today and ask if she’s still up to facetime. She completely dodged the question and started a new conversation as if my question didn’t even exist. 

The advice i need is where do i go from here? I don’t want to push the facetime thing anymore tonight if she’s just not comfortable with it yet and this is her way of telling me. But i want to see her and at least get to know her better. The only way to do that is facetime. I promised her i’d be patient and wait until she’s ready, but i’m really starting to run out of patience here because i really like her and being limited by text and snapchat alone irks me. I want to respect her boundaries at the moment, but at the same time i want to be honest about what i’m feeling to her. I wanna chat with her online and i just need some advice on how i should proceed from here.",01Jun2020,1

129,"Hello, I'm an adult college student and unfortunately, live with my parents atm. My parents, growing up, would always refer to black people as ""those people"" and say things like ""they choose to live in poverty and filth"" and that its their fault cops do things like stop and frisk because ""they choose to be criminals"" and ""statistically, they do more crimes""

Obviously, with recent events, their racism has shot through the roof. Any time I talk to them the first thing they go to is how awful the protesters are and that they deserve to be shot at. It irritates me enormously, but with the while COVID thing I have nobody else to talk to.

I tried to tell them about how black people have it hard in America and not all of them are looting (ex: the people holding hands/taking a knee quietly and police attacked them) but they just don't care. They say things like ""I hope they all get shot at"" just for being there. Anytime I try to direct the conversation to something new, it always go back to the protests as they watch the news constantly.

Even weirder is they claim they are democrats and against racism. Its like they are against only ""certain kinds"" of racism and they only want other races to have some rights, but not if it interferes with them at all.....basically, they're pro-segregation

Tldr: I just want to know how to persuade someone not to be racist or just how to direct a conversation without it going back to the protests.",01Jun2020,1
130," This will be long but PLEASE bear with me. I made an account just to post this. I am in a very dark place and really need some advice/help. I also just really need to write out all my feelings. Please excuse any grammar, spelling, etc mistakes, I am crying as I type this out.

I used to live in rural Indiana with my family. We were incredibly happy and always had a very close bond. In hindsight, everything was going so well. I was happy. And then a couple days ago I moved to LA. Why the sudden, brash change? 

Here's some insight:

For the longest time I have led others, and myself, to believe that I wanted to pursue working in the animation industry. Every time I repeated this I felt a sort of disconnect with it? Like an automatic ""I'm good!"" when someone asks how you're doing. I just liked drawing and coming up with characters, something that didn't seem like it fit in with the traditional just ""being an artist"" at the time. I thought the only way I would get to do what I liked with art would be entering the animation industry.

Well, flash forward to the present. I have a Bachelor's degree in Fine Art with a specialization in Animation. I don't regret college because I met some wonderful people that have become lifelong friends and a support group. They are all interested in pursuing a career in the animation industry. Everyone talked about how excited they were to work and get started. 

At the time, I thought I did too, although the disconnect I mentioned before was always present. I'd repeat the same ""this is definitely what I want to do!"" idea over and over but I never *felt* it. It was as if I was just saying it to appease everyone. It must also be noted that for my entire life I have struggled with chronic depression and a serious anxiety disorder.

I graduated last May and my friends and I had cooked up a plan to work for a year to save money then move to LA. Originally, we had a whole group involved. There were 7 of us. We were all going to move out around the same time and have each other as a support group. Things got scrambled. While I worked my factory job saving money, the group split up. My closest friend was heavily pressured by her parents to start a career teaching English in Japan. Others moved to different locations or months before our planned time. Without going into gross detail, it came down to me, A, and D. None of us are close enough to each other to really provide that support group aspect. It very much had the feeling of “well i wanna move and LA is crazy expensive so i need roommates”. 

Things got scrambled worse and, once again without getting crazy detailed, I am now sitting in LA with just A. He’s very kind and sweet, but we are not close and our relationship isn’t at the point where either of us are super comfortable about sharing our feelings. I very much feel like I am just here so the apartment is cheaper. That A would not choose to live with me just for the fun of it.

So I am essentially alone. On the other side of the continent from home. I miss it terribly. To the point of feeling ill. I have been unable to eat from the constant anxious feeling of needing to throw up. I have also been unable to stop crying. I have always been a person that does *not* let others see me cry and I cried in the middle of Walmart earlier. I had to leave my dog behind and just thinking of her makes me bawl. Just thinking of all this in general is making me cry. 

I suddenly realized the feelings expressed in the earlier paragraphs about my art “career” a few hours ago. And I cannot shake the feeling that this was a mistake. I should not have moved here because I do not feel the desire to do what I’ve been *saying* I’ve wanted to for years. They were just surface ambitions, easy answers. I love art deeply, but I do not want to live here and pursue this. 

I am still very young and I definitely have the time to try again (we all do). I want to return home so badly it hurts. But I am wracked with guilt over leaving A here. I have the money to cover my portion of rent, I paid for our hotel stops on the way here (we drove), and I paid for my half of the uhaul trailer we towed. I also have enough money to return home. 

A is a very resourceful, strong person and would certainly be able to maintain himself here. We moved into an open room in an apartment with a very nice woman we recently met and we were only planning on staying here until August. Then D would be ideally joining us and we would all find a place together. However, D has expressed concern over the state of everything right now (understandable) and it is not 100% set in stone that she is moving here. The state of affairs also has me constantly anxious.

Writing this out has helped me figure things out a lot and I don’t think I will be staying. I hate to fall into the “small town person intimidated by big city” bucket, mainly because that isn't true. I’m not intimidated by the city, it's beautiful. I just don’t feel that this is a good fit for me. I am terribly homesick, but after a lot of thought it is not what is truly fueling this. I feel extremely foolish for not realizing these things before making such a huge decision and I feel that I have lied to everyone I have ever known, including myself. 

What would you do in my situation? Do you feel that I would be in the wrong moving back home and leaving A? We are all grown, albeit younger adults with a good deal of money saved.",01Jun2020,1
132,"to start off, i don’t want to give my name for privacy reasons. i’m a teenager that has been active on twitter since mid 2018-end of 2018 and until now, there have been countless things that i witnessed.

due to the fact that my first community was kpoptwt, i was immediately exposed to countless problems (i won’t go in depth because this isn’t what the post is about) but before i left kpoptwt, which was near the end of 2019, there was a “fancam situation”.

a lot of people might be familiar with it but for the ones who are new to this, i will give a brief explanation. users have started to create gore fancams. they were adding in scenes of any gruesome situation, from self harm to decapitation, anything you can think of. 

of course, during the time, i wasn’t interested in them until a few weeks ago where i stumbled upon them once more. this time there was a whole community called goretwt, troll accounts that would do this to trigger people, people that found it nice etc. 

i always knew i liked gore but it was always the type i saw in movies, because i am an avid fan of horror movies. however, i did not know my tolerance to gore was this high.

the moment i found out about one account it was a rabbit hole. in the end, i found myself watching these videos for an hour and going through multiple accounts. what disturbed me was not the stuff i saw, no. it was the pleasant feeling it left behind.

there is something about these that makes it pretty. i don’t know the reason but looking at blood never disgusted me. in fact, i think it’s beautiful and i like looking at it. 

i know this is wrong because the people in the videos are clearly dead. is it normal to feel like this? is this a way to cope? reddit is the only place i can ask this in peace. please tell me your thoughts and advices because i feel insane",01Jun2020,0
133,"Hi all,  sorry if it seems like i'm bragging I truly do not mean to gloat

I am a very fortunate 20(m), I will be getting my second bachelor's degree on full scholarship(finance and marketing will be my two degrees) from a top 20 university on this upcoming April, previously I dropped out of school for a year to be a manager at a fast-food place and saved up enough money to quit and go back to school full time and make money from day trading stocks. I live with my best friend of 6 years and have a very loving and caring boyfriend. I have an okay relationship with my family. Aside from the challenges of school, which quite frankly is not too difficult for me I still have plenty of free time to play videogames, and generally be unproductive.

I have a seemingly great future ahead of me. But to put it bluntly, I don't care about any of it.

I maintain my grades because if I don't i'll lose my scholarship and have to drop out of school, but with the exception of my grades i've just lost all drive and motivation. I have worked incredibly hard to get ahead in life, working 60 hours a week ( illegally as a minor) and 70-80 hours a week for a year and 3 months once I turned 18. I have busted my ass like I can't even imagine, but now I can't find it in me to care or keep pushing like I used to. Everything is so bleak, boring, and doesn't seem worth my time

I have all these great things in life, but my brain is telling me to just let it all go to waste.  And it makes me feel like a privileged, spoiled brat that I somehow manage to find sadness even when I have nothing but blessings

What can I do to care? Have any of you been in a similar situation, how did you get out?

136,"Sorry for the bad grammar. English is not my first language 
So, my mom has always been kind of overprotective on the wrong things but has abandoned me on others.
She is always suspecting I am doing drugs and makes jokes about it or even went into conversations where she just blatantly accused me of that. My mom has trouble letting me go out and hang out with my friends or even when I have to go to anything else that involves moving around. She tties to manage my life in ways that are just overwhelming, like getting angry when I dress up like I want or trying to drive me everywhere and never letting me have my own space. She will tell me she gets migraines whenever I tell her that I want to do my own life or when I'll be put with friends.
She makes me feel trapped and I can't go with my dad bc he is just worse (he is a narcissist and has made my life hell to the point of me being suicidal). Mom knows how I feel when I am with him and threatens me to send me there so I can ""have some discipline"". 
I feel very giulty for being angry at mom however, sje had trouble concieving and had already lost 2 babies before being pregnant with me. 
She usually tells me she doesn't wanna give up on me, the problem is that moms behaviour combined with the life circunstances I had made me wanna give up on myself (I told her that, but she only listen when things go her way). 
Now. Why do I suspect moms been interviening my phone? The reason is that, like a month ago she started going on rants about things that I only chat with my friends or things that she is not suppoused to know. Everything clicked when I saw some pictures that I took with my phone in the screen of my moms phone and thats when I started suspecting.

139,"Hey everybody, some context first: We're both female highschool students that go to some fancy Catholic academy * I'm transferring soon because I'm moving to a new city with even better schools, so it would make sense to do so, but it isn't relevant to this situation at all * and I'm a bisexual. I'm not out to everyone in my immediate family, just my Dad and 2 of my siblings. Most people at school know I am though, because I don't care about them knowing. 

My best friend is pretty far behind everyone else relationship wise. Nearly everyone we know has slept with multiple people * including me * and she hadn't even had her first kiss yet. This made her pretty self-concious. Everyone at school always thought she was a lesbian, including me. She has streakily bleached/hair that's cut in a boyish, neck-length way. Her style of dress looks extremely ""gay"", and all of those things paired with a short-tempered, masculine attitude and not wanting to talk to boys...you see what I mean. We clicked immediately the summer before we started school together, and have been best friends since. 

I had a huge crush on her all of Freshman year, and thought she was into girls as well. I never told her because she always said she was straight and didn't want to be rude and pushy, or make things awkward between us. Late December of 2019, she comes over for a sleepover, and I'm not sure what was different about this night, but I just found myself so absolutely enfatuated by her. We often times changed in the same room, but I couldn't take my eyes off of her this specific time while she pulled off her clothes and put on something more comfortable. I followed suit, and suggested we played a PC game. 

We waddled over to my computer desk to play The Sims 4 , but as she sat down I realized I only have one computer chair. She told me to sit on her lap * I'm a lot smaller than her for context, 150 pounds 5'6"" vs 170 pounds 5'11"" * and I did. We played for around 20 minutes before I noticed she was grabbing at my hips and ass a lot. I turned to look at her and giggled, and started playing with her hair. She was looking at me funny, with these dreamy eyes, kinda how I look at her. I told her I was ""tired of playing"" and said we should go lay down and listen to music. She lay down and I straddled her as we talked about school and some random shit (lol). I kissed her, and it was absolutely magical. More stuff happened and things got super intense, she even called me her girlfriend! I was on Cloud-fucking-9. Then the next morning, I wake up to her next to me, and kiss her on the forehead. She smiles, but I can tell something's off. She goes home, and two days later, I get an Instagram DM. It's a long message about how she's not gay and what happened didn't mean anything. I was so upset, she'd broken my heart. How could she be my girlfriend one second and then be....straight? 2 days later? I was furious. I ignored her for a month and planned to never talk to her again * long story short another friend of ours tricked me into meeting up with her to make up *. She was actually really upset and torn up over hurting me, she wouldn't stop sobbing and apologizing and talking about how upset she was that her confusion had hurt me. It took everything I had to not deny her apology, but I didn't. 

A couple months later, things are mostly back to normal. But she comes to sleep over, and one thing leads to another.....we're making out again. Um????? bitch what? 
During this make-out session (lmao) I told her that my romantic feelings had gone away after she hurt me and that whatever came of this had to remain purely physical. She kept repeating that she doesn't want to hurt me again and she was taking herself out of the mood * if you catch my drift *. I was getting fed up so I rolled over and went to bed. Every time we talked about those two nights after, she'd say that she's still sure she's straight and that she thinks I'm hot but...""doesn't feel anything"" when we do stuff like that. FYI, when we did these things, she'd be VERY...enthusiastic * and she started it both times *, so I don't understand how that could be true. She now says she's on the gray, asexuality spectrum? Her dad's catholic and is forcing her to be, although she's an atheist. Could that be it? I don't know what it is about her, but I can't get her out of my fucking head and my romantic feelings have come back. She's beautiful, and teaches me how to be a more considerate and sweet person. She's amazing, as angry as she can make me. I still see her look at me funny sometimes, but we've talked about what's happened those nights so many times, and she'll always claim she's straight afterwards. I need help guys lmaoooo",01Jun2020,1

I understand this is an important experience for me and future relationships I have, but I still can’t seem to figure it out- I just need that final push to actually do it. The only problem is, I’m incredibly patient and tolerant and it hasn’t allowed me to pull through with the words even though I know that I *need* to.

I realize that I need to do it soon, for the best of both of us. I know I’m holding both her and I back by not doing this. We practically live together (although she does have her own apartment) and our roommates have moved out. It seems like the perfect time, with little distractions. But I still can’t actually get the balls to say the words, and everytime I “pump myself up” to say them, my mind wonders to the effects and immediate life afterwards and it drives me away from saying it. Some days the relationship feels awesome and we get along well, and other times neither one of us wants to talk to each other. We are with eachother 24/7 since lockdown, and probably before too.

I don’t have anyone I feel comfortable talking to about this in person, so I’m here kind of hoping for that last push, maybe some similar experiences and techniques people used to say the words. I don’t know if this is some sort of internal issue where I always look for immediate gratification or something. I’ve even been reading books about motivations and habits in hope it could somehow change me and get me to do it.

142,"May 31st, 2020, around 5:00 I was crossing a street on my bike, I stopped to let the cars go by but the driver said I could go. There was another car going the opposite way who was at the other stop sign. As soon as I crossed and made sure it was okay for me to go because both cars stopped and was fully aware I was going to cross, the car on the opposite side starting driving full speed and hit me from my right side. I flew off my bike about 6 feet away, until people starting coming out of their houses to call 911 and stay with me until they got there. An ambulance came about 5 minutes after, and I was taken to the hospital, leaving about 2 hours later because I only had minor injuries. Just a contusion on the leg, and a bit of back pain, nothing major thankfully. I am home currently, and I’m walking on crutches because of the difficulty of walking. I know it could’ve been a lot worse, and I know I made a mistake by not waiting for both cars to past. I am scared to go by roads and I want to isolate myself before I make a similar mistake or get hurt worst. I never want to go through that experience again, the nervousness and pain was too much for me even for it to be minor injuries.

144,"I (14M, diagnosed with social anxiety and haven't had therapy in about 6 months) have a habit of getting really inspired by fictional characters and taking my favorite characteristics and trying to integrate them into my own personality and life. It can be good or bad and it's really up to interpretation. Anyways, I recently read Good Omens and I was really inspired Aziraphale as a character. His good, yet introverted nature, and it's made me just want to be a generally better person. 

I have some habits and I really want to work on them but I honestly don't know how and have gotten a lot of shit advice on it. So here they are, and here are what I've done so far:

\-I talk too much about myself or things I like

a. The only advice I've gotten is to listen more than speak. This mere advice doesn't work for me. I've tried podcasts, but when it comes to real life, I tend to either ask so many questions it sounds like I'm prying, I just nod and act like I'm listening which makes people think I'm not, or I get asked a question and go on a rant or derail the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I'm super anti-social and have issues making friends

a. The main advice I've gotten is just ""put yourself out there"". I've joined clubs, I've done volunteer work, talked to people, but nothing really ever sticks. I find I usually just get rejected if I work up that far, or the conversations become one-sided and uncomfortable. 

\-I tend to get annoyed or aggravated by people I don't know very well

   a. I find once I do make a friend, things usually go well, but when I'm just meeting someone I'm not only a little judgy, but if I don't like someone I get a little annoyed and might brush them off. I know it's shitty, but I don't know how to tell someone ""hey, you're really nice, but I don't think this will work out""

\-I express my emotions and thoughts extremely bluntly and it makes people uncomfortable or upset. I never mean to be rude it's usually more genuine questions or just expressing discomfort or sadness. 

a. most people have just said keep a journal for emotions, but I really feel the need to speak or even just get a response. I also often get criticized for thinking too much so I guess I'm just thinking in the wrong places.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I just... I don't know. I just want to know how to improve. Besides these, I can't really pinpoint anything really awful, but I still feel like there's something wrong and there's something that makes me insufferable and crappy and I really just want to improve and become better. It doesn't have to be on the topics listed specifically, I just want to be better.  I express my emotions too freely and it ends up making things uncomfortable or upset and I never really mean to be I'm just very blunt and I want to learn to be polite and y'know a better or more likable person. I get it, the inspiration of the week is a dumbass anyways, but I respect the ridiculous dumbassery, I just don't want to be rude and I sometimes tend to be when I really don't mean it.

145,"This ended up being about 6 good length paragraphs, I'm not sure if that's considered long for this subreddit, but here's a warning. A lot of it ended up being me describing my family so you all could understand better, if there's anything you need me to clarify just let me know.

So I (16F) have a younger sister (12F) that a friend of mine and I believe to have some form of mental illness or disorder (Asperger's has been thrown around but obviously neither of us are professionals so I'm not trying to diagnose her) because she is socially inept, not necessarily in a bad way but she seems to be a few years behind her peers, where she has trouble picking up on social cues and often doesn't realize something she is doing/saying is wrong or insensitive without someone telling her and also faces anger issues. She tends to go to the worst-case scenario first and is honestly a bit of a crybaby (this coming from a fellow crybaby). Even if it's not anything that could be labeled, it is obvious she would benefit from therapy and possibly special classes in school.

From that description, you can probably guess she isn't getting the help she needs. Aside from all of her current issues, she was also molested by our brother (14 at the time I think, 15 now. I'm also not sure molested is the correct term because I've never been strong to push that conversation on her but I know it wasn't full-on r\*\*\*). This situation was never taken to the police, instead, our brother was sent to live with our dad as soon as it was discovered, but despite that he's not completely out of our life, we are still subjected to being around him sometimes, but I make sure they are never alone and I've even taken her with me to a friend's when I could, and I personally do not talk to my brother at all even when he's around. He's given up on trying to speak to me and my sister and we basically ignore each other while we're in the same house, which I am grateful for. 

Speaking of my parents, they are separated and my sister and I live with our mom and her long-term boyfriend (10+ years). They are alcoholics and smoke and sell weed in a state where it's still illegal (not against it, just stating facts) as well as use other drugs, though I don't think those as often. They argue a lot, have gotten physical many times in the past, and we do depend on her boyfriend's income unfortunately as my mom is a high school dropout that quit her job back in late 2019  and has been unemployed since. She is stubborn and has plenty of anger herself, and her boyfriend is honestly a major asshole too, especially when he's drunk. The bottom line is they clash a lot and you never know when things will go from perfect and happy to absolute hellhole. They aren't always like that obviously, but when it happens it's bad. I'd say I have an okay relationship with my mom, but it's honestly a very shallow relationship and I disclose too many ""big"" things to her regarding my mental health and things like that as I realized long ago she'll often focus on the wrong thing or the classic ""you need to stop crying.""

Finally, I am going to be a senior in high school when things start back up, meaning I'll be off to college in a little over a year. I also have not been diagnosed with anything nor been to therapy of any kind, but I know I face my own mental issues, at the very least some form of anxiety disorder. I have also always been ""the favorite,"" the perfect older child who doesn't argue and throw tantrums when in reality I was too scared to do so. I was reaping the benefits while crying my eyes out in my room every time I had a problem because I couldn't bring myself to stand up for what was going on in my house. I was a peacemaker and a comforter for my younger siblings, and while I've gotten better in past years, unfortunately, I'm still much more likely to cry and rant to my friends than speak up.   
The reason I am saying all of this is because I want some advice (obviously) with how to help my sister. I know the household I grew up in is toxic to some degree and my family are the types to not prioritize mental health if they even acknowledge it at all. I want advice on how to help my sister and get her the help she needs before it's too late, as well as what exactly I should or could do to get there while I prepare for college. I already know what college I'm going to (hopefully), it's about an hour away from my home and I don't want to leave my sister behind at all, but I need to get out of the house. The options my friend and I have come up with in the past have been 1) I get my shit together and confront my mom about all of this and have some very difficult discussions, which needs to happen anyway but I'm pretty scared about it, especially while we're still relying on her; 2) I get the authorities involved which I believe could go south very fast; or 3) I have those difficult discussions with my dad and his girlfriend instead who aren't perfect by any means, but are objectively better than my mom, and try to convince them to essentially switch off where they take my sister and my mom takes my brother, but my mom kind of basically hates my dad and his gf and for some reason practically ignores what my brother did now that time has passed (it's been about a year since we discovered the situation).

I've had this on my mind for a long time and part of me is always trying to figure out what to do, but I'm scared of all of the options in one way or another, mostly because I'm afraid of the change and the shift in dynamics that will come with this. I know I need to let go of this thin veil of functionality but having to go through with it is probably the most frightening thing I've ever considered doing. If you do comment, please at least try to be polite, I already know I should have spoken up sooner and done more for my sister, I'm just trying to focus on what I can do now. I just want my sister to get what she needs, at least therapy above all else so that when I do leave and I won't be around her 24/7 she'll be okay. Thank you for reading through all of this.",01Jun2020,1

148,"I am a 27 year old female, who has gone through life only caring about grades, career and other accomplishments. I went to a top tier university, have a fabulous selective job at a prestigious tech company, earn over $250k. On paper, it seems like the perfect life and that I should be happy but I am not. I feel like I have enjoyed my life more.

I am always anxious about the future which prevents me from enjoying life even more. E.g., I often turn down invitations to parties because I wanna go home and read the latest industry news or take an online course - not because I enjoy it but because I am worried that I will fall behind. 

If being successful is not making me happy, is it worth it? 

I'm also looking to date a guy yet most of the guys I meet are near-exact copies of me- incredibly boring, career-obsessed nerds who just wanna play video or board games in their free time? I find myself drawn to guys who were cool and social through high school and college, probably in a frat. 

TL;DR - Wondering if anyone had any thoughts on how I can be more happy, reduce my anxiety, build a social circle that I am proud of and find a fun boyfriend? I'd really like to work on myself and turn my life around.",01Jun2020,1
149,"So 9 years ago, when I was 3 or 4, I was very close with my half sister. We’ll call her Sammy for now. Sammy’s my half sister on my dad’s side. She’s 10 years older than me, and lived with her mother in Hawaii. She visited for the holidays, Summer, and sometimes Spring break. But when I turned 3 or 4, she decided she didn’t want to show up anymore. Her mother had told her all these awful things about my dad, and asked for my mom to pay her money on a yearly basis for no reason. She also wanted my parents to pay for her college. After my mom refused to pay for her college, Sammy didn’t show up anymore, and I hadn’t been in contact with her up until last night. I found her instagram, and my mother told me it was alright to message her just as long as my father didn’t find out. I messaged her about my life and how I’ve been doing, and she messaged back telling me about her life. She seemed pleased to speak with me. But the thing is, now that we’re speaking to each other after 9 years, I have no idea how to get closer to her. I want my big sister back. What should I should do?",01Jun2020,2
150,"Me (F 20) and this guy (M 21) have been dating roughly for 1 month and half , and have hung out roughly 5 times. We basically have been going on several different dates one a week, had sex, and it has gotten so personal that he has shared his own personal problems and has been vulnerable with me. There’s time where we just literally stare into each others eyes and you can tell the chemistry is there. It feels like way longer than a month and a half and it just feels like it’s the right time for him to make it official. I haven’t dated to get in a relationship in a while so I don’t know if a month and half of talking should be long enough for him to make it official. I don’t want to ask him where we stand because he has made it very clear that he is interested in me but I just feel bad because he would jokingly say “he wants me to be his” but i don’t know if he’s still trying to be sure so that’s why he hasn’t asked.

I was merely walking down the alley breaking no laws. 

The police questioned me though and I feel like I narrowly escaped being arrested for nothing. I’m thinking of buying a body camera and wearing it on my walks. That way, I can show police the footage if I get accused of of something like this again. Would it work? Is it a good idea?",01Jun2020,3
153,"Okay so I am 16 tomorrow and my mom and stepdad keep telling me that I'm not doing enough in school 

Average highschoolers turn in about 2 credits a week and I have been turning in 4-6 credits a week as well as reading massive books and doing extra work to help plan out my future 

I am graduating 2 years early, technically 3 since I was held back, and I have a scholarship to a few schools because of my insanely high gpa and how early I am graduating as well as my AVID elective helping me out with that 

My mom graduated hs a year early but never graduated college and instead went to the marines and after about a year ended up dropping out of that after she popped the tendon in her ankle and my stepdad who passed hs only because he spent a majority of his hs life at a boy's ranch and never even tried to go to college and never went to the military 

They both constantly nag at me for not doing enough in school and not being like my older brother (m17) (I am actually doing better than him) 

Because of the quarentine my mental health issues have gotten worse especially with the riots that have been happening. I have depression, anxiety, I am bipolar, I also have some more that I can't remember atm and although it's super fucked up violence makes me delirious and overjoyed and so I end up getting worse in my head and since I can't see my therapist I get worse and worse by the week

Back to what I was saying I am going to be graduating on 4/20/2021 which is before my older brother graduates and even earlier than my mother graduated and I will be the first in my family with a scholarship

I am constantly yelled and screamed at to do more, always grounded for not doing enough, smacked or getting my hair pulled (I have extremely long hair that goes a little past my butt that my mom makes me tie back in a tight bun like she did in the Marines) all for not getting at least a B- on everything 

I have A's and I only have one B- which actually got all my stuff taken from me for 2 months as well as being stuck in my all white room with nothing except for 2 changes of clothes a mattress with a blanket, my schoolwork, and 1 meal a day 

They say I need to do better but idk what more I can do in school to make them feel like I am doing enough work for them 

I even tutor my older brother and occasionally give him screenshots of my work to help him with his classes (which ik he just copies) 

I've done the most that I can and tbh all I want is to have a normal 16y/o life and be able to fail a test or 2 with not such a bad backlash and to graduate on time or a semester early maybe and to not get everything taken from me every week 

Idk what to do and I need help with this 

TL;DR my parents aren't satisfied with the amount of schoolwork that I am doing despite graduating 2 years early and having a scholarship and tutoring my older brother and take extreme punishments to get me to do more but idk what more I can do to satisfy their need for my success

Also I live in California, USA",01Jun2020,1
154,"This has been going on for a few months and today has just been too much but my mom
told me the reason why she always tells me I don’t deserve to be sad is because my therapist told her so. I’m f(14) and she’s f(41). 

So a few months ago I wanted to open up a little bit to my mom a little bit so I started letting her into my therapy seasons at first she would be quiet but then she would always ask me why I would feel depressed after every season (which is dumb because she knows it runs on my dads side of the family) , my response would be vague since I didn’t want to tell her anything big yet.

When I started to tell my therapist about how manipulative her and my brother were she would always change the subject and when we got home and at any moment where I would have an episode she would scream at me telling me I had no right to feel depressed and that I was weak. 

I didn’t say anything about it until recently when she told me my therapist is the one who told her to say it, and I don’t know what to do because she keeps telling me to go live with my dad if I’m so depressed with her and that she’ll drop me off and then leave so I don’t have to see her again. But she knows I’m scared of my dad so I don’t know what to do or if I should tell anyone near me. I don’t want to go with my dad but she keeps screaming at me and threatening my brother and the dogs.

I just want her to calm down and to stop yelling everyday, but I’m not sure what to do. I’m not even sure if this is the right subreddit to ask but it’s worth trying",01Jun2020,3

Whenever I think about my future, my mind gets clouded with doubt, confusion and fear.....and All I see is and end of road, surrounded by Pitch Black Emptiness.......... I don't have a dream or wish what I want to be and that scares me......  


I took a small trip hopping I would be able to achieve or be able to see something but Nothing.  


I then, worked (as game dev) for 3 months for an animation company(for kids only)......hopping that would help........but I was forced to resign my job by my parents because they believe that I might end up Introvert, Violent....etc... They also believed that my job was worthless. They told that if I work in there for too long, I might get a communication disorder.  


Currently I am working for my father as an accountant. My brother is working there as Executive director.

161,"I live i’m Canada and i’m pretty sure I have some really bad anxiety. Telling my parents isn’t the issue, i’ve told them how I feel many times for the last 3 years but they haven’t taken any action to get a diagnosis or medication. My mum just says if I go exercise I’ll be fine and cured. I would really like to get this under control before my senior year of high school.

 I endlessly worry about everything to the point where I feel like I’m holding my breath a lot of the time. I bite my nails, cuticles, lips, and cheeks to the point where they’re bleeding most of the time or scabbed. I have panic attacks and over react when I am in tense situations. I cry when I have to face confrontation, someone raises their voice at me or have a serious talk with someone. I have trouble breathing and sweat really badly when I’m in uncomfortable situations or have to talk to stranger. I avoid contact with strangers or acquaintances. I don’t talk in class because it makes me so anxious and worries me. I spend most of my days worrying about university and my future. I don’t know if this is anxiety but it makes me anxious when stuff in my room is organized and clean so I clean up like 24/7 and my family is so messy to the point where it makes me physically upset.

I honestly just want to feel calm. Where do I go to talk to someone about this and get a prescription? If anyone could walk me through how it works that would be amazing because no one in my family is helpful or knowledgeable about this. Do I ask my mum to take me to go to my family doctor? Do I have to see a therapist because I don’t think I can do that right now. I think the walk in clinic only take calls right now but I’m not sure because of COVID at the moment?

165,"Since I turned 17, I've realized that Older men (mostly late 40s ish) have been staring, and talking to me. The first time I noticed was when I was walking to work.

It was sunny. I was wearing sorts (it was 95° F). I hate to think it was what I was wearing, but I know that it's not my job to manage their thoughts. I started my walk, and ahead I see this older man get into his truck (WM). When I get up to his truck, he hasn't moved. I walk by but I remember thinking ""It's scary to be a girl in America, good thing that it hasn't happened to me"". Then behind me I hear a honk, I turn around mostly thinking that maybe my stepdad came to give me a ride. I look and WM pulls up beside me. Here the conversation.

Wm- Hey are you going this way, I can give you a ride. 

Me- (not hearing what he said) what?

Wm- I can give you a ride, I'm already going this way anyway

Me- Oh No Thank you

Wm- are you sure? A pretty girl like you shouldn't walk alone.

Me- I like the walk, thanks

He drives away. Though the situation didn't come with any conflict it made me uneasy for the rest of my work day. The next day I saw the truck again, but this time, I swear he was following me.

(I am male and I live in Georgia) Last year was the worst start for my Freshman year of High school. First I had this will we/won’t we relationship with this girl who ended up going with another guy who just likes her for her body and influenced her badly .Since we were close and good friends that left me on a bad note and I started stressing and failing my classes. Then friends left me behind and became influenced by school as well, even though I have always been there for them and made them my number 1 priority. During this I made a dumb mistake and rebounded with another girl who shared a similar situation with me. I had my first kiss with her in the woods after school, turns out she ended up using me and other guys to get through her situation and ended up with a drug addict. I had a little hope in that one of my exes helped me through my situation and became a good friend of mine again. During quarantine we’ve been texting but I slowly started to notice that she is enjoying talking to me less and less. She moves on from people and friends quickly (reason why we broke up in the first place) that’s just how she is however , she is a sweet and caring person, just gets treated badly by guys due to her being one of the most attractive girls in school. Coming close to next year I am afraid of getting attached to people because I’m scared of being left behind by friends, I haven’t answered my current friends texts because I’m scared they’ll leave too.

173,"I'm a 17 year old and so is my boyfriend, we're in a straight relationship. It's extremely important to note that I was his first relationship, I even was his first kiss. That's why I'm not gone yet.
Some backstory, my boyfriend and I got together right before quarentine. We had amazing chemistry beforehand, he was always so sweet to me and paid so much good attention to me. Now, it's completely different. I'll list my problems with the relationship in a list.
1) We never talk. I've had this conversation with him 2-3 times and it hasn't changed. I always initiate the conversation and half of the times he leaves me on read. He's never asked to hang out, to ft, to phonecall, nothing. He's never even checked up on me. 
2) He doesn't care about my requests. I told him that I was upset for him not telling me goodnight last night. He made excuses and when I said I was upset again, he said ""okay, be upset"". He was even up when I told him goodnight!!! It's now almost midnight the next night and he still hasn't said goodnight tonight, either. I also texted him around 1 am some night last week if he was up because I was upset. He told me the next day that he didn't answer because he was focusing on homework. He completely ignored me for homework that he put off until that night, didn't even text me that he'd respond late or couldnt text because of homework.
3) He's rude. He treats me like one of his friends. He's never affectionate, we can spend an entire day together and we won't kiss at all. He doesn't even touch my leg or something. Tonight, we were at a birthday party. He called me babe maybe once, my name once, and the rest of the time he was calling me things like ""bitch"", ""asshole"", ""fucker"", even under his breath, not intending me to hear them. I was also trying to LIGHTLY flirt one time, nothing serious or sexual, and he LEFT ME ON READ. Just opened it and never responded. On the way to his house when dropping him off after the party, he yelled at me. Literally yelled at me for going 1 mph through stop signs that no one was near. 
4) It's starting to get physical. It was never really ""physical"" until tonight. I was playing with his knife which he always carries and he tried to rip it from my hands. He also tried to rip my shoe off even after I was saying for him to stop in a very strong voice. Same thing happened with my phone. Out of no where, he tries to grab my phone TWICE. Once was slight, the other was like a tug of war with MY phone. I was telling him to stop and no and let go of it in a very serious, not funny voice. I was even looking at him like ""what the fuck dude"". I'm afraid it'll escalate, especially since he has slight anger issues and always carries a knife.

175,"So, I’m a 6’3” 220 lb teen of African American descent. I’m straight but I won’t touch a woman. The reason behind this is that I fear being feared. I have a lot of female friends who trust me and a lot of girls wanting to be in relationships but I push them away. 

When women try to touch me, whether it be a friendly hug, a kiss, or even accidental I make it a point to avoid them at all costs. I don’t have a self image issue and I am still very attracted to women but I don’t want to ever touch a woman at all because of societal issues and the fear of being thought of as a bad person. 

I’ve been in a 2 year relationship before and I rarely if ever touched her at all in any way. Because of this I fear I’ll never be able to be in another relationship again or get married or anything of the sort. 

Whenever I accidentally touch a woman or they touch me I see all possible wrongs that could happen to me, or what if I accidentally touch their backside or chest? One time while hanging out with a female friend of 5 years I accidentally grazed her breast while walking out of the room and nearly had a panic attack because I thought I’d be falsely accused of something or that people would think differently of me.

179,"Idk if this is the correct subreddit, sorry.

I'm a teenage girl and I've realized that I wear the exact same clothes way too often. I have about 10 identical pairs of black pants and about 15 of the same shirt in different colors. I rarely wear anything else. 

I'm hoping for some suggestions of how to make my wardrobe less boring and more typical for a teenage girl (like suggested brands, suggested items of clothing I should own, general tips, accessories, etc). I have very limited knowledge on this. I don't want to be over the top, just normal, casual, and simple. Suggestions for athletic outfits would also be great. 

I do have some limitations due to my school dress code and family. No belly shirts, no ripped clothes, straps have to be 3 fingers wide. My family would definitely frown upon anything overly revealing. I also kinda dislike wearing skirts and dresses. 

Anyways, any help would really be appreciated!",01Jun2020,2

182,"Reposted here b/c it was deemed inappropriate for r/personalfinance. I’m not very experienced with Reddit so I’m still working some things out lol. But here’s my situation. 

I have been working since I was 16, when my dad opened up an account for me. Because I was a minor, it was opened as a joint account. The only thing is I turned 18 a few months ago and despite promises to remove his access from my account, my dad has not done so. He owes me at least $1K and has not given me any bit of it back despite having many opportunities to do so. This money is often used for nonessential/recreational purposes. When I try to talk to my mom about it, she accuses me of being ungrateful and tells me to drop it since they spent much more money raising me. I do appreciate all they’ve done and continue to do, but I fear that one day I’ll wake up to a drained account and won’t be able to do anything about it since it’s a joint account out of my control. 

I am starting college in the fall and desperately want to be able to save money for my future. My household environment is often toxic and financial freedom is my escape. Additionally, I want some privacy with my transactions which are free for my dad to view. At this point I don’t even care about him returning the money, I just want an independent account. But going somewhere else and opening up a new one by myself will cause lots of drama and accusations that may very likely lead to me being disowned, jeopardizing my future plans (most namely college).

I live in CT and I’m with the American Eagle Financial Credit Union if that’s relevant. If there are any ideas on how to minimize drama, that is appreciated but I understand that may not be possible. Thanks for any help/advice in advance.",01Jun2020,3

I had read that walking a different on pavement can make arthritis worse, but its difficult not to walk on the pavement around our hosue, and I figured walking on pavement is better then not taking him in walks at all. Lately hes been limping around the house. My mom took him to the vet, and the vet said hes got some severe arthritis in left paw. It will require daily medication.

We've been online close online friends for over a year, we used ro play every day, hang out, text etc. He was closer to me more than my friends in real life. It was a platonic relationship. His friends said he liked him a lot but I never thought of it and kept everything platonic.
This week, he randomly said he wanted to distance himself from me for no reason. We didn't fight or anything. Nothing happened. But he has been off recently and he stopped talking to me. I don't know why. I asked and he said he doesn't know.

I don't know how to deal with it becauze we were close. I try do focus on my hobbies and video games to distract myself but it feels like it's not helping and I feel so hurt. I don't want to feel hurt, I want to forget he ever existed but I just can't. I hate losing friends for no reason.

Im never doing chemistry and physics again after literally a week, so I haven't studied at all for them in favour of studying for other subjects I plan on pursuing (maths, legal, English, biology etc).

188,"I don't know whether its a big deal or not but I should explain a couple things about myself as to why I am in panic mode.

If I'm busy with work, study, games or listening music I can lost track of time and I'm curious but after years of mostly mental abuse mostly suppressed that side of me and I'm terrified of false accusation because when I was young teachers beat me multiple times whether I was innocent or not which is why interacting with authoritative figures like boss, cops, doctors or elderly I tense up with weird fear and guilt. I don't like going to hostipal because I respect their job and feel like I'm wasting their time, If it isn't serious I can heal by myself. Now I was diagnosed with paranoia and depression, I don't like people coming near me or my stuff, clothes, phone etc not even ps3 saves actually even my home. Because I don't trust anyone and sometimes I keep worrying for literally no reason.

Now the reason why I'm in panic, because I was looking at porn from a well known site and done google reverse image search and it showed a couple russian sites that has nothing to do with what I was looking, it was nothing sexual but it was too weird and I was dumb enough to thought if it shouldn't exist, it can't be exist and followed the rabbit hole. Site was basically 4chan and I think threads and contents weren't new and thankfully admins banned and deleted bunch of stuff so there was nothing overly disturbing but the way they talked about it, even shared collections 100s of links was disturbing to say the least and in the end I find few sites that shouldn't exist imo, lost few hours and feeling disgust. I wanted to report but I didn't know where to, then I got scared thinking if I do either people come near me or I get blame for something or people who are into this stuff somehow harm me (I know it's highly unlikely). After almost a day I decided if it was possible I prefer to not see this stuff. I couldn't reach 2 people I trust, I have no reason to trust recommended sites and while searching for help I learnt I should've ignore in the first place and not investigate. It's been 8 years since I felt fear and panic and 5 years since paranoia hit me this hard and my fcking depression keeps telling me ""I don't want to waste time with worry anymore. We had a good run, I'm bored let's end it."". I might try to find a lawyer and ask but I don't know what to do. Any legal advice or someway to suppress this feelings?

TL:DR - I found something, I wanted to report it but I couldn't and it seems I should've ignore it in the first place and don't know what to do. I'm scared.

189,"I'm an 18y/o male freshly graduated, and I've had issues with social anxiety/loneliness and the likes for a while, but not really sure what to do about it.

My issues were magnified about a year ago when my girlfriend of a year broke up with me bc she was leaving for college. I had gotten really attached and fallen deeply for her so it hurt, but I knew it was for the better at the time. As the time has passed, I've felt like I've only been becoming more alone. At the start of my senior year I sorta put up a wall between myself and others, and become more of a quiet kid, don't get me wrong I'm an introvert and love my time alone but this was unusual for myself. The entire year went by and as the time passed I felt my friend group almost dissipate to a handful of people, and I haven't been able to get a girlfriend/hookup since the break up.

I don't know how to start conversation with people, especially girls, as I'm the type of person that won't talk to anyone unless the other party initiates conversation. I've tried a handful of times to try to spark some sort of conversation to no avail, and it makes me question my self worth, and almost like I don't have a personality.

As for recently, I deleted my social media accounts (snap, insta, etc) to try and improve my mental health and it has for the most part, but the one thing I noticed was that not even the closest people to me have reached out to try and have a conversation or hang out. This really hurt me because I thought I could count on these few people to at least maybe reach out and just say ""What's up"".  I've never been a person that opens up about issues about this to other people, and at this point I've been in a rut for a year w/o bringing it to anyone's attention and I feel like I'm completely lost now.

195,"The last 4 days I've left my apartment to run errands. Upon my return, I park my car in my parking spot, and head to the elevator to go up to my floor. Each and every time I enter the lobby, the same man is there and just happens to be going up in the elevator with me. Now your first thought is coincidence. But I've been running errands at random times of the day and return at random times of the day as well. The kicker here is that this person has always said hello to me and then kind side stared at me with a half smile on his face as we ride the elevator. The kind of stare where you can tell they're looking at you but they're trying to hide it. This person always goes to my floor as well. Today was the 5th occurrence of this. I poked my head into the lobby, saw this guy and immediately left and went back to my car. I even drove around for a few extra mins before going back. Thankfully, when I returned he was gone, but now I'm starting to freak out about leaving my place again.

What that actual hell am I supposed to do here? I don't want to sound accusatory if I confront this person as I don't know how he will react. But I also don't want this to continue and have something happen. I'm even hesitant to use the word ""stalker"" but I don't know what else to call it.

198,"I am a naturally angry and emotional person. It really sucks. I’m bipolar and even with meds I often find myself getting extremely upset over small conflicts to the point of crying. Again, it sucks. Injustice just really grinds my gears and I have a very intense sense of “fairness” and right and wrong. So I get emotional when I try to debate people over topics that are important to me and I’ll often end up in tears which is awful because it just makes me look like I’m speaking with just my emotions and not my brain, which in turn causes people to dismiss me and think that they don’t need to take what I’m saying seriously because I’m just a hysterical child. I do my research and I believe that my opinion should be taken seriously but because I struggle to deliver the message in a mature way people dismiss me or say “that’s why no one agrees with _____, it’s because you’re so aggressive!”

It also makes it seem like I’m upset that people disagree with me, which I’m not, I just get emotional over the situation in general, if that makes sense. So basically my emotions and lack of patience are preventing me from educating and helping people in an effective way, they may even be doing harm.

Recently I watched some debate videos by an activist who literally always keeps his cool no matter how angry the other person gets and I thought wow, he’s actually speaking lovingly to these people. He’s listening to them and then replying. I want to be like that. But it’s hard. How can I argue my point patiently and lovingly?

199,"So we have a friend group that is composed  of four people including me. The people are Connie, Sarah, Tara and Me. We’ve been friends since we were babies. Sarah and Tara are siblings and live together. Connie and Sarah are gay. Sarah has not come out to anyone, but us. Connie came out last year to her homophobic parents. They lashed out completely at her. And they banned her from hanging out with any of her gay friends. So obviously Connie cannot hangout with Sarah or Tara anymore (somehow Connie’s parents found out Sarah was gay and incorrectly assumes that Tara is also gay). We have been working around this but we have realized we cannot anymore. Our graduation parties are scheduled in a few months (if corona doesn’t cancel these things completely). Mine is coming up first and my friends (Sarah and Tara) are coming up second. Our parents are all friends and want us to all be at each other’s parties. The only things that my parents and Sarah and Tara parents know is that Connie is gay.  They do not know that Sarah is gay. So the problem we are running into is that if Sarah and Tara attend my graduation party... there is a strong possibility that Connie’s parents will lash out and then force Sarah to come out. And it looks very suspicious if Sarah, Tara or Connie does not attend my graduation party. We have been thinking about what to do such as calling out sick for the party? Though we are lost for ideas.

202,"Tldr: My boyfriend ran out of cigarettes and has been going through withdrawals and been very aggravated, and I don't know what to do. He thought about quitting, and I want him to quit but I don't know if I should suggest that or what. What can I do?

So my bf and I (20F) have been together two months, and the past week or so has been super rocky. He ran out of cigarettes last Tuesday, and is going through withdrawals. He has run out of cigarettes once in our relationship, and he only went a couple days without them before he was able to get more. He is 20, so as he isn't able to get his own, his roommate bought him some. The few days he went without them were hard for both of us because he felt like shit and was aggravated at everything, and in return I felt like I annoyed him. I constantly feel as though I annoy people anyway, that's just how my brain works; I always think people only are friends with me to be nice, I'm always paranoid about annoying people close to me, so him being irritated by everything made me feel like shit.

Last time around wasn't super great, but this time has been worse because he still hasn't gotten cigarettes. Wednesday morning, I had to leave for work, and he was bugging me to stay so I could give him a BJ. Since I had to leave, I said no, but he kept pressuring me and fake-pouting that I wasn't going to. Normally he's really good about when I say no to something, and that made me feel horrible that he kept pressuring me. That night when I came back over, we were watching a movie and it was so tense, he didn't even cuddle me or anything. He apologized for pressuring me and said it wouldn't happen again, but I could tell he was just in an aggravated mood. He didn't sleep much, and when we were in bed I asked if there was anything I could get him. He laughed sarcastically and said really incredulously ""no there's not"", which probably shouldn't have made me feel bad but it did.

The next morning I left without waking him up and saying goodbye cuz he didn't get a lot of sleep since he was feeling so poorly, and I spent that night at my parent's. Yesterday I asked if he wanted to go for a walk, and he said yes, so we went to a trail. It was still a little tense, and I asked if he was feeling better. He said he was, and he was thinking about quitting cigarettes cuz even though it sucked the first couple of days, he felt a lot better now. I was so happy because I honestly hate the smell of cigarettes and what it does to your health and lungs, and I really hated how the past few days had been. I told him the part about hating the past few days, and he said he knew and he was sorry. That morning was really good, he held my hand for the first time in a few days, and he kissed me goodbye.

We were planning on hanging out that night, so I texted when I was off of work and we went to get dinner. I could tell immediately something was off; he didn't hold my hand or kiss me, and he seemed very tense. In the drivethrough, he said he really wasn't in the mood to hang out tonight, so after we grabbed dinner he was going to drop me back at my place. I was hurt, but I understand that he's feeling like crap, so I said it was fine. He was talking about how his roommate still owes him a pack of cigarettes cuz he already paid him for it, and I suggested he just ask for his money back. He said he'd rather have the cigarettes, and I said I thought he was going to quit. He said he was thinking about it, but even if he did quit right now it wouldn't be cold turkey because he hated how he was feeling. I really wanted to say that if he quit, he wouldn't have to feel like that again once he got past the first bad stage, but I didn't want to aggravate him. So he just took me home. He said thanks for understanding when he dropped me off.

I guess I kind of needed to rant, and also ask for advice. I'm really upset about this whole thing. He's always so good to me, and this is so new for him to be not wanting to hang out or not wanting to cuddle, anything like that. I don't know if he doesn't realize how upset this is making me. He doesn't have any anxiety or depression or anything, so he is genuinely confused when I talk about how little a thing can be to make me anxious or feel like I'm doing something wrong. So I don't know if he even realizes something is wrong. Should I talk to him about how I'm feeling? Should I try and get him to stop smoking? He's said a few times he wants to quit. What can I do to help him right now without annoying him? I just really miss cuddling and sleeping with him. He helps me a lot to calm down and relive some stress, and I've been so frazzled the past few days. What can I do?",01Jun2020,2

211,"For the past 2 years, I wished I would just die in my sleep. I hated living, due to many reasons that I don’t really want to explain again because I’ve posted them before and there’s a lot of stuff, most of which just points towards the fact that my life got really messed up from a medical condition a few years ago, BUT since 2020 started, even though it’s probably been the worst year, worldwide, in my lifetime, I’ve been the happiest I’ve been in a long time.

Just a couple of days ago, I watched the crew dragon launch into orbit, the first rocket launch on American soil in almost a decade. Im not American, I’m Canadian, but watching the falcon 9 rocket launch get those 2 astronauts to space really inspired me. I’m not new to loving space, I wanted to be an astronaut when I was a kid, as a lot of kids probably did, but I realized when I was still a kid that becoming an astronaut was more than likely unobtainable, so I gave up on it early and focused on other things. I’ve still loved outer space my whole life tho, I stargaze by myself regularly, I’m obsessed with anything to do with the universe, and I’ve always wanted to be able to explore space anyways. But, after i watched the launch, something changed. It seems to me that I now have a purpose for living, and I no longer want to kill myself at all.

Killing myself appears to not be an option anymore, because all I can think about, is my new goal, TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO NOT DIE ON PLANET EARTH. I’ve searched for a couple years for things that I’m passionate about, since I graduated high school, but I felt lost. I took a year of college last year,  but dropped out in may. I’ve tried and gotten good at 30+ hobbies, yet none of them give me the fulfillment that I want my adult life to have. I don’t want to have a job that makes me miserable for the rest of my life, so the frantic search for happiness in the future had to ensue. Even though I found nothing that got me inspired, it did give me a crap ton of random skills, that are probably useless but still, I’m proud of them. 

Since the launch, I’ve started teaching myself astronomy. I’ve always had a good knowledge of the topic anyways because I’ve always liked learning about space, but now I’m going for everything, all the math, all the science, all the important historical dates, EVERYTHING, literal rocket science. And I have been just soooo happy the past few days. I’ve always hated school, and learning, but damn, I really enjoy learning on my own, about a topic that I’m actually passionate about. 

My only problem is that I don’t know how I can turn this into my job. With commercial space travel becoming available in the near future, it’s looking like it’s going to be very possible for more than just high level government scientists to be able to go to space in the next few decades. I just have no idea what to do to be able to make a living with my goal in mind. I’d really like to work for SpaceX, but I don’t even know what I would do there. I’m only 20 years old, I have a lot of time still to get things working properly in my life, and to get to space, I’m definitely gunna need money to live until that point. 

Do I go to university/college for this? Do I give up on it again? Is there anything I can do from home given the circumstances involving the virus? What are the realistic steps I need to take in order to get me in a position to leave the atmosphere of planet earth.",01Jun2020,1
212,"A little backstory. A year or so ago I found out that my husband was spending an inappropriate amount of time with a woman at work, and people were starting to talk. ( he works at a small private school). I consider her a friend, so just started kind of keeping an eye out for myself. I did notice that they were very friendly with each other. I've always known his phone password as it was common for him to have me dial numbers or text for him if he was driving, that kind of thing. So I decided to see if he had been texting her. He had. Nothing overtly bad, but flirty. I confronted him about it, and he said there's nothing going on. They're just friends. WE are all friends. 

Fast forward to January of this year, and I learn that people are more than whispering about them, they are outright questioning the amount of time he spends in her office and have seen them coming out of otherwise empty rooms together. I say something to him again and he is defensive. Accuses me of trying to start trouble and spreading rumors about him. He did agree to not have anymore contact with her. (They aren't in the same department so no need for them to have any contact anyway) Then Covid hit. I drove past the school on my way to the store, and saw her car. I knew he was supposed to be there. So I used his code to get in the school and headed to her office. The door was locked, but I could see him in there. I beat on the door, and y'all should have seen his face. He let me in and I asked him to leave so I could talk to her. She promised me there was nothing going on, and she had even talked to the administrator about telling him to stop coming around, because her daughter had asked her if there was something going on with them (she is newly divorced). I confirmed with their boss that she did ask him to step in, but admitted that he did not because he didn't think it was a problem. My husband again said I was overreacting and that nobody was even at the school to see that they were alone together. 

Our youngest graduated this weekend and the town had a parade for all of the seniors. I went ahead to get a spot at the beginning of the route and he was supposed to meet me there. He called me right after our son had already gone by to see if he had missed it. When I told him he had missed it he said he would go to the end of the route and watch. So I drove over there and who was he standing with? Yep. But I'm overreacting because there were lots of people there. 
 
So if you've made it to the end of my story, please give me your opinion. Am I overreacting that my husband has promised to have no contact with a woman, but I keep finding them together. What else can I do?",01Jun2020,1

I weigh myself each month and have noticed I have lost 7lbs in one month, which compared to previous data for the year, is a lot.

218,"**TL;DR** The title

Recently my girlfriend and I had a discussion about the recent events regarding George Floyd and the BLM movement. We are both Asian and as many asians know, the current stance on the movement in the asian-american community is split. There's an undeniable undertone of racism when talking to first-gen parents as a second-gen Asian American like myself. 

My parents own a laundromat/drycleaners in one of the major cities affected by the riots. Before the riots, for the longest time, we've always had issues with customers that vandalize the store, break our windows, defecate on the floor, egg us, call us chinks, and rob us because we couldn't give them exactly what they wanted. Now these aren't like daily occurrences but still something we deal with at least weekly, some more frequent than others. I work part-time at the store and these are things I would deal with along with my parents. Once corona hit, everything became worse when we were told almost every day to go back to our country, being told we were the cause of Corona (We're not even Chinese btw). This further cemented my parent's prejudice views and have also made me resentful as well. When our store was looted last night for the atm, change machines, etc, our already unstable means of income were shattered in front of our eyes. 

Most of my in-person experiences with black folk have been so negative that when asked the questin by my girlfriend, ""Are you fully committed to supporting the movement and cause?"" I hesitated. I believe that what has happened, not just with Mr. Floyd, but throughout all of American history, unjust, inexcusable, and a sign of foundational corruption. The fight for equality in America has been something that is not progressing and what is happening is necessary in order for change to happen. I know that my personal experiences are not representative of the entire community. I know that we can't move forward with progression with racism towards other minorities without fixing the biggest problem at hand right now. I know that. I know, and believe that this movement is right, just, and necessary. However, when my girlfriend asked the question, I was ashamed at myself that I couldn't proudly say yes. I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable to say yes confidently, knowing I would be marching with the same people in my city that have constantly harrassed my family's business and livelihood.

Whether you share these political views or not, I need advice in general as to how I can overcome my past experiences and embrace what I believe is bigger than me and is the greater good. I truly want to support the cause, but it just doesn't feel that binary to me. I'd appreciate if the advice included tips that involve actionable steps, rather than ""just stop being racist"" or something along the lines of that.

 Sorry if this post offends anyone or evokes strong emotions, I really want to learn and be better.",01Jun2020,1

225,"So basically the title but theres a bit more to it. My mother sometimes brings home those premade cookie dough packets and my sister always makes cookies. I don't really like the way she makes them since they are always extremely undercooked. 

So today my sister burnt through 3 packets making, ""mega cookies"", (mixing all the dough in one ball and cooking it like that). She made more that night but they were really raw, so I decided that I want to use the last packet for myself and make it not raw. She flipped her shit and started getting extremely angry, yelling how I eat everything in the house and never leave anything. (By leaving nothing, she means eating a couple of the breadsticks when we order pizza saying that I stole them after she started eating them).

I obviously get a bit frustrated because she constantly does this, when shes the one who eats everything and brings it all to her room. I tell her that and its 11 PM so my mother tells us to keep it down, I go to her room to tell her okay and goodnight. My sister immediately just says, ""Yeah go and snitch to mom, drphilsfiance"". Shes never stopped saying this because once she broke my door and refused to fix it and the one time she horrified me with a frog (read one of my earlier posts on r/AmItheAsshole)

Then when I argue that I literally didnt say anything and my mother figured it out on her own because my sister started bragging about it, she just slams the door in my face and tells me to fuck off. So I'm pretty heated, anybody got any ideas on how to get revenge?",01Jun2020,1
226,"So this little post has two parts, and it's basically me just telling you about two things that I want to change and get some insight on and anything is appreciated! :D I'm (17m) if that helps

1. I don't think I have any friends, well, it's weird, I have people that for a long time I called friends, but as of late I've begun to realize that I'm actually only in contact with them because I've known them since I was in elementary school. Now I've reconsidered what I would count as a friend, it would be someone I could tell my secrets, I don't tell them anything in my life, but not because I don't trust them per say, but literally because I just don't know them.... It's so weird to type out, but honestly... I don't, I could count the amount of times I've met all of their parents combined or gone to their houses. Also there is no support system in place where I'd even want to go to them for advice nor do they come to me, and perhaps the biggest thing is, I'm just not excited to go meet them, in fact I'm exhausted when after I hang out with them or go on a ride with them. 

Now with this part of my ""operation change life""(title in progress) post is that I'd like to ask you fine people of Reddit, what should I do, should I just sort of phase them out or ghost them or something like that... They're not bad guys by any means, I just don't think that we where meant to be friends... but I've known them from elementary school so it's really weird to think about just stop talking to them, please any advice on this would be great, even a story or just anything :D go wild.

2. Now part two is a lot more on the lighter note, I'm thinking about quitting all social media and           
focus my efforts on other things for example, exercising, I was a competitive swimmer but got   
a back injury and after gaining a couple of pounds and getting depressed I quit, I know   
exercising would greatly improve my mental health and such, and it'd probably do a snowball   
effect where I'll do better in most aspects of my life. Second is I want to educate myself by   
reading more books, I've realized that.. well.. I'm just dumb... well okay maybe not dumb but I   
think uneducated might fit better, so I'd like to educate myself on pretty much anything that I   
can get my hands on :). 

Now just like the previous part, any insight on what it's like to quit social media to work on different aspects of your life would be greatly appreciated, you know it doesn't have to mean anything i'd just like to get any advice whether it's directly or indirectly through all of your stories or notes :D

229,"I’m a high school senior graduating probably around July due to corona lol. Up to now, I have come to terms with not being valedictorian. I got a B my second quarter this year. 

Our school is not that strict on the requirements. The old rule was to only have an A as a final while taking all the AP and honors courses. The new rule implemented after my freshman year was A’s every quarter for all 4 years. Because the change came after our first year, I believe the rule is now A’s every quarter for 3 years excluding freshmen year. I feel conflicted because two of my friends didn’t received the call last Friday for valedictorian presumedly because they got a B one quarter freshmen year. 

My one friend emailed guidance and they apologized saying they forgot the new rule change, so now they’re both valedictorians. I’m happy for them, but at the same time I’m upset because there are 7 valedictorians at this point and it’s my bad luck I got my only B senior year so even if I finished with an A final I don’t think it’ll count.

I know you don’t need valedictorian to be successful, but it’s hard to come to terms when I missed it by a sliver and the rules seem a bit unfair since B’s in freshmen year were excused. I wish there was only one valedictorian and one  salutatorian so I didn’t feel so down about myself.",01Jun2020,1
230,"Hello Reddit!
This is probably my first post on here.
Me(20,M) and my girlfriend(20,W) of almost 2 years just broke up yesterday. We had some issues but we always tried to go through them, always were honest to each other and could talk in a very very deep way i never experienced with anyone else. But the last few weeks it was just not the same  we were always fighting, and we only really enjoyed our relationship when we saw each other.
Well yesterday we said good morning to each other and as the day went on she didnt bother answering anymore. I was sleepy from the night before so i slept through the whole afternoon (very weird i know, but it gets important later). So because of that i didn't really text her at all either.
in the evening she was very sickened that i had not asked about her day or something at all, and she asked if i even care how it goes on with us.
for your information: she had a really bad day at first and had a very extreme fight with her dad, which (her words) partly may have been her fault because she was overreacting due to her upcoming period. i must say, i was trying to make myself not care, because the last few weeks she didn't have the same interest in me as usual and she stopped saying i love you (in other words we didn't say it at all anymore).
My girlfriend is a very honest person, so i kinda knew there was something devastating up to with her not saying i love you anymore.
Well it came as it had to and we started arguing (all in text) and she told me she didn't have the same feelings for me as in the start of our relationship, but that she didn't want to lose me at all costs. i told her i didnt have the feeling i could really open up to her about my deepest sorrows etc etc. that i said that hit her very badly, maybe because it was true and kind of proved her point.
she felt really bad seeing how ""bad"" she treated me in comparision to me treating her, which she never really noticed before and never at all was her intention to do so. imo it was too dramatic and i didn't want her to feel that way because i had a lovely time with her and i wouldn't want to change it at all costs.
well after a lot of tears we said we would meet up after dinner.
we met in a parking lot of a school, so kind of like neutral ground for the both of us.
We talked, and we cried a lot, and i felt as if she tried to find reasons to go on.
I don't know what was/is going on with me but i was so devastated by the fact that she had the feeling she didn't love me anymore, without me ever doing or not doing things, that i just kind of lost all direction what to say.
I felt it was time to rip off that band aid.
so we kind of tried to find solutions, without losing one another but it all felt as it was going down the drain.
We were both so heartbroken by seeing the other one be so hurt that it was basically just us crying for 2 hours. After some time we said it probably was best if we just leave it be and we parted ways.
i called my best friend because i needed somebody to drive along with me and not let me be with myself, as i really am heartbroken (as i thought i never would be). We drove for an hour and he said that he thought it was going to end a while ago (when i told him about our problems), but thought that we had it worked out, as he thought the problems were starting to go be solved through our hard work working on them. he tried to up me with the basic best friend bullshit talk that now we can go out again looking for girls etc etc. and i kinda liked the idea, i had missed it with some part of myself not being able to wander around. But the overwhelming majority of me hated myself for even thinking about that. i started imagining what i lost with her and what i lost with the relationship, and i could not comprehend what that would mean for me. My girlfriend always was very loving, very caring (the more the longer we went on), very sincere and very fun.
I had spent the majority of my time the last 2 years hanging out with her, going on vacation with her, hell even working on a farm together because of covid-19.
Well i drove home and tried to sleep, a laid in my bed awake for 4 hours just thinking and crying. I kind of had the feeling that this whole thing was a huge mistake, that we just threw away so much just because our emotions both went over the top in a short period of time.
i feel like i should have done more, fought more and held on to the relationship.
I couldn't sleep until 5 am and i had the feeling i needed to go see her right at the moment and clarify everything and my point of view and fight to keep her.
i texted her in the night that i really hope this is the right decision and that i'm sorry for making her feel bad because i said i could not open up to her.
she today said that she wanted to talk to me again and that she had the feeling we needed to talk about the whole relationship.
Now my look for advice:
Should i fight for my love and try to win her back?
Or should i let go of a failing relationship and move on?
On the one hand we really did have our problems, and sometimes her disinterest in stuff i did or just in me as a person was very hard for me. But on the other hand those were the most beautiful 2 years of my life, and we worked through many problems in those 2 years, and i never have ever felt such a connection and deep love from and to another person.
Now if she says that her feelings for me aren't there anymore or that she doesn't believe that they will ever return, then its a closed case, because i don't want her nor me to be in an one sided unhappy relationship.
But if she believes that the spark could return, i believe  that we can work things out and both be happy again.
Now we are meeting again today, to talk about everything.

235,"So I've (31f)  had a rough last few days physically. For over a week my back has been very sore... no positions are comfortable, it is especially bad with sitting which sucks because I'm require to sit at a desk to do my work. I was taking naproxen around the clock to manage it somewhat but it still didn't take the pain away. What I didn't know is that naproxen is really tough on stomachs and erodes the stomach lining leading to ulcers and stomach bleeding. I also take an SSRI which I've come to learn worsens the effects of napr9xen on the stomach. So my stomach was more acidic most of last week leading up to some severe pain Thursday night affecting my ability to sleep. Friday during the day, I spoke with my doctor who just told me to stop taking naproxen and to take proton pump inhibitors daily. Friday night was again severe pain - by that point I had taken all sorts of ant acids with no luck. Took a high dose of cannabis to  sleep... but still ended up waking up in severe pain... whinsing in pain, nausea etc. My husband was pretty worried and he brought me to the ER around 3am. They did blood work - which was fine. Plapated my stomach to rule out appendicitis and waht not. They had given me an ant acid as well. Prescribed another stomach med and sent me home. Saturday night a bit better but my stomach is still hurting and I can't eat anything... surviving on banannas bread and crackers. 

Anyways - my back still kills and I need to get xrays on it and my stomach is still hurting and I'm lethargic.

Normally, if my any of my other ex-bfs said they missed me I wouldn’t really care but with this ex of 3 years, it gave me hope that he actually missed me as his gf and that there was hope even if just a little, until he said it was all a game. He explained that he, along with his sister and her friends, were playing a card game in which he had to give up his phone so they could text a contact he had. Surprise, surprise, they chose me. I told him it was crappy especially because it was me and I obviously still love him a lot. He apologized and said they were annoying for doing that but I didn’t know what else to say.

238,"\*I just needed to vent/rant about my mom's behavior and see if anyone has a mom similar to mine.\*

I'm 20F (about to be 21 in 3 weeks). I love my mom, but I hate her as a person. She is very narcissistic and believes everything is about her. Her behavior has ruined both my childhood and adult life. Everything I did as a child was a reflection of who my mom wanted me to be. She's always to be in control some kind of way even if she's uninvolved. If she doesn't get her way, she explodes. I went to prom twice in high school. The first time I got ready at home, and she drove and picked me. The second time, I wanted to get ready with my prom group and ride with them and she was UPSET. She didn't talk to me for a whole week. She didn't even ask to see my prom pictures. She still, to this day, has never asked to see those pictures.

My mom rarely goes out. She doesn't drink, smoke, and dresses ""overly modest."" She thinks that anyone who goes out to clubs and parties has no morals values. Anyone who dresses in anything ""too revealing"" looks slutty and unclassy. I wasn't allowed to pick out clothes until I was in high school, and even then my outfits had to be approved. She's gotten upset about some of my normal outfits recently and demanded I not wear them when shes around. I've been forced to change my clothes because she didn't like what I was wearing. My mom thinks she is this perfect person who lives this perfect life. She has no life. She has friends, but she's terrible towards them. She refused to be apart of a family friend's wedding because she didn't want to comply with the bride's dress code. The bride tried to compromise and my mom told her she was over it and didn't want to attend.

When upset, she goes on and on about the things she has done for us. The problem is she mostly brags about the things she's supposed to do as a parent. I'm glad she can provide the basic living necessities but where's everything else a child needs when growing up? Support also includes being there for a child mentally, physically, and emotionally. She was never there for me in that way. I can't remember the last time shes told me she was proud of me. She never tried getting to know me, instead, she tried to shape me into someone else. I have to live a double life when I'm home vs being at school. I now have a hard time expressing myself, because of this. I was never able to discover who I was as a child. I still haven't been able to figure out my style, how to say no, or even have the confidence to be myself.

I obtained my first job at 19 when I got tired of having to ask them for money. They never emphasized me working, preferred I focused on school. I don't have any real bills to pay, but I've been trying to build a savings account. I was never taught the importance of having savings.

With COVID-19 happening my dad is no longer able to support us financially, so my mom now has to take over and pay all bills. My last day of employment was about 3 weeks ago due to shutdowns so I haven't been able to work. Before the shutdowns, I worked for my own money. Aside from Christmas, she hasn't purchased any of my clothes, shoes, personal hobbies, etc in 2 years. Any time I reasonably spend money on something I want/need, she finds a reason to complain about me spending MY money. She makes comments about how I need to start saving my money daily. Even if I'm not spending money.

I do live in a dorm which means that I have to move back home every summer for 3 months. I've been home for the past 6 weeks due to COVID-19 and I'm miserable. When work resumes in 5 weeks, she told me that I CANNOT go back to work. If I say no and go, she'll make life miserable. She'll call my dad and exaggerate the situation to get him to agree with her. He's easy to convince and, he will avoid disagreeing with her to avoid arguments.

She keeps going on about how it only takes one time to get sick. She made me apply for unemployment benefits, which also states that I MUST go back to work when work starts or find a new job. I'm too nervous to say no, but I'm also not okay with not being at work if nobody is helping to support me in the future.

Any advice or comments?",01Jun2020,2
239,"For context,

This situation takes place in the US

For a while I have been part of an online friends group of various people, I have never met any of them in person we are just close online buds. One of the people is a 16 yo girl, who I have recently found out is in a relationship with a 22 year old man.

To make matters worse, she met him on internet forums as a 12 year old girl and he was a 19 year old man. They kept into contact and he basically manipulated and groomed her for many years.

I want to try to help her out of this situation but I have no clue how. She is very deeply entrenched in this and doesn't understand why what's happening is wrong and thinks I am just trying to ruin her relationship

I confronted the guy in question and he makes excuses, saying he's not doing anything illegal because he has no ill intent and that he hasn't done anything sexual to her(which is true) and that he's waiting until she turns 17, which will then be the legal age of consent and make their relationship valid, according to him

Is there anything I can do?

I have many screenshots of the internet forums of them talking from years ago with evidence that can prove their identities as well as him literally admitting to me in DMs the nature of their relationship and that he knew she was under age

One screenshot even has him outright acknowledge they have a 5 year age gap

In addition to those screenshots, in terms of personal information I also know his full name and where he lives

I am really desperate and really at a loss as to what I can do here

Her parents don't care. I am just a friend. I've been told there's nothing I can do because he hasn't had sex with her or received sexual images from her, but surely that can't be the case, that seems like the ultimate pedophile loophole

The tricky part being that they are in two separate states and I don't know them personally. This is entirely an online matter. I know where the two of them live but I am personally myself in an entirely different state. 

I want to protect her from what is happening but I just don't know how


Again, her parents don't care and she's been so thoroughly manipulated that she would never report it herself

I desperately need help 

Any help is greatly appreciated",01Jun2020,2
240,"We both work and live together. And over the 3 months we’ve lived together I’ve grown resentful towards her for many reasons:

•She’s sooo nosy, she doesn’t know how to mind her own business

•She talks about home at work and work at home. And I’m really private about my home life but now everyone at work knows we live together. She keeps asking awkward questions when we work together, like “oh is my son home?” And I’m in work mode so it feels so invasively personal at work and everyone is hearing it. I cringe. And she talks about what’s going on at work on my way to the bathroom or outside. Like just stop.

•She can be extremely passive aggressive, I’ve known from work and at home. And irritates me

•She’s also hella fake and has a big mouth. Recently one of my coworkers told me that she talks about me behind my back AT WORK when I’m on my breaks.

•My boyfriend (who also works with us) is really uncomfortable being over and being intimate because she’s in the next room. They have a difficult work relationship, he doesn’t like her work ethic (she doesn’t give AF about anything) and she doesn’t like that he isn’t fast enough (fast food job)

There’s a lot more I can say but either way I’ve slowly been hating living here and being in her presence. I’m off on the weekends and my bf works so I go over to pick him up after his shift so we can head to my place. And she always asks for a ride, she’s been taking the bus to work. I sound like a total asshole just saying this but I was okay for the first few times but now it’s bothering me. I feel like my privacy is being invaded EVERYWHERE. I know it’s 4am and we’re all going to the same place but she’s been passively horrible and talks shit about me and my bf behind our backs. I go there to pick up my boyfriend not to be everyone’s taxi. She also says things like “can you give me a ride tonight I’ll pay you.” Straight up lies to my face, has done so four times and I haven’t received shit. I hate her but it would be tolerable if she chipped in financially. I don’t want her to think I’m doing her a favor. She is low key manipulative and always asks me in the worst moment to say no. It feels like I don’t have a genuine choice. 

Like maybe I should sympathize with her transportation situation but I need advice on how to approach her chipping in financially if not tell her to deal with that herself and stop relying on me. Idk I sound like a total asshole but she’s just not a nice person in many ways. Any advice would be appreciated.",01Jun2020,1
242,"I know this can be asked a lot but I really need some advice. I know its very uncommon for someone to be my age and not have ANY experience and trust me I'm already embarrassed about it.

I grew up struggling with mental health so I spent most of my teenage years dealing with that and completely immersing myself in school and then university. I don't think I'm super ugly, I think I'm decent looking and in university, I've had a few guys show interest but I was never attracted to them nor had any interest in them so I declined.  I've been on a few dates but sometimes it makes me a bit uncomfortable to be super close with a guy since I don't have any experience and I'm embarrassed to tell them.

I've been on bumble and chatted and met with two guys off of there, but sometimes I just straight up feel like a catfish cause I think I look prettier in some of the pictures of myself than what I look in real life (especially rn) and I'm also scared to meet up with people because of this as well. I feel like I could let them down or I don't know their true intentions. Especially since some guy in my university followed me home without me telling him he could and he tried to make a move on me and I flat out rejected him and it still makes me uncomfortable to this day, but that's beside the point.

Anyways, I've also steered clear of guys a bit while I was in university because again I was dealing with some mental illness stuff and trying to focus on school, but I also believe that if and when I do enter a relationship, the other person shouldn't have to deal with all of it so its best to work on myself. As time goes by I just get more embarrassed though, my one sister and her boyfriend joke about me being a lesbian (which I'm not and even if I was it shouldn't matter) and my other sister's boyfriend had made comments to me before about my relationship status and I went home and just cried.  I want a connection with someone and to meet someone but with my inexperience being a major turnoff or even a flag I'm scared to tell guys + meet with them in case they try and make a move and I'll have 0 clue what to do.  I rejoined bumble as I thought now would be a good time as you can't really meet and that way I can just chat with people but then some guy suggested we hang out and now I'm panicking.

My question is how can I get out there and get that experience? How do I tell guys? It seems to be a dealbreaker for quite a few guys and I'm just embarrassed and don't know what to do. Help please!!

243,"Tensions between my parents and I have exploded, partially due to being locked in close-quarters excessively and because I'm not a great a son. It was a very hurtful conversation. They are okay parents but have been an obstacle to my healthy development in life and my ability to integrate into society as an immigrant (parents: ""don't be western""). Ultimately, my life is in my own hands regardless of whether they or myself fucked it up. They are threatening to kick me out once Covid19 is over (so I guess I have a few months to prepare). To help me organize my next steps, I've decided to lay out major pros and cons.

Cons:

\- Live with parents

\- Can't drive \[this one is 100% on me, so stupid\]

\- Still a graduate student therefore make approximately \~$20000/year in a major Canadian city \[graduation time not forseeable\]

\- Single and therefore I am my own emotional &amp; physical rock (also see #1 &amp; #3 major detraction from attracting women)

\- Parents try to exert control over my life by dangling financial freebies (mostly rent) and have often attempted to pressure me into marrying people I don't know. The rug is in the processed of being pulled

Pros:

\- Can cook, clean and do laundry (thank you Google during my Summer Abroad Courses!)

\- Approximately 35K in savings \[15K in crypto assets (not liquid at all), 15K cash, 5K stocks &lt;with annual return of \~20% that I self-manage in my spare-time&gt;\]

\- On my way to a STEM PhD (parents have often discouraged me about this and blame it for the root cause of my wordly miseries - they try to make me feel bad about it knowing how much I love science)

\- somewhat Attractive but getting old\[!\]

After thinking hard, I've come up with the following action plan in the following order: learn to drive (tough to find an instructor given the situation), move out, then cut-off parental ties (they'll continue to try to control my life and put me down).

Thinking about all this is scary. Any advice reddit?",01Jun2020,1
244,"I live in Malaysia. I don't feel comfortable with my life and I think I figured that out a bit too late. Here are some of the reasons I feel like shit. 

- my grades are awful hence I probably won't get a scholarship hence I probably won't leave any of the relationships I wanna leave and will never be happy.

- I have never hated my body and physical presence more than now as I have put on way too much weight for someone my age. 

- I feel so lonely because everyone around me does not share my values or lifestyle so I'm here just being the weird odd one that everyone laughs at. 

- I can't think of one single reason as to why I should be alive right now. I do nothing, I'm the opposite of what my community wants, I am unaccomplished, and weak.

Lately I (21F) have been dealing with a lot of self-esteem issues ever since I started trying to gain weight in order to build muscle when I weight train. I was fairly skinny growing up and I still was in my first two years of college. I was happy to take selfies and take photos with my friends. I wanted to build up my physique more my third year of college so I ate more to build up my muscles, but I found out that ever since I started gaining weight I hated the way I looked in pictures.

247,"So for context I’m a 27 year old American who has never owned a firearm and never felt the need to own one. I’m apolitical. I try to stay out of politics but I’m somewhat scared by the protests and things going on across the nation. I hate to admit it but I’m a pretty timid guy. I mind my business and I keep to myself. I’ve never been in a fight and I avoid conflict. Some say the protests will die down but I’m not so sure. I just wanted a gun for home defense and self defense. I’m highly doubtfully I’d ever need to use it but I guess I just want to “be prepared” as some put it. It might just be paranoia on my part and all the things you see and hear in the media. 

My dad isn’t helping either. He’s become paranoid as well. He’s 63 and is talking about spending $3,000 on guns to protect his home because he believes a race war is coming or looters will start coming down residential streets. I think it’s insane to just go out and buy thousands of dollars worth of guns. He seems way more paranoid, and for the record I grew up in a gun free home. My dad doesn’t own a gun and never was interested in hunting or gun collecting, so that’s what scares me. He seemed serious tonight when I spoke with him. 

Some other strangers on the internet said I should have bought a gun awhile ago while others said there is nothing wrong with owning one for self defense but as I said I just really don’t think I need one. I don’t know what to do. I’d like to believe things will die down. Protests will end, but these protests seem worse than the ones we had years ago.",01Jun2020,1

I need a reliable car to get to work and back and didn’t have much time or options so I bought a 2002 Honda Accord. I knew it had a history for having some problems but the dealer told me the car comes with a lifetime auto repair discount at their auto shop. I asked about head gasket replacement and transmission replacement and both guys told me they would charge me $300 and $600 respectively because Honda’s are easy to fix and cheap parts.

256,"Last year I (28M) applied for a sales position at a funeral company/cemetery, which might not be the most exciting job in the US, but in my country is a respected position with great pay. Unfortunately, I was called for the two-week selection training, but did not pass it. A few weeks ago, they advertised this position again, and I decided to apply as I have been unemployed for a year and I liked the company and its work culture. Today they called me to announce that due to Covid-19 they will be bypassing the two-week training and I was to be directly hired. My country has been in lockdown for 79 days, but tomorrow restrictions will be partially lifted, even though the curve is still rising here, as the lockdown pushed a lot of families straight into poverty. The problem is, I live with my older sister (35F) who has asthma, and therefore is terrified of getting infected, as is the rest of my family who told me in an extremely stern way that I should not leave home if not strictly necessary.

I discussed the issue with my sister shortly after hanging up, and she said that she was OK with it but that I should self-isolate in my room whenever in the house, which I agreed to. However, when I let my mother know, she told me that I should first see what the work conditions will be and to which extent we will be required to be out (we're scheduled to receive that info tomorrow, but were told in advance that some key processes were made virtual), and that I should be positive and give it my best, but immediately after called my sister, she thought I wouldn't hear them and basically told her that she will talk to my father, who still supports me finantially, to ask him to stop me from proceeding any further with the job. My father is a doctor and is also worried about my sister's condition.

I understand where they are coming from, therefore I would like to propose that I temporarily move out until the pandemic subsides, as I know they won't agree to me permanently moving out of the house, even if it's just me, my older sister and her husband, and my parents (divorced) each live in a different city but my family, as much as it is loving and supportive, is also very overprotective and overbearing, so I know right away they won't agree. I don't want to write a wall of text, so feel free to check my post history for more details, but I truly wish to break free from that cycle and become my own person, therefore I have been very frustrated to be unemployed, and even more so with this pandemic as I thought I would have to continue depending on my parents for who knows how much time more.

I don't know what to do. This is a good position at a great company, and I specifically wrote in my cover letter that I wished to be given a second chance to do things better. I don't want to stain my professional image by turning down an offer I asked for in that way. But at the same time, I don't want to spread Covid in my family, and I don't want to be constantly fighting with my parents. My sister says she doesn't wish to be involved, but she feels she just cannot say as much to my mom.

**TLDR.- Got offered a good job that I was previosly rejected for, but live with asthmatic sister. I'm afraid my family will not let me move out temporarily**

258,"TL:DR Went on a booty call, we got into a heated argument now they want to charge me with attempted rape and murder.

Ok this is gonna be a long and messy one.

So I' had sex with this girl a few times. It was pretty messy and we would always end up arguing or something. I even went there once and end up leaving before anything happened cause we just started arguing. So it came to a point that we wouldn't even talk anymore,we even kinda hated each other.

But one drunken night I don't know what happened but we ended up having sex. Great sex. I still it was a messy situation and didn't want to keep fucking for too long cause we actually don't get along at all.

Came to the other day where the FU really happened. I was really drunk and tried to booty call her but she didn't pick up so I just went to bed and went on youtube. She texted me later but I told her I didn't want to anymore.

At some point someone start calling me in my room (I should add I live in an open house kinda thing -trying to be vague here). And it was her. Telling me to go with her. I said no a couple of times but ended up going... One last fuck can't hurt, right?

FUCKING WRONG! We got there and we started arguing like crazy.

I'm not really sure how it started, I think we were laying down and I went to grab a tit and she went FERAL! Like don't touch me and shit, full on. Here it all becomes a bit blurry. She started saying everything she could to hurt me, bringing shit that I had told her before and all. She was going in with all the ammo she could get. All this while shouting loud as fuck, she was telling me to leave her place, and when I tried to leave she would stop me and bring me back to her room....3 times! (I really don't know why I kept going back in, maybe I thought she wanted to fix things...but not at all). At some point I had enough and I started talking back to her, till she tells me to leave again. I do and she starts fucking hitting me in the head. I was trying to leave and she kept hitting me, until I snapped and grabbed her by the neck... strong enough. Then she kinda stops and a girl that lives with her comes and tell me to leave. I said thank you to her and left.

On the next 2 days she messaged me telling me I tried to kill her and that I wouldn't stop touching her. I don't pay much attention. But a couple of days go by and she starts telling everyone in the small town that I tried to kill her and rape her and went to the police to file a report about it.

Now there's posts about me in all the town social media that I'm a killer/raper and to watch out.

I know I reacted like shit and that I should've just left the first moment or not even have gone there.... but fuck me! I'm the towns villain for what's left of the quarantine (apparently 2 more months) and I can't even leave if I wanted to.

I know it's a fucked up story and I don't feel proud at all about what happened but fuck she definitely took it to the next level...

263,"My friend, 19, and his sister, 21, recently inherited a house from their uncle who passed away a couple years ago. They haven’t exactly had the best life as their mom died around the time my friend was born and their dad ended up becoming a drug addict. Their dad’s problem ultimately resulted in him losing custody over them so they had to go live with their other aunt and uncle. Their dad was still in their lives from time to time but didn’t really help support them financially. Their dad’s life is by far way worse than their’s, last I heard from them was that he was living in his car. He also isn’t the smartest nor careful person. Every time I bring up their dad and the things he does my friend always says the same thing every time, “My dad doesn’t give a fuck”. One time, his dad was working and of course wasn’t wearing protective gear and accidentally cut hit pinky with a circular saw to the point where “it was almost dangling off” (their exact words, not mine). He decided not go to the hospital because it would cost too much, so he had the people he was working with spray his finger with a hose and then he wrapped his finger up in duct tape. I don’t know what changed his mind (probably worker’s comp) but he eventually went to the hospital and had rods inserted in his finger; however, the damage was already done. His pinky never healed back properly and he is now unable to bend it. Like my friend said, their dad does not give a fuck. Their aunt and uncle are pretty much completely out of the picture now that my friend is an adult and don’t help him with anything anymore. Essentially he has no guidance in life and, just like his father, isn’t the most careful person which is why my parents and I try to help him as much we can by giving him advice and guidance. Anyways, back to the present, my friend informed his dad that he inherited the house so his dad decided to try and “help them out” by fixing up the house for them. What I mean by “help them out” is that he still doesn’t give a fuck about anything while fixing the house. He just does whatever he wants to the house without properly knowing or learning how to do it. Also, let me just state for the record that only my friend and his sister inherited the house, their dad did not inherit the house along with them. The house was originally built sometime in the 50s-70s and had popcorn ceilings and walls. Generally speaking, any house built before the 80s that still has popcorn walls and/or ceilings most likely has asbestos still in the walls/ceilings. For those that don’t know what asbestos is, it’s a mineral that is also a carcinogen that can lead to cancer or asbestosis if exposed to for an extended length of time. It’s a very serious health hazard, just look it up if you don’t believe me. My friend’s said that his dad had no knowledge of the asbestos at the time (that or he just didn’t give a fuck) and went ahead and scraped all of the popcorn off the walls and ceilings without any protective gear or getting the house tested and on top of that did with his son in the house. At the time I didn’t know about asbestos and visited the house after the scrapping was all done and noticed that every time I stepped on the carpet a cloud of dust would appear. I brought this up with my dad who has worked on construction sites for almost 30 years and he immediately started asking me if the house has asbestos or had been tested for it in the past. I immediately called my friend and told him that the house could be unsafe, to collect a sample of the popcorn stuff so it could be tested, and that he should probably spend time at his girlfriend’s house until the problem is resolved. Usually he would take any concern that my parents and I have seriously. Instead, he and his sister both ignored almost all of our concerns and continued living in the house. I also told him that he should stop his dad from doing any further work the house, but he told me that his dad does whatever he wants to do. His dad was pulling out all of the carpeting at the time and I told him that if his dad brings that stuff to the dump and the people at the dump finds out about the asbestos that he could get into so much legal trouble. They still haven’t brought it to the dump yet and I don’t know if it was out of fear that they could get in trouble, but probably not. The only thing my friend did do that I suggested was collect the sample of the popcorn stuff (thank god). Over the past month he has had multiple friends over that have been told the house could have asbestos in it and all of them don’t seem to care just like him. These friends that he has aren’t ignorant and careless like him though (and I mean that in the nicest way possible). Even I’m friends with them, so it came as a shock to me that they still chose to spend extended periods of time in the house regardless of it’s supposed condition. My friend said that the reason he chose to not take this problem seriously was because my parents and I are the only ones in his life that are concerned about it. Everyone else doesn’t see it as an important issue. We ended up buying a test kit for my friend, since he refused to buy one, and gave it to him. He said he will get the results on June 5th and by then it will have been over a month since the walls and ceilings were scraped. I don’t even know if the sample he sent is even testable though because he collected it a couple of days after his dad finished scraping everything so the carcinogenic fibers could have already been fully released into the air and on the ground making the sample useless. Even if the test comes back positive my friend said that he won’t try to get an asbestos removal service to come out and fix the place because it would cost too much. He told me that he talked to his aunt, who’s a house realtor, and she said that the test kit was a waste of money because she knows without a doubt that the house has asbestos in it. Even after his aunt told him that he still doesn’t care. I don’t mean to take control of my friends life and his actions and while he has a point that there isn’t much he can do at this point since him and his sister don’t have any money there is no excuse for not taking the situation seriously. I tried telling him how worried I am for him and his health and tried giving him as many suggestions as I could: “stay at your uncle and aunt’s house”, “take control of your dad and his actions towards the house; you own the house not him”, “move back into the empty dorm at your college”, “take out a loan to pay for the asbestos removal service”, etc. However, every suggestion I give he gives an excuse as to why it won’t work and that he and his sister are set on not doing anything about it. I don’t know what to do at this point, it’s possible that the house doesn’t have asbestos in it, but even if the test comes back negative I don’t think I’ll be able to trust it considering the quality of the sample used for the test. This guy is my best friend, we have known each other for several years and we both have the same interests, comedic taste, share opinions on a lot of things, and game with each other almost every day. Hell, we even get people that say we kinda look alike and ask if we are related. I know this sounds corny as fuck but while we aren’t related, to me this guy is my brother. I don’t want this whole thing to possibly ruin his life or ruin our friendship but I hate seeing him living in an environment that is slowly killing him and not caring about it.

264,"For context, I’m only 14 years old. Every since started to “mature” in my behavior and academics, my parents have been acting a bit differently towards me.Honestly, I’m not even sure if I can describe them as “toxic”. I may just be being over dramatic. My parents are very loving for the most part, and have been for my whole life. Recently, though, I’ve been seeing them in a new light. My parents, to me at least, really don’t seem to have the happiest marriage. My dad has been getting more and more irritable to everyone in the house, and is constantly victimizing himself. He calls himself “the maid” and “our personal slave” because he claims to be constant cleaning up after us. Granted, he does clean a lot, but it’s because he doesn’t work, my mom does. He stays home, but doesn’t cook for me or spend time with me, then cleans our kitchen and bitches about it to us whenever we’re around. He freely cussed around me to, and calls my mom and sister fat and dumb, and calls me stupid and bitchy a lot. I’ve gotten old enough where I have the balls to call him out on it, and stand up for myself. He always takes it as back talking. I find him manipulative, using his “old” age to make me do stuff for him becasue I’m young and so “energetic”. Today, though, he downright crossed a line with me. See, I still love him, and I just try to generally avoid him. I sat down while he was, once again, unnecessarily cleaning the kitchen, and tried to ask for advice. My hair is always super frizzy, and I was asking him if he had any suggestions to maybe help. I know, sort of a weird thing to ask your dad, but really, I meant it as more of a joke. I tell him everything I’ve tried so far that hasn’t worked, and he then launches into a lecture of all things about why I’m only seeing the negative things or something. Really, I didn’t get his point at all, and I’m pretty sure he was just lecturing to lecture. I ask him, if I’m so negative about my options that haven’t worked, does he have any actually helpful tips, which was kinda the point of this convo in the first place. He gets all defensive because he obviously doesn’t have any and doesn’t want to be wrong, and says just do nothing. I told him, yeah I tried doing nothing to my hair and it still got frizzy, so I couldn’t do nothing if I wanted the problem to go away. He just keeps repeating to do nothing, and I REALLY have no idea what he was talking about, and he just went on about that. I repeated that it wouldn’t achieve anything. He said that I always run away from my problems, which, WHAT? Where THE FUCK did that come from? When in the convo did I express something even remotely similar to that? Before I could say anything, he keeps talking, and says that, hell, I should just shave my head if it was bothering me that much! He said it complete seriously, not in a joking manner at all. What he said next is what made me just walk away. After the shaving comment, he then said “the only thing left to do after that is kill you self! Then you’d have no more problem to deal with at all! Wouldn’t you just love that!” He said it with a smirk. That is crossing the line. You don’t just say that to a child, your 14 YEAR OLD daughter no less. I almost cried right then and there. He has NEVER said something like that EVER. Obviously, nobody’s said anything like that to me becasue it’s sort of a horrible thing to say. He also doesn’t trust me with my phone, and he put restrictions on it so that I couldn’t access the AppStore, or even be on my phone PAST 6. I got around it easily, and he forgot to put them on my new phone after my old one stoped working. He doesn’t listen to me, spins everything to be something that it’s not, like the conversation about my HAIR FRIZZ, and insults me and my family members pretending like he’s some god and so much better than us. God, I’m sick of being around him when I can’t even have a normal conversation without leaving angry sad guilty or feeling bad about myself. My mom is way better than him, and is very loving and very caring. But she also said something to me the other day that actually did make me cry when I tried to casually leave and went to room. She if pretty laid back, but the one thing she cares about a lot when it comes to me and my sister is our grades. My sister got good grades until junior year of high school, where she slipped a little bit. I had to help her hide her report card from our parents because she was to scared to tell them that she got a C and asked me for help. She wasn’t being dramatic either. My mom grounded me because I got a B in math one year. That was the only instance, and I have had straight As ever since. But that’s only the expectation, so she never compliments or my hard work. She just assumed that it was easy for me. The other day, my school posted a video about the top students for each subject this quarter. I have no idea what this award was, we never had anything like it before quarantine, so I was a little confused but didn’t care that much. I got an award in math only, because math is my best subject, and even though I have straight As, I definitely worked harder in that class because it was my favorite. I was happy with myself, but my mom wasn’t. She was angry with me because I didn’t make it into the other subject. She said that I could’ve “at least gotten into reading”. She compared me to my friends, saying “your friends got into all of the other subjects, why couldn’t you? What’s wrong with you”. Direct quote. My sister was there with me, and was incredulous at my mom as well, and was getting angry at her because of what she was saying to me. And she was right to because what my mom was saying was actually really harsh and it actually stung a little bit. I try really hard to meet my parents expectation, to be as good as my sister, to be on par with my friends, and I thought I was doing a good job of it. I still DO thing I’m doing a good job, regardless of what my mom said. That doesn’t mean that it didn’t hurt when she didn’t think so. Again, like my dad, she has NEVER said something so scathing like this to me ever. She’s always super kind and loving and supportive. Even if she always has been more uptight and strict with my academics than anything else, she has never said something that was so blatantly degrading and insulting to me. And she didn’t even seem to notice that what she was saying was hurtful. My dad didn’t notice either, even though I thought him both cases it was pretty obvious that what was coming out of there mouths were pretty charged. Are these red flags that I should be paying attention to? Maybe they’re just super stressed because of what’s happening in the world? Even though I would say both of the underlying reasons they said what they did have been going on for a while. Like my dad insulting ya and victimizing himself, or my moms fixation on grade cards.

273,"Hello.

I've been friends with this woman for almost a year. It's mainly a long distance online friendship that we keep to Skype.

There's never been any kind of flirting between us whatsoever, but something strange happened last night...

We were in a Skype chat, and as things went along, she started playing some of her favorite songs and began to dance provocatively on the camera. This included revealing her underwear underneath her skirt numerous times, suggestive hand signs, and the way she would stare into the camera at me.

I, not having very much experience with girls, wasn't sure how exactly to take it. I don't know if she was just being silly, or really getting into the rhythm of the music, or if she was deliberately trying to convey attraction.

She's quirky and sensitive, so for most of the duration of this, I tried to not read too much into it and rationalize ""Oh, she's just being playful. She doesn't mean anything by this. Etc."". I felt really awkward but didn't say anything. This was compounded by the fact she has a boyfriend, so my mind really wasn't trying to *go there(* in thinking she was doing what I suspected she might have been doing.

My dilemma is this - 

1) I don't know how to confront her about it and figure out what's up. 

2) She's cute, but I don't want to get involved with someone who is in a relationship. That's not who I am.

3) I also don't want my worst fear of being proven right (that it's all on my head) be confirmed and lose a friend over it.

Please help.....How can I bring this up and ask her about it in a ""Hey, about the other night...what were you trying to do?"" kinda way?

Do you think she was trying to rile me up?",01Jun2020,1

For the last 3 weeks I've been using the ""it's pandemic so i can't get the necessary certifications to get a job"" as an excuse to not applying to anything. Well, it's true but then again, i just don't know which path i wanna go through.

There's a couple options :

1. Get a specialization through another 5-6 years of school again while living off my parents' money or
2. Get a job and go through with it, build a career and all, see what will happen in the future while definitely let go of that specialization school because i won't be able to afford it in the future.

Pretty obvious right answer, isn't it? Go back to school and get specialized and in the end i'll be able to build my career properly from there. The thing is, I don't like both options. I've been depressed and anxious for the past few years because of this. I don't really like the career path and going back to school is just another 6 years of lonely fight.

She’s been to protests before but only peaceful ones and i really think this one is going to get violent and turn into a riot and she doesn’t she doesn’t even seem to care about her health or covid-19 and we argued about it a coup hours ago and her mind is set on the fact that she’s going to the protest even though she might get badly injured if it turns bad. Also her parents aren’t healthy and if they get covid-19, i’d give them a 50/50 chance at surviving. She knows this too and completely doesn’t care and says that is her responsibility if she gets them or herself sick and that it’s not my job to worry about them. I’m all for peaceful protests but it seems like most of them aren’t ending peacefully. I love her more than anything and I don’t wanna see her get hurt and she keeps saying that since i’m not outside in protests or posting about it on my instagram story, I need to “check my privilege” because i’m white and come from an upper class family even though we do tons of stuff for the community.

ive been seriously drawing since i was 7 or 8. it's been my main hobby for as long as i remember but for the past few years its started to feel like a chore. i cant draw or even think of drawing without trying to gauge how much social media attention it would get. i started doing this when my style was still developing and because of this i still haven't developed an art style. not like i only draw realism or anime, ive gotten past that baby artist phase but every single thing ive drawn for the past years has been in a different style, now that im at the point in my life where i should have one. i wish i was kidding. people go through my sketchbooks and digital art and assume i share the books or accounts with other artists. it would be nice if i was going for a tawog vibe, but all it does is make art frustrating. 

all i think about when i draw is my style so i end up changing it with every thing i draw. today alone ive made 3 completely different styled drawings and i didn't really like drawing any of them. im constantly thinking about what styles people like, what styles are going to get me recognized and none of my art comes out feeling like what i want to draw because i dont know what i want to draw. i dont know what style i want to have. i dont have any ocs or any universes, ive just been kinda aimlessly drawing for so long and its made me wonder if i even like art at all.

Everyone's going through something, right? Everyone's got baggage? And we're all going through something rough right now. 

But is that the same thing as this deep heartache that's constantly there? Everyone's carrying something, sure, but does everyone have those deep heartaches (not like romantic heartbreak, just intense emotional pain)that eat at them over years and years or is it usually something closer to juggling surface level stress &amp; worries? This is what I genuinely don't know and I'm afraid to ask anyone I know in real life. 

I've had a relatively good life but some stuff has happened that has affected me over the years and now because of this whole situation I've had so much time to think and it's bringing up a lot of stuff. Mostly I've realized that I've been burying pain deep inside, the kind that causes a constant ache in your heart that's always there, even if it's quieter sometimes. I haven't been through anything traumatic but I guess there've been lots of experiences and negative emotions that've built up over the past decade or so. It's not really anything fixable. And normally it's not the end of the world when I have things to keep me busy and make me happy. But right now there's none of those distractions so it's especially rough.

This is where the question comes in. Because I've been debating with myself lately if I'm okay or not. Part of me thinks I'm overreacting, I'm fine, everyone goes through shit. I don't want to make a big deal out of nothing. Especially because I'm sure a lot of people are struggling right now.

I'm actively trying to reevaluate myself and really figure out how I went against my own morals so easily. It's incredibly hard, but I need to. For myself and for future people I meet. 

When it was brought to our attention, I expressed my regret to the person I hurt in the past, and my friends immediately withdrew and I was met with silence. I gave them a few days, then tried to give an apology to one of them for disappointing and hurting them. They expressed they didn't want to hear it, and that I wasn't taking this seriously. I've tried to accept their words and take a step back in order to truly understand their point of view instead of get angry or let the hurt control me. 

Though a couple days later- today, I was asked to delete our two year old group chat. I did. I knew whatever memories inside weren't more important than their feelings or personal reasons. Almost immediately, various group members began dming me and another friend from said group who was essentially in the same mistake maker boat as me- yelling at us and calling us awful friends. Expressing their micro aggressions with us over the years. It was very hard to swallow when these people had become found family to me. It felt like I never knew them. 

In the end, I don't believe it matters much that the group made the similar mistake I or my friend did. We all hyped each other up and egged each other on- we had a very bad case of mob mentality. But now I'm at a loss. 

The only people I have now are my boyfriend (who is still in contact with the group) and the friend who was also banished from the group with me. I haven't been this alone in many many years. I have a lot of emotions towards the group and especially towards myself, but I feel like I need an outsiders perspective. I don't know what comes next and it's scary.",01Jun2020,1
297,"What is it like to have a close friendship? I'm not able to connect with people, and I can't keep conversations or be articulate. I have this fear I'd be or say something cringy. Help!",01Jun2020,1
298,"How can I act like I like her? I have to because we gonna be together in the same class for 6 years, and we have same group of friends. 

List of things that made her toxic in my book: 

1. We are asians, so she always make a subtle competition on who can eat less, because apparently 'eating less = being more skinny = more attractive'. She saw me losing weight due to quarantine (I don't eat much during quarantine), and she started to eat less while eyeing how much I ate (Maybe I was overthinking, I hope I was overthinking it). This greatly triggered my previous experience with eating disorders and I just got into a much better happier relationship with food 
2. She keeps insisting on both her and my styles. I recently changed my fashion style because I felt like it and I have been enjoying the effortless look. For some reason, she starts insisting on both of our styles. She keeps going on about how black is her colour and she looks amazing in it, while I would look really good in mustard yellow AND dusty green, and she keeps insisting that I try on and buy mustard yellow clothing whenever we go shopping together. Mind you, I am wearing mostly black on that day and been getting compliments on my recent change of style, so I don't think that I am being biased when I say I also look good in black, because frankly black is such an universal colour that everyone looks good in it. 
3. She starts doing what I'm doing sometimes. I loved wearing tank tops and started wearing it more because of I feel confident in wearing them now, so she started wearing tank tops as well. I started buying bralettes because I've always loved them and recently got back into them, so she wants to get bralettes as well. I dyed my hair black to go back to natural to fit my current style, originally she was going for a balayage curly look, but saw that I wanted to dye my hair black so she thought about dying her hair deep brown or black instead. 
4. We both joined the committee of the school club at the same time, and we both wanted the role of publication secretary which was planning out all designs, artwork for club promo and social media etc. She got it because she insisted that she wanted it. We thought of setting up two publication secretaries because all of that may be too much of a workload for a single person, but again she INSISTED that she wants to take charge in that by herself so she can decide all the aesthetics. Im quite chill because she did say that she wanted to do it first so I just ran for another post in the club instead. 

  A few months in now, whenever she pinched in ideas, the ideas were almost always rejected, not because they're not good, but because the president of the club already had some of the ideas and she's quite a stubborn person, also she's in charge, so my friend doesn't really have a say on matters. My friend thinks that her eye for aesthetics does not match the group's because she was 'raised in a different culture' and she considered herself quite whitewashed, as she watched American tv shows, listened to western pop and have a more americanized fashion style; whereas the rest of the group is quite local and are into East-Asian pop culture. I relate to her and understand her in that aspect, because we have a similar upbringing that's out of our control. 

  But then, she decided to quit because not only are her ideas always rejected, but she has a heavy workload, she's been feeling stressed about it. But we don't even have school anymore, we are having our holidays right now, all she does everyone is going out and drink with her friends. So she said she has to quit to work on her mental wellbeing. Like ok, that's fine, it's important to work on your mental health. But then the workload gets pushed down to us, especially me, suddenly I have to work on the layout and design of the schedule. 

TLDR: Friend makes everything a subtle competition, insisted on getting a role that we both want, then decided to quit after a few months because it's too stressful and her ideas get rejected a lot but the workload gets pushed to us now.",01Jun2020,1
299,"First off let me say that we’re not legally married but have been together since we were 18 and I’m 29 now, we also have a 3 year old daughter and 6 year old son. So where do I really even start?, we’ve fought since we’ve been in a relationship before kids, and lately the spark is gone and I feel as she has complete control of my life, I don’t get to go see old friends and she gets upset when the pop up around the house. She puts me down in front of her family members after I tell her like can we talk about stuff later. I get upset with her as well and will be rude , and at sometimes I’ve become violent. I realized my kids were starting to catch on a lot more to the serious arguments as they would start pleading for us to stop. And I pay all the bills and I’m the only one who works and during this hard economic time I just recently financed a new vehicle for her. She never helps me at all with money the little times she does work.. we’ve recently had a huge argument and she want me gone and I have a chance to move in with my father who lives 2 hours away.

301,"Recently my fathers mother died a week ago or so and he hasn’t seen too sad but I can feel he’s hurting over the death of his mother. I only met my grandmother twice (once at a young age, and once at 12) the time during when I was 12 was for 3 weeks. I never FaceTimed him or knew him all too well and don’t feel too sad or effected by his death which makes me think I’m some monster.

I want to be their for him since he learnt today, but I don’t really feel anything. It mostly comes from what he feels. I feel more angry and hurt about the injustice of BLM than I do which makes me feel horrible and all I want to do is support my father but it’s difficult.

I don’t usually struggle with being empathetic and helping people but I’ve never had someone important to a family member die, and the fact I wasn’t close to her makes it harder to connect and bond and heal with my father who’s grieving.",01Jun2020,1

303,"I'm currently living with my Mom.

Some context/background: 
My mom used to have a hair salon that she worked at for a few years. Though 2 year ago my mom had a lot of downs. Her salon had to be closed down so she didn't have a job for a few days. She later found a part-time job as a janitor and did that for a year. She later was able to move her salon into our house, so it became a side hustle. My mom uses both these things to help her pay bills so when unexpected bills appear it kinda throws her off and makes things a little difficult.

The Thing I need Advice on: 
A year ago my Mom took me to a pediatrician to get a check up. Around that time we had Medicare, so they payed for most of the check up. Every thing went well but after a few days it was my younger brothers appointment and we missed it by a few minutes. (So we later had to take him to a caravan.) Since we missed the check up my Mom had to pay a fee and she did. Soon after we weren't eligible for Medicare anymore (hence caravan check up for my brother). We can't afford to have any medical bills so all try are best to not do anything major that would prompt such. Now we're in Covid and as you know people are having trouble earning income for themselves or family. My Mom was fortunate to have a least her janitor job, but it's been reduced a lot, until now. (It's gotten better) Usually my Mom saves up near the end of the month so she can easily pay the bills we have. Which means no grocery shopping for that week or two. Recently my Mom received another bill, a year later from the Pediatrics place. She doesn't understand why they gave her this bill that goes to $230 dollars when it was for a simple. Check up for me. Is there something I'm not getting?

Seriously, I don't get it.

Also excuse any grammatical mistakes as this was written at 2 in the morning.",01Jun2020,1
304,She made a profile for me on a dating app and is checking it. I let her know that the profile does not represent me well and that i would like her to change it.

305,"I've been up to date since the Minneapolis Incident and I've been so devastated by the things going on in America. It's not even remotely related to my country yet, I cannot help but empathize and feel sorry about the people suffering there.

306,"A couple weeks ago, my neighbors were yelling profanities and blasting music at night, violating the noise ordinance where I live. I called the cops on them and they have stopped, but I've noticed that  named their wifi name ""filthy f\*\*king (my ethnicity)"".

I've already contacted the landlord about their multiple noise violations, but he never responded to me. Is there anything I can do?",01Jun2020,1
307,"I [19F] am overstressed constantly.
I really struggle with voicing my feelings and thoughts. I bottle up my feelings and so I end up being all alone with my negative thoughts. I have basically no confidence because I feel like I can't do anything alone and I'm worthless/useless. 
It's strange because I used to be a massive extrovert and was  basically never at home, at the time I thought it was because I was a social bug but now I'm starting to realise that I was quite violently absusing the use of alcohol from the ages 13-18. 

I moved to Australia only a few years ago after living in Europe with my mother and step family.
My mother committed suicide when I was 11 and so my sister and I were told to live with our father back in Australia. 
To me it was all very sudden and I wasn't even aware that I had a father in Australia. 
Fast forward to highschool and I was sent to a sister school of the primary school I was attending. 
This is where my first 'boyfriend' at the time forced me to have sex with him and I was already being tangled into the web of drugs. 
The school environment was so toxic - to the point where I was bullied every single day. I used to pretend that I was sick so I wouldn't have to be at school but my father and new step mother didn't believe me so I used to make myself vomit as they required pictures otherwise they  thought I was simply trying to ditch class. I would even wear 2 bras to school to make my boobs bigger because I was teased for having no titties (I am I was 11 and hadn't even hit puberty yet?). 
They even went to the point of on and old social media platform (Ask.Fm) where you can write anonymous questions to people they would say things like ""You need to follow your mum's footsteps"" and ""You are no doubt the reason why she did it"".   

After failing every class for 7 months and being continuously grounded due to failing (I was failing from hiding in the toilets in fear of my peers, being overly sexualized, cheated on) I told my parents I needed to move schools. 
When i moved schools I worked up the courage to tell my parents that I was being bullied at the pervious school and that was the real reason why I wanted to move and my father said that he knew that there was more than just the marks being down for no reason. 
If he thought I was being bullied why did he never say anything to me? 

The later years in my life only seemed to get worse. 
In grade 10 my older sibling was raped by a stranger in a park after clubbing. 
My dad and step-mum told me about it but after that never  spoke of it again. 
I didn't even understand what rape was. I had to Google it. 

My ex-boyfriend and I were together from highschool ( the new school) to the end of college. 
It has come to light that he was a sociopath and sexually manipluted and controlled me through the entire relationship. 

In grade 10 I was raped by a a friend that I considered a brother to me. I haven't told anyone about it besides my new partner and a small group of my close friends. 

I have tried talking to my parents and had agruments where I was begging for my dad to give me more emotional support as I felt so overwhelmed and even gave him suggestions on ways that would help make me feel more loved and supported. 

I cannot remember any times that my dad said that he was genuinely proud of me. 

He used my little sister who I adore more than anything on this world to emotionally guilt trip me I do not come over and see them and make her upset telling her that I have let them all down. 
Even if I say I have a work shift and that is the reason of why I cannot see them. 

I was in a position where I couldn't talk to my parents about anything because if I spoke of any of my problems I was having with friends or partners they always took the opposing side and basically made me feel like I was deserving of what was going on and it was most likely my own fault. 

I am a complete pushover and  people pleaser and I actually hate it. So many people in my life have abused this and I believe I am those two things because of my dad and step-mum. 
I could never tell them anything I always had to ask. 

I feel so stuck because  when I brought up that I didn't feel loved by him I could tell it would really hurt him and he would them say he did love me and how dare I say such a thing. He made me feel like I was irrational for voicing this and wrong even though I knew in my gut that it WAS how I felt. Leavaing me to question every emotion I feel. 

However I feel like the only time he has been there for me was when I attempted suicide and he slept on the floor of the emergency room by my bed and wouldn't leave. 
But he never spoke of the night to me and never changed in anyway after that and I actually attempted it whilst being grounded because my entire teen life I was grounded for most of it and when I came out of the hospital my step-mum and him told me just because I was out of hospital didn't mean that I would be ungrounded now.. even though all I wanted to do was see my closest girlfriend and not be locked up in my bedroom. Alone.

I'm stuck in this constant battle of guilt because I know that all of these events happened in both of our lives and so I know it has had an effect on him also but still in current times I self harm and think of suicide at least once a week. 
Covid-19 has left me being in isolation for the past 3 months and it has really pushed me to breaking point. 
I feel like I need to be in an insane asylum sometimes because I cannot tell what is right or wrong and I am in a constant state of not feeling like I'm good enough for anyone and that I am a horrible person who rots every relationship because I struggle to feel safe and respected in them because I'm so scared of being manipulated. 

I don't know whether to distance myself from him (I have been living out of home for over a year now and this is the only time I have realised how wrong and how horrid my previous living situation was with my parents) 

I just feel so lost with what the right thing to do is and how to go about it. 

Also any times on how to manage stress and anxiety would also be deeply appreciated. 

I will be seeing a psychologist soon hopefully and I'm thinking of even requesting medications to help with my mental health as I have been dealing with issues mentally since the age of 13 and every time I start to feel better all my emotions come back twice as bad and I have realised that I cannot do it alone and I cannot keep living in the same way. 
This can't continue as I'm scared I'll do something to myself that I know I'll regret. 
I don't want to kms even though every ounce of me is sometimes telling me that I do. 
I love him a lot but everytime I visit him be belittles me and show no instrest in any aspect of my life. 
Am I wrong to think that I feel like he should have been there for me more?",01Jun2020,1
308,"I'm not sure where to start really, but please excuse any english mistakes. I think I'm broken in some way and I'm not sure how to change. When I was 15 I was sexually assaulted by someone I thought was my friend. My best friend at the time, was in the same room; pretending to sleep. After that incident throughout my teens similar things have happened. Different guys touching me without my consent, always in situations I was either too scared to protest or couldn't. By any means I'm no longer a teen, I've continued with life. But I never really processed all of these things and feel as if can't form close connections to my partners. I'm terrified of becoming intimate and despite having a strong libido, I feel no ""attraction"" towards others. I've told my close friends and ex of 2 years I'm asexual, but it feels like that's just an excuse. I want nothing more than to form a intimate relationship like an ""normal person"", but everytime I chicken out. I'm not sure where I'm going with this, but how can I change? Should I go to therapy specifically for this?",01Jun2020,1
309,"a little bit of context first. I'm in my teens, still going through puberty, and am female, which kind of makes things worse. My brother is six, and is just starting to notice girls in general. And considering all of the quarantine shit that has been happening, the only girl he's had access to was me. He's begun showing a weird interest in me, begging that I have regulated times of the day that I have to spend with him, trying to kiss me, and making jokes about my boobs and swim suits (the weird, ""hey, you should show me your bra"" kinda thing, which is honestly really inappropriate for a kid his age, but my parents haven't really done anything to correct it since he's started saying it.)   
He's also begun sort of dry humping things, varying from the couch to even my bed. He avoids answering when I ask him what he's doing, and the one time I got an actual answer, he described it as ""trying to get the milk out."" I'm terrified of what he's alluding to and incredibly uncomfortable as he seems to only do it around me. I want to tell my parents about it, but they're very Christian and just haven't been very good on the whole sex and puberty talk thing. They'd rather pretend it not exist than try to intervene, which is why I'm scared about bringing up the topic with them. But I'm uncomfortable and want to distance myself from him so he isn't constantly looking at me in that manner. I just need advice on what I should do or how I should word it, if anyone can help.

311,"i (f, in my twenties) have a male best friend (also in twenties). We have been friends for about 4 years. I sent him nudes around 5 times. He told me he deleted them and never showed or told anybody. I trust him, but I'm growing increasingly paranoid about the photos because I keep seeing stories about people being betrayed by whoever they sent their nudes to and ending up on porn sites and stuff like that. Also in the past he has shown me nudes of other women. They weren't close to him, they just were random women, so at the time I sent the nudes I thought it wouldn't happen to me because we are very close, but now I think I was being dumb.

312,"So, title pretty much says it all.  Because Monday was a paid holiday in which we did not work, management is claiming  that we (manufacturing) are thus behind our weekly quota, and made Saturday a ""mandatory"" shift (show up, or you are fired)... but will not pay out overtime because Monday was ""Holiday"" pay, and does not count towards the 40 hours before time-and-a-half wages kicks in.

In other words, we gained a day off on Monday (note: we had to work/had a mandatory Saturday last week as well, so it was *not* a three day weekend for us, but rather just Sunday and Monday)... but lost a day off this weekend ***without weekend overtime pay***.

315,"It's more complicated than the title betrays.

Okay, this is a long one, and needs a bit of back story.
My last bf and I broke up bc he stopped wanting sex. I spent the last year of our relationship feeling very inadequate and unsexy, and hating myself. My self esteem was rock bottom, and I was desperate for any kind of half hearted meaningless validation I could get. I ended that when I was 19, and It's taken a few years, but I'm a lot more confident these days.

However, my current bf, who I've been with for maybe a year and a half, recently injured his knee badly and put on a lot of weight bc of it.
I couldn't care less about the weight personally. I still find him sexy, but for about 3 months he stopped really wanting sex or anything. Note that he's been able to walk for a couple of weeks now, and is totally capable of having sex. 

I asked him about it, and he explained that because of his weight gain he's just feeling really down and not sexual.

I've been trying to be respectful and not pushy, and I've only tested the water here and there to see and then backed off, but it's been a while since he's wanted me now and those feelings of inadequacy and low self esteem are coming back. I thought I was over it, but I guess I'm emotionally scarred or something.

I talked to him about it again recently, about how I feel, and all he can really say is ""I don't know what's wrong, I'm sorry"". And that's okay, we're all human and we don't always know what's wrong. Since then we've started doing a little here and there, mostly just me blowing or using my hands to get him off, and nothing for me, but tbh I've been happy just to have any kind of sexual connection again. So
I've been doing some research and picking some brains about the ways I could best blow his mind, to remind him that it's exciting and great to be sexual with me. I mean maybe he's just bored of what we have going? Idk.

So yesterday, Sunday, we spent the whole day together. Well we do live together, and it was Sunday so he had the day off, so pretty standard) 
I tried to get him to shower with me, and he firmly declined. I was planning to get hot and heavy in the shower, but whatever, I spent the tome shaving then doing my make up and hair (I had a family event that night anyway). I came out and was hoping to get his attention since I was all tiddies out, and this man love his tiddies, but he didn't look any more than a glance away from his phone... 
So I was feeling disheartened and dropped it. 

Fast forward and it's the end of the night, and I finally got him into it and gave him a bj, idk how relevant that is.

Anyway, so he went to sleep (since he wakes up early) but it was too early for me. So I decided to do some study. I've been using his iPad as a second screen when I study, which he's fine with. I went to history to find the last page I used, and would you believe that google history is linked to his phone's google history? Shiet.

Now I'm not usually one to pry, and I feel REALLY guilty about it. We know each others passcodes and just trust that we won't snoop, but it just popped up accidentally, and the first search was porn.

Not let's be real clear, I have absolutely no issue with porn. I watch it too sometimes, not a big deal. However I noticed the time stamp said 12:20pm.... and I'm thinking, but he spent the whole day with me? How? Oh, when I was in the shower.... 
And I know this is because of my past experiences that I'm so sensitive about it, but the fact that he chose to watch porn instead of taking advantage of his lonely, horny girlfriend that's been throwing herself at him, and expressed several times that she feels that the lack of sex is becoming and issue... well it's way too close to the bone.

I guess I forgot to mention that my ex stopped wanting sex supposedly because he was addicted to porn. Idc if he genuinely was or not, he chose porn over me every single time, and it SUCKED to be me. 

So that's why I'm hurt and upset, and I don't mean to attack him or tell him he's bad for watching porn, just explain how it fucks with my head if he does it in a situation where I'm willing and ready. Like if I was asleep or studying or whatever then all good, I wouldn't care.
The thing holding me back from this convo, is that further down there were more porn searches... and they were very personal and specific. In particular girls with strap ons, and BBW kind of searches (and I'm not a BBW so how random? I guess he's looking for ultra boobs). I mean I'm all for being open and trying new things, but I don't want to embarrass him, especially since I shouldn't have been snooping.

So, should I have that convo with him while it's relevant and fresh, or hope for the best that things improve and that I never have to worry about it again? 

TL;DR My bf hasn't been wanting sex lately, but his history shows he has been watching ""specific"" porn. I want to bring it up, but don't want to embarrass him.",01Jun2020,1
316,"I’m a sophomore in high school. I play football for the varsity team, and I coach my friends Intramural Basketball team. I’m a bright student and I have over 4.0 cumulative GPA. I’m a social person on the inside  but I’ve only hung out with people in like a party or bonfire twice in the last two years. I miss my grade school so much. I had so much fun and had real friends who I lost touch with. It hurts me bad. I never asked out my crush that I had for a long time, and I regret that because I feel she would have said yes
:( nowadays I have people I consider friends but I don’t think they feel the same way at all. I’m always out of the loop and alone. I have a good relationship with these people I consider to be my friends person to person but when I’m away from them, I’m always learning about gossip being told about me and people posting stuff behind my back. Unfortunately my Intelligence has been a curse and I remember a lot of the negative stuff said and posted about me. I rarely remember any of the good moments. I feel like I’m the popular loner if that makes any sense. I’m the person most people knows but I’am never out of my house with anyone. I recently opened up to my mom about my situation and we are gonna work together on this situation. So here is my question to you all-

How can I interact with these new people better and how can I develop a relationship with these people without them tossing me out? (I know what I say about these people seems bad, but they are good people, and they are the people I want to be around). 

Is there anyway I can get back in touch with people I fell off with(no bad blood, it was just distance that broke our relationship)? &lt;—this one is super important to me, I miss my old friends and I’m positive that our relationships can be salvaged if i play this situation right.

Also if you any words of encouragement to help me get through my difficult struggles right now, I would so appreciative.

317,"She (25) wanted to try my (15) Bluetooth earbuds and they wouldn't connect to her phone. I wanted to make sure she didn't see my regular history (ironically) and Samsung phones have a feature ecalled secure folder. Anyway I opened YouTube in it and the search history was from years ago and said stuff like sexy Selena gomez or Tessa netting. She said she saw it as I quickly exited and we ignored it.

320,"I am a 15 year old female who thought that for my entire life I was destined to go into the medical field. Lately I have been having some doubts and I’ve come to the conclusion that the only reason I wanted a medical career was to get my parents attention, but that career path isn’t very healthy. So I’m left with this question: what would be my future career? All my life I’ve never thought of a backup plan, and I’m scared for my future. Does anybody know how to deal with this or at least solve this problem? I’m not very interested in anything, even if I am, my brain would probably pick at the smallest problem, which is why I’m scared to choose another path.",01Jun2020,1
321,"So this was last year. Sophomore year. There are three characters. Me, Jane, the mega bitch, and my good friend John.

Jane is really awful. She's attempted numerous ""pranks"" on her friends involving such serious matters as arranged marriage (She's from the middle east) and suicide. She would straight up message me asking to tell one of our friends that she was about to commit suicide. Needless to say, I answered no each time.

But one day, she tries pulling the arranged marriage prank on my buddy John, someone she has really strong feelings for (though not reciprocated). And low and behold, she messages me trying to convince me to be her little messenger boy again since I'm one of the few people at our school keeps close contact with. 

Here's where my potential assholeness comes in.

I agree to do it, then make an exact replica of John's account and begin making a fake conversation wherein I tell him that she's getting married, and John confesses his love to her. 

So I send Jane the screenshots for a little while, getting her hopes up nice and high. And then I quickly drop them after sending her a screenshot of the fake John account saying now in my writing style that it was a prank. She was fuming.

Even a year later, she spams John and uses me as a means to contact him. And she still asks me if that confession was really a fake. I told her that it was, and that John found it funny (Which he actually did when I told him about it). He blocked her earlier tonight.

I actually asked my mom about this, if what I did was wrong. And she answered obliquely that I ought to be careful what I put out into the world, because it's gonna come right back to me. So I guess we know her stance.

Was I wrong to crush this girl's crush?",01Jun2020,1

Recently with how crazy people have been acting, my cat dying unexpectedly and not really having any other friends to fall back on i've been super lonely and thinking about trying to reconnect with my old friend. But after looking him up and scrolling through his FB page, every time i do he seems like a totally different and far stupider person. like all his views and beliefs have completely reversed from what they used to be and all he does is scream about politics that I don't agree with and he used to disagree with.

323,"I saw a lost cat in my neighborhood Friday morning on my way to work. Unfortunately I was not able to help her then, but when I got home today I was able to help her out. I put out posts on Nextdoor, Pawboost, as well as local Facebook groups. I have not been able to contact the owner at all. 

I have put up a few signs in the neighborhood that I found her in (my neighborhood) but I live in Los Angeles and there is a curfew in place due to the protests and I couldn’t be out for very long. I will put up more signs tomorrow before curfew begins.  

The cat is currently not with me as my mother is extremely allergic, but with a friend of mine whose fiancé owns a pet store and is good with animals. Unfortunately they can only keep her for a week. 

I am trying to remain optimistic that the owner will see my signs and contact me but if she doesn’t I really don’t know what I’ll do. What would be your next and best move if next Sunday rolls around and I cannot locate the cats owner?",01Jun2020,1
325,"My husband and I have been married for almost a year and together for almost 5. We have a young daughter. We've always had our differences, but we worked through them because I love him and I know that all relationships can be hard.

Things have actually been really good lately. But all of a sudden, sh*t hit the fan and we randomly got into a huge argument. I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall because if I say one thing, he starts an argument completely missing the point.

He came into our room, where I had gone to cool down, and started arguing again. After listening to him yell at me for 20 minutes while I covered our sleeping daughters ears, I finally told him that ""I dont love (him) sometimes"". He said ""F*ck you"" and slammed the door. 

All I can think is that I'm done. It's over. That maybe its been over for a long time but I've been working so hard to fix it. But I'm the only one working at this. 

There has been no infidelity (as far as I'm aware), I just feel like we've grown apart too much. BUT my heart absolutely breaks at the thought of our daughter watching him leave. I don't know what to do.",01Jun2020,1
326,"Today I invited one of my best friends over to swim today at my house. She’s always been really sweet, outgoing, and sometimes a little weird. I always sort of thought, but never really actually sat down and considered it. However, today, somehow the topic of sexuality came into our conversation. Don’t remember how. But anyway, she asked about the difference between gay/bi/lesbian/trans etc. I explained and she understood. And then, something really weird happened. We were playing on this float and for some reason in an effort to get me off she undid my bikini from the back. I was freaking out at first and I made her reattach it bc I was mad at her. Then, we were talking about Tik Tok (i hate it, she loves it) and she was talking about those cringey posts that are about coming out to friends. Like, “I tried coming out to my friend today and she didn’t notice...” type things. I just laughed about it and thought nothing of it. But the reason that makes me think she’s bi and not lesbian is the fact that she talked about her “ideal guy.” It seemed pretty genuine.

For the record, I’m straight. I even like a guy and she knows. I think she might be into me though. When we graduated, we walked down to our seats together and she thought like we were getting married. She’s made jokes about us dating after that though, too. Here’s what I want to know, though: Should I ask her if she’s bi? I don’t want to ruin our friendship if it makes her really uncomfortable. But I really think she’s bi and not telling me. Also, I don’t think I am going to ask her if she’s into me at all. Way too uncomfortable. Just let me know, am I onto something or is it all just in my head?",01Jun2020,1
327,"So my boyfriend of 3 years lost his license due him passing out while driving. He passed out a couple times in the past while we were dating and since the first time he did, I urged him too see a doctor and never did.

When we first dated at (18) we got into a pretty bad car accident and he was driving. He hit a barricade. In the same month my Uber driver hit another car and I was hurt. From then,  I was too scared to drive and my boyfriend use to drive when I don’t absolutely have to.

328,"Hey all! 

I'm considering transferring to a radiography degree. It sounds like a good job in most respects but I'm struggling to find concrete stats on what it's like money-wise. So, how much radiographers earn in Australia? What is an average starting wage, and to what degree does salary increase with experience?",01Jun2020,1
329,"I [19F] am overstressed constantly.
I really struggle with voicing my feelings and thoughts. I bottle up my feelings and so I end up being all alone with my negative thoughts. I have basically no confidence because I feel like I can't do anything alone and I'm worthless/useless. 
It's strange because I used to be a massive extrovert and was  basically never at home, at the time I thought it was because I was a social bug but now I'm starting to realise that I was quite violently absusing the use of alcohol from the ages 13-18. 

I moved to Australia only a few years ago after living in Europe with my mother and step family.
My mother committed suicide when I was 11 and so my sister and I were told to live with our father back in Australia. 
To me it was all very sudden and I wasn't even aware that I had a father in Australia. 
Fast forward to highschool and I was sent to a sister school of the primary school I was attending. 
This is where my first 'boyfriend' at the time forced me to have sex with him and I was already being tangled into the web of drugs. 
The school environment was so toxic - to the point where I was bullied every single day. I used to pretend that I was sick so I wouldn't have to be at school but my father and new step mother didn't believe me so I used to make myself vomit as they required pictures otherwise they  thought I was simply trying to ditch class. I would even wear 2 bras to school to make my boobs bigger because I was teased for having no titties (I am I was 11 and hadn't even hit puberty yet?). 
They even went to the point of on and old social media platform (Ask.Fm) where you can write anonymous questions to people they would say things like ""You need to follow your mum's footsteps"" and ""You are no doubt the reason why she did it"".   

After failing every class for 7 months and being continuously grounded due to failing (I was failing from hiding in the toilets in fear of my peers, being overly sexualized, cheated on) I told my parents I needed to move schools. 
When i moved schools I worked up the courage to tell my parents that I was being bullied at the pervious school and that was the real reason why I wanted to move and my father said that he knew that there was more than just the marks being down for no reason. 
If he thought I was being bullied why did he never say anything to me? 

The later years in my life only seemed to get worse. 
In grade 10 my older sibling was raped by a stranger in a park after clubbing. 
My dad and step-mum told me about it but after that never  spoke of it again. 
I didn't even understand what rape was. I had to Google it. 

My ex-boyfriend and I were together from highschool ( the new school) to the end of college. 
It has come to light that he was a sociopath and sexually manipluted and controlled me through the entire relationship. 

In grade 10 I was raped by a a friend that I considered a brother to me. I haven't told anyone about it besides my new partner and a small group of my close friends. 

I have tried talking to my parents and had agruments where I was begging for my dad to give me more emotional support as I felt so overwhelmed and even gave him suggestions on ways that would help make me feel more loved and supported. 

I cannot remember any times that my dad said that he was genuinely proud of me. 

He used my little sister who I adore more than anything on this world to emotionally guilt trip me I do not come over and see them and make her upset telling her that I have let them all down. 
Even if I say I have a work shift and that is the reason of why I cannot see them. 

I was in a position where I couldn't talk to my parents about anything because if I spoke of any of my problems I was having with friends or partners they always took the opposing side and basically made me feel like I was deserving of what was going on and it was most likely my own fault. 

I am a complete pushover and  people pleaser and I actually hate it. So many people in my life have abused this and I believe I am those two things because of my dad and step-mum. 
I could never tell them anything I always had to ask. 

I feel so stuck because  when I brought up that I didn't feel loved by him I could tell it would really hurt him and he would them say he did love me and how dare I say such a thing. He made me feel like I was irrational for voicing this and wrong even though I knew in my gut that it WAS how I felt. Leavaing me to question every emotion I feel. 

However I feel like the only time he has been there for me was when I attempted suicide and he slept on the floor of the emergency room by my bed and wouldn't leave. 
But he never spoke of the night to me and never changed in anyway after that and I actually attempted it whilst being grounded because my entire teen life I was grounded for most of it and when I came out of the hospital my step-mum and him told me just because I was out of hospital didn't mean that I would be ungrounded now.. even though all I wanted to do was see my closest girlfriend and not be locked up in my bedroom. Alone.

I'm stuck in this constant battle of guilt because I know that all of these events happened in both of our lives and so I know it has had an effect on him also but still in current times I self harm and think of suicide at least once a week. 
Covid-19 has left me being in isolation for the past 3 months and it has really pushed me to breaking point. 
I feel like I need to be in an insane asylum sometimes because I cannot tell what is right or wrong and I am in a constant state of not feeling like I'm good enough for anyone and that I am a horrible person who rots every relationship because I struggle to feel safe and respected in them because I'm so scared of being manipulated. 

I don't know whether to distance myself from him (I have been living out of home for over a year now and this is the only time I have realised how wrong and how horrid my previous living situation was with my parents) 

I just feel so lost with what the right thing to do is and how to go about it. 

Also any times on how to manage stress and anxiety would also be deeply appreciated. 

I will be seeing a psychologist soon hopefully and I'm thinking of even requesting medications to help with my mental health as I have been dealing with issues mentally since the age of 13 and every time I start to feel better all my emotions come back twice as bad and I have realised that I cannot do it alone and I cannot keep living in the same way. 
This can't continue as I'm scared I'll do something to myself that I know I'll regret. 
I don't want to kms even though every ounce of me is sometimes telling me that I do. 
I love him a lot but everytime I visit him be belittles me and show no instrest in any aspect of my life. 
Am I wrong to think that I feel like he should have been there for me more?",01Jun2020,1

I’m a terrible texter which i think led to me losing my friends during the quarantine. I’m trying to get a job to be around people more to distract from my depression. I just don’t know what to do i’m in a ton of pain and i can’t show it. Any advice please. thanks.,01Jun2020,1
333,"I just feel so guilty and I have to get it off my chest!!!So a brief explanation. 

This girl let’s call her Ally is a girl I’ve hung out with maybe 3-4x she’s pretty chill we smoke and hang out as there’s nothing to do here in Tallahassee. Mind you I live at college apartments so everything is really laid back. My friend and I wanted to tan and smoke a blunt by the pool. When we went out there was a group of maybe 15 or so people having a little party. They were out there first and I didn’t want to intrude. Boy was I wrong these people were so nice! As soon as we walked in they introduced themselves, offered us drinks, and even brought us white claws while we were tanning. 

Now normally i wouldn’t point out race when telling a story but for the sake of understanding the severity of the story I am. The group having the party was entirely black and my friend and I are white females. So I’m chillin by the pool smoking a blunt with my friend and Ally calls me and kinda invites herself. I’m like okay whatever my pool is the only pool open it tally so if anything she can chill if I leave. So Ally, her boyfriend, and his friend show up and we’re all chilling taking shots. The people hosting the party did the same to them when they walked in and offered them drinks. 

So everyone is having a great time at this point. Im playing beer pong with these awesome people I just met and we are just chilling and drinking. Ally is twerking for everyone at the pool and everyone is just laughing and snapchatting. Everyone loves her at this point. I was thinking to myself like damn Ally is the life of the party. 

Not even 15 minutes later I see her sitting with a group of girls that were playing cards. I was about 10 ft away watching them talk and the music was pretty loud so I couldn’t really tell what was being said but next thing I know I read the words, “you need to get the fuck up on out of here bitch.” 
At this point I’m like 👁👄👁 then they just start fighting. Everyone is trying to tear them apart, Ally is relentless just charging through people trying to get to the group of girls. The guys are screaming just so upset that this is happening. I was so shocked that I just stood there. I felt so shattered. I gathered Ally’s things and begged her to leave. She wanted to stay and have fun .... I’m like girl you just fought these people. 

So I walk up to the girl that originally told her to fuck off and she comes up to ME with a bottle of Henny and goes, “you look really confused baby you need a shot.” I’m like, “yes I’m so sorry I don’t even understand what happened.” She must of accepted the apology as she poured a shot in my mouth but then her friend runs from behind and snatches the bottle from her hand causing the liquor to go into my eyes and all over my face. I just stood there embarrassed and confused as her group of friends and everyone at the party was like, “why’d you do that? Shes been cool this entire time.” 

At that moment I understood she was upset as she probably associated me with Ally and I stood there and apologized. It still wasn’t cool that she did that but I didn’t want anymore fighting I just wanted peace so I just walked away. 

A little context Ally likes to do bars so sometimes when she talks it totally doesn’t make sense. Come to find out Ally’s dumb ass said something along the lines of, “you guys really just need to watch out there’s such crazy stuff going on rn, I love black people, I went to a protest yesterday etc” and I guess they took it the wrong way which I don’t blame them the topic of race was just something we didn’t need to talk about especially now.I think Ally had good intentions when she said it but I didn’t hear everything and she was fucked up so who knows wtf happened. 

It just really sucked being associated with her because they way she acted was so embarrassing especially after they welcomed us so generously. My friend and I went to home and cried to each other about how shitty we felt even though we had no control over what was going on. 

I feel broken spirited more than anything as the day before I spent 7 hours marching through Tallahssee with protestors handing out waters and masks.  Then here I was the next day not doing anything when my friend made a racist comment that started a fight. On top of everything else tensions in Tallahassee are extremely high as Tony McDade was killed by TPD just 4 days ago. I feel sick to my stomach and my heart aches for the people we met. They just wanted to have a peaceful day and here come these annoying white people saying dumb shit and stirring up trouble. I’m sorry I just had to get it off my chest. 

I’m very passionate about the BLM movement as the majority of my friends are black and my boyfriend is Jamaican. I was just moved so deeply from my experience yesterday that I feel the pain those guys felt when they were tearing the girls apart. They just want peace too and here Ally is making a scene and making them look bad. 

I know I didn’t do anything to cause the fight but I just feel like I could’ve done something. I didn’t know what was going on and I didn’t know what to say. I felt like since tensions were already so high anything I said could’ve come off as racist or disrespectful. So I got my things and left but I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. 

I haven’t checked on my friend. Idk if I should. Idk if I want to be her friend. I just feel confused and upset about everything. My neighbors are probably going to think I’m racist every-time they see me. Just UGH I feel like SHIT. I apologized and removed myself from the situation because I felt like that was the best choice. 

I’m only 21 and I honestly thought racism was something that stayed in our history books. After hearing people’s stories I couldn’t be more wrong. 

I want to learn, I want to grow, I want to do better. DO more than just protest.

334,So I dove into a new hobby but quickly realized that I don’t know how I’m going to be able to do it. I got into surfing it’s something I’ve wanted to do for over 10 years. My son has started to show interest in it as well. I have a board and I’m going to get him one as well.

335,"I know that there's many subreddits out there somewhere but I checked and all seemed to have a different take on the matter.

 I'm lanky with semi broad shoulders, sticks for arms and slim legs that may have thickened up a little bit over the last while...? Hard to say.

My dad is a big guy but lanky as well (6'3, 210lbs) and my mom is very short (5'2, idk lbs) so I feel like they balance themselves out, putting me at an average build overall but if anybody has info on how much longer I'll slowly grow and roughly how much growth, I'd appreciate it.

338,"Hi,  
If anyone has any advice on this I would really appreciate it.  

So I'm a first year student at university studying a Bachelor's of Laboratory Medicine. I worked really fucking hard to get where I am despite having both a chronic physical illness and severe mdd. 

My whole life I've known exactly what I wanted to do. That's changed a couple times over the years,  of course,  but when I decided what I wanted to be, I stuck with it firmly for quite some time. When I was a kid I wanted to be a pâtissier, so I taught myself to bake. Then I was diagnosed with coeliacs disease so that went down the drain, lol.  

I have two long lasting passions in life- medicine &amp; hospitals,  and houses. 

For a long time I thought I would be an architect. See,  I've always had this obsession with residential architecture.  I started drawing floor plans at age 6 and haven't stopped since. I must have designed hundreds of homes by now. I dream about them,  I keep up with the real estate market because I love houses so much,  I sketch and design constantly. But I chose not to pursue it at university because I was terrified I would resent it.  That this thing I love so much would become just a job, just more work to do.  I was scared it would lose its charm.  

So I took my other passion and after a lot of research thought and discussion came to the conclusion that I could be a good doctor.  I really think this is what I want to do in life. So I chose an undergrad degree that will afford a great deal of help applying for medical school. My current degree includes a year of work in a pathology lab in a very reputable research institute and I know this would go a long way in applying for medical school.  

Now,  I'm not under any delusions that being a doctor is easy. I know medical school will be a gruelling and difficult experience. But I didn't plan on applying for at least (at an absolute minimum) another five years, and I have hope that by then some of my own medical issues will be under control, and I will have gained enough life experience to prepare me for such a big task. 

But lately I've been wondering what it would be like to study architecture. I have an acquaintance who is study architecture at the university I would theoretically apply to and he really likes it. And my mom says that maybe I should do it, if that's what feels right. 

I've made a list of pros and cons for each of my choices and logically it doesn't add up to transfer to a different university and start a whole new degree. And I figure maybe if I still love architecture in the future I could study it part time in like twenty years when my career is all on track.  

I just can't shake this 'what if?' about it. I think I could be really good at it. What if I'm wasting my time trying to pursue medical school?  What if I'm actually destined to go into drafting or architecture and I'm not choosing the right path?  

Anyway, I just wanted to know if anyone has any advice on all this. I'm torn between my heart, which tells me I'm doing the right thing now, and this gut feeling, that tells me I could be missing out on something great. Thanks for reading, any comments are appreciated.",01Jun2020,1

Last year my sister tried to kill herself worst part was that I knew something was wrong I just thought she was going through a phase or something I’m a military child we were living in Okinawa japan and after she took a bunch of my dads medication she was hospitalized in a psych ward in Hawaii I was supposed to finish middle school in oki but about halfway through we were told that we’d be moving to lackland I won’t lie I wasn’t a good a person I tried snaking my way into girls hearts to see them naked I was terrible but then my friends found me and for a while things weren’t as bad everyday I still looked at that traitors  face when I brush my teeth but I at least felt the urge to leave my room but then freshman year came I dated a girl in our group and things went south fast her parents didn’t approve and told other parents that I was up to no good or whatever I cheated on her at Halloween after my best friend ghosted me the entire time only responding with ghjgh I think even after they had convinced me to get a giraffe onzie since they were getting animal onzies a month ish later a girl said I had done something (if I say the post will get deleted) in a bathroom even though ironically enough she was the one who asked me if I wanted to make out with her basically when I confronted her she said she didn’t say anything to anyone and that someone Misinterpreted her but eventually she apologized along with one of my friends my others didn’t even apologize after even though Spencer spread all that shit around even to my online friends after I had explained to him what happend when I asked him why he did it he just smiled and said ok the only ones to have stood by me were my guy Zach and Danny Taylor did but she thought that I had done it too it took a week for everything to be set straight and only Amaya has apologized a couple of nights ago Spencer made an argument between him and dahlia public I can’t say what because I never asked but he made a whole thing about it in our group chat so I started making passive aggressive comments still joking but kinda telling him to stop then dahlia sees the texts and they start arguing things get heated I don’t exactly remember what was said but I remember saying I may be failing algebra but I’ve been asking for help for months and only Drake and Amaya said something you all ignored me so yeah I’m failing algebra but at least I’m not the kinda person to throw people aside like fucking trash things kinda cooled down after that mainly because he did what he always does and brooded about it at home ignoring me completely after I tried to apologize I don’t get it I’m I crazy? Am I the ass here because it feels like no matter what I do they find a way to make me feel like I’m wrong sorry for the rant and for mobile if you want greater detail make a comment I’ll respond in full",01Jun2020,1
341,"Sorry if the formatting is weird, I'm on mobile. Also TL;DR is at the bottom

So background: I graduated university in 2014. I took some time off, which ended up being longer than planned due to family reasons, and searching for jobs at that time was not successful. I ended up in retail despite my degree

I kept applying and eventually managed to get an offer from a company that's fairly reputable, big, etc. It's not a job I wanted to do, but I needed money and thought it would help as a stepping stone, if nothing else. As long as it would get me out of retail, that was enough, I'd figure the rest out later 

Fast forward nearly 4 years. I'm still at that job, despite actively looking for something else the last 1.5 years and looking on and off for the previous 2.5. It pays well, I'm good at it, and I'm lucky enough that it's considered essential (even though I live in Canada, so being laid off would not currently be a financial problem for me, at least short-term). I've gotten multiple raises and a promotion and they're very happy with me for the most part

Thing is, I absolutely hate it. The work itself is mind-numbingly dull. The company attitude and policies are stuck in the 90s while claiming that they're being progressive. I get along with my coworkers in the sense that I can work fine with them, but there isn't a single one I'd want to spend time with outside of work. It's an office job as well, meanwhile a large part of the reason I went for a science degree in university is so I wouldn't be stuck in an office, but here I am. This is not a position or company I want to work at and it's only tangentially related to the field I want to be in (and spent several years and thousands of dollars to get a degree so I could be in)

I can't stand it. Every Sunday night, I spend a couple of hours sobbing because I'll have to work again the next morning and I dread it at such a bone deep level. I'm 27 and I fantasize about just getting in my car and driving away, telling no one and never coming back. I think about how getting injured or sick would be worth it if it meant I could miss work even for a little bit. I used to have a \~20 year old car (it quit and I had to buy a new one) and I would often think about crashing it into a barrier on my morning commute and hope I'd get hurt enough to get off work for a while but not die (I don't anymore now that my car is actually worth something lol). I can't sleep at night and I've recently started to have trouble waking up in the morning - I set 12 alarms and am lucky if I hear even 2 of them lately. Sometimes I have panic attacks that make me hyperventilate just from thinking about logging in to work the next day. My whole body hurts and I'm so exhausted at the end of the day from sitting at my computer that I end up doing nothing all evening. I know this is depression, but I also know the main cause right now is my job

I did some reading on burnout and realized that my hatred for my job is not normal (I legitimately thought this is just how every adult who isn't doing their ""passion"" lived). So I took a week off, tried to recoup. I've been back for a week and the brief respite and good feels I'd amassed over the week have completely evaporated. I've been feeling this way for at least 2 years and it's only been getting worse. But no matter how many jobs I apply to (I'm well over 100 at this point), the economy here was bad before the pandemic and there's hundreds of other applicants too. I've had a couple of interviews but no success. I keep trying, but now with Covid and everything, I feel like there's no hope in sight. 

I feel trapped because I can't just quit, I'd run out of money in a couple of months even if I was extremely careful. But no matter how hard I look, I just have no success. I thought working from home would help, but it hasn't. I can't take it anymore. I need out but there's nothing I can do, it seems. I have no skills that could get me money on the internet and, even if I did, there's so much going on right now that this is NOT the time to try something that financially risky with no back up plan

I feel helpless and hopeless. I don't know what to do anymore. It's after 1 am and I'm laying in bed and I have to log on again tomorrow at 8. I'm afraid to go to sleep because I don't want it to be tomorrow

TL;DR version: looking for tips when you're stuck in a job you can't stand to the point where it's ruining your mental and physical health, but the job market is terrible so finding a new one is just not happening. And yes, I've tried finding the positives about my job - it didn't help because there aren't many",01Jun2020,1

346,"Yesterday I was on my local beach kayaking with some friends. I drove everyone down. We were probably down there for about 3 hours. When we came back up and got back into the car, we decided to get some take out. I looked at my wallet and could have sworn I had 20 euro in there. I didn't say anything until another guy who I've just recently become mates with mentioned that he was missing up to 100 euro from his wallet. We all came to the conclusion that we were robbed. I've never been robbed before and I could have sworn I locked my car (I'm a pretty careful person). But, I don't see any other way people could have gotten in! So it's my fault for not locking it properly. The guy who got a lot of cash taken is a really nice dude and I wouldn't like to sour our relationship as I've only really got to know him over the past three weeks. Cool guy.

348,"I just feel so guilty and I have to get it off my chest!!!So a brief explanation. 

This girl let’s call her Ally is a girl I’ve hung out with maybe 3-4x she’s pretty chill we smoke and hang out as there’s nothing to do here in Tallahassee. Mind you I live at college apartments so everything is really laid back. My friend and I wanted to tan and smoke a blunt by the pool. When we went out there was a group of maybe 15 or so people having a little party. They were out there first and I didn’t want to intrude. Boy was I wrong these people were so nice! As soon as we walked in they introduced themselves, offered us drinks, and even brought us white claws while we were tanning. 

Now normally i wouldn’t point out race when telling a story but for the sake of understanding the severity of the story I am. The group having the party was entirely black and my friend and I are white females. So I’m chillin by the pool smoking a blunt with my friend and Ally calls me and kinda invites herself. I’m like okay whatever my pool is the only pool open it tally so if anything she can chill if I leave. So Ally, her boyfriend, and his friend show up and we’re all chilling taking shots. The people hosting the party did the same to them when they walked in and offered them drinks. 

So everyone is having a great time at this point. Im playing beer pong with these awesome people I just met and we are just chilling and drinking. Ally is twerking for everyone at the pool and everyone is just laughing and snapchatting. Everyone loves her at this point. I was thinking to myself like damn Ally is the life of the party. 

Not even 15 minutes later I see her sitting with a group of girls that were playing cards. I was about 10 ft away watching them talk and the music was pretty loud so I couldn’t really tell what was being said but next thing I know I read the words, “you need to get the fuck up on out of here bitch.” 
At this point I’m like 👁👄👁 then they just start fighting. Everyone is trying to tear them apart, Ally is relentless just charging through people trying to get to the group of girls. The guys are screaming just so upset that this is happening. I was so shocked that I just stood there. I felt so shattered. I gathered Ally’s things and begged her to leave. She wanted to stay and have fun .... I’m like girl you just fought these people. 

So I walk up to the girl that originally told her to fuck off and she comes up to ME with a bottle of Henny and goes, “you look really confused baby you need a shot.” I’m like, “yes I’m so sorry I don’t even understand what happened.” She must of accepted the apology as she poured a shot in my mouth but then her friend runs from behind and snatches the bottle from her hand causing the liquor to go into my eyes and all over my face. I just stood there embarrassed and confused as her group of friends and everyone at the party was like, “why’d you do that? Shes been cool this entire time.” 

At that moment I understood she was upset as she probably associated me with Ally and I stood there and apologized. It still wasn’t cool that she did that but I didn’t want anymore fighting I just wanted peace so I just walked away. 

A little context Ally likes to do bars so sometimes when she talks it totally doesn’t make sense. Come to find out Ally’s dumb ass said something along the lines of, “you guys really just need to watch out there’s such crazy stuff going on rn, I love black people, I went to a protest yesterday etc” and I guess they took it the wrong way which I don’t blame them the topic of race was just something we didn’t need to talk about especially now.I think Ally had good intentions when she said it but I didn’t hear everything and she was fucked up so who knows wtf happened. 

It just really sucked being associated with her because they way she acted was so embarrassing especially after they welcomed us so generously. My friend and I went to home and cried to each other about how shitty we felt even though we had no control over what was going on. 

I feel broken spirited more than anything as the day before I spent 7 hours marching through Tallahssee with protestors handing out waters and masks.  Then here I was the next day not doing anything when my friend made a racist comment that started a fight. On top of everything else tensions in Tallahassee are extremely high as Tony McDade was killed by TPD just 4 days ago. I feel sick to my stomach and my heart aches for the people we met. They just wanted to have a peaceful day and here come these annoying white people saying dumb shit and stirring up trouble. I’m sorry I just had to get it off my chest. 

I’m very passionate about the BLM movement as the majority of my friends are black and my boyfriend is Jamaican. I was just moved so deeply from my experience yesterday that I feel the pain those guys felt when they were tearing the girls apart. They just want peace too and here Ally is making a scene and making them look bad. 

I know I didn’t do anything to cause the fight but I just feel like I could’ve done something. I didn’t know what was going on and I didn’t know what to say. I felt like since tensions were already so high anything I said could’ve come off as racist or disrespectful. So I got my things and left but I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. 

I haven’t checked on my friend. Idk if I should. Idk if I want to be her friend. I just feel confused and upset about everything. My neighbors are probably going to think I’m racist every-time they see me. Just UGH I feel like SHIT. I apologized and removed myself from the situation because I felt like that was the best choice. 

I’m only 21 and I honestly thought racism was something that stayed in our history books. After hearing people’s stories I couldn’t be more wrong. 

I want to learn, I want to grow, I want to do better. DO more than just protest.

352,"Hey, 

We're obviously all experiencing covid to some degree at the moment. Some of us are absolutely finding it easier than others. Up until about four weeks ago, I'd have said I was finding the whole thing pretty alright really. I was finding more than enough to do and was generally keeping myself entertained. 

Sadly all of that changed at 9pm on the 3rd of May, when my right testicle decided it was just about the right time to swell up to three times it's normal size. Great. I was rushed for an emergency operation straight away - at that point it was presumed to be a torsion. During the op they found a lump on the testicle and I was subsequently diagnosed with testicular cancer. 
I've now had the operation to have the testicle/tumour removed. There have been some complications along the way - namely the wounds getting infected, meaning that I was bed bound for 10 days which was really tough. That having been said, the upshot is largely positive. I'm currently on surveillance in case the cancer rears its head again. I hasten to add, I'm almost certainly not going to die here. It's horrible to hear you have cancer, but it sounds like testicular cancer responds well to treatment. It's not like this is the last chance I have to see those I love.

My question really relates to being able to see my girlfriend. These are obviously hard times for anyone, but getting a big diagnosis right in the middle of it and then having major surgery makes it all the more difficult. Being alone in a hospital with no visitors has been horrible. I'm currently sheltering at home with my family who have been amazing. They've said if I want my girlfriend to come and stay, they're more than willing to accommodate for that. My girlfriend and I are both concerned that doing a household swap would be violating the lockdown rules. 

Would you consider these to be exceptional circumstances that justify a household move for a couple of weeks? 

I'm aware I'm being somewhat selfish even considering the prospect of it. The general suggestion in the UK is still to stay home after all. My partner's dad isn't as young as he once was. He's also in a fairly high risk category for covid so I'm somewhat concerned she'd risk taking something back home with her in a few weeks time when she goes home.

TL;DR - COVID was going well until I found out I had cancer. Now all I want is a hug and to spend a bit of time with my girlfriend to get through the recovery with some emotional support. Does this sound like a valid reason for her to move in under lockdown rules or am I being selfish?",01Jun2020,1
353,"I've been friends with someone for over 10 years now. For a while now, she has become very pushy and has crossed several lines. The first being, she told her bf that i told her to break up with him (he is abusive and she asked me what to do). Now her bf hates me and has threatened to blackmail me (although he has nothing on me). The second is that she insults my parents and my close relationship with them (i am extremely close to them and spend a lot of time with them). The third is that she constantly complains about her bad family and how pitiful and stressed she is. I have tried to be there for her really. But recently i have been experiencing very bad anxiety and i really do not have the physical or mental strength to deal with her anymore. I feel drained and panicky everytime she texts or calls (we cannot meet for obvious reasons and i have never felt so liberated in a long time). Please advise me what to do. 

It's a complicated situation. I have never discussed my feelings with her before (and for that i understand if me cutting her off would seem really shitty and abrupt but i have reached my limit). We have always gotten along and have never fought at all. How should i go about telling her i do not wish to be her friend anymore (or at least telling her that need a long break from the friendship)?",01Jun2020,1
354,"# Here's the backstory before the fight happened (WARNING: A lot of ranting here):

So I was unemployed from 2012 to 2018, this was due to me being lazy, depressed, anxiety fueled, and basically having given up on life. The reasons behind that are complex and would take too long to explain, so I will fast forward to 2018 (I was 22 years old at the time). I had finally gotten the motivation to look for a job and work again (Last I worked was April to June of 2012) to also support my brother and my mother who suffers with schizophrenia and other mental issues, so I looked around for places I was interested in applying for. And I decided to apply to work at a grocery store near my home and I also applied to another location of the same store chain. My brother worked at the current store I'm working at before, and he helped me get a job here by talking with the manager and letting him know I'm his brother and am able to work here. I went for an interview, and the great news was that I got hired, I felt so excited. Before this I was at home most of the time, using the computer all the time, lazy, didn't clean the house, depressed all the time, and was on disability program relying on government income.

I patiently waited for an answer of when I'd be able to start, the department I'd be working at, how many hours I'd get, my duties, etc. And September of 2018 was when I started, and it was the deli department. The person that would be training me is a person who for the sake of this story we will call him Cameron, he was a full timer.

Let me describe Cameron for you: He is overweight (WingsofRedemption level of overweight), balding white guy, early 30s, he's homosexual and has the gay voice (Not trying to sound homophobic, I have nothing against LGBT+ people and am friends with one who still works with me in the same department who I'll call Tyler), he's very extravagant and desperate for attention to the point where he will even bully people for attention, he loves stirring drama, loves the Kardashians, he loves fashion and got a fashion degree in college.

So Cameron trained me in the department, showed me how to make pizza, sandwiches, how to serve customers. The next day however I got trained by other co-workers on how to close the department. And the first couple of weeks went well with Cameron, me and him joked around a lot and we both had a good time. I also started getting along with his best friend who we will call Emily for this story who still works with me in the same department.

However, I started to see how Cameron really is. I noticed for example he was pretty unhelpful, for example I had a pizza order and asked him if he could back me up with another customer who was at the hot food side, but he ignored me and I had to serve the customer and put a pause on my pizza order even though I promised the customer who ordered the pizza that it would be ready in about 15 minutes. I was too scared to confront Cameron as he was with Emily (Who is a rebellious type like him and has no respect for the rules in the store and doesn't care like he does) and I was scared he would tell me to ""F\*ck off"" or an argument would ensue, I was also new and didn't want to risk losing my job and he was a full timer who's seniority was much higher than mine (He had been working in this store for 10+ years) and was afraid he could get me in trouble. So I took the passive route and let it slide.

I also noticed whenever he would get closing shifts, he would basically never help us close even when we were falling behind. And when he did help us he would do the absolute BARE minimum and do the easy tasks, but he would half-a\*s them too like he usually does with his work. His excuse for not helping us was that he was putting away orders, which he would do half the time and would only do half of that work, and the other half he'd be standing around talking and annoying other co-workers, going for smoke breaks constantly, and be on his phone. Also whenever he did his work like making sandwiches, pack out and what not he'd leave a big mess for us to clean up and he just did NOT care. And this was normal for the one year of me working here.

Also whenever Cameron had a bad day, he'd let his anger out on me. He'd boss me around, and one mistake he'd get all mad and tell me to do it right. I was passive, and I responded in a smirking way ""Ok"". Also that was another thing, he was a hypocrite. He would often boss me around and call me out on things that he did himself. For example, we had a new co-worker and she was looking for some containers for her pack out duties, and I looked around and tried to help her. Cameron walks in with one of the bakery employees and he says ""Why are you standing around, stop hitting on her"", my co-worker Tyler commented saying ""Ok Cameron, now you're being weird"", he ignored Tyler and said to me ""Look for something to do"". And I again responded smirkingly ""Ok then"". So he walks off with Bakery employee, but comes back to get dipping sauce for his food, and I jokingly made a sex related joke with him to try to enlighten him (Something me and him sometimes made to each other), but he told me to ""F\*ck off"" while not giving me any eye contact and I felt hurt when he said that realizing Cameron was serious. That was something he'd normally say when I would comment on what he did. And through that whole day I felt upset and wanting to confront him about it, but of course me being a coward I didn't and was worried about the consequences and I had too much anxiety to do that.

I talked to Tyler about it, who honestly is one of the coolest people I've met and he is such a nice and sympathetic person and told me that he thinks it's BS that Cameron treats me that way, and when I told him how I felt about it he agreed with me. Tyler in fact told me that Cameron sometimes goes up to Tyler when Tyler is talking to his friends while working and says ""If you got enough time to lean, you go enough time to clean"". Tyler however is not afraid of him and would call Cameron out on his hypocrisy, Cameron would be awkward and not know what to say. It was BS for Cameron to say that to Tyler, considering Tyler I would argue is probably the hardest working person in my department and he always is doing his work and only stands around and talks to others when he's not busy and has his work done. He always backs me up, he helps out with closing in a big way, and he doesn't boss people around like a jerk like Cameron does. He's basically the complete opposite of Cameron.

Whenever Cameron helped me with customers when it got really busy (Which was rare, he'd only do it because our deli manager would demand him to do it, she hated his guts like I do), he would shove me out the way of the printer constantly so he can print the item for another customer he was serving, and him being really overweight I would feel the weight of his shove. I didn't take it too seriously, but when I think about it now it makes me mad. Also he made fun of my customer service constantly by mocking my voice. I'm almost always respectful and joyful towards customers, I'm a nice person and that's just how I am, also I enjoyed working here because I felt like a productive person again and felt like I had some sort of purpose again. But I would just laugh him off and give into his mocking by being myself, and his insults would fall flat. Also he would complain that I wasn't backing him up with customers (Very hypocritical as he often tries to avoid serving customers and rarely ever backs me up with customers when I back him up no problemo every time). I was on the other side taking care of other customers, so I couldn't take of the other customers on the other side as I don't have four arms. He even tried to come over to my side of the department to confront me about that, but then he saw one of his friends who we will call Jessica (who is a very cool person) his angry/tough tone declined. It was hilarious to watch lol, I laughed at him. It was like in cartoons when the character acts all tough, but when the other person stands up and towers over the character their tough tone starts to decline and become cowardly. That's basically what happened here. 

He was constantly pointing out that I do nothing, and he would even boss me around at bad times. I had a pizza shift, and I was overwhelmed with pizza orders and I had to fill up the pizza slice counter with new pizzas because they were running out. He asked me to fill up the cold counter with pizza dough, and me being passive of course I said ""Ok I will try to"". About half hour later, he asks me again in a annoyed tone, I just kind of respond with ""I'm sorry, I'll try to"" instead of telling him that I was busy, I know... I'm a coward. About an hour later the lunch rush died down, and I was able to have time to put out the new pizza doughs but I was so confused as to why he couldn't just do it, I get that he was putting orders away but he didn't look that busy and there wasn't many orders. As a form of revenge, I was stocking up soda cans and saw Cameron as usual standing around and talking to other co-workers and not doing ANY work. I told Tyler this, and he got mad and ran up to Cameron and did like a fake hop on him and walked away. I was dying of laughter, and Cameron looked at me with a mad face but he said nothing. I know you might think I don't like being told what to do, but I actually didn't mind my deli manager bossing me around, she was very reasonable and have me do one task at a time and she was strict but reasonable. However, when Cameron bossed me around he would be unreasonable and hypocritical.

Cameron was also often pretty cold, every time he was having a conversation with someone and I decided to participate in it, he would not let me into it and be like ""Don't worry about it"" or he would flat out tell me to ""Mind my own business"" or ""You're so nosy, f\*ck off\*. Nobody else in my department minded if I participated in their conversations, but clearly it bothered him (I know you might possibly side with him on this one, but it still hurt like I was being left out). He was also judgmental, he told me that my deodorant (I used AXE bar deodorant) made me smell like an old man, he would make fun of my speech patterns and the way I speak, he would also pretend to play dumb with me whenever I talked about a certain thing, he also said that I should see a doctor because I'm too ""Different"", and so on. He would also get uncomfortably close to me and make moaning sounds and even hug me too hard and in a creepy way. He would also often bother other co-workers a lot. If a co-worker walked past them he would make a silly comment towards them or even make fun of them, in particular his favourite target was my brother. 

Then I came up with the perfect plan, I knew my brother disliked Cameron a lot and my brother is WAY more assertive than me and he doesn't take crap from others, so I decided to feed Cameron insults to use on my brother that would get under his skin so my brother would call out Cameron on his BS. Cameron would call my brother ""Meatball"" a lot, and then one day my brother had it with Cameron, he told Cameron straight to his face ""Stop talking to me like I'm your friend, I'm not your friend, your jokes are unfunny, you're a cringy 30 year old balding obese guy working a dead end job for 10+ years without a real promotion and wasted your time and money on a useless degree, you're annoying and embarrassing as hell, and you're a rat (Cameron told the manager that my brother went for a break longer than he's allowed, Cameron keep in mind is also a rebellious type who is anti-snitching), so please don't talk to me"". Cameron went silent, and looked so embarrassed, everybody's jaws were on the floor and my brother walked away casually. I was thinking in my head, ""I wish I was as confident as my brother and didn't take crap from others"". 

I was just so passive and every time he bullied me I felt like I wanted to cry but also stand up for myself, but I had no courage to stand up to him because I felt I didn't know how to articulate myself properly and would be too scared to do it because of getting in trouble...

This may sound weird to bring up, but Cameron had watched the movie Joker (With Joaquin Phoenix) which came out back in October, I saw it too and I loved it, because I felt like it handled mental illness so well, was beautifully directed and written and acted, and I also felt like I saw a lot of myself in Arthur Fleck, I felt so bad for him in every aspect of the movie and I saw where he was coming from when he did do those vial acts. Cameron asked me if I saw the movie, I told him I did and said I thought it was great and also that it was a very dark and sad movie. I felt in the inside that him seeing this movie might open his eyes to mental illness and might be a wake up call for him to not pick on me, when in reality he still continued his behaviour towards me.

Months went on with Cameron's antics, until he went on vacation. Then I heard possibly the best news: that Cameron was getting transferred to a different store. I pretended to act sad about that, when in the inside I was having a celebration mentally. Surprisingly (Honestly, not surprisingly) he didn't tell me this news directly I heard it from co-workers and when I brought it up to Cameron that I heard he was leaving, he looked at me with a shy look and his friend Emily explained that he was indeed leaving. The transfer happened and Cameron was gone. I felt so happy about it and talked to other co-workers about it, and they told said some negative things about him. I wasn't completely surprised, but at the same time I didn't really completely know for sure their stance on him. So I agreed with them and basically told them everything I've explained to you all so far. The store manager was very laid back and not very strict at all, he let Cameron get away with a lot. My deli manager on the other hand HATED him, she bossed him around a lot and called him out on his BS. Unfortunately, he still continued his behaviour.

Emily who got promoted to full time developed a good relationship with me, at first she kind of made fun of me but she started to dig me and we've grown a pretty decent relationship. However, one day she had brought up the idea of going to a cottage to spend time with me, her and the Seafood manager who we will call Joe. That sounded fun and I was actually interested in going, until... she said that Cameron would be coming, I told her I'd think about it. I talked to Joe about how I didn't want to go because of Cameron going because of the stuff explained, Joe agreed with me and he felt the same way about Cameron and said he wouldn't come either. So the next day Emily asks me if I'm down with going to the cottage, I said I'd still think about it. Then out of the blue, she told me that she had a feeling it's because of Cameron. I was surprised she heard this, she NEVER knew about how I really felt about Cameron, and it seemed like Joe told her, so cat was out of the bag and I told her ""Yup"". And surprisingly she agreed with me, which shocked me because she's best friends with Cameron. She told me that ""You're right, I agree with you. If Cameron came, he would ruin all the fun and be annoying"". I agreed with her, and then the next day she was talking crap about Cameron saying that he's really annoying and not respectful of her time. She said he would call her during work and ask stupid questions like ""What are you doing girl?"" in a flirtatious way and she would respond with ""At work, what do you think?"". She also told me at the other store that Cameron currently works at, he's on with the same antics he had here, and apparently his co-workers there hate his guts and the managers there don't tolerate him. It kind of shocked me that she was talking crap about someone who didn't seem like she had any problems with whatsoever they are basically like a Yin and a Yang.

# Now we get to the fight (Which happened 2 months ago as of writing this post):

So one day I was talking to one of my co-workers who we will call Tiffany, she brought up Cameron and said some nice things about her. I flat out told her that I hated him, and all the reasons I stated. She laughed in disbelief, but guess what I didn't know? Tiffany was actually best friends with Cameron, and I didn't know... they hung out outside of work and such. So she told Cameron what I said about him. 

Then one day I get phone calls from Cameron, which I of course ignore. He then tried to call the department through our phone and one of my other co-workers picked up and she backed me up telling him that I was on break. Cameron then tried texting me, and I responded which obviously led to an argument. I won't go into extreme detail and as to what was said but basically I told him how I felt about him and brought up the stuff he did to me, he called me an ""Idiot"" ""Loser"" so many times, insulted how I smell again saying I don't bathe (Which is not true), saying that people in the department were talking crap about me (Which I responded with saying that I was there to work and support myself, my mom and my brother, who had quit exactly a year before, and that I couldn't care less what co-workers were saying about me) also bringing up that he was fed with a silver spoon in his mouth by his parents but I have to work hard to support my family, he also tried to give me advice telling me to ""Worry about myself"" and ""Think for myself"", and I used that against him by saying he should worry about himself instead of worrying about what I'm saying about him, he also told me to ""Man up"" and say it to his face instead (Not knowing I have anxiety), we go back and forth a bit until I got mad I said something that tipped over the edge and I will admit was probably not the nicest thing to say to someone. I told him that he was a ""Result of bad parenting, but I'm sure your parents are nice people"" and he got pissed saying that he was gonna come there to ""Deal with me"". So that was that.

I had finished my shift, it was evening time. I left the building, but as I was on my way to the street I spotted from far away a Black Dodge Caravan stopped on the side of the street. I knew that was him, since that was the car he drove, and I'm not gonna lie I started to shake not expecting that he'd come all the way here. So I decided to try to use the other way by going all around, but unfortunately he cuts me off on the other side too. I try to walk away, and I'm looking at the reflection of the restaurant glass of the Caravan getting closer to me, I decide to turn to look at the car to see that it's Cameron on the driver side, with Emily on the passenger side. He looks at me with a serious look and says ""Yo you wanna talk?"" and I responded with a smile ""Sure"". So Cameron parks his car to the side, gets out of the car walks up to me, comes up to my face and immediately starts with ""Why are you talking shit about me? You f\*cking loser, you f\*cking idiot!"" and I respond with ""Because I stand by everything I said about you"" and he continues with the ""Idiot"" ""Loser"" I was smiling trying to keep my composure, but I was shaking, scared, my heart was racing. He threatened he'd spit on my face, then I told him he would get charged with assault and then he responded with ""I DON'T GIVE A F\*CK"" and I said I'd call the police on him and he said ""Go ahead, I don't give a f\*ck idiot"" I called him a loser back, but he laughed and said ""Honey, I was fed a silver spoon"", and then said I talked crap about his mom, which was out of context and not exactly true, and I told him ""That's not true"" and he said ""It is, I have the F\*cking texts"". I told him that what I said was that his upbringing is why he is this mess, and then he responds with ""At least my parents raised me"", which pissed me off and I threatened that he would be dead, and then he responds with ""Is that a f\*cking threat?"" and then repeats it three times to me, and I told him ""I'm warning you, you'll be dead"". So he went on with the insults again, then I got fed up and pushed him. He threw cigarette on the floor and started trying to lunge at me and grab my face and he threw a few punches to my head, as he was trying to hit me, I threw so many hard punches to his cheek, before the fight could get any worse a police officer intervenes, he asks what's going on and I told him that Cameron started assaulting me, the officer asks why and I told him that it was stupid drama on the phone. Cameron lies to the officer and said that he works here and was coming to visit and that I all of a sudden started harassing him, the officer believes Cameron and tells me to get out of the area. Before I walked away Cameron told me ""If I ever hear my name being talked about in a negative way again, I'm gonna be rolling up and down these streets"". Emily who is on the passenger side was just looking at me laughing during this whole fight, I looked at her and said ""We're not friends anymore"" (Which I reversed my decision with her later on, since I didn't want another enemy at work). So I walked away, and I tried to convince the officer that Cameron was lying, but officer was very mean and told me to ""f\*ck off and get a job"" but I showed him proof that I work here by showing him my badge, he then responds with ""Some example you're setting"". I gave up trying to convince the officer, and walked home. When I came home I broke down and cried to my mom, I didn't tell her what happened, but I told her I loved her and I will take care of you the best I can. I told my brother what happened, he was surprised and he told me not to be scared of him and that he is really just a ""Loser"".

News spread of this happening, I explained what happened with my co-workers. Most of them praised me (Including Emily who said she was proud of me for standing up for myself), some of them said I should've ignored him, others said I should've sent the texts to the police. I didn't go with police because I felt that this situation didn't warrant it and that it would be too much legal work financially and I don't think I'm smart enough to give my side of the story.

Regardless, I feel so much anxiety since this happened. I feel anxious every time I'm outside that I might bump into him (Even though he lives farther away from me), every time I see Black Dodge Caravans I keep worrying it might be him, I also keep imagining what I should've said to him by talking to myself, also I've been admittedly getting violent thoughts about this because the way I physically hit him was me not unleashing my real anger, I keep imagining wanting to beat him to a pulp or even kill him. I imagine the scene from Joker where (SPOILER) Arthur brutally murders Randall, and I keep imagining myself doing that to Cameron. I know it sounds scary, but this is what I've been dealing with mentally every day since the fight, and I don't know who to talk to about this...

So my question I pose to you, how do I stop the anxious thoughts, the fear, the violent thoughts, everything. How do I move on past this?",01Jun2020,1

359,"This is gonna be a long one, sorry. 

I'm 24, my girlfriend is 22 and her sister is 26, and she's nuts. I've been living at her house with her mum and sister as I was visiting when lockdown started.

Her sister has a serious problem with sharing her family, her mum and dad split up when she was a kid, and since then she's been sabotaging relationships. The dad wanted to get back with the mum after they broke up, but the mum wasn't having it, so the sister would go round to the dad's house and fill his head with false hope that she wanted him back, she didn't. It got messy..

Fast forward a few years, the mum and dad are in various seperate relationships, the sister always sabotages them, acts so difficult and nasty that the new partner leaves, citing her as the reason. Always telling the new partners ""this is my house not yours, and you'll never be my mum/dad."".. Making false claims that the new partner was abusing her, giving herself bruises and blaming them. Basically scaring them away. 

So anyway we've got this nightmare girl that sabotages relationships and is generally a crazy person. Enter me, I met my girlfriend online we spoke for a few months before even meeting, then I start going to her house regularly. The sister immediately hates me for ""stealing her sister"", spending too much time with me and not her. Every time I was to go round she'd lock herself in her bedroom miserable.. Crying and pulling her hair out and randomly screaming and hitting things.. Bare in mind she's an attractive 26 year old girl who would seem totally normal if you met her in public.

One time she lied to her mum and dad saying I was being horrible to my gf, calling her fat and not letting her eat, which they questioned me about, prefacing it with ""listen, we know she lies, and we know you wouldn't do this, but we have to ask.. "" of course I didn't (it was still awkward though), and the gf went mad saying I'd never say that.. (I'm close with the parents and I'm great to my gf, both parents think I'm great)

When my gf makes a comment about me and her eventually moving out together, the sister literally says she's gonna kill herself, my gf is too scared to move out with me incase she does. She makes flippant remarks about suicide at every minor inconvenience 

She's so attached to her family it's crazy, she even hates all my girlfriends/her mums/her dads friends, she cuddles with her dad, calls him daddy and kisses him on the lips, she seriously acts and talks like a little girl around him and she's 26, it's all just very strange. Whenever I'm round she's making nasty comments downstairs I can hear her saying ""ugh is he still here"" and ""whens he going home"" and just doing petty things, like when we went on holiday 6 months ago with me, the gf, gf sister, their mum and dad and 2 friends. She went in one of those seaside shops and bought a bunch of friendship bracelets, gave them to everyone but me. Just really stupid childish petty shit. I'm sick of being made to feel not welcome, she tries to cause arguments between me and my gf, and when that failed she even lied her way to try and turn my parents against hers. It failed too. why can't she just be happy her sister has found someone that makes her happy? She's not gonna break us up and she needs to give up. I'm sick of it.

363,"Throughout my life I found myself always having day dreams about my future. When I was young I wanted to be a cop. So much so that I joined the youth police program our department had. Met cool people and hung around cops and made friends as well as had fun activities. My anxiety disorder eventually stopped that dream of becoming a cop from ever panning out though, and my horrible athleticism lol! Then I wanted to become a paramedic. I took a job in the medical field while also working to be accepted to our states only EMT program. Turns out I had made it in thanks to my slight experience in the field. I would day dream about being an awesome medic etc. and making it my career. Then the classes started and I couldn't keep up and my social anxiety just got in the way as well. I ended up dropping out to much surprise of my classmates. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward many years later and I am studying psychology with a dream of becoming a licensed therapist to help others with anxiety and ocd. This dream has been lasting awhile now because of attaining the degree. However, I need a masters to get licensed. I also have had a big interest in Sweden. Their music is amazing to me and their country in general. So my goal/dream as of recently is to study abroad for my masters. I looked into various schools there and looked for English taught degrees. I contacted a bunch of schools and came into contact with someone that did what I want to do and gave me tips. 

However, this is only one university that seems to offer the degree. Daydreaming about this seems too dangerous. Chances are I won't get accepted, I won't have the money to go (I have a LOT of credit and student debt) not to mention that I also daydream about meeting a girl down there and perhaps getting married or living together down there so I could become a citizen. YET I am 25, chubby as hell, never went on a date, socially anxious, awkward, only now learning their language to help me understand their music, and I have never visited the country before. I also still live with parents because cost of living in my state is astronomical unless you have a significant other or make bank. I am also knowing that my parents don't even know my goal/dream to study there. They only know I want to visit which is what I want to do next year to check out first. 

What I am doing is  finishing my last year for my bachelors while also working 7 days a week (still only 40hrs/week as I am a Behavior Therapist for children with Autism) to pay down my debts. Sweden is in my mind and keeping me motivated to keep going.

Needless to say, I feel super delusional about dreaming about living in Sweden, especially marrying someone there. Hell, I even sometimes daydream about a girl on insta who is married and lives in Sweden...like, that can't be healthy. I even caught myself daydreaming about driving around friends and family from the states to show them Sweden and my house there etc. All of this in my head as I drive to and from work, blasting my favorite Swedish music.

TLDR; I daydream that I will study abroad in a country I have never visited for 2 years to get a masters degree, afford to pay for it, make friends, get a girlfriend/marry there, have a wedding down there showing off the country to friends and family, speaking fluently, despite it seeming that It will never happen.",01Jun2020,1

Im 18 and he is 18 in a month and we know each other cuz we are in the same class in high school. I met him 2 years ago. We are rly good friends like rly comfortable around each other and have the same laid back vibe. We are into the same things and have a lot in common. But we never ever hung out. Only to go to the gym together after school but thats it. Also he calls me everyday since the day we became friends. But apparently he does that to all his friends (he lives alone so feels alone a lot). At some point in our relationship I felt like he treats me as one of the guys. But recently since quarantine, he gives me mixed signals. Like sends me pick up line memes but when I ask if he is serious, he says ""hell naaaah"". Also when I asked him to explain his recent weird behavior, he says he is like that to all his girl friends (which I dont rly believe) and then he asked me out, i said yes to which he told me it was a joke, which hurt.

I really really like him but I dont show it much. Anyways we are both moving to different countries after the summer and Im very sad about that. I will really really miss him. Im lost. I dont think he likes me the way i like him and im scared to ruin our friendship cuz we might visit each other in the future and i dont want it to be weird. Recently our entire class met and we had to sign or write smthg on each other's hat. If ur rly gd friends, u tend to write inside jokes or such. He only writes his name with a smiley face on my hat. So I do the same to him. I just feel that was so inconsiderate of him. After that, he dares ask me to buy him and his friend a beer (18 age limit) which I do cuz im nice and like him. Also, we talked recently on the phone, we talked shit about a couple in our class and he said smthg along the lines of ""i dont believe in relationships in our age right now... if they are meant to be together then they will cross paths later in life again"".

Anyways, I will see him on the 12th june cuz we are having our graduation. Should I confess to him then? Or not and just say I will miss him (so that i dont ruin our friendship)?",01Jun2020,1
365,"Hey, I’m 14F and autistic (I’m only mentioning this because we emote differently by default but idk how exactly) and this has been going through my head for a while. I have a short temper, and although it’s slowly mellowing out, I still have issues from time to time. How much is hormones, personality or my general behavioral issues I have no clue. 

Whenever I fight with my parents over some dumb shit, I end up going to my room and ranting to myself for a while, sometimes even ending up making myself cry (yes this is stupid I know). Or sometimes when they yell at me, I end up crying. Again, over dumb shit, I’m quite privileged and a bit sheltered. 

The thing is, I never cry at movies (ok, I’ve cried ,like tears-falling-down crying, at two) or books or songs or anything like that, and not even serious life events. Again, sheltered, but when my stepmom had to put her dog of 15 years down, I just had what I can only describe as a vague aching between my eyes and my cheekbones in place of tears. Maybe it’s because I never liked the dog, but even seeing her an emotional mess never got to me that bad. The most I’ve felt is this sense of emptiness when I think of it, the idea that it’s now a lifeless body or pile of ashes, same as I feel after a celebrity I know only a little about (like Juice WRLD, may he r.i.p.) dies. I asked my dad about this and he said it was normal not to cry at this, but the thing is this distance just feels so prevalent. The days and weeks and months bleed into each other easier and easier with each passing year, even before quarantine. I so often sit on the sidelines (oh yeah I have basically no friends *shock*) or waste my time doing nothing, no ups, no downs, nothing.

Well, that last one was half true. 

While my sadness, anger and anxiousness (we’ll get back to that one) are completely out of order, my sense of happiness and excitement seems to be at least a bit normal. I wanted to go over this quickly to make sure y’all know. Being 14, I do a lot of the wonderfully embarrassing process known as fangirling: celeb crushes, smiling for no reason other than because someone I like is singing on a song. I also seem to have an actual sense of humor, so that’s nice (but I can't tell you the amount of times that I've laughed at my own jokes because I suck like that). I’m not amazing at expressing it, but I can assure you this isn’t where the problem is.

Anyways, back to anxiousness. The first sign of any of this I noticed was my distinct lack of stage fright. I might have felt the jelly knees and oh-shit-I’m-gonna-fuck-up only once or twice, and it wasn’t crippling. Similar thing with tests and stuff. No, what I get anxious over is social interactions! Oh, also I’m terrified of the idea of going to high school, but that’s a slow burn sort of terrifying. I’ve had to have my stepmom join me to ask my (Not scary) next door neighbor to borrow a tennis ball for a homework assignment. Yeah. Or when I had to (I think) make a video for my grandparents (who I’m not close to) in a restaurant, I thought it was weird and the person I was with didn’t think so at all.

I ask myself why is it me? Why is it me experiencing these things? Why do I interpret the world through my eyes, why not someone else’s? It’s just this sense of hyper-awareness. It makes me feel anxious and uncomfortable and I have a hard time sleeping because of it. 

Honestly, it all leads to me thinking about suicide. I wouldn’t do it because I’m depressed, I would do it to just satisfy my curiosity. It’s the biggest unknowable, unanswerable question. And it is so alluring, seeing what lies after. And doing so will answer my questions of why me. Doing so will prove that everything I believe in is right, or prove that I simply am a secular being, just the latest iteration of the human computer, who was fed information to trick it into thinking that it wasn’t alone.

There are what you can call higher positions in the planning committee and lower positions, making it a chain so that first year students must first be staff members, then they can apply for a lower position in the committee, finally being able to apply for a higher position once they reach their final year in school. This is not a made up rule as it was written in the application forms from previous years.

Now, last year I got one of the lower positions in the committee, which was fine considering the following year me, along with the other low position members, would be eligible for the highest position. I don’t want to sound entitled at all, but I really did work my ass off last year to get the teachers to notice my effort and interest as the convention leader, and I even got hyped up by the former high positions who told me I was one of the candidates to run the event the following year. I gave my 150% in every task I was given, and always made sure to follow instructions and volunteer for work other people didn’t want to do so that they could see my dedication with this whole thing; so by the end of last year I was pretty sure I would at least be taken into consideration for the position.

As soon as I was told the convention wasn’t going to be cancelled due to covid-19 i applied once again and did an interview but didn’t get the position I wanted. This really made me feel insecure about myself as I tend to think that maybe I am not enough for it and people saw that; however as a good loser I sucked it up, and accepted the position offered to me because I knew that some of my fellow members of the last year committee were pretty good options as well. Today I was found out that by some reason there was a bending in the rules and a second year student was getting the leading position even if she hadn’t been in the committee before. Now this made me real angry since it tells me that all my dedication and effort were completely ignored as well as those of my last year committee partners (who some didn’t get offered any position at all). I’m not one to undermine people due to their age, however it does bother me how this girl get to skip a step in the process and take the position from all of us who worked and have the experience of running things (not saying this is her fault as she didn’t choose herself). This event’s preparation is divided between 4 schools, and unfortunately this girl is from mine so I wouldn’t have any control on any decision, as she would take all responsibilities inside or part of the planning. In the position I got I would basically do all the same work I did last year with the exception of now getting to stand closer to the center of the oficial picture taken, and being bossed around by her directly rather than from someone else.

I know it sounds like I really don’t like the event but it is fun, I had an amazing time last year, and it is a great curricular for college; still  I am pretty pissed that the teachers literally preferred to have someone completely lacking of experience being the leader rather than any of the other four options. I don’t know if I should stay on the working team considering the mistreatment and disrespect of me and the rest who worked hard for that spot. I know it is impossible for them to take the position away from her as that would be rude, but I would still appreciate advice on what to do and if I should leave or not.

378," 

Its been a while since the fact but I can't stop feeling disgusted at myself. I (23M) live in a small flat and I have this (21F) neighbour that have a bf (22M). We became friends quickly after I moved in.

One day, around 4 a.m, the bf, drunk af, starts banging on gf's door but she was at her parents home for the weekend, so I open my door, help him  sit on couch, give him water, clean shirt and some fresh sheets. Inside my flat was warm, so he refused to wear the shirt and just removed his own.

I am a bisexual guy and never hid that I think he's hot. We used to joke about having a threesome, but never more than a joke between friends. When I was about to go back to my room, he says that wants to thank me and hugs me. Ok, a friendly hug. But I noticed he had a boner, not gonna lie, it felt good and also wrong. I let go of the hug and start walking back to my room but he holds my arm and kisses me. Long story short, we ended up having sex.

The awkwardness was thick in the next morning so he left without saying anything more than thanks. This by itself already made me feel extremely bad, but a couple days later the gf came to my apartment and told me that he told her that I had molested him. I denied and told her my version of the facts. She was angry and sad and we never spoke again.

But since this happened I read about a lot of people that were abused/molested when drunk/asleep. I don't see any similarities between the abusers and me but still feel like shit. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",01Jun2020,1

382,"Pregnancy Scare Help Requested

Me and my girlfriend had unprotected sex on Thursday (5/21). She is on the combo pill and doesn’t always take it the same time every day, but is always within about a 2-3 hour range every day. On Saturday night (5/23) she had some spotting that she’s never experienced before which had us both a little nervous. She took plan B on that Saturday (approx 50 hours after). 

She keeps telling me how worried she is because her period tracking app says that she would have been ovulating on the Thursday we had sex and so she thinks she might be pregnant. She’s planning on taking a pregnancy test on Tuesday morning (6/2). 

As a guy, admittedly I’m not as educated on all of this as I probably should be. Just wondering before she takes the test, how worried I should really be?

384,"On August I met a girl on an organized trip. I really liked her, and if I’m good at understanding girls’ signals (which I’m not), she liked me as well. She’s absolutely perfect. One of those you find once a lifetime. We were both with our families, and luckily we got to know each other and become friends, sort of. When we got home from the trip, since we found out we weren’t living too far apart, we decided to meet again. First we went to their home, then they came to ours. Honestly, I must say I’m very socially awkward, but in any case I managed to not act like an idiot (I hope, at least). I may have been quiet, but I can say we’ve all had a great time together. I followed her on IG, she followed me back. I liked some of her new posts (I was too afraid to dig into her older posts) and so did she. She even added me as a close friend (I got the green circle around her story once) and she (or someone of her family) sent me a request from the account of their farmhouse and liked a couple of my older posts. I didn’t know how to act, since I very rarely post anything, and I realized I made the stupidest thing I could do. I never wrote her, never reacted to any of her stories (except one) and never got to interact with her as much as I wanted to. They invited us once again, but quarantine got on the way and we couldn’t possibly see each other for around 3 months. The fact is, she has now a boyfriend. I did some research through her stories and found out his name. This situation is making me feel very depressed lately, and I just can’t handle the idea that I MAY have been is his spot instead. My question is: should I send her an anonymous message on IG revealing my love for her? A side of me would never want to risk to break any relationship with her, not even friendship (that’s why I wouldn’t use my regular account). On the other side, I would really want her to know how I feel about her, and let her know I’ve always been really into her, even though it may have not looked like I was. I’m not expecting to become her new boyfriend, of course, but I just want to let her know. Please help me, I really feel like I’m going to get a mental breakdown. Also, don’t tell me to forget her and move on, because I’m 20 and I assure you she is nothing like any other girl I’ve ever met before.",01Jun2020,1

386,"TL;DR: the title. 

I'll try to make it short. But I this all is happening now and I can't sleep. 

My grandpa lives with my aunt a couple thousand miles away from my mother. They decided to fly him out to stay with my mother for two weeks while my aunt took a road trip. Basically, so someone could watch him. 

My grandpa just had skin cancer surgery, less than a month ago and hasn't fully recovered. He's always been active, but since the surgery, his health has been deteriorating and hes lost some of his mental faculties. Not an invalent*, just less than what he was. 

I found out he was coming into town a few days before he was scheduled to fly out. When I did find out, I immediately called my mother and begged her to not fly him here. He is high risk, he's old, been sick, and he should not be flying. Definitely not right now. But if he does come out, I will not be coming to see him, I have an 18 month old baby at home.

(We haven't been to see my mother since lock down began, besides just me dropping off groceries, since I don't want her to shop for herself, so she.. understands lockdown.) 

Man. I had tears in my eyes and begged her. 

She was immediately dismissive and kept telling me, ""We all have to go some time, "" and ""What can I do? They already bought the tickets.""

My grandpa just got in to town, less than 48 hours ago. When he got off the plane, my mother said he had slurred speech, and was not acting like himself. He fell twice. My mother called this afternoon telling me she was following the ambulance to the hospital.  

Come to find out, he had a blood clot and pneumonia but no Covid symptoms. The doctors told my mother he does have Covid and now he is in the hospital hallway waiting for a room in the ICU. And since the pandemic, no one is allowed to be with him. Last I heard, they had sedated him. 

So, my mother calls me after leaving the hospital, crying, telling me everything the doctors told her, and I immediately cut her off, and with a heartbreaking compliancy, I told her off. (May not be the right words, but I basically told her this would happen and hung up on her.) 

My spouse has been in contact with my mother all day and relaying the ""updates"" to me, but I have yet to speak to her directly. 

I doubt I will for a while. 

Now my mother has to be in self quarantine for two weeks and probably has Covid too. Im sure my aunt has it, but I highly doubt she would even get tested, less to interfere with her vacation. 

This came out of left field and I am completely lost. I want to talk to the rest of the family about this, but.. black sheep and all. I'm afraid it will just end with ""sending prayers"".. 

One last note:
Im in my mid 30s, left home when I was young. Have not had a relationship with my parents since Ive been an adult and only recently had them back in my life since my daughter was born. We've made progress as a family with our issues during the past year, but I feel like this betrayal of family trust can not go without a response. 

What do I do? Call her out? Let it go? Call the airlines? Go wait in the hospital waiting room? Am I focusing on the wrong part of all of this? I am so scared my grandpa is going to die alone in the hospital.

388,"Here's the thing. Mental disorders are not a choice. It's a dysfunction of the brain. It means your brain produces hormones in such excess that if left uncheck the YOU are no longer in control of your actions and you can only watch as shit happens around you, while you're a passenger just dragged along for a ride in the car that is your body.

Yes, we need to be more aware of each other. Yes, we need to make sure that it never gets this far and that we treat the disorder in a healthy and effective manner. Yes, you shouldn't be a dick. And I agree, there are those who uses their disorders as an excuse to be dicks. These people are assholes and deserve a kick in the balls.

Yes, if you hurt anyone emotionally or physically, during an out of control episode, you must take responsibility and do whatever is necessary to fix the mess you made, even if that means jail time.

But to anyone who suggests that the mental disorder is something that can be easily controlled by the individual, I give you this challenge. Your position is that the patient is supposed to have full control over their actions and mind while the brain is pumping major amounts of hormones in their brain, causing them to lose control. You say that this loss of control is complete bullshit and made up by them. Here's the challenge. Hold in your urine indefinitely. That's it, prove you have control of your mind and body that you don't need to take a piss ever again. Sound stupid? Well that's how you sound when you say people with mental disorders must always be in control of their actions.",01Jun2020,1

391,"     As the title suggests, i’m in need of help. I was first recognized as “gifted” in 2nd grade, which is when i moved to the U.S from mexico. I came here not knowing a single word in english but i completely mastered communication with adults and nullified my accent in under a year with no teacher, just me naturally picking things up as i heard them. This shocked all of my teachers and family, and was soon recognized as a gifted kid.
     It’s been like this for a long time, i got good results by putting next to no effort into anything, and it felt good. I was full of myself for being good at my academics, sports, and a lot of other things, i even had a College level reading score during 5th grade. To be completely honest, it felt amazing. The next year came and i started middle school, it was close to the same but i started having a lot more self awareness and decided to stop floating and just relax. I relaxed a lot, too much. I barely passed my english class with a C- during the first trimester, as a perfectionist and overachiever i was overwhelmed. This was a big moment because i’d never gotten anything below an A, so i picked things up. I went back to my usual self and things went smoothly throughout the year. I was placed into honors classes during my 7th grade year and everything was close to the same as all the years before, to me it was all just a repetition of the previous years. Then 8th grade came. When i took my SBAC tests, i got a really high score so i placed into high school algebra. I thought it’d be the exact same as the last couple of years. Boy was i wrong. I fell behind, only getting a B in the first trimester and a C+ in the 2nd. I thought it was a fluke and didn’t change my ways. I probably should’ve mentioned this earlier but i’ve never studied for a test before now. Putting effort was a completely new thing to me and it was really tough, i still can’t completely put any effort because it’s a 2nd nature to me at this point to succeed without trying, and i hate it. I wish i’d been born without this and i was born normal. I hate not being able to put in effort. My happiness declines because i’m not getting the results i want, i feel hurt because i can’t put in effort to get results. I know what i’m doing but i can’t seem to stop it and i hate myself for it.

392,"Please read all of it, and I'm sorry for how long it might be. This is a throwaway because he knows my real account.

I met him on a video game forum and we started out playing games all night for a month, voice chatting, and texting a lot. We got on super duper well, and it's been maybe 2 months since we've been talking/playing every single day. We got really close. We even planned to meet up on a specific date and location in a year or so.

I made a lot of mistakes. He acts like this really, really nice guy but when he's horny or drunk, he changes entirely that it scares me. Before I knew that he is really scary, I sent him nudes a couple times. This was my biggest mistake. He's the same age as me, and we're a little underage. 

For 2 weeks or so, I refused to send him any. Whether it was saying I was super tired or I didn't feel like it, he always said that consent mattered and it was no problem and that he was sorry for asking. He always asks before he sends nudes to me, and I've been saying no lately. He usually never crosses the line except today. He crossed the line and sent me a nude even though I strictly said no. He also sends me explicit messages that sounds a bit rapey (his kink).

It's really scary that he knows my friends, location, full name, and pretty much my life. I wish I never let him know that much. Now I'm really scared that if I block him or something that he'll ruin my life by telling my friends or family that I sent nudes. And the embarrassing things I did in the moment that I thought I would never regret. 

I'm scared because I'm dependent on him to always talk to someone. And he's dependent on me. I'm worried for his mental health if I had just disappeared. I just noticed now that I'm always the one that ends up apologizing. My real life friends all hated this guy from the start and keep telling me that he is giving off red flags, and I feel like I see it now.

What do I do? I'm really stuck and I don't know where to go from here. It would really hurt to completely break friendships off with him because I've gotten so close to him. He's a completely good person when he's not horny. He's apologizing to me right now because I got mad that he sent me a dick pic without my consent.

395,"Hi redditors. Hopefully this is the right subforum. I am writing this to see if others have advice or experiences to share. Here I go.

I am in my twenties, and I used to love my life just five or six months ago. I was about to get my Master's, I hit the gym regularly, did beauty modeling, wrote books, roleplayed (DnD) and I was making plans for my future. 

My family has never been exactly supportive of my hobbies, they are the kind of people that are all about the career. I never neglected my duties and I worked my \*ss off to finish my studies and move out as soon as possible, so this was never an issue.

Just before coronavirus hit, I found a very good job opportunity abroad that was entirely in line with my career choices. Things were looking great. Then the virus hit and the job chance was postponed indefinitely due to borders closing.

Of course, I stopped with the gym and with the modeling, I lost all interest in writing, and the DnD group stopped meeting and never recovered (we still meet outside of the game since we are all friends though). I still do not have a job because I live in a terrible country job-wise that would rather not hire you if you are over 20 and I have no idea when I will be able to go abroad as planned initially.

The relationship with my family is incredibly strained. I keep sending CVs and applications for any position I can find, even unrelated to my field/not ideal, and I am sometimes told that I do not put enough effort in, as if I am responsible for the pandemic and I'm not getting hired on purpose. We had an argument the other day because I kept being treated like dog shit (for example, ordering me to do something instead of asking, when I have a history of complying with requests/chores around the house; I have never been a problematic guy in that regard) and I was told that they could stop giving me money at any time if I didn't behave. Now I avoid them around the house and I try to impact daily life as little as possible, I started buying my own groceries and doing my own laundry.

I am a guest in my house and it crushed me to realize how weak I am and how helpless I can be made regardless of my plans just because I don't want to take constant abuse.

At the same time, I am stuck in a disfunctional relationship with my girlfriend. It's not abusive by any means, I am just not as invested as she is, partially because I want to leave the country for good. She's a loving and caring person but I am just not at the same level as her. I am afraid to leave because I am a coward and I fear I will regret it. We do things together and we meet regularly, but sometimes it feels like we are friends. She notices and suffers for it, and I suffer to put her through this.

So here I am. I lost all interest in my hobbies (or I cannot resume them due to external reasons), my family life's well-being depends on me being treated like garbage, my relationship is all I never wanted, and my only true chance of turning a new leaf is blocked by the virus emergency and I have no idea what to do in the meantime, or if the situation will even unlock any time soon. I feel like my emotional drain has been clogged by a year of sh\*t going down it, and it just kept piling up from there.

Often I don't want to leave my bed even if I have stuff to do, and sometimes I do exactly that, because nothing I do really matters in the end.

Has anyone ever had a similar experience? How did you handle it? Did you pick up new interests, if so, how? I am open to all suggestions.

396,"I know I need actual therapy but I can't at the moment. 

To be perfectly blunt, I'm barely one step above hating myself most of the time, and I constantly believe everyone I interact with even for two seconds feels the same, including family. I've tried the ""fake it 'til you make it"" approach and just wind up hating myself more because it's just not genuine. I've been trying these dumb exercises I find on Pinterest and they only make me feel worse. ""Best compliment you've ever received? Your biggest skill or talent? Ten things you like about yourself?"" Yeah, I've got nothing.

As you can imagine, I'm pretty much crippled socially. I just freeze up in social situations, my mind is blank, and every social interaction I have usually leaves me kicking myself for being stupid and awkward. I really don't have anything to say most of the time. Maybe because I've been like this so long (basically my whole life) I've just trained myself to STFU and don't know how to snap out of it.

397,"I just feel like I need an unbiased 3rd party's opinion on this. In my personal life I have people on both sides of the aisle.

Obviously things are crazy worldwide right now and employment opportunities are bleak. I was lucky enough to keep my job in the pandemic but with everything going on in the world my job has been feeling more and more void of purpose and it's really been stressing me out internally. I really think I would like to go into a line of work with a more direct positive effect on the world but I don't even know what that sphere of industry looks like.

I have around $15000 saved up which by my calculations would last me about 7 months if I kept my expenses exactly the same, had absolutely zero income, and didn't use any credit cards (have a healthy line of credit available but obviously not a fun debt to carry around).

I just don't really know if my frustration with my work is warranted given the climate. It's not that I hate my job, it's just that I know it's not right for me and it feels like I'm depriving myself of purpose by not taking the leap despite not even really knowing what I would want to do.

So my question I suppose is: what lines of work are even available to someone who wants to help people more directly (or what jobs will be available post-quarantine) and what kind of specialization do they look for?

My follow up question is whether or not it's totally off-base to quit my job in the middle of the pandemic. All signs point to 'yes it's a dumb idea' but my mind is still finding a way to rationalize it to a certain extent so I would really appreciate input from people who have done something similar or been at a similar fork in the road.

My problem is, I hate my job, and unfortunately work takes up the majority of our lives and it’s just making me hate my life a bit.. 

I did all the standard stuff, did fairly well in school, left school and went to uni, got a degree in business that and graduated coming up 5 years ago now! Since then, I just don’t feel like I’ve known quite where I fit in society. I got a job right after my graduation, I was there for 6 weeks and then just got fired randomly one day.. I’m still not actually sure why, they didn’t really give a reason for it, this understandably knocked my confidence, and I wasn’t the most confident person to begin with! 

I was unemployed for 3 months and pretty desperate for a job so I took the first job I could get, which was working as a personal assistant within a fairly small financial consulting firm, the job was pretty boring and tbh there wasn’t a lot  for me to do but I was happy to have a job and the people weren’t so bad. I was there for just over 2 years, and then I decided it was time to move on and find a better paying job, which brings me to my current job. 

I’ve been at my current job now for just over 2 years, and I’ve pretty much hated it since day 1, my current job is as a personal assistant for an even smaller investment firm, there is me, my boss and a guy who is also above me who works closely with my boss. Reasons why I hate my job: 

1. I don’t enjoy being a personal assistant in general 

2. My boss is simply not a nice person (putting it politely) she often belittles me, she scolds me for the most trivial things, honestly I could talk all day about this but I won’t bore you with the details on this post! 

3. I have some responsibilities that I feel are ‘important’ to the business, but these don’t take up a lot of time each day, I feel that a lot of my role only exists because my boss is lazy. I.e make her tea, collect stuff from the printer, scan stuff for her etc. 

4. The company is so small, there’s nobody else here at my level and nobody that I can chat to or have any sort of human interaction with other than discussing work 

5. My pay is quite good, but there are no other benefits of any sort other than the minimum of what is required, I get the minimum amount of holidays that is required by law and I get a pension which is also required by law. This isn’t a major problem for me tbh but just when comparing to what other companies give, I don’t get much. 
 
For all these reasons and many more, I feel stuck. The last 5 years I have realised that I am not a particularly money motivated person, yes I need money, but what I mean is, it doesn’t  drive me or fulfill me. I need something that I feel gives me purpose/meaning and I currently just don’t have that. 

I thought by 25 (26 in 2 months!) I’d know what I wanted to do but I just don’t and I worry that I’ll never figure it out and will be stuck in my job or similar jobs for the rest of my life until I die and it just depresses me! 

Realistically, I know that 25 is young, I haven’t run out of time quite yet, there is room for me to move into other things or try out other things, but I just don’t know quite how to go about it.. 

Sorry for this long rambling post! I just needed to get it all off my chest! And if anybody has any advice, is in a similar situation or has been before, any advice would be greatly appreciated! 

Thank you!

Edit: I think another reason I’m feeling stuck, is obviously now with coronavirus I worry that there won’t be jobs I can get so I’ll literally be stuck in this one forever lol and 2. I have no idea how I can do interviews and work at this job, firstly, if it was a face to face interview, my boss likes me to go on lunch when she goes on lunch, which is at different times everyday, Its also not the done thing to ask for time off at short notice. Interviews are currently mostly being held via video conference, but this doesn’t really help the situation either D:",01Jun2020,1

401,"Hi guys, I need help. Warning, this is quite long and has lots of contributing factors. 

I (20F) applied for a hospital job back in March, I’m a student nurse and had been told by my advisor that because I’ve trained at the hospital I’m applying to that my application would go through quickly and I wouldn’t need an induction. 

I was hoping to start in April, maybe May. I’ve just been told that I can do my induction on July 6th or August 3rd - induction, weird right? Thought I didn’t have to do one... This induction is 5 days long for 9 hours a day. 

I currently live with my mum and sisters, we don’t get on that well but I’m not alone. 
I’m moving to a different city in September so can’t continue working then, I’m also going on holiday Sep 7-14 so would have to self-isolate for 2 weeks before going if I was working in the hospital. This is fine with me. 

If I took the July 6th induction, I could work for 5 weeks before having to self-isolate and leaving the job earning me about £1200 - some decent money!

I haven’t seen my boyfriend since the UK lockdown started, we’re planning to meet in my new rental July 4th (as soon as I’ve moved my stuff). This induction would interrupt our time together, after what would be 4 months apart. Due to then working in the hospital I couldn’t see him for the whole period of my employment and self-isolation after, a total of 8 weeks. If I take the job I wouldn’t bother meeting him for the 1/2 days before the induction as it’d probably be more upsetting to see him for a day then have to leave, than it would be to not see him at all.  

My dad and his partner have recently had my baby half-sister, we’re all very close. My working would mean I couldn’t see these guys either. I also couldn’t attend any meet ups my friends might have, I haven’t seen my friends since January when they left for university. 

I was hoping to start back in April, maybe May, as I’d been told I could start quickly, then I was planning to work through the lockdown and see my boyfriend and friends in July and August once restrictions lifted more. 

The job is just low level tech work, doing obs and cleaning, it doesn’t matter that I’d only be there 5 weeks. 

Do I take the job, earn £1200 for the 5 weeks but not see my partner for what would be 6 months (March-September), not see my dad’s family for 8+ weeks and attend no friend meets. 

I’m not desperate for money, but obviously any money is good, and moving in to a new place does have its costs. £1200 is still a lot of money, hence my indecision. 

Thanks all, stay safe!",01Jun2020,1
402,"Regardless of what it is, vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom, taking care of my 2 little siblings, etc. I’m always the one who does it, and I often get called lazy in my household, even though the majority of the time I’m the one doing a lot of things. Most of the things aren’t hard labor or anything, but just straight up annoying. Whenever my 2 little sisters want something, I’m always the one who ends up giving them what they want, even if I’m in my room in the other side of the house. We recently just got 2 parakeets, and I’m the one who takes care of them, when I didn’t even want them. If I don’t listen to them, then they threaten to take away my computer and probably get called lazy.

404,"hey everyone, so my boyfriend runs a small family business within the dmv area with just his mom, it’s a medical store that sells clothes, supplies, and equipment. not that it should matter but he’s a minority like me, i’m black and he’s middle eastern jew. he fully supports the protests that are going on, but he’s also been getting increasingly worried about the looting that’s been going on too.

i keep trying to tell him that the chances of his store getting looted may not be zero, but i think they’re slim considering it is a small business and it’s not like they’re selling actual prescription drugs or stuff people would really want to steal (like sneakers and designer items from stadium goods and all those luxury brands over in soho). but then again there’s also a MAJOR corporation AND a police station right by his store (did i add that his store is also where he lives? yeah so he could lose his home too, worse case scenario, so the argument that “insurance will cover it” doesn’t really work.)

he’s still really (justifiably) worried anyway and said he’s considering getting a gun for protection. i don’t want to tell him not to because i understand his reason for protection, but i also can’t help him because i live in nyc. i honestly don’t mind the looting as long as it’s only done to major corporations and luxury brands that clearly don’t care about the people or the cause we’re fighting for. i think small businesses, especially ones that are black-owned, should go untouched.

but anyway, does anyone have any suggestions on what he could do instead (or additionally) to protect his business &amp; home? any helpful advice will be much appreciated.",01Jun2020,1
405,"Hello everybody, first time visitor here. If this question isn't appropriate for this sub, I will remove it. 

Anyway, I am a 22-year old university student from Bosnia and Herzegovina and have always been living with my parents. My parents (my father, specifically) are dissatisfied with how I'm doing in school, and have threatened me with kicking out many times before. Last night, we had yet another fight, and my father told me he would think about letting me stay with them any longer. In the chance I do get kicked out, I'm pretty lost. I have absolutely no money, not even a single dollar. I have no place to stay. I have no possessions to my name. Any job I could possibly get with my qualifications would barely cover the rent, and I could probably scramble along for food, which leaves no space to pay for my studies. There are also no homeless shelters in my city, as far as I'm aware. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, since I am completely unprepared and lost. Thanks a lot in advance!",01Jun2020,1
406,"So in light of the current political atmosphere in the US, I was reading about both the largest protests in US history, and the death of George Floyd on Wikipedia (in that order). 

It was peculiar to me when I saw it, but I didn’t look into it- but when I was originally on the largest US protest page, at the bottom of the intro text was “2020 George Floyd.”

When I hit back to return to said original page later on after reading the about the George Floyd murder, I noticed that that single line of text had been removed. 

I thought to myself, “well that’s weird, but mildly expected. It seemed like an impromptu addition bound to be removed until the protests have concluded, so they can be quantified and placed on the list officially. I wonder if just anyone can edit these pages to add text?”

So out of curiosity, I hit edit, only to find [this.](https://i.imgur.com/PGoJa4y.jpg)

Again, weird, considering that I’d never registered as an editing user on Wikipedia, and had expected to be prompted to create an account. 

To me, it seems like that user was tracking this page or that page specifically, in order to block any IP address who had even visited these page from editing at all. 

**If that is the case then that should be of concern. **

Now, I wasn’t going to reinsert the line, or edit the page at all. I was solely curious, but now I’m blocked and frustrated by that fact. I think this is concerning, and I feel as though I should contact Wikipedia to inform them of this user, but I’m not seeing any outlet to do so through. 

Should I contact wiki? How could I do so, if that’s the case? Would my actions normally have warranted my being blocked?

I am 29 year old .since I am from India..  discussion of arranged marriage is happening.. I have an engineering background .. but what I wanna do and what I am doing as job is nothing to do with the degree I have...and I am happy with what I am doing .. as matter of fact I earn more than what some are earning while working 9am to 5pm (or more ) jobs in their core fields. but whether its family or friends ( except few friends).. majority considers me jobless as in their eyes it's not a fancy braggable job.. they consider what do is like a hobby  and they make me feel  worthless .. as per them even if I bring 1 usd by working 24 x 7 is more valuable than these non fancy jobs  .recently got a another arranged marriage proposal.. she also had same opinion like I should be working in engineering core field ..what ever I do outside is waste .. 

Since majority around me is reacting the same..I am clearly wondering which one is really important  

Social status   or money plus enjoying life 

. Is it hard for people to see and love others without being judgemental ..love you for what you are instead of what you will become or something they want you to be

421,"This sentence resonates with me deeply. The current times makes me feel very isolated, I haven't seen my buddies in months and surely I can't talk about another quarantine 'what I cook today' sessions, because seriously after a few months and circulating between cooking mackerel or long fish tuna is better with certain type of rice dish, I wouldn't be surprised that once the Covid subsides, my friends and I would  already be sporting tails and long whiskers! Meow! 

So I resorted to reddit to try my luck. Surely there have got to be other loners like me dipping their toes in this virtual pool because all the stores have ran out of Wilsons. ;)

So I met this redditor for purely platonic conversations which has hit month 2. A feat for me who has the attention span of a fruitfly. Of course there are others, but because this person is from the early days.. I unfortunately find myself in a codependent state  with this person. A state I am fully aware I'm in and I can't wait to get out.

I wouldn't say, this person is great, I would describe him as a more of an eccentric person. That he is an outlier among my scatter plot of friends and I orbit around him because I find him fascinating... At first.

Unfortunately, things just fizzled out. And I felt dejected. The optimistic fool in me wants to believe that he is too polite to say 'you're overwhelmingly boring', and chose to bow out silently. The same fool also tells me that who says it has to take two to tango, its 2020, just go for it. So I went for it, start all the conversations that he replied succinctly.

Until a point where I do feel my fingers resisting to type anymore, I could feel the blood rushing to my face 😔 everytime I made an attempt to talk to him.
Maybe it is the solitude that lead to this, that every friend found, is precious.. For now my heart is in Takotsubo syndrome...and I wish somebody would just encourage me to resist and just let bygones be bygones. Its all in the head.",01Jun2020,1
422,"I don’t really know how to introduce this well, but here we go... 

Hi. My name is James, and on 25 August, I will be turning 19 and I will be entering the final part of my teenage years. I live in the UK, and I also get stressed and worried about so much to the point that I am just sick and tired of my mental state. Let me explain. 

I can get worried about anything. “Do I still have my train ticket? I can’t get home if I have lost it”. “Am I 100% certain that the date and time that’s in my head for this important appointment is correct?”. “Have I filled this form out correctly?”. These are very small, inconvenient things, but they make me panic nonetheless. Maybe you would like to say this is paranoia, and that’s ok. We’re allowed to disagree, but this is obviously written from my point of view. 

Then we move up a stage. I remember in school, hearing the words “part of your final grade will be made up of your presentation skills...” and my mind just instantly tuned out. Whatever the rest of the sentence was just went in one ear and out the other as the worry started turning inside my brain. I think this is a common one, much like that sensation you get before going into a hospital or sat outside waiting for a job interview. I cannot cope, and I need to fidget out of habit to get my brain to slow down and focus. I also need to mentally prepare myself to call up customer services for the bank if I can’t email or use the computer, and don’t even get me started on asking another human being for help. I can and have done it, but it was not easy. People say “things get easier with practice”, but I would say that is not true. 

I would like to point out that I don’t believe I have social anxiety (as in, I’ve never been tested and so therefore I don’t want to go and self diagnose myself - I don’t want to pull a Trisha Paytas who seems to be both male and female as well as being straight, bi and also a lesbian. Basically where I am intending to go with this is I don’t want to just flippantly throw a term around because I can imagine some people won’t be happy with me doing that and I don’t want to cause stress and upset). 

I would say the epitome of my stress and worry (and this is the part that has a few layers that also has the most negative impact on my mental well being) is when I think about my sexuality and the sex work industry. I feel that the relationship I have with my sexuality (which is muddy) has affected the way I look at sex work and the people involved in that world. Let’s discuss.

I am sexually confused. Like I said earlier, I am going to be 19 in just over two months from the day I am writing this, and I have never (I hate when this word gets used incorrectly, but I mean literally never) felt any type of sexual attraction. I don’t know if I am attracted to boys or girls (you may notice here I didn’t use labels - I don’t fuck with labels because I’d rather just go out and live my life). As a result of my head being all over the place, when I see people who are professionally being horny and sexual all over the internet or in person, my skin crawls because I myself haven’t experienced that. My libido is so low it could almost be virtually inexistent. Don’t get me wrong, I have looked at and watched porn before (boy with girl and two boys together) but it just didn’t do very much. I masturbated to it, but I feel it was more a physical thing and not a “I like what I’m watching” thing, if that makes sense. 

I am all for people doing what they want with their lives. Make money selling your body to random people if that’s what you want, but it’s not for me. In my opinion (again, MY opinion) money and sex should never go together. Even if I was more horny and sexual, I don’t think I would have sex with just anyone. If you want to have sex outside of a relationship, that’s great, but the way I see it, you should get to know that person and build up some sort of a rapport with them before you even get to the topic of “intimate cuddling”. The concept of a one night stand upsets me is what I am essentially trying to say. The sex I have is for me and that person (I will say now this hypothetical person could be male or female). Filming it, putting it on the internet, and then charging people to see it ruins the moment for me, and this is coming from someone who only lost his virginity in February of 2020 to someone who was definitely the wrong person. I was so annoyed and angry that I still had my plates so to speak, so when the opportunity presented itself, I took it without a second thought. I know I am asking for advice, but if you are reading this and you are younger than me, the best advice I can give you (and I am passionate about this) is please don’t feel ashamed about your virginity. Your virginity is yours, and so you’ll lose it only when you feel ready to. I have learned from experience, but my virginity is not something I can get back. I don’t regret it, because I don’t think I should - what happened has happened and it’s in the past and I can’t change it. However, looking back, I feel I should’ve just said “no”. I wasn’t ready to lose my virginity then, and I should’ve waited for that right person. 

The stuff these people plaster all over social media - “I’ve just taken 9 inches of man meat” or “cum on my face and in my pussy” and all the rest is really stressful. If these people have supportive families, that’s great. I don’t think sex workers (and I’m talking about every type of sex work - the strippers / pornstars / webcam models / escorts / phone sex operators / people who make content for Only Fans etc) are bad or horrible, nor am I saying they can’t behave in this way (who am I to say to someone else what they can / cannot do?) I just am not the biggest fan of this industry, and I think my thoughts and feelings are justified. My heart is set on getting a digital marketing job in Central London, because then I’d actually be able to look at my family and tell them exactly what I do to earn my money. Yes, I also do believe sex workers earn too much. I’m not saying they don’t put work in, but it’s not hard (at least, not as hard as being a teacher or a builder or a surgeon / doctor). All those other jobs provide vital, important services, whereas sex workers (who, I would like to reiterate, are completely allowed to behave like this) are having sex. 

I will still love and look after my kids if they ended up in this industry when they turn 18 or older. I will never ever abandon them. But I will let them know I don’t support what they have done and I won’t feel proud. I don’t know what you will say or think to that statement, but I have been open and honest throughout the rest of this so I felt I should add this as well. I am not saying this to be controversial. This sex work debate is something I have had both mentally with myself and with the tiny group of friends I have who I love from the bottom of my heart. This is an opinion that has taken me a long time of thinking and stress to get to, so I hope it would reflect that I’m not just saying something I don’t fully believe in.

Thank you for reading this all the way through. I don’t know how many of you will respond to this, but even if it’s just one, I will appreciate it. I would like to hear other opinions (about the sex work thing or the other more trivial lighthearted stuff at the top) so I can work on myself and figure out my thoughts and feelings in a healthier way. 

Good luck and stay safe.",01Jun2020,1
423,"Okay a bit of backstory, on mondays we normally clean house. Like a proper clean so that for the rest of the week everything is relatively neat and tidy. This monday, my mother asked my older brother and myself (26m and 23m) to help get stuff out of our younger brothers cupboard (17m) who is at school. 

Now, as we were getting random shit out of the dark recesses of his cubboard, we came across a homemade bong made out of a plastic bottle, and weed crusher and a vape. Admittedly I gave him the vape but I gave it to him to stop him smoking. Sounds dodgy I kniw but the school he attends I also went to and this school is a bit lax about smoking and things like that. 

However where drugs are concerned, the school takes no chances. In addition, I know peope say that weed is NOT a gateway drug but having gone to the same school and seeing friends devolve into drug addicts who only used to be weed smokers makes me scared.

So I want advice on how to proceed. My parents are good people and would never make him leave the house and I think telling them what it is might be a shock that he needs to stop. Also this is his final year of school and his marks this year are VERY important. So, any advice?",01Jun2020,1

430,"My cousin (21F) is in a relationship with a man (30) who has recently expressed on social media his affiliation with white supremacy / neo-nazi groups and ideals. This cousin is mixed race, her dad, my uncle, is black.

I confronted her about her boyfriend's views and asked her how she felt about his posts. She defended him, said he was drunk at the time of the public posts and that they were having an argument. 
For a bit more context, her boyfriend's dad is a well-known Skinhead - in England, this is a term for a culture which promotes neo-nazism - and is a notorious racist.

My cousin and I had a long emotional talk about all of this, she knows it's unacceptable but she says that he said he's sorry. We discussed at length what his actions meant and we agreed, at best, it was a horrifcally bad red flag and that she can't continue the relationship with someone who has publicly, or privately, expressed racist views. She said it was difficult because this is her first boyfriend, her first love.

This morning they've announced their relationship again on social media.
I am white, I could never truly understand what's going on in her head right now and I don't have the experience or the right to tell her what to do or how to feel about it, but I just feel that this is so wrong. 
I've already spoken to her, listened to her, reasoned with her. The rest of the family don't know about any of this and it definitely isn't my place to tell them, but I think that it could help if her dad and sister were to know so they could talk with her about it. I suggested she speak to her parents about it and she said it's absolutely not an option.

Do I just watch her continue to date this openly racist man in silence? She's such a quiet, sweet and sensitive girl who never stands up for herself, this could have the potential to get really ugly. What can I do?",01Jun2020,1

432,"I have a really close friend (let’s call her Mackie) and I also have a good friend called Greg (these aren’t their real names). Mackie has been friends with Greg for longer but I would say I have a good friendship with Greg. We all hang out together and have a group chat together.

Around 2.5 months ago, Mackie said that she felt like her and Greg’s friendship might be slowly falling apart because she thought that he was ignoring her and didn’t want her. Which basically means in her terms:

“I’m jealous that you are talking to him and I feel like your in the way and I want you to stop being a conversation hoe.” 

So, I start apologising and saying that he’s still your friend, etc. But it made me feel like shit because I didn’t even talk to him much and I really enjoyed being his friend. I really don’t want to hurt my friend, but I want to stay being friends with Greg. So, I just start talking to him a little less and not laugh at every joke for Mackie’s sake. Eventually it goes back to normal but Mackie is starting to act the same way as before when I talked to him too much. I asked her if she was okay with it multiple times but she said she was “fine with it”. I doubted that she was okay with it because every time Greg and I had a good time or held a good conversation she would go quiet, mute herself for long periods of time (if on call), leave early and say salty/sarcastic replies when we ask I talk to her.

I try confronting her many times after this happens but she just gets annoyed and says that she “okay” with me talking. She then sort of avoids me until I stop talking to Greg and 10mins have passed.

What should I do? Mackie isn’t a toxic friend and she’s not a bad person, so I’m not sure why she does this. I’m not sure if I’m overthinking it because she’s always a bit salty, but is there any advice you can give me?",01Jun2020,1

434,"20M

My mum raised me alone, and my dad only really came back into my life now that I'm in uni and not a hassle anymore. My parents separated but now they're back together; not because they're happy with each others company but I guess cause both of them are getting old now and they both generally accept that in the future they're gonna be retiring and living together. 

Growing up, my mum was strict, controlling and had high expectations. Unreasonable, horrible temper, toxic. She had a tendency to blame everything around her except herself, I remember even from a very young age there were situations which went wrong that ultimately should've been her responsibility as an adult and a parent but she would throw onto me. For example when I was 7 I got lost in a shopping mall and I got disciplined harshly for 'intentionally' causing her trouble when I was genuinely lost sight of her. 

I think to this day these situations influenced me in two ways, firstly I adopted a lot of the same negative personality traits. For a long time I had the same tendency to blame everyone and everything around me except myself, and then when I realised that wasn't working for me since friends stopped talking to me I did the opposite and now have a tendency to beat myself up over everything. Its probably why my mental state is the worst its ever been these days. I guess this post is to gain advice to fix my relationship with my mum as a first step to improving it. 

And secondly, it made me genuinely not want to be anything like her, and hence I stopped listening or respecting any of the things/advice she said even though some of it does have merit.

But I know deep inside that she is a good person and more than that, she has always truly wanted the best for me. Raising me alone all those years was a huge emotional and financial burden, its not that I don't understand what shes been through or how things came to be today. But I can't help not having any trust or respect for her anymore. Its not something I can control.

Theres only really been one serious opportunity for me to have a serious, from the heart conversation with my mum about these trust/respect issues and it was last year. The first and last time. The first because before then I was probably just too immature to really understand what was happening. And the last because I think its gotten to a point where the trust is completely gone. 

Last year I deferred a year of the medicine degree I was doing because my mind just wasn't on it. I did it without telling her because I was an adult, I didn't want or care for her reaction and I knew that under no circumstance would she understand or 'allow' me to do what I did. What ensued was a conversation where I actually opened up to her about how negative and emotionally crippling talking/interacting with her on a daily basis was. Of course, she neither understand nor cared about anything I had to say and verbally bashed me about my decision to defer. The next day, she took away many of my possessions such as my laptop, phone saying that since I wasn't studying anymore I wouldn't need any of them. Underwent the heaviest verbal bashing I ever received (even for her standards), including 'You're not my son', 'Good luck working a 30k job, you failure just like your father', 'Get out of my house, you don't exist to me anymore'. 

And thats what I did. I  blocked my entire family on every platform, packed my stuff and left with like $400 in my bank account. And I spent 6 months outside working 35-40hrs a week in 3 different jobs, I was productive, I wasn't happy but I wasn't unhappy for sure. I saved up a decent chunk of money (for my age anyway), and even managed to travel a bit.

A few months ago I moved back home. The main reason for this was I felt really bad about what I did. Within weeks of moving out, my mum reached out to all my friends, tried to contact me through a variety of different ways. It got to the point where she waited at a train station at the last place I stayed for half a day to try get hold of me. There was even a time where she actually managed to find me in person, and I literally ran for it like I was in an 100m sprint. Obviously she regretted what she said. But I wasn't ready to associate myself with her again. 

And then my dad called me (literally for the first time ever), saying he was coming back and living with my mum again and how my mum wants to apologise for a lot of things and how she's really changed this time. I didn't really believe it but I wanted it to be true.

So I moved back. Firstly there was no conversation, no apology, no nothing. For my mum she just wanted things back to the toxic 'normal'.  But I knew if I moved again so quickly, Id be breaking her heart. It wasn't meant to be for long, one month at most. But then Covid happened, and between that and knowing that my mum would be depressed if I moved out again I decided to stay. 

After the first month, everything went to shit. My parents fight basically everyday; to them its normal and its 'just how marriage is' but to me its distressing, it makes my heart race, my stomach sink and I fucking hate it. My mums back to her toxic ways, endless conversation about race and politics in the house that I'm sick of hearing. Sneaking down the hallway and barging into my room to make sure I'm 'studying' like I'm 12 again. Being the receiving end of the blame game once again about how its all my fault I can't connect with my parents properly and why I can't I be a good son. 

And I have brought up these issues since coming back, but the conversation always goes how I know it would go. Patronising talk about how I'm just a kid who 'doesn't know enough about the world yet' so I get completed disregarded. And if that makes me wanna do anything, its to get the hell out of this house once again.

And its affected how I am as a person and its made me act terribly. My mum asks me for a favour and I don't even want to help her inside because I don't want to lull her into the security of verbally bashing me or thinking she can control/judge every aspect of my life just like last year. One time I even threatened to move out overnight because I got so sick of hearing them fight over nothing. 

Its gotten to a point where I don't even look at them anymore when I'm speaking to them because I don't want to see the worst of them and I don't want them to bring out my worst. I stay in my room and skip meals to avoid them. 

So this is where I'm at right now. I don't know my dad enough to trust him with anything to be honest (even though he seems like a decent guy). I don't trust my mum for all the reasons above. These days I've been downright depressed to be honest, productivity is at an all time low, and I hate this house more than ever. I feel like the time for conversation is long past, and I'm sick of trying. I care about both my parents to some degree, and I understand perfectly whats going on but I don't know how to solve it and I dont know if I should sacrifice my own wellbeing for it. 

And I haven't said this so far. But I don't even know if moving out this time WILL actually solve any of the other issues I have like it did last year when I moved out. But I reckon it could be a first step.

441,"I’m 19, he’s 38 (yes my parents were very young).
My mom has about 10k followers on Instagram because she’s an author. He’s a streamer, blogger and present on YouTube.

Lately he’s been talking about the things he could’ve done back then and how he always stopped (photography, music) and he regrets is but this time he’s really pushing through till the end. Constantly talking about how he regrets so much and lowkey trying to tell me that I’ll regret it too because it’s the future or whatever.

The thing is, that I absolutely don’t want that. I’m currently trying to delete all my accounts except for a few ones (Reddit and Instagram). 
While I support the them and everyone else doing their online businesses, I really don’t want to be part of it. 

My mom on the other hand doesn’t push me at all into that whole social media presence thing.
I know very well that it’s helpful, beneficial and an easy way to make quick money once you have your audience, but that doesn’t mean I want to jump on that bandwagon.

My dad used to care about his privacy and the informations big cooperations collected of him, but now he doesn’t anymore. He recently said, that people who are too afraid that these companies gather their information have something to hide or are/will be criminals. I don’t plan on being a criminal tho. 

Okay but now to my problem- my father can be very „okay that’s a dumb way to see it“ or „the way I’m thinking about it is the correct one“ kinda person (sorry English isn’t my first language and I don’t know an equivalent word). He’ll make me feel like shit when I tell him I don’t want to be present online the way he is (vlogs, streams etc). 

Can anyone please give me good advice on what to say to him? I am so tired of constantly hearing about it and I’m really not into it at all. I don’t officially live with them anymore but due to the current situation we are neighbours (they planned on leaving to travel the world this summer but can’t so they rented the apartment next to mine) which means that I am not constantly with them.",01Jun2020,1

444,"hey all, I'm 17, 5'1 and I weigh almost 44 kg. I've been skinny all my life, but i do have a tiny chunk of belly fat that makes me feel insecure, and I've set out to get rid of it and get as fit as i possibly can, to look good and feel good. I'm thinking of starting out on a calorie surplus, eating clean, going for 1 hour+ of cycling each night, doing a beginners HIIT everyday and starting out with weight training.

With weight training the issue is that I have deadweights that are 2 ,8 and 10 kg, and no more. Will these be helpful for muscle gain? ( i specifically would like to improve my core and try for abs but I know you can't target that specifically so I'll just find overall workouts, I just need to know that if i start out with the 2 and end up at the 10 will it help me gain muscle or is this too light?).

I was planning on 4 days cycling, 3 of weight training and all 7 doing a basic 20 minute HIIT. I know cardio isn't the best for muscle gain, but I've just learnt how to and I love doing it lol makes me feel great, so I'm going to keep it in. I also love the sound of Creatine monohydrate, and I've read good things from qualified people about it so i might work that into my daily routine, just a few grams as recommended, not much.

To sum it up, as a skinny girl that would like to get fit and have a lean torso, if i do cycling, light weights and basic HIIT, take creatine and try for a clean diet, will this help me achieve my goals?

445,"New to reddit and on mobile.. so please don’t judge cause I’m shitty at writing. 

A bit of back story; my sister S and (now baby daddy to my sister) A, meet on my 20th birthday can’t remember much cause I was drunk but my friends told me he was flirting with everyone at the party including me (I had no interest/ didn’t realise because my sister told me she thought he was cute/ had crash on him) and I kept on pushing him onto her. Anyway he finally ended up flirting with my sister and they hit it off and start a fwb relationship which she then finds out 3 months later she’s pregnant. 

Anyway they have a weird situation (seems off topic but I think it’s relevant) S loves him but A doesn’t want a official relationship but I have been told A seems upset if S seeks out to other people in romantic way. 

I’m sorry if this is confusing and jumbled I’m trying to get to the point.. when S was still early on in her pregnancy she went out on a date (told me and a friend was to make A jealous) but before she went out on the date she wanted me to call her 20 mins into date to make up excuse so she could end the date early now thinking it was a bad idea at the time (me and S also lived together at this point) and A was over, him and I were drinking. 

After S left for date he asked me something along the lines about how drunk I would have to be or if I was drunk would I sleep with him and I foolishly said yeah probably would lol if I was pretty drunk (not thinking) In my defences usually when I’m drinking I end up bringing someone home for a root and I’m not slut shaming myself but I kinda lose my morals when drinking. 

After a while of drinking A started initiating to sleep together and I said nah I couldn’t do that to S my sister, he continued to ask and I kept saying no, but he said something along the lines because what I said before about being if I was drunk I would sleep with him and he kept bringing that up and in the end I agreed to sleep with him and I have felt awful since and it’s been 2 years 

My friend asked about it the other day and what had happened I never really told the whole story before and she said I shouldn’t feel guilty and stuff but I can’t help it so.. I guess I’m asking if I am in the wrong or if my friend is right and I shouldn’t feel guilty?",01Jun2020,1

Makes me feel ‘special’ that you have to have that as well as me” and in my eyes that’s very disrespectful of him because he knows I have previously been used and abused in relationships and knows I feel useless to him but doesn’t really try and make me feel better, if anything he wants to make me feel worse...

Didn’t really tell me much, which then got me overthinking the situation and then when I expressed my feelings he caused an argument and called me stupid etc. He has told me he would never cheat on me and I believe people until I find a reason not to.

453,"I've \[M16\] had a crush on this one girl from my class for a pretty long time now. Although, I wouldn't call it a crush. I usually don't feel much towards her, but as soon as I see her talking to someone or getting along with someone, I get super sad (almost jealous, except that I don't get mad at anyone). At the start of the year I tried befriending her through playful banter and soon enough, we were ""dating"". Basically, we weren't in any sort of relationship but we were pretending to be, although it was more painful to do, since I always felt like I was annoying this girl. I actually asked her out in February at a prom we were attending with friends (spoiler alert, I ran and locked myself in a bathroom stall right after I told her, the next morning she rejected me). We remained friends, and I'd always playfuly insult her, only to then apologize like mad when I got home. I always felt like I was annoying her, and that she was on the verge of cutting ties with me. She was always on the timid side, never really posting anything and not texting much. I know we used to talk quite a bit one time in December, but ever since then it went downhill. I was always the one starting convos and it was becoming pretty apparent that she wasn't into me

&amp;#x200B;

Then... then I goofed up. BIG TIME. Last week, our classmates organized a party because we hadn't seen each other in 3 months (we were allowed to, the laws are a bit looser here). I of course started out by joking around, to which the girl laughed. Getting a bit melancholic, I needed some alone time, since there were 10+ people and I just needed a bit of space. After being alone for a bit, a friend came up to me with a bottle and told me to chug it, that it would make me feel better. You see, there's more alcohol in a pear vodka than you might think and I learned that the hard way. 

Coming back to the party half-hammered, I started playfuly instulting the girl, hugging her despite her hating any sort of physical contact, and going to sleep chanting her name. When I woke up the next day and got home, I realized what I'd done. I again resorted to apologizing to hell and back. After more than 7 hours of my message being stuck on ""sent"", I pondered... Could she have blocked me?

I needed to confirm my theory. Yup, I was right. Blocked me on all the sites she had. After a week of contemplating, a friend reached out to me, willing to ask her what happened and why. What I got back was that she was mad and that there was no way of fixing it.

My heart sank. The girl I always dreamed of being at least a good friend now didn't want anything to do with me... I still have 3 years of class with her left...

I hate myself and my poor self-control. What do?

457,"I will keep a long story short. And I’ve edited some of the details slightly because I’m worried he could in some form of way see this and know it’s about him. This is my first post on reddit. I tried to find the best community to post it to. Feel free to remove it if it’s not acceptable. 

My step-brother [22/M] threatened to beat me, and when my mum [50/F] stood up for me he squared up to her too. 

I found my baby nephew half way up the stairs, and the only reason I found him was because I had decided to go for a shower at that moment. His dad was supposed to be watching him but was just laying on the couch playing on his phone. (They don’t live with us, they came to visit, they often exploit my mums kindness and worrying as a way to not have to look after their child)
I called him out, I told him to take better care of his son. To which the threatening began. I told him to get out of my house so he went screaming into the garden where my mum and step dad were to tell everyone what he was going to “smash my face in” and that was when he squared up to my mum. 

He is a bully
He is twice the size of my mum and me
He used his size to intimidate her
His own mum and sister are scared of him but now they have made their bed and they will lay in it. All those years ago they exploited his bad behaviour claiming it was ADHD, and claimed disability benefits, they no longer let him in their home unless his stepdad is there. 

I’m disgusted that someone would use their size against someone smaller than them and think they’re “hard” because of it. 
Once Corona has passed I’m going straight to self defence lessons so I could take out the mother fucking giant from jack and the beanstalk if he ever threatened me. 

If he decides he was going to beat me, nothing around at the time could have stopped him.
I’m finding it a lot worse because he threatened me in my home, my safe place and I haven’t really felt safe since. So, I need a advice about what is considered self defence. I need to have a plan in my head what type of things I could do to defend myself and keep myself safe until police arrive(I don’t have much trust in UK police). 
Honestly the first thing I did was google how to stab someone that’s not fatal but there’s too much risk of seriously harming him. Other ideas I’ve had is just smashing plates over their head. I know there’s a pressure point under the thigh, that you just have to pinch and it’s real sore. 

One day he’ll put himself in jail and I’m looking forward to it. I think everyone is.",01Jun2020,1
458,Okay so.. Me and some of my close friends have been planning a d&amp;d sleepover at my place. There are three boys (two of which I have been friends with since before kindergarten and the other is a friend I made last year). We also have one girl who will be coming over too. The plan was to set up a tent in my backyard and we just do all our stuff in there. My Dad said yes because he was actually the one that gave me the idea. Mum also said yes until I told her that there would be a girl staying too. She then swiftly said no since.. ya know she would be the only girl there. Mind you that she is openly gay and that i have known her since grade four. I don't really know what I should do. I don't want her to have to be kicked out because I have dealt with that before and don't want to do it again so... I just need some advice about how I could not be the asshole in this situation to anyone.,01Jun2020,1
459,"So to give some context, my dad and I (20F) do not have a deep, meaningful relationship in the slightest. I have lived with my mother since I was 8 years old. I used to stay over my dad’s house when I was younger, but since I’ve gotten older and he’s developed a family, I now only see him about once every 2-3 months. He texts me every now and then to say he loves me, maybe gets a phone call in, but that’s about it. When I do see him, our relationship is very surface level. I have a hard time opening up to him because he really wasn’t there in the formative years of my childhood and never really provided emotional or mental support to me. He never really asked about my hobbies or tried to learn or show up for my sports growing up. My mom basically raised me on her own, paying for almost the entirety of my upbringing, and I am very close with her because of it. It’s also really hard for me to relate to my dad in any way now that I’m an adult because it’s become apparent that we have very different views of the world. He is also someone that will go to every length to prove that your opinion is wrong, especially online. 

Well, I recently posted on Facebook about how it is important as white people to do our part in the black lives matter movement because we will never have to experience the fear and pain of being a black person in America. I am very passionate about human rights even before the recent protests started happening as well as about the black lives matter movement. It truly breaks my heart that black people have to continue to endure racism and oppression in today’s world when they have tried to open our eyes to their pain over and over and over again. Well, my dad sees my post and initially comments, “this is just a lie.” This isn’t the first time he’s commented on one of my posts about racism and white privilege to which I debated him or just ignored. This time I responded “well Dad, these are my thoughts about racism, if you don’t like them you don’t have to read or engage with my posts.” A few minutes later, he proceeds to type out an excessively long comment on my post about how I’m completely wrong because he’s experienced so much bullying and hate as a white man and it’s not right for me to assume his experience. I ignored this comment and continued to use Facebook like I normally do. A few hours later I reposted 2 other posts regarding the black lives matter movement right now, to which he commented on both with other posts that he felt proved my point to be wrong. 

I love my Dad because he is my family, but I would never choose to be friends with him or associate myself with him if we weren’t related. His values are completely different than mine and he goes to any length to prove that mine are wrong, and he does it publicly. I’m tired of having to deal with him thinking he is always right or that he needs to always correct me when in my opinion, he really doesn’t even know me well enough to do that especially now that I am an adult. I don’t know the right course of action here, because even though it is not much, we do get together every couple of months. I do my best to maintain some type of relationship with him, but it really just does not seem worth it anymore because we are just so different especially with values that I hold very close to my heart. It would be a different situation if we ever had a close relationship, but that’s never something I had with my father. I’m wondering if anyone has experienced something similar to this and is able to give advice on what I should do? 

Disclaimer: I know that there are way more important things happening in the world right now, and I am not trying to make this situation about me in any way. I’m just overwhelmed with constantly having to deal with negativity from a loved one when I try to express my support and advocacy for the black lives matter movement in particular. I know that black lives have a much bigger problem at hand right now, but any advice would be appreciated so that I can continue to help the movement in every way possible that is most beneficial to my mental health.",01Jun2020,1
460,"I am writing this on behalf of my sister. I dont really know how to give her advice regarding this topic, so I want to hear your advices and insights on this situation.

My sister is 21 and has an online job teaching and tutoring Japanese people English, she also works as an assistant for a dentist. Its only been approximately 20+ days since she started her online job and 2-3 weeks since she worked under the dentist and so she has a very good income. Since, she has already received income from her job, she sometimes uses the money to order food from online food businesses. She also does it because she would like to support the businesses that are suffering from this pandemic.

Now, in comes my mother. My mother tells my sister that she shouldnt waste her money for food that we could just make at home. But even  my mother and my sisters know that it would be a hassle to buy the ingredients to make it at home, and also, it not a problem, since the food sold is incredibly cheap!

My mother tells her that she shouldnt be using her money so squanderously because money is not easy to earn and to come by. My sister is literally just buying the food so that we could eat and enjoy it together! And my mother is even guilty of suggesting to her to buy said food. But my mother doesnt even acknowledge that my sister wakes up everyday, as early as 4 am to start doing her the online job and sometime in the afternoon goes to assist the dentist, so she is working very hard and diligently!

My sister even volunteered to pay for our family's Netflix account and is also planning to buy a vaccuum that my mother has been putting off even though its really needed but instead buys useless sht. But, my mother only said that its nice having a daughter that can pay for her and she didnt even thank my sister!

So to my sister, it feels like my mother is belittling her effort. Because my sister is doing the job so she doesnt have to ask money from my parents and so that she can support herself financially. Our mother isnt even trying to recognize the hardwork that my sister is putting into her job. To me, what shes spending on is justified because its her money and she works hard for it. My sister is a smart person! But my mother is saying that my sister shouldnt waste her money albeit, my mother likes to waste her money on useless af shit more so than shes accusing my sister of.",01Jun2020,1
461,"During quarantine I joined a Virtual Reality group which debate philosophical questions twice a week. I've attended almost every event, become a moderator for the group.

On the discord we are meant to suggest philosophy questions for the next event, and I always post at least 6 while most do 1, and usually my questions get used.

After the 2 hour events we all usually talk in a big group, which usually dwindles down to the host, two moderators and me and we'll talk for an hour more. The host even asked if I would like to join his podcast (which I refused for the moment).

Yesterday we had another event, but at the end of it the host said ""some of you will have gotten a PM from me, we'll be heading to private world after this."" but I didn't get a message. I see all the moderators, and a couple of new members all follow the host out the room. I look around and see it's just me and 7 new people. 

It did hurt. I'm a reserved person, people generally like me being around, they think I have friends, but they arent close enough to me to ask to hang out and stuff. I just fear being left out so usually I keep people at arms length. But with this community I really thought I was one of them, part of the group and actually making friends.

There is another event tonight, part of me wants to just never turn up to an event again. Do I just put less effort in and remain distant with them. Or do I put it behind me and continue on as normal, maybe they where just talking about the podcast I said no too. Or maybe they don't like me being around and where just being polite.

TL;DR Joined a group and thought we where becoming close, in Virtual Reality, they then invited a group to go to a private room to talk and I wasn't invited while some new people where. Should I stop putting as much effort in to the community?",01Jun2020,1

468,"Been with my boyfriend for 3 years, currently living together. We had an amazing relationship untill a year ago when things got bad, it all left me feeling so lonely and unlovable. He's trying now, he really is... giving me love and attention and gifts... He's just a little bit different than me, he loves staying at home, he isn't passionate about much besides work and doesn't have many friends... I love him and care about him anyway but... we do have some problems.There's this other person. He makes me laugh more in one day than my BF does in a full month.My BF is a better fit on paper, same interests, career aspirations and this other person is quite different. And oh, the other guy, he's my brothers friend. Which makes this even more messed up.

I initially had an attraction to him a few months ago- but something you forget about once you get home. Then it kind of started growing stronger and I started thinking about him for the next few days whenever I'd see him in a group setting and that's when I decided to stop seeing that group of friends. It worked for a while and I thought I was in the clear so I started hanging out with them again.Suddenly, I wasn't only thinking about him for 3 days after I see him, it turned out into him being my first thought in the morning. I even have to intentionally stop myself from acting on my desire to go places where I'll see him.

Needless to say, I don't plan on acting on it, it's my brothers friend. And I'm not the type to cheat. Only having these thoughts is making me feel like a horrible person..But I can't stop thinking about the 'what ifs' I don't think that he looks at me in that way either, I don't know. The outgoing guy he is, he gets a bit awkward around me which is unusual but he has never done anything that would step out of the friend behavior.

On the other side, the though of leaving my boyfriend hurts like hell. The thought of doing something stupid an hurting him hurts me even more. I feel like such a bad person, I've never been this confused in my whole life...

469,"hi, i (f/23) am a student and come from a not-so-well-to-do background. my parents' house was abusive and I've suffered a lot there. 2 years ago i was absolutely desperate to move out of there and study in a different city. i had even made a plan to run away if the plan to study doesn't work out. but then things worked out in a very strange way. my father suddenly refused to pay for my education. my mom somehow managed to get some loan money from a few friends which i'm supposed to return soon as my course ends and i get a job. i moved to this new city without a penny in my bank account as mom didn't have any more money. i told mom that I'll get a job and take up a place on rent but she was against it and was like i want you to focus on your studies. we fought a lot but ultimately she made me move in with my uncle-aunt (her younger brother and sister-in-law). they were more than happy to help out and take me in and even take up the responsibility for my expenses. I'd always been on great terms with them. 

they don't have a kid of their own and soon i became that kid for them. especially for my aunt. she loves me so much that i've even heard her say that she can't imagine life after i move out of their place and she doesn't want me to go. she would keep telling me that i'm the missing piece to her life, that i have made their lives better just by existing. 

i had never experienced a healthy, functional family life and i went crazy with happiness. i idolised them initially and would try to impress them like a child. my aunt was more than happy in that stage. but now i notice that she tries to change everything about me. she keeps asking me to do things her way constantly, even the littlest of things. i can discount that thinking she wants her own house in a certain way. but it's about my personality too. she gets into one of her moods where she criticizes everything inherently personal to me: the people i'm friends with, how many people i have dated, what i talk to my therapist about (which she demands to know even though i've told her that i don't feel comfortable sharing), what i post on Instagram, who likes my posts, what caption i put, etc etc the list goes on and on. both of them insist that i keep my door open while talking on the phone with friends. after the lockdown, my exams are finally approaching and they're at my back constantly like i'm a child of 6. usually i switch off my phone when i sit to study seriously, and if i do something light i don't. they sometimes insist that i handover my phone while studying. they don't let me close my door and say that they don't understand why i need to do that.

whenever i try to have a conversation to address these issues it ends up in a huge lecture with them telling me how lucky i am. also, in withdrawal of affection for a while because oh how dare i contradict them or have a mind of my own.

i'm losing my mind. i feel suffocated. can't even say anything because i'm so indebted to them for all they've done. i do love them. but right now, both of them are just driving me nuts. please give tips to deal with this situation.

473,"Background: I [14F] am Black-British (of Sierra Leonean descent to be more specific). I have 3 younger brothers [12M, 12M, 11M].


Let’s just call one of the twins Z. While we were having brunch, Z whispers a joke to my brother about Chinese people. He says that they eat monkey brains. I told him that was racist and he should stop being racist and not all Chinese people eat monkey brains. He said ‘idk why ur getting angry,  I’m stating facts’ and racist-ass shit like that. I just think it’s ironic bc Ebola hit Sierra Leone pretty hard, and some people theorised it was from bats or monkeys or something like that. I told him this and asked him how he would feel if somebody had said that he ate bats/monkeys bc he was Sierra Leonean. He said that he wouldn’t feel good, but his racist comment concerning Chinese individuals were just facts and he said his teacher said this to him. I told my dad and he shrugged it off and said it wasn’t racist. 

Another thing that happened is that the other twin (we’ll call him E) said “I don’t know why they’re getting angry bc one person died’ regarding the George Floyd protests, which not only disgusted me, but it shocked me as we’re all black. I tried explaining to him but he just thought I was going off on him.

How do I stop my brothers from being racist POS(s)??

I’m just afraid that they just believe anything that is said to them regarding race relations, bc one day they’ll jump out saying colourist or even more racist and ignorant things they’ve been saying.

So to start off I’m a twin. We are identical and this is a big reason I’m writing this post. So my twin recently has been acting unusually quiet and not leaving their room much. They went out and I didn’t mean to poke my head around their room too much but their phone was open ( no I don’t ever go through peoples phones ever but I know somethings up) anyway, so I notice they are talking to online dominants ( sexual kind ) first things that hits my mind is okay everyone has their kinks I’ll ignore that not my cup of tea but okay, so I keep scrolling through fast just looking for big key words and notice they have sent revealing pics and ones which you wouldn’t want others seeing. The thing is I get it’s their kink but they and myself both have important Jobs with a public image so they should know better. Like personally not only are they putting me at risk but themselves. How do I go about this. 

Note : they saved the pics themselves on Snapchat chat so it’s permanently there and used kik too so they don’t delete.

477,"I (23M) have always hated eating noises. I have never met someone who eats as loudly as my roommate (20M). 

We work in the same place and have the same schedule, and we're also very close as friends so we spend a LOT of time together. Almost every meal he eats, I am present for. Spending meals apart would likely mean a decrease in other fun activities we do together, usually while eating. It would also be inconvenient since we both eat in our room and the rest of the house is often populated and not very relaxing to have a meal in.

When I first brought this up, he would jokingly eat louder to piss me off, until I told him that I didn't find it funny. As more time has gone on and I've made it very clear how much I hate listening to him eat, he's gotten more distraught about it. Apparently he's been trying to eat more quietly, but he needs to swish the food around on his tongue in order to 'taste it better.'

I'm sure it sucks for him to hear me complain about it every day, but there's no way I'm just going to ignore it. Listening to him eat triggers some deep rage in me. I love this guy like a brother, but it takes a lot for me not to yell at him or take his food away. I know he feels guilty about it, and I feel bad about my reaction as well.

I don't know if this is something I can get therapy for, or if he could learn to eat more quietly. We could eat our meals seperately, but it would be unfair to either of us to have to leave the room, and it would just suck not to be able to share mealtimes anymore. I'm at a loss, but it's definitely an issue that needs to get fixed one way or another.

TL;DR: Despite trying not to, my roommate eats very loudly and I can't stand it. Not sure if I need to get therapy for it, or if he needs to try harder to eat quietly, or some other solution. Thanks for reading.",01Jun2020,1
478,"I am a 20 yo girl. When I was a child, my mom was very neglecting of me (She would leave me weeks with my grandma, see me only on weekends, dad was always traveling due to his work) until I reached 7 or 8 years old and my grandma told her she was too old to do this anymore. 


Even then, since mom was always working, I would see her during lunch, and after 8pm. When I come back from school, she would buy me children books, junk food, and leave me in the bedroom to watch cartoons. My parents never asked me how my day was, they never knew the name of my friends. They knew I was good at drawing just because my school teacher, in the parents-teachers meeting, told them so. 


When I was 12 or 13, the neglecting stopped, to be replaced with the emotional abuse. I was on the heavier side, so my mom would not spend a second without calling me all sorts of insulting names.. I would predict her words some days, ""you're so ugly and you only get uglier day after day. Why don't you lose weight?"" . This naturally made me bulimic at the age of 13, and I lost a lot of weight, but her insulting was so frequent that even after becoming worryingly skinny, I could still hear her voice in my head and found myself fat. After all those years, I still suffer from a complete lack of self-esteem.


Dad's emotional abuse was on a more discreet way. He had anger issues. (One day, we were walking together, and he's much faster than me, I told him jokingly ""Dad, wait for me"", he stopped and started screaming at me and insulting my slow pace, to the point where we gathered a small audience that had pity looks on their eyes). I can't even call him to lunch without thinking it over 100 times and getting scared he's going to go on a rampage. 


This isn't a pity post. I started researching this subject to find out what went wrong, so I don'tt really blame my parents, maybe they had their own mistreatment growing up. Due to this, at the age of 18, I went to the farthest town to study engineering, but due to Corona, now I'm back here since March and I'll stay until September, and everything is coming back to me. I rejected every single guy that asked me out, due to my broken self-esteem and inexistent confidence, and I've never been intimate with anyone. My communication skills are screwed, I get irritated easily. I'm still a broke college student, so therapy is a solution only reachable three years from now.

482,"My and my friend (let’s call her Isabel) have been close friends for around 8/9 years now. All of her family knows, and likes me. She’s a wonderful, kind girl who shows amazing devotion and loyalty to the people in her life, which often leads to her giving people more chances than they deserve. Over the years we’ve had so many “nearly” moments. Kissing, touching here and there and some heavy flirting, and the exchange of some interesting pictures, with neither of us really brave enough to go for it. But nothing has happened since she entered this relationship around 4 years ago. I definitely am attracted to her (I feel weird describing her but she’s beautiful) and would love to be with her, and I feel like she might feel the same way, but she is stuck in a pretty dead end relationship with her boyfriend who we shall name Chris. 

Now Chris isn’t a terrible guy. He doesn’t abuse her or hurt her in any way, in fact on the surface it looks like they have a pretty good relationship. They share the mortgage on a house together in the centre of a major English city. They seem comfortable, and it’s always difficult to leave a comfortable situation. 

However, Chris does not really appreciate her. He’s always reluctant to do anything with her and they both acknowledge that they get sick of each other’s company very quickly. They barely ever have sex and almost never go out, not even for a walk in these crazy times. He works or plays computer games constantly and doesn’t give her the time of day she deserves.

Isabel has been talking to me a lot recently about how she doesn’t feel appreciated, about how all of her friends think she could do better, about how she wants to leave him but is scared to for a number of reasons (mainly due to the house they have bought together). Along with this she has started sending me (slightly) suggestive snapchats again. For example, she will be out on a walk and send a video of herself and pan down her whole body, and she knows how sexy I find her figure. We haven’t really sent pictures of ourselves to each other since she got with Chris, so this is all kinda out of the blue. Am I reading too much into it? I dunno. 

Anyway at first I played it cool, not knowing how serious these thoughts she was having were. They go through this a lot, they’ve broken up before, it honestly barely seems like they like each other. They’re just going through the motions. But this time sounded like she truly was considering leaving him. She said she doesn’t find him attractive anymore, all of her friends are telling her to leave him etc. So I took this as a cue to lay it on a bit thicker. I told her I agreed with her friends, that she should be with someone who appreciates her, all the while complimenting her. I wasn’t explicitly saying that I want to be that person, but I was starting a lot of sentences with “if I were your boyfriend”. 

And that is where I am right now. So my question is what do I do? Do I straight up confess my feelings and admit that I want to replace Chris as her boyfriend, and show her what it feels to be truly appreciated? Or do I not risk confusing her and maybe let her build the courage to leave Chris on her own? Or is there a third option I’m not considering? I’m so confused!",01Jun2020,1
483,"So I’ll give you guys context first before I say what I need help with. I was on tinder around March of last year and I matched with this girl, we really hit it off and we met up a couple of times, shared socials and we message each other every day. This was amazing to me as I’ve never been close to anyone let alone been in a relationship. 
I thought we were basically dating at that point but recently, past few days actually, she’s been ignoring my messages and snaps on Snapchat for hours on end and when she did finally respond to my snapchats she just blankly ignored my questions and just took a picture of the top of her head with no message. (We normally respond to each other’s messages instantly) and just in the past two hours before I write this she’s posting on her Snapchat story kissing some dude on one post which really just hurt me as I thought we were dating then the next saying “hmu so bored” despite me trying to get in contact with her and getting left on delivered?
Is whatever we had over? Should I block her and move on? Should I continue to pursue an answer  to all of this?
Please help or give any advice I’m totally lost and at the point of breaking down. 

Thank you so much for your time to read this, I really appreciate any responses or advice you guys can give!

486,"Hey guys, I am currently having a bit of a panic attack about something that happened at work today and could really use a second opinion. 

Firstly, a little bit of background about me. I have worked in this store for almost 5 years, I have next to no social skills and suffer from severe anxiety and PTSD. When I am at work I constantly worry that my boss and co workers think I am either really rude or weird because I struggle to interact with other people. 

Now onto the story...

Long story short the place I work at just got a new department manager who nobody likes and in a few short weeks my workplace has gone from a really happy, fun place to a store full of miserable people. 

The company I work for puts out an annual survey to gauge how they are performing, employee happiness etc. that is supposedly anonymous (it’s actually not) and non compulsory. Every year the managers at my store bug us relentlessly until we compleat it and often try to get us to compleat it during a shift so that they can hover over our shoulders and see our answers. I have decided not to compleat the survey this year because knowing my what my co workers are like when they are pissed off someone is going to write something offensive on their survey and cause a heap of drama that I really don’t want to get dragged into. 

So today a co worker (who has also decided not to compleat the survey for the same reasons) and I where working together when the new manager approaches us and asks if we would like to come into the office to compleat our survey. My co worker and I both declined and explained to the new manager exactly why we didn’t want to compleat the survey. He got pretty offended and went off to speak to the store manager (his boss). I didn’t get the chance to speak to either of them for the rest of the shift but they spent a lot of time together during our shift quietly talking. 

Honestly, I am not worried about offending the new manager but I have a lot of respect for the store manager and am really worried I may have accidentally offended him.",01Jun2020,1

I’m a naturally flirty person and we had a bit of friendly flirting back and forth but once again we thought nothing of it. The one day we were playing truths and he straight up called me ugly and said my curves don’t suit me which knocked me a lot. The next day I confronted him and he apologised. I don’t trust people often and if a person I trust hurts me I tend to forgive easily. We became close again but he did something similar where he called me ugly again. I once again forgave him and we were fine for ages. But more recently he has put little to no effort into our once pleasant conversations and every time i try to talk to him he just puts idc and i don’t know why he has done this or what I should do about it....

I live with another brother of mine named Ken, I'd let Cody stay with us but Ken doesn't like him and I don't want to cause a conflict between the two.

The only reason Cody is in this mess is because he's too devoted to his girlfriend...or ex-girlfriend because I'm not sure if they're still completely over. They've been together for 6yrs and all this women has done is cheat on him and he was aware that it was happening but he loved her. Since he's been with her she had a child which I'm 80% sure is not his. Despite that, he was practically asking to pay child support for this kid and refuses to get a DNA test. She didn't kick him out, he left on his own but he's also currently paying for her rent while he's homeless. He could just find his own apartment and stop paying hers.

501,"
As a short backstory:

I‘ve been (m/19) in a relationship with my girlfriend (w/19) for 2.5 years. Growing up and in the years before this relationship, i‘ve experienced some traumas and went through a depression. During the past 2 years I kind of managed to deal with my depression, through a different circle of friends, my girlfriend, art and therapy and feel a lot better. This is my first real and serious relationship and I have this problem for about 6 to 12 months. English isn‘t my native language, and I hope everything is understandable.

I‘ve talked to her multiple times and we tried different things, but nothing seems to work out. I love and appreciate her. She‘s there for me, I feel attracted to her, can talk with her, … 

Our sex is good and she‘s happy with out sex life but for me it‘s just not what i want. It feels good, I‘m more or less happy with the amount and I‘m able to try out most of the things I want to do, but I just want something new. There really isn‘t much I want to try out anymore and I‘m happy with my partner, but I just feel like somethings missing. I‘ve had thoughts about another partner but I would never consider cheating and don‘t want to break up with her.

Sometimes I feel like she‘s not really trying to help me with that problem, but when I think about it, it‘s obvious that she puts effort in having a healthy and happy sex life for both of us.

Ever since I started feeling unhappy about this, it‘s harder for me to show her affection. I really love her and feel a deep connection to her. She makes me feel safe and I have no problems with hugging her, holding her or lying next to her. But it‘s really hard for me to tell her, that I love her. Kissing her without having sex also started to feel weird and kinda repulsive. Even a bit disgusting, but I don‘t know why. We talked about this and she accepts and understands it, but it‘s driving me crazy.

My overall sex drive also went down in the last few weeks, and i sometimes feel ashamed, disgusted and disappointed after we have sex. Not during, but after. I now asked her if we could stop having sex for a while to see if anything changes and so I feel better, but this can‘t really be the solution. I still feel aroused sometimes and I know that I‘ll still be disappointed now because I can‘t act out my sexuality and because my girlfriend isn‘t really fond of this idea. I‘m just afraid, that I will still feel bad after the time we have sex.

I have to add, that our sex life was great for the first half of our relationship. I don‘t know if it is, because there was always something new to try out or if I just started  having more and more expectations. It‘s not fair to her and really affects me emotionally. I don‘t have any fetish etc.

Does anybody have advice, similar experiences and/or knows why I might have this problem and how to solve it?
I start to question my sexuality (not sexual orientation) and don‘t know what to do.

Thank you all.",01Jun2020,1

505,"My weight has fluctuated a lot the past few years. 
I’m 28 and since I turned 25, I started putting on the pounds. I’m around 5’4” and back in December I got up to 155-160 which is the most I’ve ever weighed, considering a few years ago I was 110-115 on average. A lot of my weight gain had to do with consistent back pain that caused me to be physically inactive for months. I also wasn’t eating my best. 

I had back surgery in January to fix the nerve pain in my low back. It was called a microdiscectomy. It went really well, overall, and without even trying I started losing weight weeks and months after the surgery. I also stopped birth control, which caused me to lose additional weight. I also changed a few other medications, which must’ve been a factor as well. I still eat the same foods, just smaller portions, but I haven’t *really* tried super hard to lose weight. It just kinda happened. 

Currently- I’m right around 128-130 lbs and as happy as I am about the weight loss, my skin is so saggy and I look really deflated and unhealthy. 
I have no muscle mass. I can’t remember the last time I worked out. I am a smoker and have been for at least 10 years now.

507,"My wife and I have a 5 year anniversary coming up. We always had a trusting relationship up until now. We're both 27. We have two daughters. She's kept a few friends from high school. They're her ""guy friends."" I'm actually good friends with one of them. 

There's another friend who she knew very well. Before she met me they were good friends and he even went with her and her family to the mountains once. When I found out about him (when we first got together) and I asked if there was anything between them. She told me no, that they were always just good friends and they never had romantic feelings. 

Fast forward some years into our relationship (which started in 2013), and she's going to hang out with him at night because he's only going to be in town for a short time. This happened more than a few times but I trusted that she just wanted to see her friend. I even got a chance to talk to they guy alone and he assured me that there was never anything between them. 

Fast forward to this morning and I get a message from his wife showing me snapshots of a dirty Snapchat conversation between him and my wife. They were basically sexting. And another one of her saying that she was into him since early on and that she would do anything he needs her to. From what I gathered they had not done anything physically, but they were talking about it. 

I confronted my wife and she admitted to it and she said she knew it as wrong. She said that she told him she didn't want to have that kind of conversation anymore. She told me she has never been intimate with anyone else. I just don't know what to believe now. 

What else has she been hiding from me? Can our relationship recover from this? This isn't the person I thought my wife was. I can't live life being paranoid about my marriage. But I don't want to rip my family apart. My parents divorced when I was 13 and it was ugly. I never wanted to put my kids through that.

511,"Hello I am not sure what to do about my friends. We are all about 13, 14, 15 at the moment and I am around 14 15.

So this will I think be long as I am going to explain it fully. A few months ago almost a year I fell out with a  good friend by the same of 'Susan' (not her real name) Susan was so mean to me and in general was a really toxic person. She was a horrible person to everybody who met her and she crossed the line for me so many times so I eventually just cut all contact with her and don't talk to her anymore. Because if the pandemic I am hoping she will be moving to Wales soon.

It is important to note that Susan has a twin sister called 'Sandy'. Both of the sisters are not very nice and are extremely horrible to each other not in a 'oh there sisters' kind of way but like a full on ""Fatty! Cow! Bitch!"" kind of way and they fight constantly so it was hard for them to fit in and find friends in our school as they both were extremely unpopular for this. Now this is where my friend 'Kate' comes into play. Both the girls seemed to have a some sort of dependence on Kate and would fight for her attention constantly. Now me and my bets friend Liza had been friends with Kate for longer than the girls but they just dident care.

Blah blah blah skip a bit.

Since the pandemic all my friends (not including Susan) have been using a group chat to talk to each other. And since everyone has been cooped up in there house there has been some obvious tention between everybody where Sandy has been posting videos of herself in a sort of 'look at me!' kind of way (I don't think she meant to) but I just found myself getting frustrated with her and eventually we ended up telling at each other where she told Liza to ""Shut the F*** up"" now if you know me nobody tells my best friend to do that so i just left I was invited back by Kate later on.

Sandy never apologised to Liza nor me and neither did we so I just let it go.

Here's where my problem comes in:

Lately Sandy Susan and Kate have been hanging out along with Kate boyfriend 'Duke'. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this but this time I do.

Now I am not the jelouse type but for some reason I just was, I wasn't sure if it was because Kate and Sandy where hanging out with Susan or if it was because it was quarantine and they were out.

But as well as this I was also very angry. Normally I wouldn't care if I was invited to anything but this time I felt hurt and offended and it wasn't like a one time thing they hung out several times after this and processed to post videos of they all hanging out.

What's my problem?

I don't want to sound mean or jelouse or anything but  Where was my invite? It was basicly the hole friendship group changing out but not me and Liza. Now I would get it because Susan was there but Liza wasn't invited?!

Again I don't want to sound jelouse or mean but it hurts to know that they don't want to hang out with us because ""Oh it's only (insurt name) and Liza they won't mind!"" well guess what we do.

It hurts to see my long time friend ditching me for sombody who basicly shat on me and threw me away. As well as this it hurts to see they post videos on the group chat with Susan in them.

I don't want to hurt them or unfriend them but it hurts to see Sandy and especially Kate ditch me and Liza like that. I'd like soem advise but also sorry about any spelling errors and gramme mistakes. Thankyou.",01Jun2020,1
512,"Hi. I'm a 15 year old going into my sophomore year of high school. During my freshman year, I wasn't the most responsible student and would scroll through social media in class. To stop this, my mom activated the screen time function, blocking any and all social media apps until the weekend. But it's not just the social media apps.

We were told what we did was unsafe and were instructed to make sure we had all the supplies. Again we had the supplies but they turned out to be slightly defective but still useable. We were also in trouble for “taking too long”. I do NOT know how to do any of this work without supervision. I did not go out to the job site with defective materials on purpose. The 6th person was not involved because she was called into the job to help. Again I tested 2/16 of the supplies. What happens if I do not sign the write up?,01Jun2020,1

517,"Hi all, this is a tad trivial since it was years ago but I need some advice. I'm currently a 20yr old student and my sister informed that my old bully from when I was around 9/10 is now this big Instagram influencer with around 20k followers. Honestly, I wasn't that bothered mostly curious, but when I searched her first name she came up immediately.. some people I know also follow her. It shouldn't be bothering me this much but this is the same girl who threw me to the ground and told me to eat dirt, the same girl who taunted me and made me feel worthless. I currently deal with social anxiety and though it's getting better, I felt helpless again. I don't know why I feel this way and I hate it. Is it jealousy? or bitterness?

518,"My laptop is a dell inspiron 14 3000 and I've had it for about 2 years now. I've been using it mainly for school and gaming though. The issue that I've kept having is that the screen randomly turns to black. However, whatever program I'm using still runs. Sometimes after the laptop would eventually shut down. It occurs during when I'm playing or when I'm just watching youtube. Worst was when I was taking an online exam then. I know my laptop isn't really for gaming so I've always kept gaming on it to a minimum. And because of this I'm deciding to possibly buy a new laptop preferably for gaming however as the situation right now isn't good it might take some time for me to buy a new one.

519,"I (M, 24) have always been an introvert. Making friends was always difficult for me. During school it usually happened because I was ""forced"" to be with other people and my friends were the people sitting next to me.  
After school I realized I didn't have any deep friendships at all as contact broke off almost immediately and I've been pretty much alone for the last 4 or 5 years.  


At my job, the average age seems to be around 50 (at least it feels that way) with the youngest person besides me being already 30. It doesn't look any better with my hobbies (things like astronomy (which I like to do alone anyway) and archery, etc.).  


I just don't know what I'm supposed to do now. I hate clubs, I don't really like going to bars, and even if I doubt I could talk to anyone as I'm not very confident in myself.  
What I often hear is the usual ""just go outside"" advice but I don't understand that one either.   
Do people just randomly talk to you when you're outside? Do you randomly talk to people?  
I don't see that happening (as it has never happened in my life) and I'm not sure how to initiate a conversation with a random person anyway.

I need help with music recommendations. I've been stuck in the metalcore scene for years and I want out. I want to try something more positive and it's hard because idk where to look. The closest I found was synthwave and punk goes pop but it's not exactly what I'm looking for. I've been told to try rap and I listened to some J Cole and Kanye and I liked most of it but that's not exactly it either. I tried some viking folk music and that was dope but it's kinda hard to find.  
I mostly listen to music at the gym so if it's something that does not hype me I'll probably remove it from the playlist and recently the it has gotten so short it can't last through half the workout. Here are some that do:  
Johnathan Young - SKYRIM THEME - Dragonborn  
Hacktivist - N\*\*\*\*S IN PARIS

I go to, or went to, a well recognised college and my parents were really proud of me for getting into the college. In family get-togethers my parents spoke fondly of it, and my little cousin looked up to me as someone smart...

I failed a few modules in 3rd year and it's failed the course, and I feel like I'm going to let everyone down when they find out. I know my job prospects will be effected, and my situation just feels awful

I took a gap year after 2nd year and any internships fell through so I went home and worked a factory job doing 12hr nightshifts bc that's all that was available, and that's what my parents will force me to do if I go home and can't find another job asap

I have about 3 weeks until I have to move out of student accommodation... the dream would be that I get a job and just rent somewhere but finding a job is the kicker. I've been having real issues worrying about what comes next. I can't go back home and get funnelled back into the agency/factory work... it's just not an option for me

Anyone that's seen someone go through this or have been through this, can you give some advice?",01Jun2020,1

A seried of books and a few toy houses

My grandparents gave the books to my uncle so today my mom asked if she could get the houses

They talked about it before but it came up today again 

My grandma told her that she will be giving the houses to my uncles wife 
My Uncles wife wants them so she can sell them because they do have some actual value 

My mom got upset , she had tears in her eyes but didn't say anything, she just told her that they mean a lot to her because she has a lot of memories with them 

We went home and she started crying behind the steering wheel

So I wrote a '' speech '' 
I was planning to go to my grandfather and take hime for a walk in a park and just tell him everything that happened

And them I started to overthink everything

It feels like to me when things are handed to me (ex a home, food, ect)I abuse them and never get anything done. My mental health is meh I see a therapist every two weeks and am on meds for it. It does not help that during this quarantine I started to smoke weed again and this to everyone is the route of all my problems.

My parents spread drama about their kids and home lives. Some of which is personal things about me and I do not agree with it.

526,"For a little bit of context, I am nearing my senior year of high school and throughout my whole school career, I haven't been able to get into a close relationship with someone. The only close friends I've ever had were online friends that I played video games with. Looking back now, I took everyone for granted. I wish I had done things differently, but I honestly hate this mindset of regretting. After I stopped talking to all my online friends, I didn't have anyone and became very lonely. I was in a shitty place mentally. This past couple months, ever since I started watching this streamer, I've actually brightened up a lot and he helped me get out of this mindset. My mental health right now is at the best it's ever been. Soon I am even going to go to therapy, so I won't be there again. However, my fear is that when I am all well, I will fall back into a pit of loneliness and hopelessness once again. I've asked this multiple times in the past and I've gotten answers like: ""Friends aren't everything in life"" or  ""Go to a sports club or something"". Although I agree with the advice, I feel like I've learned how to properly take care of myself without relying on others, but I still feel stuck despite that and I feel I need close friends that won't be afraid to criticize me when I fuck up.

529,"Hello, I’m here asking for advice for something that truly confuses me. A couple days ago I woke up to find one of my driveway lamps knocked over. I checked my Nest camera immediately after this to see if anything happened the night before. As I was searching through, I found someone on my camera at around 3:30 am. It was hard to see clearly, but he was hooded and possibly walking a dog. He was walking normally but then stopped at my driveway and took out his phone to use the camera. He then used his phone to take pictures of our trucks with the flash on (My father is an electrician). After he was done going around and shining his light at the trucks I heard him tell someone “You just blew my shit” and ran off to the other side of the street. 

Is this something that I should be concerned with? If so, what is the next best choice of action?

531," Hi guys. Really need some advice on the two models.  


I am thinking of buying either a 13"" MacBook Pro (2020) higher-end version (no upgrade), i.e. **10th-gen model with 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM** OR the **8th-gen model with an upgrade to 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM.**  


The prices for the two models are: **SGD2549 for 10th-gen, SGD2319 for 8th-gen**  


Even though many reviews have recommended not buying the 10th-gen model over the base 8th-gen model because it isn't worth the money for not so significant CPU power, I have seen people recommending topping up S$230 from the upgraded 8th-gen model to the 10th-gen model.  


Here is my situation/use cases:  
1. I am a full-time software developer, but I do not need to use my own laptop for work, probably for **leisure coding/practice coding**  
2. Will **not** be using for intensive video/image editing  
3. Will be connecting my laptop to a Dell mid-range monitor via **HDMI/Display port**  
4. Most of my peripheral devices will need to connect via **USB 3.0**  
5. Will likely to use for an average of 5 hours on weekdays, 8-10 hours on weekends  
6. Will **not** be using for gaming  
7. Don't mind buying an external speakers instead of using the laptop's speaker (considering Creative A250 Speakers)  


Do you guys think that I should really top up $200 for the 10th-gen instead of the upgraded 8th-gen? Would really appreciate your opinion!!",01Jun2020,1
532,"Bit of a backstory:

We've been friends our whole lives, I don't remember a time where I didn't know him. Over the last 5 years we've slept together a handful of times. Sometimes it's been a little weird afterwards, but it's normally it's fine. This time I was meant to go see him and stay for a while. We're both single at the same time for once, it was planned.

We had sex as soon as I arrived, and it wasn't great. It wasn't a short session and we were at it for what felt like a long time but he didn't finish and it just kind of came to a close. At this point I'm blaming myself - I'm kinda unfit, he's definitely not and me being out of practice kinda affected things after a while! I just couldn't keep up. Kinda felt a bit like I was being fucked rather than playing my part? 

My confidence felt well and truly knocked, and I feel like he should've picked someone else to invite to his. By the time I'd got out the shower it felt awkward. Over the course of the day we relaxed and we had fun, we laughed and joked, watched films and it felt alright. I did get the same awkward feeling a few times but we felt like we were normal. 

The next morning we had sex again and it was better, I felt like I'd contributed more this time. He still didn't finish again, apparently his ex couldn't do it either and he didn't seem bothered. The rest of the day just felt so unbelievably awkward, it felt like I wasn't welcome. He was quiet a lot and it felt like he wanted me to go. So I asked him if he wanted me to get out of his space and he said yes. He wasn't mean about it in anyway. In the next 10 minutes I'd collected my stuff and left. I left pretty much 24 hours after getting there. I cried the whole drive home. 

He's always been a closed off person, difficult to read and who won't really talk about feelings but I've never felt like that around him, he's always felt so comfortable to me. Just spending time with him is one of my favourite things to do. We talked a little when I got back, but I needed a few days to feel more emotionally stable so didn't reply. Now that I have I'm ready to talk, he's not replying to me.

Both for my mental health and the sake of our friendship I feel like I need to bring this up. How do I do this without fucking things up more?",01Jun2020,2

So in the past, my parents were my only source of life experience and formed my view of the world. I have cousins and stuff, with which I have a close relationship and my two grandmas, but I don’t talk with them about everything as much as with my family of course. As I was getting older, I became more and more informed through my smartphone (if that makes sense I don’t know how to formulate it else) and I formed my own view of the world. I’m a late repatriates, which means my ancestors were originally from Germany, moved to Russia because of benefits and my grandparents came back with my parents. We’re evangelical and I was baptised with 14 in this religion, in which I truly believe. My parents are conservative, but we got into a different church, because the other one was too conservative (no public swimming pools etc I hope you get the point). However my parents views are still conservative with stereotypes of people (blacks=damned because of ham, they’re lazy, make only trouble, are treacherous etc etc, white men=hard-working and so on...). When I was young, I agreed with them and this racism, because I knew nothing better. They weren’t and aren’t tyranns or force their views or religion on me, however I was heavily influenced. When I got to school and got my smartphone I slowly formed my own view on the world and as you know, the whole nazi-thing is a big subject in German schools, so I learned about all of it and am still learning. My parents are no nazis just for clarification again and they don’t do anything against black people (“or all people who come from Africa, the Middle East etc, they’re all the same, all black”) but avoid interactions between them. In the past, I disagreed with my father more and more because I could slowly but surely hear the generalisation and the pure racism out of their mouths. But enough context, this is getting too long, I’ll try to answer your questions though. 
Today at lunchtime, my younger sister asked me if I knew, what’s happening in America and for sure I knew, because I use reddit, but for all of my family it was like the first time they heard about George floyd and the whole protests. I explained it as good as I could and clearly pointed out, that George floyd did absolutely nothing wrong. Then my father started talking about all the bad stuff black people are making, how lazy they am and so on. He told us his experiences with “black people”, that he was defrauded by them and in which they are the ones, that are the big brown monkeys and beat up so many innocent white people. He once again recalled his stereotypes of the black man and the white man as explained above. As I was trying to point out his racism and his generalisation he just continued and talked about how bad they are. “The whites are so hard working and the black are just lazy asses, who want to have 20 women around them and don’t even want to try to work. You know, why they have it so bad down there (Africa)? They’re lazy” “So you’re just saying they should work and everything will be fine then? They live in the desert and are getting robbed by the whole western world” “if they live in the desert, why do the Israelis have it so good?” “Because they’re not getting robbed?” Btw my mum also shares his opinion, not as racist as him, but she also believes, that all the blacks that immigrated in our country will destroy our economy just like they did in their countries. The conversation continued and we got back to George Floyd and we (both sisters, mum and me) pointed out that George floyd did absolutely nothing wrong, as he wasn’t even resisting arrest. “No I can’t believe that. There clearly was a background story to this.” “No, that’s the whole fucking point” “You can’t tell me, they just got there and said ‘yeah let’s just arrest this guy’” I pointed out the video evidence but he wouldn’t believe us, that the American police is so racist, clearly the black dude did some bullshit and they had a reason. He finally gave in a bit, but he pointed out, that the blacks are making nothing but trouble like the looting, which I mentioned and clearly separated from George floyd, but he stood his ground. He then told us once again (and at this point my older sister was pretty annoyed as she always is when I have a discussion with my parents and just got up) how the Israelis did a great job killing the murders of the 1972 or so Olympiade in berlin, were 11 Israelis were kidnapped (?) and later killed, which he didn’t even knew the exact details like the counterattack in which they were killed, not directly at arriving. I then asked him if he would honestly believe the israeli media, which maybe stated, that they only killed the terrorists or the Palestine media, which would state, that the Israelis massacred thousands of people. He couldn’t give me a real answer to that one and at this point I was tired of discussing with my parents and just went with Einstein’s “it is more difficult to break down a prejudice than an atom”.

536,"Hey all, 

I’m somewhat at a loss of what to do in this situation and I could use any advice you have. Basically, I’ve been Facebook friends with my eighth-grade math teacher for probably ten years, and for much of that she has posted nothing. 

Within the last six months, however, she’s begun constantly sharing easily-debunked political memes, posts containing anti-Semitic tropes, and other articles that are clearly race-based without much real information — for example, “WOMAN WHO BAKES PUPPY IN OVEN WALKS FREE,” with a picture of an African-American woman. The site was some non-news blog. Another one showed a picture of a black guy photoshopped next to crosses that had been run over in a cemetery, purportedly suggesting he had run them over. As these protests continue, she’s sharing old articles of white cops killed by black men, and raging why those aren’t being reported on. 

I’ve called her out on some of the fake posts, noting that whatever content is easily disproven and that it’s her responsibility as an educator to think about what she’s sharing before posting. I’ve commented on the racist and anti-Semitic posts as well, noting that it’s incredibly offensive, for example, to share a photo of Auschwitz and suggest that Bernie may like it there because Nazi Germany was Socialist (yes, seriously). But it’s like running into a brick wall — she doesn’t even respond to my comments anymore, and I’m sure would delete me if she knew how to use Facebook. She and her conservative white friends just comment with no regard to fact or reality or context. 

Ordinarily I would just delete her and be done with it, but it’s been really bothering me for a long time, because she’s currently a TEACHER. And not even that, but a teacher at a poor, northern Louisiana middle school (named after a Confederate general...) where probably 80% of the students are black. How can she treat her black students appropriately if this is how she feels about black folks? How can she teach anything if she can’t research a bot-generated Facebook meme for veracity? It’s bothering me A LOT because she’s in such a position of power and in a position to shape so many kids’ lives, and I genuinely don’t know how she can if these are her views on race and the world. 

So I guess what should I do? Is this even any of my business, or am I getting worked up over nothing? Should I reach out to the principal or school board? Anonymously or by name? I don’t want her to get in trouble or anything, but it’s devastating to me that this is how she feels about life and race and equity. I sure wouldn’t want the teacher of my kids to have these views. Any advice is welcome. Thanks so much!",01Jun2020,1

He once again recalled his stereotypes of the black man and the white man as explained above. 

As I was trying to point out his racism and his generalisation he just continued and talked about how bad they are. “The whites are so hard working and the black are just lazy asses, who want to have 20 women around them and don’t even want to try to work. 

“You know, why they have it so bad down there (Africa)? They’re lazy” “So you’re just saying they should work and everything will be fine then? They live in the desert and are getting robbed by the whole western world” “if they live in the desert, why do the Israelis have it so good?” “Because they’re not getting robbed?”


Btw my mum also shares his opinion, not as racist as him, but she also believes, that all the blacks that immigrated in our country will destroy our economy just like they did in their countries. The conversation continued and we got back to George Floyd and we (both sisters, mum and me) pointed out that George floyd did absolutely nothing wrong, as he wasn’t even resisting arrest. 

“No I can’t believe that. There clearly was a background story to this.” “No, that’s the whole fucking point” “You can’t tell me, they just got there and said ‘yeah let’s just arrest this guy’” I pointed out the video evidence but he wouldn’t believe us, that the American police is so racist, clearly the black dude did some bullshit and they had a reason. 


He finally gave in a bit, but he pointed out, that the blacks are making nothing but trouble like the looting, which I mentioned and clearly separated from George floyd, but he stood his ground. 


He then told us once again (and at this point my older sister was pretty annoyed as she always is when I have a discussion with my parents and just got up) how the Israelis did a great job killing the murders of the 1972 or so Olympiade in berlin, were 11 Israelis were kidnapped (?) and later killed, which he didn’t even knew the exact details like the counterattack in which they were killed, not directly at arriving. I then asked him if he would honestly believe the israeli media, which maybe stated, that they only killed the terrorists or the Palestine media, which would state, that the Israelis massacred thousands of people. He couldn’t give me a real answer to that one and at this point I was tired of discussing with my parents and just went with Einstein’s “it is more difficult to break down a prejudice than an atom”. 


I don’t know what to do here and I never convince my parents in this discussions (my mom also is an antivaxxer (luckily after we were all vaccinated) and believes that 5G is bad but that’s an other topic). What should I do?",01Jun2020,1
538,"18M here... Almost 19. I won't write about my terrible past cuz that is not important for the current situation. Let me explain my situation.

I live with my father and older sister. Recently my father had some serious health issues and they keep stacking up even more. He was two months at home as a recovery period guaranteed by the law. The situation in that period got worsened. A surgery looks like to be crucial... The problem is.... The main one is i live in a really poor country, first of all im concerned about my father. We have an almost non-existent public health system. The main concern is about him and also if he has to do the surgery... most likely he won't be able to work for 3-4 months due to recovery. That will result in him losing the job which is our only financial income. Here everything falls apart  and it was impossible to find a job in regular days. I can't even think about it now during this crisis. I'm willing to work and sacrifice my uni progress but there is no chance here. Im the only one that is capable to work. My sister isn't allowed to work because their University has a policy with which they are forbidden to work untill they graduate or quit the Uni. im basically stuck and i have now an even larger responsibility on my shoulders. I had so far many things to take care of now this stacks up. I'm pressured by my uni and the exams and this quarantine and curfew drove me insane... Here the situation is even deteriorating and other restrictions will be implemented. Seeking help from the authorities is a big joke. Im tired of this stuff and my country. It has no future. I'm shocked about what was happening to me and what is happening to me now. I can't find a way nor a solution. Can anyone tell me what to do ?",01Jun2020,2

Feel free to ask me something if you are confused abt the whole situation. Another thing to note, it seems to me like the quarantine got to her head, because she never did this before.",01Jun2020,1
540,"So I have this ""friend"" let's call him tom. So Tom is quite a bit younger than me and we've talked to each other and played videogames for years. Tom has a tendency to guilt trip lie and accuse people. He's still very young and has just gotten to double digits in the past few years. I am 13 male. So I have severe anxiety and Tom has not helped that whatsoever, and has triggered a few brake downs. He has been bullied at school and the only reason I tolerated him was to attempt to help him fight his own anxiety (triggered by the bullying). But recently I've given up on him. Me and my best friend call him Dan were playing with him and he started to destroy my Minecraft world after we told him not to kill the village nearby. We got sick of him and removed him from the party. He started messaging us about how it's out fault that he wants to ""kill himself"" and he apparently thinks that the world would be a better place without him. Obviously I start messaging stuff like ""don't think like that"" and explaining a few things about how he can irritate us, at this point I had nearly had another brake down. We then message him telling him to tell his parents and talk to them. He said that he couldn't and we started to figure out what was going on. Dan told him that if he didn't tell his parents then he would himself, I wasn't all for this but Dan was insistent. Dan then told me that he had had those same thoughts in the past and knew a few others who had too (I hadn't known this so I got slightly angry that he hadn't told me when it had happened). Tom started messaging in exclamation marks saying stuff like ""no, you can't do that, I don't want then to know!"" Dan told me to trust what he was doing so I did. All of a sudden Dan says ""right I'm going to tell your mum about what you've told us"". Tom instantly changed tack and tried to divert the conversation. It turns out that yes he was lying. He had done so many bad things to me in the past that I began to hate him. He then messaged sla few days ago saying that he had told his mum. I asked him about it and he seemed like he had gotten himself so far down a rabbit hole that he had literally told his parents. I'm not sure now whether he does have depression and these kind of thoughts but after everything I don't care anymore, and I know I should. I have just recently gotten into a relationship with my crush and it's going pretty well, I want to focus on her and obviously we aren't seeing each other during lockdown. The relationship causes enough anxiety as it is so I don't want Tom on my mind. any advice?",01Jun2020,1
541,"Let’s go back to the start.

Just over 3 years ago I heard the news that my ex was pregnant. Thought it could be my child. We had a paternity test done and it came back negative. The biological father wasn’t/didn’t want to be involved.

I was the first person to hold her and immediately fell in love. She was this bundle of joy that I couldn’t stop loving even when I found out she wasn’t mine.

After a few rocky years with her mother she decided to call it off last week. I haven’t seen my step-daughter now for a week, I think I have just ignored the overwhelming feeling of needing her company this past week while trying to keep myself busy and sorting out my new life.

All of a sudden today I have really started to crave her company and her joy. Can anyone help me in how I begin to recover from this heartbreak. TIA.

Background:

Just finished freshman year in business (marketing). It was nice and chill but damn do I hate it with passion due to reasons. The only thing is, I'm good at that course since I was trained and prepared to venture into business when I was in senior high school, I took accountancy and business management. 

So finished my freshman year with great grades but one thing I realized is I don't think I'll pursue it anymore. I'm planning to switch to medical technology since I was always fascinated about the human body and etc. The problem is, I don't have any basic knowledge about anything when it comes to biochemistry or anything related to STEM besides, physics, chemistry (two whom which I failed) and biology.

546,"Hey everyone. So I had a problem recently with my family. I decided to go on a run one day as I am training for a physical fitness test, I didn't decide to go to my local park because there are a lot of people there trying to get outside. So I decided to go around my parents neighborhood to run around because I know it's secluded and I'm familiar with the area. I then decided to drop my keys and wallet and phone in my parents house, went in for 10 seconds and no one was home, no big deal. 

During my run I see my parents and my sister and her family walking with my parents. I then said ""Hi"" to them and my sister responds with ""Did you go into Mom and Dads house?"" I was taken back a bit, and said ""Just to drop off my phone and wallet"" and after I finished my run, my phone and wallet and keys were left outside and I was getting lectured on my phone that I couldn't see my parents because I'm going to kill them and I would feel bad about myself for the rest of my life. 

It made me feel super shitty, not because I was wrong, but because I was treated like some infected zombie when I had not been sick and have been quarantined for the last 2-3 weeks. She claimed because I didn't order my groceries I could potentially be a carrier. So I didn't say anything and blocked her because I didn't want to say anything I regret and didn't want to get lectured about how I'm killing my parents. So after some time I get a call from my parents and they start yelling at me for not talking to my sister and calling me a 12 year old girl and a pussy and I needed to apologize. I hung up because it was making me feel even worse. 

So I call up my sister and I said ""If you could even acknowledge how I felt or apologize I can forget all this"" and she then told me ""I'm never going to apologize because I'm in the right and protecting my family"". Then she started lecturing me again until I apologized just to end all this. I haven't talked to them since, but I have to go pick up some forms at my parents house and I can already tell there is going to be an argument, I don't know how to handle this and could really use some advice.

548,"Dear reddit, I don't have anyone to talk to about this subject, so I'm here to hopefully get some advice and possibly answers to my problems. I grew up in a Christian family, my dad being a Catholic and my mom is a Protestant. I also study in a Catholic school (currently transitioning into a Protestant school) and I grew up in a Christian church/community.

I am starting to question why everything is happening, and I'm starting to question my religion and faith. I feel as if my religion does not fit my view of life. For example, my mom absolutely hate the gays even if she does not show it that often. Both my parents are also a little bit racist. I see those characteristics in most religious people but I am very againts it. But I really love my religion, it gives me comfort and I do truly believe in a higher power/God, but again, I do not agree with some of the ""rules"" that they have. Or am I the bad guy? After all, I'm only 14 and I don't understand a lot of these things.

Another thing is that, a lot of people seem to be againts Christianity and the existence of God in general. They say that these things are wrong and people should not believe in religion. They say that religion contradicts science and that there's no way people that have religion truly believe in technology and the art of science. But I do believe in technology and all the work that has been done by scientists, it's truly incredible what things have been achieved by them. These inventions and creations that has been made by human hands are truly incredible. But again, I feel left out because most people do not like it when there's a Christian in a tech conversation, saying things like ""Oh you're Christian, Christians don't truly understand and believe in technology"" or something like that and it makes my heart ache. Or maybe it's just me being sensitive to what people say, idk.

I also have a lot of questions like, why do God allow some people to suffer so much, or am I questioning things too much? Maybe it's me who can't understand God's plan? Who knows.

Sorry if some of my questions don't make sense, I'm just trying to let my heart out. I can't talk about this to anyone in my country because my country is very religious and questioning religion/faith is very frowned upon. If you guys have any advice, please tell me. Don't be hesitant to give me advice or :D Thanks, reddit. I've never been so relieved in my life, I have bottled this up so much.",01Jun2020,1

Thing is I already talked to them about it and they said they didn’t want me to leave so that shop has sailed. However they very clearly don’t like me nearly as mush as each other and my house is the only place we really hang out so they may even just be using me to hang out here.

Its happened multiple times and i accept her apologies right away usually but im starting to feel like im being a doormat this way. And like its empty apologies.
The problem is that i cant really feel angry with her for long, no matter how disappointed or angry i am at the time of the arguments. 
Tbh we both need to see some therapists (for personal problems) but that just isnt an option currently.

562,"TL:DR; I questioned a group member about using a copyright date for in-text citations for a paper. She said in-text citations with n.d. are unreliable &amp; then took all in-text citations out as they are only needed for a direct quotation. I emailed the professor for confirmation as I didn’t learn it that way. Professor said in-text citations are needed, and she bitched me out for posting a screenshot of the email. I switched groups after.

Looking to find out if anything I said came off as disrespectful and if I handled the situation properly. Its the next day and I'm worried it seems like I overreacted and my professor will think that too.

Hi all, need some opinions on this whole ordeal. I am new here so I apologize in advance if the layout or format is wrong! I am sharing all this because I’m genuinely confused about the entire thing, and if my responses came off as me being rude.

I am in a group project for an online class that is due in August, worth 30% of our overall grade. My group consists of me and 3 other people. We got into a bit of a debate about APA citation and in-text citations. This was our first group assignment.

For a bit of background info: I started the assignment earlier this week and only one other group member had (#2) contributed. Then #3 contributed on Sunday morning. On Sunday afternoon, #1 sent out a huge text (attached below) stating there were some concerns.

I’m attaching the screenshots to our conversation, listing each person as 1, 2, and 3. First few are from our group, then a comment I left on a google doc, then private texts between me and #1.

University guidelines state: ""Include an in-text citation when you refer to, summarize, paraphrase, or quote from another source. For every in-text citation in your paper, there must be a corresponding entry in your reference list.""

The thing is though, I'm well off. I have a lot of money saved, I live in a middle class family, I'm studying at uni (struggling), I have friends, I have hobbies, but the feeling of emptiness is getting stronger and stronger and it's taking over. I'm not depressed (I dont think), I'm just... scared? In a sad way? It's about life and death in general, and the thoughts are really clouding my view on reality.  I'm usually somewhat distracted during the day, but then when this mood comes in, everything I look at, I feel empty and sad and scared all at the same time. It's been an issue since I was a kid, but it's been getting really bad lately (past 2 years or so).

It's the feeling of, 'nothing matters. We're all going to die. Nothing I do in my life will have any meaning at all. Not in the slightest'. I mean, I wont ever get to see 99.9% of the world, and I won't get to meet 99.99999% of the current population. Every piece of artwork I make will one day be without an owner and in the rubbish. My position in society will be a 'thanks for contributing' sort of thing, and then that will be it. Who cares? Even if I get famous it wont matter. David Bowie will one day be completely forgotten, and that's just a fact. And this is just the surface. We are just a fraction of a fraction of a spec of dust in an ocean which is the universe. And most of the secrets, adventures, discoveries and natural beauties will be forever out of reach from us due to the expansion of the universe. And even if there are amazing things out there within our reach, it wont be in our lifetimes. Period. How can I live with that? And I'm so sick and tired of complaining about this stuff. Because everybody experiences these thoughts. Though it's getting worse and worse, and I've never met someone who felt these existential feelings as much as me. It's really effecting my everyday life now. 

How can I live happily, knowing everything and anything I do in my life will hold no meaning at all? The only thing that matters is temporary satisfaction and happiness. And what gives me happiness? A few things. But it's only a distraction. And I'm becoming increasingly detached from reality to the point where I feel like I'm dreaming. Even typing this feels so surreal. I'm just looking through a pair of eyes that will one day die along with the brain controlling them (no I'm not on drugs). Am I asleep right now? Am I going crazy? Is this one big joke? How is everyone so blissfully unaware that there's no point to all of this? I'm so over hearing the same old 'life is what you make of it'. Man, what am I supposed to make with it? A bunch of distractions to convince myself I'm okay with one day dying?

And what's a psychologist gonna do? Because my feelings are real. They are based on facts. Reality. There's no sugar coating it, and there's no workaround. So how can I get out of this hole? How can I work on accepting life as it is? Any help is much appreciated.",01Jun2020,2

Lately I’ve been feeling so disconnected from him and unfulfilled in the relationship. He works 11-5pm three days out of the week and since quarantine I don’t have a job and been stuck at home with nothing to do. I basically just get dressed and wait around all day for my boyfriend to get home from work, just anticipating hanging out and spending time with him. Well for the past two months he’s been not making an effort at all. He comes home and runs right onto his computer to play games and puts his headphones on. Either that or sits on his phone watching videos not even paying attention to conversations I’m trying to have with him. 

Yesterday was really the icing on the cake. He got home from work and picked me up to go get some food. After we got the food he told me he’s going to go hang out with his friend. I’ve hung out with him and his friend countless times before and so I asked how come I can’t come with and he said he just wants to hang out with the boys. I totally get that, but it just hurts because I wait around all day for him, excited to spend time, and he just leaves which results in me going home by myself for hours doing nothing. Am I wrong for being upset about this? He left around 8:30 last night to hang out with his friend and wasn’t back until almost 1 am. And when he got home he basically went straight to bed and we’ve barely talked since. I’ve been shutting him out since last night because I’m just so exhausted from being the only one making an effort. 

I don’t know if it’s because since we live together he hasn’t been making much of an effort since we’re always around each other or what. I know we’re both super comfortable with each other and we always say that we’re each other’s best friends but lately it feels like he’s been just a “friend” to me and not treating me like an actual girlfriend. I try to make efforts to still doing relationship stuff, like the other week I had bought us food and had set up a picnic date for us to have at a park and he barely sat down and ate with me. He just kept walking around or going back to the car. 

Not only that, but he likes to crack jokes and pick at me a lot. I’m a sensitive person to begin with so I try to keep in mind that sometimes I take things to heart when it’s not that deep but recently it’s just been so much. I can only take so much joking and picking. I’ve tried to tell him before that the constant jokes and making fun is getting on my nerves and he still does it. I don’t want to end our relationship, I still love him very much. At this point I’m just stuck on what I should do to get that spark back I guess. He used to be so loving and caring all the time. Constantly setting up dates for us, doing things for me, just being a boyfriend and it’s not like that anymore. I know we’re far past the honeymoon stage but it would just be nice not being the only one fighting to make an effort. 

I’m just lost at this point. I need advice on what I should do about this situation. PLEASE HELP",01Jun2020,1

570,"This is going to sound stupid because it really is.

This is your warning that I'm going to be talking about something that can be triggering.

I (F16) still haven't gotten out of the house. I live with my grandma, uncle, aunt, and my aunts 2 kids because my mom can't take care of me. My youngest cousin (F5) we will call her Sarah, is allowed to do whatever she wants.

Some backstory: I grew up in a strict foster family where I dealt with a lot of abuse to the point where I couldn't tell what was really abuse and what wasn't. Sarah on the other hand (thankfully) has had a good life. She's gotten whatever she wants and never wants anyone else to get attention. 

Since the time she was 2 and I was 13, I've been living with her and she is mean to me for everything.
I just breathe and she will walk over and tell me I'm ugly and worthless and throw stuff at me and hit me because she can. She's even gone so far as to say I should just end it all because no one wants me around.

Before anyone says ""She has to have heard all that from somewhere so maybe she's gone through the same."" No, she's learned it from listening to my mom talk to me and she knows it hurts my feels and makes me isolate myself. If I isolate myself then I don't steal her attention. That's how things were before I was dumb enough to move in again.

I know I shouldn't be complaining like this. She's 5. Her words shouldn't hurt me but they do. I'm tired of being shoved by her and having things thrown at me. I can't tell if it can even be considered bullying because she's only 5.

Fast forward to yesterday when I visit the place for the first time and get registered.  Guy asked for my student ID and I said I didn't have it.  He said I needed to bring it next time...  So I could:

a.) fess up, do the right thing, admit I lied, and pay the difference in cost for the non-student discount...

b.) sign up for a class somewhere that will issue a student ID and pay several hundred more dollars than the difference in pass price ...

I'm 16 and want advice for the future, since schools are closed and my GCSEs got cancelled, I don't really know what I want to do, “Options day” is also cancelled so I can't get advice from teachers on what I should pursue as a profession. Currently I am doing google classroom courses for subjects I am thinking of pursuing. 

For my GCSE’s I took Maths- HIGHER, English, Geography, BTEC ICT, Science- COMBINED and RS.  

I wanted to pursue Art and design for A- levels however I didn’t take it for GCSEs hence I can't do it. Not as interested now than before because of this. 

I am thinking of taking Biology, Physics, possibly ICT, Sociology and Technology for my A- levels. 

In the future I want to pursue either Law, Photography, Architecture, Biology, Physics, Psychology, Something in Game design, character design or some form of design and technology job, I'm also interested in coding. I really don’t know what I want to pursue as I'm open to almost anything and not necessarily passionate about something more than something else. Out of what I want to pursue I only studied physics, biology and ICT (for game design) for my GCSE’s. However also want to pursue those other things but just don’t know what exactly. 

In conclusion I would really like help to figure out what I want to take for A- Levels, and then for Uni or an apprenticeship. Any personal experience, salaries, level of difficulty of job and education leading up to that job, as well as how long it takes to get a degree to practice a certain job, also the demand for the jobs, the future of the industry, what degrees I need for said job etc.

580,"Hey guys,
    Today I wanted to ask if anyone had any advice for me with a problem I have been having since January. From October 2017 to January 2020, I had my first REAL girlfriend (as lame or pathetic as that sounds) and I really thought we would be together for a very long time. One day in January tho she just called me over the phone and said ""Hey, we gotta break up, we can still be friends, but I feel like for you to get over me, we shouldn't talk anymore for awhile"" and before I had the chance to respond, she hung up. This may make me sound pathetic, and I do fully think I was being pathetic, but I kept trying to text her for about 3 days and everyday she would either say ""(My name), we can't talk anymore, I'm happier without you"" or she wouldn't say anything at all and just blow off that I texted her. Another thing to keep in mind is this happened BEFORE the whole current situation that prevents us from going outdoors without wearing a mask. 
After about 2 weeks of missing her, I decided I would talk to this other girl and try to fill the void. Unfortunately, that void just ripped open wider after I dumped her because of the realization that, ""Damn, maybe I really screwed up this time and probably won't find another girl, at least in this time period, that will be that amazing to me.""
My first girlfriend was better to me than my own parents were and she was so patient with me. And I know a lot of people might think I'm exaggerating, but when I say I told my parents and her I felt like killing myself and my parents said ""Do it"", I mean that it happened. 
So...for reddit I only have 3 questions. The first one is how do I get over this? Or should I? I know I should and it would be best for me. But not being able to leave my house to hang with friends really doesn't help my mental state, and I'm really getting fed up with the video games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Far Cry 5. I can't seem to find something worthwhile to keep my mind off things.
My second question is should I message my first girlfriend back? I haven't talked to her in about 2-3 months...maybe she and I can talk? Or maybe I'm being a pathetic, dillusional wuss again and I should just forget about her...?
My third question is should I just forget about dating altogether for the time being? With the current situation and the fact that leaving my house could piss off my parents in more ways than one, I feel like I wouldn't even be able to hold up a good relationship anyway for very long. I also am trying to grow up to be a computer scientist of some sort, and I feel like education will always be 10x more important than any girl. 
Any advice at ALL would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking precious time out of your precious day to learn about and help out a stranger who you don't even know. Thank you guys",01Jun2020,3

582,"Hi, I'm thinking about quitting my job for fear of getting infected with the coronavirus. My mom is thinking about quitting too. We work in the same company. My city is transitioning from ECQ to GCQ (Less strict quarantine rules and people are pretty much free to roam plus malls are open). 

During the pandemic our company transitioned from working on site to working from home. However now the ECQ has been lifted, a memo was released that the employees will slowly be reintroduced to working on site. 

Most likely our company would provide a shuttle service for commuting to and from our homes. However a big factor why I considered quitting was because my coworkers arent the brightest bunch. They would most likely roam around and party now that quarantine is lifted. Theyre the type to not think about the consequences of thier actions. There was one too many times in the past where a regular flu spread in our office just because someone refused to go on a sick leave. 


Im weighing other pros and cons here:

Pros of my job:
o A kick-ass HMO (Health care). It covers almost everything. It even covers my little brother. 

o High Pay for not much work

o Ive been with this company for 3 years. Been top performer in my site for 2 years straight and 3rd highest performer before that.


Cons of my job:
o a couple of shitty coworkers in general including some crap supervisors

o Enclosed air conditioned room (might increase risk of infection?)

o even if I was top performer, its pretty difficult to get hired in this company because the test for applicants has a 2% chance of passing. So if me and my mom quit, theres no gaurantee of being rehired.


Other factors at play: *Our family has a good amount of money (the problem is my dad tends to spend a lot, which worries me and my mom (the breadwinners) because she thinks he might go through everything quickly and we would end up with no money again.) But to give you an idea of how much we have in our bank, we could afford to buy a cheap house or an brand new decent quality SUV with that amount.

* I have life/medical insurance aside from my HMO so if I quit my little brother isnt covered anymore. However my moms life insurance doesnt cover medical unlike mine and my dad wont have HMO anymore (Hes covered by her HMO) we considered purchasing seperate medical insurance -and that costs about one months of my moms current salary per year of coverage.

*Mom and dad are high risk. Approaching senior age and both have hypertension.

*Government is not the best -And by not the best I mean they jail people making social media death threat posts on the president. A lot of positive covid case results are backlogged and tests way back then only have a result now. Politicians get away with breaking thier own rules and Citizens are also not exactly disciplined either. We dont really have unemployment benefits and not much government assistance.

Like on one hand we might get infected and die no matter how careful we are because other people in the office are just careless but we keep all our money? And the other hand we'd be safe at home and alive but theres a chance we might have a hard time finding another job and maybe 1-2 years down the line if we arent able to find a job we might go broke due to my dads spending habits.

Am I being paranoid and should I just go to work instead of quitting? Or does my mom and I have enough reson to quit?

Been thinking about this for a week now. Thanks.",01Jun2020,1

585,"So I've been friends with this girl for around 2 years now, and I've adored her ever since I met her. When I met her I was dating her best friend, but she she broke it off with me and hurt me quite abit. My friend was also going through the end of a toxic  relationship at the time and so we grew closer. My friend came out and said she liked me a while after she had broken up with her ex and I was estatic she felt the same way.

 We eventually ended up sleeping together on a more than one occasion. However she didn't seem to want to be in a relationship with me. I was okay with it at the time and decided to play the waiting game. We stopped sleeping with eachother around December last year and I was pretty upset she didn't reciprocate my feelings. 

At this point I was definitely in love with her. But I carried on being the best friend I could hiding my emotions about her along the way. I see her almost everyday still and she has recently been getting close to another guy. 

Don't get me wrong I want her to be happy and be in love, a friends happiness is a blessing but repressing my emotions has led to my mental health to be in a terrible state. I've made more than one attempt on my life recently because of it but I don't ever want to bring it up with her because I don't want to be the guy that gets in the way of her relationship. And I know it would cause resentment between us if I did.

 She has said around our friend group that we used to be 'fuck buddies' and that was like a knife through the heart to hear her say that, especially when she came out and said she like me first. I know I was most likely a rebound for her. I know I have no chance of romance with her. I just don't know how to get over her considering we see each other so much. I don't want to end our friendship over this because in the end we are best friends and she has stated multiple times she wouldn't know what to do without me. 

She's all I can think about even after all this time and it's literally killing me knowing she is with someone else. I am clueless about how to deal with this. It's awful for my physical and mental health to be friends with her, but I don't want to loose her in any fashion and she is one out of my 3 friends. 2 of which are her best friends also.

Basically, recent events have made it very clear that I am not wanted at home, nor do i feel safe there. My country is currently still in lockdown and I have a dog that I could not leave there, so I can't just go and stay with a friend for a little bit.

My grandparents live about a 40 minute car journey from us, and they've always been very supportive and are the only relatives I trust.
They are both considered high risk and are not allowed to leave their house other than for shopping.

My only option right now is my grandparents, and I'd feel a lot safer staying with them, but I don't want to put them at risk.
The friends I've spoken to about this have all agreed that I should at least ask to stay with my grandparents, but I feel like it would be unfair to them.
The way I see it, there are two possible outcomes. They agree to let me and the dog stay, which would put their health at risk, or they say no and feel guilty about having to do so. But if they were to decline, I know for a fact that they would want to discuss why I had wanted to stay and would try and fix it, which would undoubtedly make things worse.

594,"Ok so I started dating this guy that I really really like, but I have 2 concerns right now:

1. During quarantine obviously we had to stay home, and we were doing a really good job at keeping up with each other and talking for a good amount of time almost everyday. Well at some point we both had to focus on school so we talked a little less. Our conversations were mostly a couple of jokes or just to say goodnight to each other. This lasted like 2 weeks. Anyways, I overthink very easily and I always assume the worst is happening/is about to happen so I feel so anxious that I won’t be able to hold a good conversation again and he will get bored. The overthinking just makes it so much worse and I don’t know how to stop. I need to transition back into acting natural again but I don’t know how to start.

2. We just went out, and I knew he was going to kiss me and I thought I was “prepared” or at least as much as you can be, but when he did it I got super nervous and realized I didn’t know what to do. My coping mechanism is to laugh, so I did, and we tried again but it just wasn’t working because neither of us knew what to do. I felt that butterflies and fireworks feeling on my end,  but i don’t think it was ideal that I kept pulling away out of nervousness. I could tell that he didn’t really like the way that went and the atmosphere got a little awkward. I tried to make it better by making jokes and just switching the subject, but I don’t think that worked too well. 

Anyways, I guess what I’m asking about is what do you think about this? I think a lot of my conclusions come from anxiety, but I can’t shake this thought that something bad will happen because of these things?

605,"Idk if this is the right subreddit, as all the other questions I see are much more serious. 
But since covid I’ve been working at home, and my office sits abandoned. My stuff is still in there &amp; my boss texts me to ask that I come get all my stuff, as I’ve decided to permanently work from home. 

He said “I need you to sneak in today or tomorrow and clean your office. There’s booger TP and stuff in there.”  

BOOGER TP ?!?!,
 
I will admit, I am a chronic nose picker and usually tear off a piece of tp from a roll in my desk &amp; dispose of my findings there. And throw it away in the trash. 
Based on this text I can’t help but think I accidentally left the tp with boogers on it, on my desk?? And forgot to put it in the trash?? 
I’m mortified. 

He could just be safely assuming that the tp in my office is used for nose blowing, right? 
But what if he’s not, and my worst nightmare is true????

Is there a way to dig myself out of eternal embarrassment? 
How do I play this off as it NOT being boogers?
What resembles a booger wiped on a piece of tp?

I’m picturing myself walking in, finding the nasty, very obvious boogie filled tp just laid out on my desk. I pick it up, laugh it off, and as I’m throwing it away I say “oh you thought these were boogers??? Hahaha that’s so funny because its actually _______.”

But I seriously can’t think of anything that looks like boogers that I would be wiping on tp.

611,"Kind of a long post here. Been a crazy past few days. 

I’ve been raised in a very Christian, southern household (nondenominational) and my parents are both extremely devout, my mom more so. Being stuck inside and away from college the last few months has made several hard conversations come up. 

I’ve always thought differently from my family; they’re very strong conservatives and I’m pretty left in my values. In the last year I finally came to terms with being bisexual, despite knowing since I was 11. Before now, these were things that I could brush over since I’m hardly ever at home (school, keeping summer jobs). 

Yesterday evening, my entire family (with my two siblings, one who is also not straight) got into a heated debate that turned emotional. My mom is a hardcore, unemotional person, but the only things that upsets her is when I hint that I’m doubting my belief in god. Though I’m certainly not irreligious or even agnostic, there have been occasions where she’s accused me of being atheist or “influenced by the liberals.” After confessing that I’m wavering with my beliefs and asking for her to actually listen to my problems, she got very offended and took it as me telling her that she failed as a mother in some way. She didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day, and isn’t talking to me so far today. My dad genuinely listened to us, and talked to us for a while after she left, though we disagreed on many things. 

Though the bisexual thing is something she’ll never know (unless I’m outed), I just wanted to be open about how I don’t feel the same way towards god as she does, at least not at the moment. It felt like a weight off my chest at first, but now I just wish I had avoided saying anything. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this? Or how to get her to talk to me? I want to be close to my family no matter their feelings towards me.",01Jun2020,3

I was brought on as a video editor but, due to the needs of the startup shifting away from what I was brought in for, I've been mainly doing customer service for about a year, along with whatever video projects need to get completed as they come in (roughly once or twice every month or two). I've been working remotely since March, as has the rest of the team, given current events.

I've been interviewing for jobs on and off for a year now, mainly frustrated with how they are content keeping me on as a contractor even though I feel like I should definitely be an employee and be receiving benefits, especially since I'm handling work that was never in my contract.

Recently, I interviewed for a new job doing video at a different startup and it seems that they're gonna offer me something in the next week.

But that brings me to my issue -- how should I tell my current role that I'll be leaving? Should I compose an email? Send a message on Slack? Wait a week and a half until my next 1:1 meeting with the company's founder? I don't dislike my coworkers, just the circumstances I'm working under, so I want to do things right. My boss has been very forward over the past year during our 1:1's asking if I'm happy/okay with doing customer service work and I haven't complained about the role, mainly because I like being able to pay my bills and because I don't actually hate customer service in itself/it's something I'm good at.

616,"My friend Faisal (19m) lives with his parents, grandfather and brothers Fahd (15m) and Abdullah (26m). They all have the same father but Abdullah is from a previous marriage (different mother).

I (20f) was in love with Faisal before but he does not feel the same way so we are close friends. We bonded over our struggles with discrimination, people were calling him a terrorist because he’s from Saudi Arabia and people were saying that I’m dangerous because I have schizophrenia and BPD.

Faisal doesn’t like Abdullah, he posts pictures on Insta with Fahd and captions them “best brother in the world” and also said in class “I’m the oldest child in the family.” He constantly talks about Fahd and his other family members but barely mentions Abdullah or Abdullah’s mom. When he talks about Abdullah it’s always negative. Last week he brought Fahd to class to show him what college is like, another student asked “Do you have any other siblings?” and Faisal said “no” and then Fahd said “We have a brother” so Faisal said “He doesn’t count.”

I don’t know the full story and I’m aware that a lot of the time when kids’ parents get divorced they blame their stepmother/stepfather as the reason their parents aren’t together and also act nasty to their half/step siblings so maybe Abdullah did something to Faisal and his hatred is justified.

626,"Hi everyone,

26F here.

I'm planning on getting a therapist to delve into my predicament, but I just wanted to know how many other people have had similar experiences to me and how you broke out of it.

\*

In 2019 and at the start of 2020 I felt like my life wasn't going where I wanted it to. I weighed 90 kg / 200 lbs, was in a relationship that was not fulfilling me and felt a deep sense of being stuck in life. I have all the tools I needed to thrive, yet I wasn't and still aren't. I would ignore my issues by stuffing my face full of food and pepped myself up on the dopamine that was flooding my system when binge eating to do only the most necessary of necessary tasks and maintained a facade of being happy. Underneath it all I felt hopeless and not making the most of life. It felt like when you push something down in your mind for a long time and then suddenly you just can't ignore it anymore and it drives you nuts. Kind of like when you lose a piece of a 1000 piece puzzle and it irritates you because it's just not all clicking together like it should.

Mid-January I dumped my ex; we were together for six years and he had become verbally and emotionally abusive slowly over a long period of time which damaged my self esteem over many, many years because I did not realise what was happening. I gained a lot of weight during our relationship because I was deeply unhappy.

At the start of February I decided enough was enough and started to lose weight. I am now 21 kg / 46.3 lbs down as of today and have never felt physically better in my life. More energy, more activity etc.

HOWEVER

I never expected to feel even more stuck in life since losing the weight of both my ex and my fat.

Emotions are hard to deal with and I just push them aside and ignore them. I haven't set goals or achieved anything that I needed to whilst quarantining, which should have been the perfect time for me to knuckle down at home and sort out my life. I can't figure out why I just don't do it. I have motivation to be social and talk to my friends, to work out and go for long runs or walks, to watch TV, cook and maintain my hygiene habits (I'm pretty militant about washing, cleaning the house and clothing etc). I just can't get motivated to move out of being stuck in life and just avoid things that overwhelm me completely.

Food was probably my only comfort for a very long time. It helped me deal with my emotions and now that I am not relying on food things just seem harder to start and/or achieve. I tell myself ""ahh you can just do it later"" but later never comes. I fill my time doing meaningless tasks to avoid doing what I need to be doing and then a day goes by, and another, until it's a week later and I've just talked myself out of doing something that was once important to me. Now I don't rely on food I just sweep my problems under the rug and avoid them.

I don't know how to get out of this very dark place that I am in in my mind when I have everything going for me. It's a really weird place to be in because I feel, on the whole, much happier now that I'm not binge eating or face the constant criticism I used to get from my ex.

Please let me know if you have had this experience with feeling stuck, and if so, how you overcame it.

Thank you very much for reading and stay safe x",01Jun2020,1
627,"Hello, stepmom of a 6 year old here. 

The little one is seriously testing my patience with lying about EVERYTHING she can. I read up about children lying and learned that around this age it's them trying to test boundaries and possibly gain attention. Its also suggested that lying shouldn't be directly addressed as long as it isn't a big lie, but it should be ignored and the subject should be changed. I'd like to hear your approaches to lying. I don't want to react in a way that with encourage her to continue lying.

She also has this need to deny every single thing that is told to her. Facts, truth, life lessons, everything. Is this normal? I should also state that the mother is almost completely inactive with discipline, so it's been a bit of a tough run trying to correct manners and inappropriate behaviors.

Please no negative comments, I really just want to learn the right approaches as my fiance works during the day and it's just me and the little one all day until this pandemic sees through. Thank you all.",01Jun2020,1
629,"My life's been a mess.

2019, was a tough year. I had a falling out with a good friend. My crush had someone else in mind. I felt alone and lost.

I keep telling myself that, if I keep pushing on, I would see the light at the end. Despite the loneliness, despite the urge to give up. I kept on going, and I achieved my goals.

But after that, I just feel empty. Like nothing's changed. All that hardwork put in and, I am still the same person. I am not special to anyone.

Then 2020 came hitting in like a truck, the first few months were a total hell. Everyone in college seems to be so arrogant. I thought they did be more mature than in highschool, but it's like dealing with a bunch of babies. Just a bunch of babies annoying you to no end.

And the couples, gosh, I know I should be happy that they found their happiness. I feel so shameful for saying this but I just feel so goddamn angry when I see them walking around, teasing, holding hands. 

My old friends couldn't care less. One straight told me I wasn't welcomed to be with him. He changed, started pushing everyone away, but I thought it was just me. I had so many sleepless nights thinking about what I did wrong. 

The others, were enjoying life, posting it on Instagram while I am barely coping with my studies. I went to hang with them once, I felt like I was invisible. Maybe it was because I was too quiet and exhausted, and that gave off a negative vibe, but it still hurts. 

People keep saying they hate 2020 because of the pandemic or they will be going on with their plans. While I just feel that I will be doing the same thing regardless of the pandemic. 

I developed the fear of talking to girls because I keep feeling I am not enough. Like they would never see me as a potential romantic partner. Like all I will ever be is, that guy, quite possibly a joke. I keep trying my best, but I have lost the motivation to. My sleep schedule's fucked and I am way behind in my studies. And I am addicted to a video game. 

I dealt with suicidal thoughts before, and made up my mind to not do it. However lately I found myself, in the darkest moments, to stared at the pair of scissors and blades. 

Maybe the pain will all just go away. I only stopped because I found out that its fucking painful and won't work 60'/, of the time. 

But it scares me because I am not so sure, if I would say no, if I had a quick painless way of going. 

My parents keep telling me that's just how life is. Battles after battles. But why do I have to go through so many hardships, only to die at the end. Why fight so hard when at the end of the day, no one would give a damn about you?

I couldn't tell this to my friends of family, they couldn't care less. Maybe would just nod and smile and just think that I am too weak. It just feels like i have to be happy and positive in front of them. Showing any signs of sadness is a weakness. I know I have a loving family and all, but I just feel like, what is the point anyways? Hardwork reaps reward, but getting that reward doesn't make you any better. You will still grow old and nobody would give a damn. 

What is the point? I really need help, please. I can't do this. I just can't.",01Jun2020,1

Here are some details and why I want to talk to him and why I don't. I am not rich and I do what I can to save electricity. He uses it everyday. The other day he was washing only 3 pillow cases and when he put it in the dryer, he let it run for 1 hour and 45 minutes(i actually mentioned that thats a long time and he quickly replied what? And that he just pressed the ""normal"" button). He comes from a very rich family. His parents never told him to conserve electricty so I dont think he realizes how much dryer use causes. He is pretty arrogant and will probably be offended if i bring it up, no matter how nice I am about it(I'm pretty sure his first response will be, ""DUDE, IM JUST TRYING TO DO MY LAUNDRY AND BE CLEAN!""). I dont know how much extra cost it is exactly. If its less than $5 more a month definitely not worth the confrontation. Right now he's washing his bath towel, nothing else. He also did have a surgery lately to remove a cyst from his back so i think its another reason he washes everything almost after use. He also showers twice a night and tends to take a bath in the afternoon.

I’m still a living meme. Still studying, parties, going out, tv shows, crying to my guy about something stupid. My friends are the same.
At times we think if we normal for our age or not.
There’s times where we would laugh and analyse shit no one does and spend hours laughing at it. Just last week we tied my friends shoe to a tree until we got told off by a lady who thought we were 16. When she found out we were 21 she looked so shocked and that said our behaviour shows other wise.",01Jun2020,2
643,"My whole life, my anxiety comes and goes. When it comes, it can stay for days, weeks, or even months sometimes. After an almost 10 year period of relative dormancy, it is now back everyday. And it is severe. 

The trigger seems to have been about a month ago. On back to back days, I found a yellowjacket inside the house. One was on the front door, so I figured he got inside the screen door somehow. But the next day, I found one on the kitchen window. Killed it and immediately called an exterminator. 

The exterminator came out, did a basic treatment of the house that he was scheduled to do anyway, and - after checking the house both inside and out - he told me he saw no evidence of yellowjackets nesting anywhere inside. He explained they fly in the house sometimes and could have come in when I opened or closed the door to let my dog out. It put me at ease...for about two hours. 

Shortly after he left, I found myself fixated on the idea that he had missed something and there were, in fact, yellowjackets in my attic or walls. So after a few days of *struggling* with anxiety/panic, I scheduled a second pest company to come out and check. This bug man was super nice and helpful. Older guy, very patient with all my questions. He spent about 45 minutes checking my house and said the same thing. He saw no evidence of a nest anywhere. 

That was two weeks ago and I have him coming out here again this week to look around because I can't get the fear out of my head or my heart.

I keep thinking about wasps. When I'm outside with the dog, I'm unable to relax. I check the exterior of the house and the garage incessantly. And when I do see one, I go inside for the wasp spray, follow it, and kill it. But even killing one doesn't put me at ease. I just sprayed what I believe to be a queen finding a new nesting site in some leaf litter and I don't feel relieved at all. I feel more anxious having been around a wasp. 

This is all so bizarre to me because it's like I'm more afraid of having to worry about them than of the actual sting. I was stung a couple times as a kid and, while it hurt, I don't remember it being the end of the world. 

But this is ruining my peace of mind. I find myself wishing it was winter everyday. I avoid outdoor activities when I can. On one hand, I'm telling myself this is just my anxiety and wasps are the shape it's taken this time. On the other, I've never been *this* fixated on something, anxious or not. 

Can phobias develop with little to no prior reason?

I appreciate any help. Thank you.",01Jun2020,1

647,"Six months ago I (f/20) was invited at a party. It was at home at a rich friend of my BFF's boyfriend. My girls from our swimming club (including my BFF) were invited as well, I didn't know anybody else there. But anyway, it was a good party and we had lots of fun.

In the late night, my girls and other guest started to leave the party more and more. Because my BFF was gone as well, I spent time with another girl pal. We were laughing and giggling together all night long, at the end we were the last guests that were still there. I noticed that I've never spent so much time with her alone before.

Later, we walked at home together (at least, we tried to walk), we held each other. We reached my home, which was directly on her way, so we could say goodbye at my door. So I hugged her before going inside. When I was about to releasy myself from our embrace, she kept eye contact and smiled at me. Then she came close to me and kissed me on my lips! It was not a tongue kiss, but very soft and lasted about a few seconds.
When I was in bed, I couldn't sleep and was thinking about her all night long. I've never kissed a girl before on my lips, never felt the need to and consider myself as straight. I only had relationships with boys before, and she as well. I must add that I never really had a longtime-relationship. At the beginning, my affairs were always exciting, but after a certain time it lost its appeal. It was so different to kiss her, couldn't say if it is better or worse than with a boy, it's just different. Her lips were so much softer and tender.

When I met her again, I first was afraid and it felt awkward. But she acted as nothing had happened. And after a while, everything was normal again. Since that day, we never talked about that and I even don't know if she can remember. Maybe it wasn't a big deal for her and there's no need to talk about it.

So weeks went by and everything was as usual. But after a few weeks, I noticed more and more that my relationship to her is changing. Meanwhile I even spend more time with her alone than with my BFF. I feel so relaxed in her company and enjoy hearing her voice and being with her. Often I feel bad for my BFF and hope that she doesn't get jealous. Also because of that, I haven't told her about our kiss.

And now, since we don't see each other anymore in person (because of the actual situation), I somehow want to kiss her again. I'm not sexually interested in her in any other way, I just want to touch her smooth and soft lips again, and express my affection to her. That confuses me so hard. But I'm afraid of asking her, because it's awkward doing that, and also could destroy our friendship. I'm not sure what to do",01Jun2020,1

649," I've always been having problems in school, my mother once told me that my elementary school said I had issues they couldn't figure out. 5th grade and up I couldn't read books or textbook passages at all- like I couldn't even focus enough to see any words on the page. Last time i can remember reading a book completely and understanding it, I was in the 6th grade.

I had issues also with sounding out words and still have that issue. My mother took me to a tutor and the tutor would try to help me sound things out- and wouldn't help me and would stay silent until I got it right. We would usually sit there in complete silence for a while. But I really don't know what letters make what sound when trying to spell like that.

In 7th grade, the class was assigned a book to read, and while i was trying to read it, i had been stuck on one page and couldn't get past it- and all of a sudden, the words started moving on the page- like floating and mixing together. I took a reading test, and my result was a reading level of about 1050, which was surprising to my family and my teachers as they believed i had dyslexia or other reading issues. But when the words moved around- the letters didn't separate they just overlapped other words and wouldn't stay still. I never got a test to see if I actually had dyslexia but I think I would know.

Around 9th grade, my school decided to put me into special ed, i didn't really understand why exactly- maybe because of my anxiety or my issues with math and English/reading. But it was really easy and I felt like I was going to slow and ahead of my classmates- but in normal classes, i couldn't keep up. Even in my special ed, I couldn't read anything but was introduced to audio books. I don't consider that reading though because I never looked at the words on the page.

In 10th grade, I started to notice that I couldn't focus on directions in class anymore. Which was very difficult for me in science and history. I felt like a idiot. Who couldn't read books, textbooks, or simple directions?

But I was writing very well and my special ed teacher noticed that I was doing way better than any of his students when it came to essays and creative writing. So that left me confused again, how can I write so good if I cant even read..

However, I realized that I could read fanfics that my friends would write with no problem- but yet again, when I would play games like animal crossing, it would take me a long time to read the dialogue bubble thing- which I actually caught on video. My mother told me that the problem was probably that I just didn't have any interest in things that weren't fun- but even when I was playing games I was struggling so that couldn't be it- i hope.

And that made me feel like I was pretending to have an issue. But every time I tried to do book-work or just read a published book for fun, I couldn't read a singe word or understand one sentence.

I started to think again- maybe I do have dyslexia... I did (though rarely) write some numbers backwards and my issues with pronouncing words and spelling them out was something that gave me concern. I just am getting no answers about this problem and I am truly struggling with school.

I just need to see if this is my fault or an actual problem..",01Jun2020,1

I want to let go of this. The complete fantasy is making it in my 20's and then resting on my laurels forever, therefore being loved and being allowed to relax and finally enjoy life.

I'm in my late 30's, all of this had not happened, and I feel scared and bitter because I cannot enjoy life or have a lover or fun in life because I'm ""not there"". I also have some previous painful attempt at making it that was actually low key and not that awesome, but I beat myself because in my distorted thinking ""I almost made it to glory"" even if the reality is different.

Harvard? tv?) and I beat myself a lot for having failed to do so.

653,"So I’ve (19F) been talking to this guy (23M)  for about five months now. I really really like him, I’m able to be myself around him and there’s no judgment we always have a good time together. I am at a crossroads because I really like him and I really wanna see where it goes but there’s just too many red flags. Number one every weekend he gets drunk and every weekend he gets into some stupid shit and something always ends in a fight. That never really sat well with me and I didn’t really like that but I was hoping it was just a phase. What’s made me question if it’s even going to work is how he’s been acting the last few weeks like we used to talk every single day, FaceTime every single day. Now I probably only get a maximum of 10 text messages from him all day and he doesn’t even call me anymore. Yes I understand that he could be busy and he does work, but so do it and I always find the time to text him. He still drinks a lot and the last time I saw him he was so drunk he could barely even stand I got out of my fucking bed at 1 AM to go pick him up and make sure he got home safely. I was so upset I didn’t even wanna look at him, I was so upset I was upset I didn’t want anything to do with them anymore. I drove him back home and he asked me if I can come inside and lay down with him and I said yes. He was cuddling with me and kissing me and one thing lead to another and we had sex for the first time. It was absolutely amazing and even tho I saw the worst in him that night  I also saw what I feel in love with and that night I truly fell in love wit him. He was so sweet and amazing and gentle and good in bed he made me feel good and it was a great night. The next day I barely get a word out of him and later on he goes and parties and I don’t hear from him until 4 am he eventually fell asleep and he just now texted me back at 9:30pm. I don’t know what to do because I really like him but I don’t want it if this is what I have to look forward to. I’ve done a lot already put in a lot more effort, gone out of my way to make sure he’s okay and he doesn’t get himself into trouble, but I don’t want to be a babysitter and I don’t want to fight for someone’s attention.  He told me that night that he really likes me and that he’s scared because I make him vulnerable. He’s told me numerous times that he’s not willing to lose me and that he wants me in his life. He’s one of those he can be brave through text but hell a shy in person. Whenever we hang out I  have to fight for his affection like a hug or a kiss or to even hold his hand. What should I do?

664,"I'm being harassed by a scam company. It keeps getting worse and I don't know what to do. I am in the process of making a fraud report. However, what do I do about the harassment? I have many mental issues as well as a physical disablement worsened by stress. This is only mentioned to explain that the harassment is difficult for me as the mental issues stem from abuse and so many similar feelings come up when becoming a target again. 

I came across a company on Instagram. I bought an eyeshadow palette from them as a gift. It didn't arrive weeks later. I tried to contact the company on Instagram. I wouldn't really get a response. I saw that they were extremely active on Instagram so I commented and suddenly I'd get a response. I repeatedly had to do this. They promised a refund. While doing this I looked more closely into their page which I should have done before and saw that the few comments made were from fake accounts who were commenting identical or similar things on multiple pictures. The refund never came so I contacted my bank to get a chargeback. I began getting emails from the company but I told them I'd sorted it with bank. The emails were far from what you would expect from a reputable company. They got worse and worse. All lies, insults etc. They tried to tell me that they had spoken to my bank and were going to get the money back. They even gave me a name and time coinciding with the made up call. I told them no way they had spoken to my bank. My bank confirmed this, not that I needed them to. In fact, no notes were on the dispute at all. 

I searched the company in Google and just a few links down I saw a review page. It was all bad reviews saying 'scam'. All had very similar stories. A couple mentioned being harassed. I left a review and in a not nice way of course, the company let me know that saw it. In an identical way to the others I began getting harassed. I dislike over use of that word but this is what it has become. I went onto Instagram to see a throwaway account was posting vile comments under my pictures, tagging people to them. No one wants that it's humiliating. Luckily for me, I have no followers. Under the review I left and in the comments of other reviews they began writing nasty stuff. Of course it was them. Firstly, it was at the exact same time as everything else happening but also, what person would happen across a review and start saying such awful stuff if they had no stock in the situation at all. Some other victims defended me in the comments knowing it was the company. I was then doxxed on their page. I didn't see it but I do know it gave my information. 

I was left disgusting voicemails on my phone. This means it's no longer just online but now is more invasive. My email and texts were spammed with refund confirmations. I started checking my bank because I knew it was going to be a tactic. Send me the refund and say I am the scammer. Lo and behold money was sent. This is weird. They need money so desperately that they set up an elaborate scam which puts their freedom at jeopardy yet they send me the money. The fact that they harass people this heavily shows their ego is more important. My bank are aware that they knew about me already getting my money and know about everything. 

Now suddenly there are Trust Pilot reviews. Guess what? They are all from the time this started. I feel sick about it. If someone was to see those reviews then they might buy a product, realise it's a scam, do something about it and have to face what I have. I desperately want to stop this from happening but every move I make causes more problems for me. They have my name, phone number, email, home address, bank details and social media. I fully expect something to happen with my home since everything else on that list has been messed with.
I'd love any advice on how to deal with this harassment. I believe the company may be a single person.

665,"A bit of backstory:

(Also i'll apologise in advance for any grammatical errors or spelling mistakes; English is not my first language)

I am a 17 y.o. male. My parents are seperated. I mostly live with my dad. 9/14 days with him and 5/14 days with my mother. In the beginning I was living with both of my parents equally (meaning 50/50 or 7/14 days with each). This changed shortly after my mother got a new boyfriend. I have autism which makes it extremely difficult to meet and get to know new people. They have been together for more than a year now and I still don't feel comfortable being in the same room as him. He also has two children both around me and my sisters age. They are both incredibly annoying (swearing, being immature and teasing each other constantly) and I'm constantly being compared to his daugther by my mother which I hate since she is doing really well in school and I'm not. Last year (2019) I was forced on a vacation with my sister, my mother, her boyfriend and his two children. The vacation was seven days long and we (my sister and I) had only know my mothers boyfriend and his children for a few months. I had told my mother many times in advance that I didn't want to go with them on that vacation. I was 16 at the time and so I didn't have a voice in it really. I told my dad about all of this and I actually cried because I didn't want to go. My dad told me to go on the vacation and just get it over with. He was very supportive and told me that if there was anytime during the trip I wanted to talk, he'd pick up the phone and talk to me. I went on the vacation and I ended up hating it to no surprise. I told my mother after the vacation that it was ""ok"" (mostly to please her and because it was finally over), but that I wouldn't want to do it again.

Now for the problem I need help with:

This year, my mother is doing the exact same thing. She wants me to go with her, her boyfriend, his children and my sister on a seven day vacation. She didn't even ask me if I wanted to go, she just booked the place after showing it to me once. I am 17 years old and i'll be turning 18 in August and so I feel like I should be able to say no to her and be able to choose wether or not I want to go with her on a vacation, if that makes sence. In my country you are considered an adult at the age of 18 and you can only truly decide for yourself at the age of 18 legally. The problem is that the vacation is due, before I turn 18 (in about three weeks from posting this). Otherwise, I would just tell her that i'm not going and there'd be nothing she could do about it. I have yet to confront her about it and tell her that ""I don't want to go"" but I fear that the same think that happened last year, will repeat itself. We talk about it, she gets mad, I end up going on the vacation because, in the end, I don't have a choice and also: ""I have to get to know them"".

I need help in terms of what to say to her. Maybe something about how I tried it last year, and so therefore I can say in confidence that I don't wish to go this year? Or something about my age? Any help would be much appreciated.

Btw, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this. I have tried to look for one that fits better, but couldn't find any.

667,"Hi r/Advice, long time lurker first time poster. My partner (M28) and I (F27) have been together for 6 years and today he asked to break up. Long story short, he's been my best friend eversince dating and he's all I've really known. We live with our families, and see each other maybe 1-2 times a week due to work. We've spoken about marriage, kids, I get along with his family, him same with mine and honestly we were ready to settle down. A few years into meeting him, I faded out being close friends with some girls from high school - we had different views on life, maturity levels, they were hanging out without me etc. This caused me to lose a lot of trust for people. It was tough, but he was there through it all and supported me. I essentially had/have no one else aside from him, his friends and my family. I literally don't have anyone who I could just pick up the phone and call to hangout. 

The reason for the break up is that eversince then, I've been dependent on him for company and my overall happiness. I know this for a fact, and we've fought many times in the past about this. I've tried so hard to work on this but find myself every now and again relapsing - wanting his attention on just me. He's a very social person and I often find myself moody or acting blunt/different if he was to hang with his friends. They never do anything bad, I know it's my insecurity and jealously seeping in yet I never seem to be able to control it. An incident happened over the weekend and seeing my mood change after his friend called, was the final straw for him. He's never been one to want to part ways and always said he'd wanted this relationship long-term from the start. He told me to take some time to focus on myself, to improve and grow as an individual. The ask for a break up really opened my eyes on how sick he is of the constant reoccuring arguments with my acting up when he has his own hobbies/friends.

We both cried, him crying the hardest I have ever seen. I asked him to reconsider and give our relationship one last chance but he said he's given me so many in the past already. After he left, I texted him and asked if he could take a week to rethink. I told him I will 100% work on myself and improve for the better. Improve as a partner, daughter, sibling and individual and know if he is willing, it will take a lot of effort for things to go back to 'normal' again. Despite me saying this in the past, him walking out has shown that I can lose him in an instant and I've taken all the other times for granted. I always thought he'd be around and I'm a fool for thinking so. I was like a lost dog asking for forgiveness.

I'm afraid of losing him because I have no one else aside from my family, but also because of my insecurities, this has caused everything we had worked towards to break in the span of one day. He said we will both take a week to think through the decision and for me to focus on myself, away from him. Ultimately I know my insecurity, emotional dependency, having no friends and being jealous of him doing his own thing has caused a massive strain on him. But this time I am willing to fight my demons, work on myself for the better and to prove that our relationship is still worth it. I'm finally reaching out to seek counselling to hopefully help with my mental health, have emailed about volunteer positions and am just focusing on me.

I'm conflicted, because despite still wanting him and our relationship to work I'm also afraid if he caves in and gives me another chance, it would be because of pity or he's too nice to officially leave. Has anyone been through something similar? What did you do to focus on yourself? Is there any way of reassuring him that I am taking proactive steps (unlike previous times) to show our relationship is still salvageable? Thank you for taking your time to read this far, I really appreciate it.",01Jun2020,1
669,"Hi All, Im 22M from UK

So to it down to basics, an Ex Girlfriend from around 6 years ago has reached out to me for some help. 

She is trying for a baby and her current Boyfriend is unable to produce children for some reason or another (I've never pushed him to talk about it much he seems to get upset when its brought up).

Anyways so basically She has asked me if I could get her pregnant, we both agree that we should keep this from our partners as this would create some tension as we used to date. 

Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated just need to hear other peoples perspectives. 

Cheers :)",01Jun2020,1
672,"I moved to this tick infested state 4 years ago, and I really thought I was gonna get out of here bloodsucking parasite free. Until this morning. Technically, my boyfriend found it, but didn’t know what it was. (“Is that pizza crust from last night?”) I didn’t either because I could barely see it. I grabbed it, and pulled. Oh my word, my heart raced when it took a righteous tug to pull it off. I already knew, but I still didn’t accept it. I held it up in front of me, praying to anyone out there, just let it be pizza crust. 

The legs squirmed. I screamed and threw it (still alive, fuck) into a corner of the room and fled. It can’t believe I got a tick on me during Stay at Home orders, when I’ve done nothing but stay home since March. I’m grossed out by every little itch I feel, and I still haven’t entered the bedroom. 

What do I do? I feel like this has to be a one off... right? We have a serious ant problem because our siding is destroyed (Landlord just... won’t fix it) on all sides of our rental, and now I wonder if that’s how it got in. If that’s the case...",01Jun2020,1
673,"Trigger warning: rape &amp; sexual assault

TL;DR - my rapist and his family/friends are stalking me online. The police can’t help me and I feel like I’m giving up if I just take down my social media profiles.

Seeking general advice on a specific issue that’s come up as a result of my sexual assault back in 2016.

I live in a really rural area, the kind of everyone knows everyone and no business is private kind of rural area. I got raped back in 2016, by one of my best friends of 10+ years. Now I’m not asking for advice pertaining to this. I did what you’re supposed to do. Called the cops, went to the hospital for a rape kit, cried hysterically, sought counseling, checked myself in on a suicide watch. 

Pertaining to this happening, and me filing a police report, it has taken the county 4 years to prosecute, set a court date, and settle the case. hence, it’s *still* ongoing.

I’ve tried to move on with my life. I began dating my current partner, found new friendships, switched careers. I’m currently 6 months pregnant with his child. The only reason I bring this up is because my victim’s advocate called me last month to ask me if I needed to update them about anything, alluding to my pregnancy. I gladly told her and she congratulated me, etc. Then, she disclosed that my rapist’s attorney had already informed their office that I was expecting. She asked me if I knew who was close to me that was feeding them information. I do not. 

I will say that I’ve taken precautions in that past to keep my life somewhat private, but that I still felt comfortable enough with my position in life to post on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram that we are expecting. My issue is that if this call was made in directly to my rapist’s attorney, someone has been stalking these profiles for a while and likely updating them about anything I’ve posted.

It’s the most unnerving thing I’ve experienced in my life short of being sexually assaulted. My options at this point are likely to make new profiles (which still doesn’t help me ascertain who is stalking me and I could potentially just add them to the new profiles, thus perpetuating this cycle), cut all contact with social media (which makes me feel victimized all over again and like I can’t have a normal life due to being assaulted), or make a post about it on my social media and hope that someone wants to throw my stalker under the bus (this is the least great idea I’ve had but I’m so damned tired of feeling like I have to hide or that everyone is watching my every move.)

I have already spoken to the prosecutor and the police department about these issues I’ve had, and they told me that basically their hands are tied unless there’s a direct threat to me or my family. They encouraged me to lock down my profiles and change my settings to private (they always have been.) And that’s the most advice I’ve been able to receive on the subject. 

So I’m asking for general advice on what some of you guys might think my best course of action is or maybe just some guidance from someone who’s been in a similar situation.",01Jun2020,2
674,"I just got accepted to a school in a different country and it's not even 30% certain because some new law from there just started. But before that new law happened, I told almost all my friends that I'm leaving. All except one.

Because of Covid-19, we were in lockdown for almost half a year. But now, our school has allowed us to go back to school. But my friend's parents feel unsafe and didn't allow her to come to school. And since I might be going to a different country to a different school next year, I realised that I saw my closest friend for the last time and didn't even notice.

Both of us still chat with each other. But every single time we do, she tells me how excited she was to see me next year. And I **want** to tell her. But somehow, I cant bring myself to. I also didn't want to tell her is because there's a chance that it doesn't work out and I can't go.

So now, I dont know what to do. Should I tell her now? Or should I wait until everything is confirmed then I tell her. But even if I do, how can I tell her that doesn't make her too sad?",01Jun2020,1

This has been happening for at least since December and I've gathered the courage to post about it. I have been having problems with movement. Either my body won't respond to what I want to do or I won't stop doing an action. I sometimes freeze. My body and sometimes mouth completely can't move and when people call me I can't really tell them I can't move. There are also times when I'm walking and I need to turn my body I continue walking. Sometimes I hit a wall. Usually when I get control of my body it's usually gradual. From my neck or my fingers. But people don't believe me when I tell them and sometimes hit me for me to flinch or dodge and I never do. There was actually a time where I froze in the middle of going down some  stairs when I told my classmate I was going to fall and that I was frozen, she didn't believe me. Not until I actually started falling but she really didn't do anything and I managed to lean into a wall before I hit a bad angle. I just want to be able to move again so I can at least solve one of my many problems. I've told my brothers and parents but I'm not sure if my parents believe me.",01Jun2020,1

679,"I'm 19 years old and I'm seeing a 26 year old american. Since I still live with my parents I know they still have some authority over me and that they wouldn't approve of me seeing someone older, so I have chosen to keep this relationship secret. I've been handling the distance just fine these past few months but it's very difficult on my partner, and since he cannot travel, I want to visit him in the next few months.

However the city he lives in is in a very bad situation because of the virus and the only way to convince my parents to let me travel would be to lie about the place I'm going to. I intend to isolate for 14 days when I come back, but since i live with 2 older people i am terrified of contaminating them. Travelling to another country in secret is also very tricky.

680,"So I used to work at this restaurant a few years back but left after working there a little over a year. Now since my summer plans have changed I decided to go back to work there for a little bit. Since I’ve been back I’ve met this new guy who I can’t stand. He’s not a manager, in fact he’s the same level as me, but he constantly feels the need to tell me what to do. If he was actually giving me good tips I wouldn’t mind as much but he’s correcting me on the most meaningless stuff. Yesterday he got mad at me for apparently setting my cup down in the wrong place (he’s the only person I’ve ever seen have a problem with this in almost 2 years there) A few shifts ago he showed me the “right way” to pour out a dustpan. He also will preemptively correct me on things. Like I’ll be walking over the grab a drink for someone’s order and he’ll say “hey don’t forget about that drink!” Or he’ll tell me to do the dishes when he isn’t even doing anything and could easily do them himself. He just always acts like he’s employee of the year but all I’ve seen him do is tell other people to do things. 

I really hate people like this and I don’t care that much about this job so it’s really taking everything I have not to just yell at this guy. What are some good alternatives to that? Should I just try to ignore him or maybe talk to an actual manager? Thanks for any help!",01Jun2020,1

The thing is that I don‘t have some classes next school year in which i have a ton of work to do now. But I don‘t really feel like doing it anymore. The past 10 years I went to school I was always (one of) the best student and I feel like I should be enjoying the rest of the school year.

I don‘t care about my grades this school year since I will pass this years anyway because of the Coronavirus. I would still do the import work for classes that I will have next year.

689,"Backstory: I met my best friend on the internet in December, 2018. I am aware of the dangers of the internet (you'd say I'm hypocritical because I'm just revealing my life on Reddit, but I'm seriously lost and desperately need help) and everything, so nothing bad happened, we talked some time to time, because we liked the same anime, but didn't get that close at first. Then something changed last summer, we started chatting more, getting to know eachother on a higher level and not just 'fangirling' together.
We wanted to meet (we live in the same country, just different cities.) She invited me to go to a con together or just meeting finally, but I knew my parents wouldn't be happy with the news. My parents are pretty conservative and old fashioned. I won't blame them, they grew up in religious, strict families as little pioneers with red scarfs (we live in a post communist country in Europe). So this kind of internet friendship would've freaked them out. And anime, oh anime... They just hate anything I've ever liked.
Fantasy? ""Bullshit, why do you even watch/read that, Lord of the Rings isn't any good for you!""
Anime? ""What the hell is that, why do you need that.""
Writing a fanfiction? ""I don't want this gig to end as a blue whale story!"" (Yes, my mom just said this.) 
I know they didn't do any of these to hurt me, they're just way too overprotective (and kinda dumb, like, what harm had LoTR ever done?), but well, they just taught me not to tell them anything I enjoy becasue they clearly just see another burden and potential danger. I'm also uncomfortable with sharing my problems with them, especially after the following story.
So, I knew it wasn't going to turn out well, but I gave it a shot with my mother (since mom's are softer, right?) and what did I get? A grimace and she basically just changed topics not even talking about it anymore. I wouldn't be here now if I didn't have a little sister. It was the end of the summer vacation and I made a phone call with my friend during the day. My sister ran to mom as soon as I wasn't in sight and told her... What? That I talked to a stranger on the phone and greeted them in English as a joke? Wow! 
My mother, instead of asking me first, investigated my phone, going through my messages and gallery and found not only our conversations but *drumroll* anime pics of boys kissing! (Crazy phase, it's over now, I'm sorry) This seriously broke me. I was grounded and my phone was taken away. I assume she expected me to end my relationship with my internet friend since I always was a well behaved, calm child but well, here we are: almost a year later, I'm 16, lost my trust in them, but me and my friend are still speaking and planning on moving in together when we go to college. 
It's just unbearable. I want to spend time with her in real life. We met once already on one of my class trips to the capital city, and I want to invest our relationship. We talk every single day, phone and video call every time I have some time home alone (it hasn't happened in a while due to corona), but it's obviously not the same. And I feel like I'm a problem for her too (she highly disagrees with this, but I still feel bad). 
We are planning on trying to meet this summer in secret. I sneak out to hang out with friends (if my parents let me) but meet her instead in my town and we spend a few hours together. I'm afraid of getting caught and a part of me just wants to live freely, but I'm too afraid of my parents to tell them, because I've been lying for months now. My friend also thinks it's not safe, revealing everything and we should just wait and set up secret dates every now and then. 
So, I'd appreciate if some outsiders could give their opinion and some advice about this. I hope I summed it up well and it's clear. Also sorry for my English and thank you in advance.",01Jun2020,1

I love her (as a friend) and it would break my heart if something were to happen to her.

I know that I'm not important right now, but I just want to know if everything is alright and if she needs me. I don't want to put pressure on her but at the same time I don't want to make her feel like she's being left alone.

691,"With everything going on in the USA surrounding race, I want advice how to help on a micro level (instead of the macro: voting, donating, etc). 

I’m a white man. I acknowledge the privilege that I have. I know that if I’m in the same situation as a man of any color, he probably had to do much more to get there than I did (and forget it if it is a woman of color). But, while acknowledging the privilege is just the first step, I don’t know what the next step should be. It’s not as simple as other things (obviously). 

For instance, I happen to be a nurse. I know my job is 10x easier because of how patients, doctors, and even other nurses interact with me as a white male. Seniors nurses eat their own making it difficult for new nurses...except if you’re a male nurse. Doctors listen to your suggestions more frequently and with less posh back as a male nurse. Patients think I’m a doctor, and I have had them ask the female doctor for water while I’m standing right there with them. But, I know that I won’t let the doctor do that, I won’t ignore a patient asking someone for help if I’m right there and able to do it, and I always made sure that with the extra time I had that I would help out my coworkers in any way possible. And I love being a nurse in a NYC hospital because it exposed me to every color, language, culture, sexual/gender identity, and lifestyle. What my coworkers and patients have taught me about life, struggle, perseverance, and gratitude was the most influential aspect of my life thus far.  

But, I don’t have that next step for this like I had in nursing. I know to treat people equally. I try to not be biased, try to acknowledge those biases when I have them, and try to deal and understand those biases when I can. I try to ask questions from my female and other raced friends (sorry for the weird wording of that) so I can understand their experiences and cultures. And I never want to be the person who says, “I don’t see color,” because I find that ignorant. The world is would be lifeless, boring, sad, and grey without all the different colors. And I know I will raise my daughter and future kids to be the same way. But is that enough? I don’t think so, but don’t know what more I should be doing. 

I just can’t imagine being judged by my skin or my sex, to be fearful of police even when I’ve done nothing wrong, and to feel like the system is rigged against me. 

So what can I do in my life to make an impact and to help others not feel this way (Side note, I use the term feel but know it’s not ‘just’ a feeling, it’s reality)?",01Jun2020,2

My dad has been battling Parkinson's disease for the last few years and I'm not exactly sure how much longer he's going to be around.

When she refuses, he gets turned on because he thinks it’s hot when people refuse his sexual requests. 

Then, he gets really mad and starts blaming her for not taking off her clothes or not doing sexual stuff for him and he says she should have sympathy for her because he gets beaten by his dad and he’s being really sweet to her and that he deserves to see something good back. 

She feels bad for him and she doesn’t want him to get mad, so she lets him get mad at her for refusing and she lets him force her to do sexual acts. 

He lives far away from her, but he’s saving up so they can meet in real life. I’m afraid something really bad will happen if they meet in real life.

696,"*TLDR* : My dad and grandmother are deceased, and I’m not quite sure what to do with their large bulky stuff. And the actions that I’m taking with their stuff, I’m not sure if it’s the right thing for me to do.

My grandmother passed away more than 10 years ago. I don’t actually remember when. My dad passed away in 2015. Prior to both of their deaths, I had been estranged from them for personal reasons for many years. As a result, I do not feel close or emotionally beholden to either of them.

This particular train of thought is completely lost on my stepmother. She cannot comprehend that I do not feel connected to anything regarding them. At this point, I have given up trying to explain it to her because it would be like talking to a wall - a wall that just constantly repeats versions of the same talking points. (“But he’s your father!”)

Stepmom recently called me up to discuss that she is finally moving out of the house that she and my father bought. (It’s too much space for just her and too expensive for her to maintain on her own.) As a result, she is downsizing her belongings and wants me to have my family’s stuff. 

These belongings range from grandma’s genealogy projects, to photos of various family members (from early 1900s to 1990s), to pocket knives and report cards and letters and model cars and jewelry honestly just a whole slew of sundry belongings.

I had discussed with my mom about what to do with all of these things, and I somewhat settled on the following:

Go through all the items. Anything that resonates strongly for me, put in a Keep Pile. Anything the doesn’t resonate strongly, put in a Discard Pile. Anything that feels grey, put in a Decide Later Pile. Anything in the KP or DLP will be stored later. Anything in the DP gets tossed out same day. 

Most everything in my KP are things like the genealogical papers my gma kept and photos and letters. I started a binder with page protector sleeves so I can see what all I’ve kept without having to handle them. 

But there are a great deal of things that are in my KP or my DLP that I don’t know how to go about handling. 

For instance, my dad’s medical degree. I do not know how to feel about this. On the one hand, it was obviously a great accomplishment of his. And I feel like I should honor it somehow. But on the other hand, I don’t want to lug my dad’s physical memorabilia around. I don’t want to hang it up. I don’t want it hiding in any of my closets. If it were simply the standard size of 8.5x11, I’d just file it away in my binder, but because it’s a giant object I am struggling to figure out what I should do with it. 

There are a number of large physical objects like this that I’m struggling to decide what to do with, because I feel like I should hold on to them until later, but I really do not want to lug them around like emotional dead weight baggage until I’ve properly decided one way or the other about how I want to handle them.

Im 21 years old and my life f\*cking sucks. When i graduated High school and headed towards college, i had this ""full commitment"",""win or learn"" mindset. However as years went by, i have no clue what happened, i have created a pathetic mindset that'll find any excuse not to anything that'll make my life better. In other words, i wasn't able to gain any friends, why? this voice in my head told me that they ""don't like you"" or ""they don't want anymore friends"" even when applying for an internship or job, ""they're not going to hire you"" or ""don't try, the people who have better qualifications than you also applied.""

She has only been seeing me at this time however would like to see one of her female friends after she comes to see me. of corse im ok with dropping her off at her friends so she can stay there for a few days however recently this friend of hers that she will visit is giving me some bad vibes. I simply do not trust her at all. 

She is not doing great mentally caused by a few bad breakups. This has led her to drink a lot, but I mean a lot... like getting smashed every night while chatting to random people on this zoom wana be app. She is also very insecure about herself. When my girlfriend goes there her friend will make her drink and of course I get nervous about that because alcohol does/can make you do stupid things, I just hate seeing my girlfriend drunk to the point she can't walk or speak properly.

My girlfriends friend is single and is the type of girl to invite my girlfriend and a few guys to her house so she can either get with one of them but also have my girlfriend there so its not awkward for her.

I trust my girlfriend won't do anything, we been in similar scenarios and she has been faithful every time I just don't trust the guys. I know what guys will do they disgusting, especially now with lockdown., Guys ways of thinking is Just because there  is a goal keeper does not mean they can't score or at least try to. I do not like the fact this friend of hers puts my girlfriend into these situations when im not there. Like I won't be invited because I have just seen my girlfriend for x amount of days and also since her friend has been seeing people im scared about getting Covid. Her mother will be picking her up from the friends house and I won't be seeing my girlfriend for 2 weeks because of this.

703,"[14m] I’m really close to my friend’s Ex Girlfriend and he’s not happy about it. He unnecessarily overuses the word ‘simp’ and at first it was just annoying banter, but now I’m afraid he’ll actually turn against me and make my life hell. He DMd me saying something about the ‘bro code’ (some unofficial rules that guy homies have to follow) one of the rules being ‘Exes are out of bounds’ (for dating). To which I replied ‘huh?’ Hes sent me another message in response, but haven’t looked at It because I don’t know how to reply to him. I’m now taking a week off Instagram and leaving his snapchat streaks opened. 

The issue is that me and this girl would totally try out a serious relationship, but now this ‘friend’ of mine is making me feel repulsive. Even though... He broke up with her for £10. Yep. His brother said “I bet you won’t break up with ____ for £10” and they were no more. So I don’t see why he should care so much about it if he so heartlessly broke up with her and are now completely over eachother.

I’ve always had a sort of toxic friendship with him, but he makes me feel awful even when I don’t do little things for him, like not playing fortnite with him. Our friendship just needs to die, but it’s best that I stay on OK terms with him because I go to clubs with him. 

When pluralise ‘friends’ I mean that one of his friends (which I was also good mates with) I’m now drifting from, we’ve not started talking as much so I’m speculating that my friend has spread rumours about me betraying him or whatever (just a speculation) 

I obviously have no choice but to reply to him eventually, just wondering what I should say. 

I haven’t talked to the girl yet, as she usually has slow replies. 

This is really stressing my out and I’m anxious whenever friend 1 or friend 2 snaps me because I don’t know if it’s going to be streaks or if they’re flaming me. I’d also feel bad if friend 2 didn’t know anything about the situation and thought that I was just ignoring him and not snapping back lol.

704,"My boyfriend has pretty bad (diagnosed) OCD and is one of the nicest people I've eve known. He isn't in therapy right now but will be soon (stupid pandemic)  He feels excessive guilt for fairly normal things but this thing he is freaking out over is not normal. He confessed his guilt for trying to find images of naked girls aged 12-14 when he was 13. This was a once off as he never found anything on Google and quickly realised it was illegal. However, he feels guilty because he worries he could've  checked something younger than this even though he does not remember this. He just feels so scared that he could've looked up younger, maybe even 5 years younger or something and forgotten it as he might have merely typed it in and not really tried or was so guilty he managed to block it from his memory and it was over 7 years ago so its hard to remember

While freaking out he was almost certain he never actually did search for anything younger as why would he? His crushes were 12-14 at the time and he has 0 recollection of checking anything other than 12-14. The next day,  he said  that he is 99% sure he never looked below 12. He still has that 1% and doesn't want to promise he didn't go below 12 as it's too scary because what if he suddenly realises he did one day? He has said before about various memories  ""I think X thing happened when I was 14"" before only to realise in a calmer state a few days later  ""no actually X never happened, I just panicked because it was possible i could have but I have no actual memory of it and realistically I would remember it"". If he genuinely did and just can't remember, should I leave him over it? I've never noticed anything creepy before and I know all his passwords so I highly doubt he is hiding anything. He finds daddy/school girl roleplay gross and called his friend out on hitting on a 15 year old when he was 19, so I take it he isn't a creep? I'm still concerned that the 1% chance he did automatically makes him a bad person.",01Jun2020,1
705,"My husband has a volatile temper. Holes in the wall, broken items etc... When he finally is done with his rampage through the house he grabs a set of keys and leaves, either in a car or on a motorcycle. When he leaves the neighborhood, he is driving or riding at a high rate of speed to the point of tires screeching. This isnt an everyday occurrence but it does happen to much. 
I have been thinking of calling the police to report him. If possible, I would do this anonymously for a couple of reasons. I don't want him to know it was me who called and I don't want the police to think I'm just doing it because I'm a pissed off spouse. 
I would mostly do this becuse I am concerned that he will cause an accident in the neighborhood or, God forbid, he hits a kid. I would also do it because I am a pissed off spouse and I'm sick and tired of this behavior. I want him to have some consequence for his actions.

706,"By now we all know what’s been taking place in America the past week or so. I’ve been noticing that my friends and I have a lot of differing opinions and sentiments regarding police, the protests/riots taking place, and race relations in general. 

I’m going to try to be a bit vague in my descriptions, who’s on what side, etc. in hopes of some objectivity. Let your mind fill in the blanks.

Regarding police: On one side of the divide, there’s the sentiment that all cops are bad and they are racist oppressors. On the other side, the sentiment is that most cops are decent, but some are bad at their job for a variety of reasons. 

Regarding the protests/riots: One side believes that protests against injustice should always be encouraged, but looting is a completely separate conversation. The other side believes that it’s high time that some violence and destruction takes place and maybe now the powers that be will take the people seriously. 

Regarding race relations: One side of the argument is that people need to be judged as individuals, and individuals of any race are capable of good and bad, and should not be prejudged or lumped in with a group. The other side of the argument is that all people of “X” race are bad and need to be dealt with.

I’ve always been someone who likes to talk about disagreements and hear different perspectives. My friends are really cool and we have a lot in common and always have good times.

711,"I'm 18, a high school senior who had huge plans for this year, none of which will be able to happen because of the current situation. 

Al throughout high school I was not allowed to get a job because my mother told me she would lose benefits she receives from the government if I started to work. Since she would lose those benefits anyway when I turned 18, I worked so hard throughout the school year to find a job for the first time this summer. I probably sent in 50 applications, went in for 3 interviews, and finally got a summer camp counsellor job around february.

Well obviously summer camp will not be running this year so I'm back on the hunt. I sent in around 5 more applications and I was so happy to get an interview offer from a grocery store. 

But, my family said it was a bad idea because of the virus. They are scared I'm going to catch it. I understand that it is dangerous, especially because my parents are over 60, and they are at risk. But its not like every single grocery store worker is getting the virus. My parents also didn't want me to do it because only 2 of my friends had a job right now. 

Out of respect for them, I cancelled the interview and accepted my fate of staying at home doing absolutely nothing for the next 4 months. 

But now, after the interview date had passed, I found out 2 of my other friends had gotten jobs too. I feel so bad because I worked so so hard to find jobs, and I was so close to getting one, but now everyone else has jobs and I'll just be rotting away sitting at home. On top of that, my university informed us classes will be online for the fall, so I could have had that job from may until december. 

I feel so so so mad at my family for making me decline that interview offer because i'm trying to apply for jobs again and I'm not getting anything back. They made me lose my one chance. I can't stop crying and being rude to them. I wanted a job for so long, since the 10th grade, and I'm the only one who doesn't have one yet. I have no job experience to put on my resume.

I don't want to scream at them, however, because I know they all had horrible pasts and suffered a lot, their lives were hell in the past and they were just looking out for all of us. But I can't help but feel this way. 

I think I just needed somewhere to vent.  Am I right to feel mad? Are they right? Should I keep looking for jobs? And will not getting a job right now and just sitting at home for the rest of the year like they want me affect me in the future in terms of getting jobs?",01Jun2020,3

715,"Hi all,

First off, thanks for reading.

Recently, an old high school friend has been posting increasingly worrisome content to their Twitter feed, highlighting looting, rioting, and other violent behavior. In high school, this kid was weird and awkward, but didn't exhibit any violent or strange tendencies that worry me, as I am today.

This person has been posting pictures of military and police vehicles asking for spec sheets and advice on disrupting or destroying operational capacity for these vehicles. They are an avidly active member of the Communist party and DSA, have been active in looting and rioting, and seem to be on a path to get either killed or imprisoned. They constantly post about how 'ACAB' and how they want to seize power from their local upstate New York authorities, and it's got me scared.

I'm worried. I used to think that this was a good person, but they seem to have gone off the deep end.

Any advice for keeping the broader community (and particularly the policing community) safe from this individual?",01Jun2020,2
716,"I feel to better understand what I'm asking then I should explain the situation that brought me to ask this question. So that's what I'm going to do, I'll try and keep it as short and accurate as possible.

I'm going to be making up names for everyone in the story so they might sound a little silly. Anyways I got angry at a person called Ice so I went to someone I thought was my friend to vent, I'll call the ex-friend Chunk. I knew Chunk was also friends with Ice but I felt that since I was just venting that it would be okay to go to them when I didn't have anyone else available at the time. Chunk apparently didn't like that I wasn't saying the nicest things about Ice but instead of telling me to stop while I was venting he sent my entire vent to Ice and their friends. My vent was an angry type of vent so I wasn't saying the nicest things so Ice understandable got upset. Ice and her friends yelled at me in a public voice call(I know, ""it's online how silly to get upset over stuff online"") telling me that I was a bad person for talking about Ice to someone and that what I was doing was shit-talking. I tried to explain what got me upset in the first place and all they told me was that my reason for being upset was unreasonable and that I never should have gotten mad at Ice. I know that I made some mistakes and I tried to make sure and apologize whenever I messed up, but I feel that I was the only one apologizing since when I brought up the things Ice did to make me upset she never apologized and just said something like I was being unreasonable. I feel that they weren't taking my side of the story seriously and didn't accept that Ice did some rude things as well which lead to me being so upset in the first place.

Anyways I know something like what I explained above will probably happen again so I'm wondering what I should do when someone is upset with me but won't listen to me and accept that they messed up in some ways as well? I am currently just trying to distance myself from Ice and her friends but I don't know if that is the best thing to do.",01Jun2020,1
717,"Obviously I can hear them. This is the fourth time I have overheard my downstairs neighbors talking about me to the other neighbors in our apartment building. The couple was telling them how my boyfriend drives me and they watched me get out of the car and saw trash in the floor. I then got out of the car carrying my bag of fast food pressed to my chest. For some reason they felt it was inappropriate for me to do this (while wearing a t shirt). I have no idea what their problem with me is, but now I feel very uncomfortable leaving my apartment because I am scared to bump into them. I feel like they are watching me and no matter what I do it's wrong. 

Two weeks ago the man downstairs caught my mildly retarded younger brother taking out the trash and took the opportunity to yell at him in front of his friends and other neighbors (nice day so many neighbors were outside). He accused my brother of smoking weed and called him a liar when he told him he didnt. My brother was humiliated in front of the neighborhood. My boyfriend eventually got him to apologize to my brother, but I hear this man scream at his girlfriend all the time. He seems very aggressive and I've had bad experiences with aggressive men.

718,"So I recently started a job as a server at a restaurant, and from the interviews and conversations with my coworkers when I first started, I was led to believe I would be making decent money. However, I just got out of training and instead of making tips, I walked out my first night owing the restaurant a dollar that I was apparently short on. All of my tables that day tipped at least something, so that was insane to me.

I didn’t really realize how hard it would be when I started the job, but I applied for dozens of other jobs in my area and this was the only one that went anywhere, and one of only two interviews I was offered. If I quit, I’ll probably be unemployed for a while.

It was fine but most of what I got to do on the course really bored me, a lot of stuff that I just didn’t really have any interest in at all and by the time it was finishing up I knew that if I just spent a year bored everyday then I wasn’t going to enjoy any job I got with my Horticulture degree.

I'm obsessed with Ariana Grande and I feel like its taking over my life. My obsession came in stages. I started listening to her music in 2014, instantly became a fan but wasn't obsessed at all. 4 years later and she became my favorite artist. I followed all her socials and kept up with her life as if she was one of my friends. 2019 and thats when the obsession started. I was literally spending a couple hours each day just on instagram, twitter and other socials, talking about Ariana, posting about ariana and just anything related to Ariana.

* She is surrounded by extremely supportive people who make it clear that she is welcome to talk to them. However, she considers herself a bad person for mistakes made in the past, and feels like she is deeply undeserving of being able to talk about her problems. She has only opened up to her boyfriend, and even that is challenging.
* Supporting *other* people is the centerpiece of her life. She doesn't want other people to think she's ""not okay"", as she fears other people starting to avoid venting to her.
* Again, she's really good at giving advice, and her boyfriend has given and continues to give her all the support he can — however, it's just not professional help, which we think she needs by this point. She considered therapy in the fall of last year, but never went.
* She clings to being okay, and has said that it is very easy to act okay. She thinks she has to be okay, because she thinks it's ""easier"" for the people around her.
* Important: she has people to talk to. She doesn't feel like she deserves to talk to them. I feel like by this point it's out of our hands.
* If it helps, we are in the U.S. If you have any local resources, I'm open to DMs. 

We've been aware of this situation for half a year, but we don't know how we can help. We've tried convincing her to go to the school counselor as a starting point, but that hasn't worked out, especially with school being over for the summer, and we are trying to be extremely cautious around the topic.

Well my issue is that my boyfriend (23M) and his brother (28M) have been planning on going to stay with a friend for a couple of days in Wisconsin.  He's gonna be moving soon to Ireland, in about a month maybe, so they wanna go see him. 

I completely get that. But I'm so worried about all this and I dont know if I'm being unreasonable. This is taking a 12 hour drive to stay with someone who has actually already gotten the coronavirus about a month ago. 

I'm also worried about the drive, they both arent the greatest drivers, especially his brother as he doesnt even have his license yet. I'm always on edge while he drives. And just thinking about them going 12 hours driving, also gonna be tired at some point too, driving through places they've never been. Who knows what could happen. 

They wanted me to go with them, as I've been staying with them anyways during the quarantine. I thought about it and I kinda kept giving them an unsure yes, but now with all the riots popping up its given me more reason to not want to, so I told my boyfriend I'm not gonna go with them if they choose to go right now. I just think it's really unwise to be traveling right now, but I don't wanna be the negative person that says no dont go stay with your friend. I can't really control that,  and I understand why they want to go. 

Oh and to mention, his brother and their dad are high risk for coronavirus, and they live with their parents, that's another thing I worry about.. i just don't know what to do here.

739,"This is a long story and it’s get a little weird so hang on tight..

Just wanna put this out in the open first. I am a 34 year old straight married male. I have always dated women and have never shown any way shape or form that I could potentially be bi or gay. With that being said I love gay people, and I have gay friends and family. I’m very open minded to all walks of life. I respect and love everyone no matter what race, gender, religion or sexual orientation.

I worked with a guy for about 10 years who was quiet and a little different. Didn’t have any friends only hung out with his parents. I always tried to break him out of his shell inviting him out to see my band perform at clubs where there would be with a very welcoming group of people including my wife to maybe try to help him be more social and not a hermit at home. It never worked but once a year no matter what we would always go out for a meal. I always had a soft side for the guy. I was raised to appreciate people for who they are and I always thought this guy was a good person. The guy had a little obsessive compulsive disorder and when he had an interest whether it was a tv show or a movie it became an obsession.

As the 10 years gone by he started getting stranger and stranger every year. He went from being this clean cut guy plain jane type of guy. To becoming this full out goth style guy with eye liner and long jet black hair. (The guys at work always used to bust on me because they told me that he’s trying to dress more like me and I’m influencing him) I have a lot of tattoos and play in punk bands but I’m not a goth or look like one at all.  He was always the same old guy very wholesome, kind, but always a little strange. A few years in he started to get a pornography obsession and one day at work totally out of the blue he told me he started masterbating on webcams on pornography websites for fun.  Being an open minded guy and having friends from all walks of life it didn’t really phase me that I had a friend doing webcams, it just shocked me that it was this guy! 

So part one of this story ends about 5 years ago the job we were working at was closing for good and we were getting laid off. We decided to go out one last time before the warehouse closed. We went out to eat and afterwards he invited me into his house to hang out which I had no problem doing. We hung out in his bedroom where we bullshitted for a while and he showed me his massive movie collection and everything was normal. I told him that I had to get going. And he said to me “wait before you go there’s something I want to show you” so I said ok what is it? He pulled out a Manila envelope and said “I want you to see what’s inside” now me knowing his sexual obsessions and webcam hobby I had a feeling what was in that envelope, pictures of himself naked. I asked him “what’s inside?” And he wouldn’t tell me he just kept telling me to open it. I said “come on man just tell me” so he says to me “ remember how I told you I was doing webcams? Well these are pictures of me naked that I want you to have” I got extremely uncomfortable and very kindly told him that “I’m good” and gotta get going. He got extremely angry and upset and started saying “WHAT?! I can’t believe you don’t wanna look at these? What’s wrong with them? I can’t believe you! “ I very friendly backed out of his room and exited his house as quick as possible. 

The weeks before the warehouse closed were very awkward and when we finally lost our jobs I unfriended him and blocked him on social media. If he told me he was gay and had feelings for me I would of totally been cool with it and told him that I just want to be friends cause I’m a married straight man. And to this day we would still be friends. But I felt so violated that he tried to trick me into looking at the pictures and got angry when I declined. A ten year friendship ended cause of it.. 

I haven’t talked to him in years but some friends of mine who are still friends with him on social media have told me he has a new obsession with a local guy who lived a few towns over who shot up a supermarket that he was working at and then killed himself. There’s a twisted fandom out there of people who have a thing for things like columbine and similar Interests like this. This guy I used to work with never met this local killer but posts pictures of him all over his Facebook as if they were friends. It’s really eerie. He mourns his death like they were real tight. Evening posting pictures of himself at the supermarket where the murders went down. Photoshopped pictures of himself in with old pictures of the murderer as if he was in them.

This morning out of the blue I had two of his online friends message me today asking about the guy. About his past and wanted to know more about me and why were no longer friends. There planning on eventually traveling to meet him and want to know more. When I clicked on there pages it seems they were bat shit crazy just like him. Posting pictures of the killer and the supermarket. I have him blocked so he must of been speaking my name all these years later and these weirdos looked me up. The two online strangers didn’t appear to be a threat of any way but they were interested in learning more about him and even asked me by any chance if he sent me nude photos with out my consent. I kept the conversation very vague and didn’t answer any of there questions. 

I think about the obsessive compulsive guy who used to be my friend. I never wronged him but I shut him out turning down those pictures that mentally violated me. He’s getting stranger every  year and I don’t associate with him. But with an obsession of such strange shit do you think he could be brewing up in his head that I betrayed him and he wants to follow in one of his sick idols footsteps. And even though he doesn’t have real friends it seems the ones he’s making online seem to be sick and twisted.

These last three or four days have been the worst we have ever seen. This weekend she drove out to Kentucky and almost married her verbally abusive and manipulative heroin addict ex, just because she ""felt like it"" and she can ""do whatever she wants"", she came home last night at eleven and was acting somewhat aggressive, but not more so than usual. When she got home she was still coherent and speaking as she normally would. Then this morning at nine she started lashing out and gained a southern accent and has been screaming incoherent tangents for the last four hours and switching between saying there is no god and that she herself is god and created everything.  We tried contacting the police but because she hasn't directly said anything about harming herself or others so the police refuse to do anything. She screamed my other  second sister out until my second sister broke down sobbing about how she can't handle this anymore and she went drove back to her college a few states away, and the rest of my family is getting close to the breaking point as well. Is there any service or group of professionals that we can call to take care of her and keep her safe, she has just been working herself up and is trying to demand we give her our car keys and let her do whatever she wants.

745,"(posted this to r/relationshipadvice originally but didn’t find much advice)

A few weeks ago my (m) best friend (f) suggested we be friends with benefits. 

We dated pretty briefly when we first met a couple years ago and I’ve liked her on and off pretty consistently ever since, and I’m not proud that even though we’re best friends I think a part of me will always like her in that way. So when she suggested it I was pretty happy, but kinda worried because I didn’t think it would last (because of isolation). 
We talked dirty a few times kind of, then after a couple of weeks she basically told me it was all a joke. I felt so used and like complete shit. I didn’t think I was gonna get over it but I did pretty quickly. We started talking again and I don’t know why but whenever things are going really well my mind kinda fucks me over and I always think there’s potential. 
Then, out of nowhere, she started talking about having sex with me, and I was pretty hesitant at first but that part of me that seems to like her no matter what took over so I played along. I even asked her if this was a joke, she said she jokes ‘some days’ but she didn’t really give a clear answer. I think I’m too eager and I really want to believe that she’s actually interested in me but I have no way of knowing. 
Then last night we were talking about it again and she said out of nowhere she felt like I was taking advantage of her, and that she was worried I was just into it to ‘brag to my friends’. 
At first I was in complete denial in my head, and I do love her and I trust her more than anyone else in the world.
But I started thinking about it and the fucked up thing is, as much as I don’t want to believe it, she might be right. 

Keeping in mind we’re both virgins and I’ve liked her since I’ve known her, I felt like everything I said after that was just taking advantage of her, she seemed pretty fine with what I said but I felt like a complete cunt typing it out. 
I couldn’t sleep all night because I felt like shit and I want to tell her everything, how I feel, how I’ve felt, how I think about her pretty much constantly. 

But I don’t know if she’ll just be on a ‘joke day’ and play along or not. I’m so worried I’ve just become a shitty person.

Sorry for the info dump, I felt like I had to get it off my chest somewhere and I don’t want to get my other friends involved because I’m trying to be more trustworthy in general. 

Any advice or just anything would be so appreciated. Thanks.",01Jun2020,1
746,"Hi all,

I'm hoping some of you absolute wizards can help me by pulling the veil off my eyes and illuminate how the actual fuck I can get things rolling.

So, some info :
I am 25f, I live in the UK, I'm living at home with my parents, I have a BA in English Lit &amp; Lang, MA of Linguistics, currently looking for somewhere to do my PhD. I don't have any debt bar my student debt. I've been continuously employed since I was 15. The past 3 years I've been working 'closer' to where I want to be (academic assistant, CA etc).

Okay so the problem:
I have got sweet fa to show for working my butt off. I live with my parents after having to come back home, I'm in an employment post I'm overqualified for where my bosses have asked me 'why are you even here?', and I live very frugally (imagine Smaug level).

What tips, tricks, and/or things could I do to change this? 

I'm excellent at saving (currently got half my PhD tuition saved for that), and I apply to a gross amount of jobs, I ace interviews (according to the interviewers) but am 'over qualified for the post' or 'irrelevant' or 'don't fit the criteria' (when I do because I have read the criteria before I applied). I just don't know what I can do to get a bit of financial freedom, a good job, some travel (obvs not atm) and the odd pretty thing that catches my eye.

I've got LinkedIn, and try and make connections and read from people how to get the ball rolling there, but nothing seems to work.

So guys, what am I doing wrong? How can I help myself and get myself mobile and using my degrees? Does anyone know how to get me out of a low paying job that's completely irrelevant my degrees and into a better job? How do build my finances beyond dragon hoarding? How do I be a successful person?",01Jun2020,1
747,"I only fantasize about my potential (which never includes the rest of the world), probably because it's the only way to stop myself from eating a bullet. But in reality, I have seriously low self esteem. I can't even go for a run because I don't want to be seen panting and sweating over a short distance because of my born anaemic and asthmatic condition. I'd rather wait till I can afford a bicycle so I'll at least be far enough to feel tired and have something to sit on and rest. 

I also no longer bother trying to have a relationship because I've always failed at it. Been rejected too many times, and just too soft to handle rejection. 

I hate anything public because I'm a mid 20s man that looks like a skinny, malnourished scarred faced teen (all cause of my health conditions). 

But I don't eat a bullet because I know it's how I was born and there's barely anything I can do about my physical looks.

That though is not working, I keep scoring lower and lower it has become to point of me sometimes crying and my anxiety sky rocketing up.

I keep getting the image of my teachers telling ""without math you are a failure"" Ive even stopped learning it as it makes life too hard for me or even a waste of time. It takes so much time in my day to even really focus on my IT (by that time im already tired and frustrated) another problem is that if I leave math, that means I will lose IT. Im already quite behind because of the amount of work given by teachers during our countries lockdown. Im scared to go talk to my parents about this as this may start arguments between me and them, I know it would make them upset and angry. My father is not really the one to pick arguements against. I will most likely send them this when im outside of the house, I don't want a confrontation with them. I know they want me to do the right thing, but I feel like I can't do this anymore.

755,"All that happened was that the past 3 times the finance is not let us know he was coming over so when a friend of ours came over and we had a lot of stuff so we wanted the garage, He showed up from nowhere in our garage (we live in a gated community). The first time he came over, I have massive problems with slamming he decided to slam on the door and his finance answered the door and said it was him- I start shaking uncontrollably, I dissociated and I felt listless, It reminded me of my parents walking onto private property. I hid in the walk-in closet because I was so afraid my parents came back. The next two times or so, he went unannounced and all I got was the B saying, Oh shit. That was enough to prevent me from going into a panic. The third time was the last straw, I was so scared and felt so disrespected that he didn't just say he was meeting up with his finance that I raised my voice and said, ""F, this is the third time you've come in unannounced"". He responded with, ""How dare you yell at me like you have authority over me!"". This is the guy who calls himself mature, yet he just claims he has authority over me in my own home. I thought I understood what he meant when he did the next actions which were to suggest that he let me know when he comes over next, and I thought it was all fine. I did not know why he told the friend we brought over to switch cars though, that was unnecessary.

Later on, last night around 9 p.m. I see a text message that starts off normal. F1 for Finance, B: for the one of the pair living with us and M for me. You have all the background information. He put words in my mouth. He does not know about the whole reason for my outburst, I never got that far because I thought it was understood what the problem is. He only knows that I said, this is the 3rd time you've come here unannounced.

1F: M, I'm letting you know that I am coming over on (this day) to hang out with my fianance.

I will txt you again on Tuesday as well as

the day I am heading over will txt finance to remind me and my fianance.

This is per your request and me adhering to them.

This is to ensure that there is no lack of communication from now on if you or Nolan have forgotten or are unsure if I am heading over I strongly recommend asking my finance.

Although should it occur that my finance is unsure and cannot give you a verifiable answer I would also, strongly recommend that you and him both message me to ensure that there's no lack of communication or misunderstanding.

Please note that I don't expect a response back on these txt but I will assume that you have read nd understood them from here on.

i hope this is a fir way to resolve any issues that may or can occur in the near future.

Please note that if I do not message you specifically ahead of time it will be because I'm picking up my finance up to leave the premises for an unknowable amount of time.

During this time I shall not enter the establishment at all and will make no physical, verbal, or txt based notifications.

I will as well be screen shooting these messages as for proof that these txt occurred and thanks to discord they will be time and date stamped so that no confusion should occur.

I do hope that is alleviate any issues.'

&amp;#x200B;

M: Finance. Problem is, I agreed with you, I didn't request anything of you- you offered.

&amp;#x200B;

F1: I offered in order to resolve this issue

You are correct

though it was no asked by Demanded of by you

and to ensure that all side are some semblance of happy or content this is the most optimal path that could be chosen.

&amp;#x200B;

M: That's on YOUR decision. I never said and don't expect this kind of response. I am done with this conversation, It's going nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

F1: You are again correct I made the decision to mitigate any issues that were occurring via my unwanted appearances.

Should you wish to revisit this conversation, again I will understand.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just what? I never asked him anything but to say, um, getting my boyfriend or on my way. But then what I am supposed to expect he's the guy who when playing as a dungeon master of a role-playing game even when talking in character he starts rolling die because he's getting annoyed we are talking which makes the next boss harder.

The problem with showing it to his finance is that he might not understand the conversation. I am worried that showing him a screenshot with this on it would make me the bad guy and that he would feel that he would have to choose sides. B already heavily enables f by making excuses for f's actions. In the previous one B told us that since he talked about doing a rp  that would allude to f's visit but that would work only if he was coming over for the rp.

Ever since the beginning of our relationship, I've noticed a sort of hatred for her by her brother (13M). Her brother is very immature, isn't too keen to sharing things, doesn't have a lot of patience, and is also very homophobic (not relevant, just to point it out). I didn't realize to what extent until she started complaining to me about various things he does that I would consider abuse. He asks for favors or for her to spend time with him and if she declines, he gets very upset and, especially when it is just them at home, tends to lash out at her, calling her fat, ugly, retarded, or in some cases, resorts to hitting her. This has pissed me off for a while as I don't want her to be in that kind of situation, and today I was pushed over the edge by today's story.

Girlfriend says her mom was showing them something. She went over to look, and her brother just comes up and shoves her out of the way. She, in retaliation, pushes him back and he kicks her in the leg (he had shoes on) and told her to die.

What do I do? I would feel awful if something were to happen and I didn't want to do something, but I don't want the police to just go knocking on their door because I fear the mother would be mad at me or something (I should mention the brother is pretty much the favorite and my girlfriend gets treated unfairly in most cases).

This situation might seem a little childish to a lot of people, so I apologize for that too, but I'm genuinely not sure what to do and I thought I'd ask Reddit instead!

I (17f) have known this girl (16f) - let's call her A - since the beginning of middle school (however we've never gone to the same school, we knew each other because our moms were friends). A lived one town over from my home city, so about an hour and a half away from where I live, but we always made the effort to see each other since we were each other's best friends at the time. Usually we'd stay at each other's houses for a full weekend (this becomes relevant later). 

When high school hit, A started making a ton more friends (obviously fine by me, I recognize that friends grow apart) and we started hanging out less and less. We'd still chat every day by text and send each other memes and stuff. She started dating, had great relationships with new friends (and would always tell me about their adventures) and I was super happy for her. Then, about a year ago, she moved to another city (let's call it City) about two hours away from where I live. Again, we still kept talking every day by text.

I make a trip to City every three weeks to a month to see my mom (who lives there, not with me). Every time I go I've tried to make an effort to hang out with A, however she kept blowing me off and making up some excuse to not see me. I believed all of her excuses and never really brought it up. Then whenever I would ask if we could call because I wanted to tell her something that was too complicated to say over text she would say ""oh I'm busy right now"" and when I asked for a specific time/day we could chat even for five minutes she just said ""I'm not sure"". She then only started texting me to chat if she had a problem and other than that would only text me once in awhile to send me memes or pictures of her and her boyfriend hanging out. \[A petty side note, on my birthday she also didn't send me any birthday messages or anything, but then posted on her spam account literally one day later how excited she was to make amazing birthday posts for her boyfriend and other friend even though their birthdays were months away. I digress...\]

Despite this, I thought I'd try one last time to reach out. I'm one of the graduates of 2020 and I'm going to be hosting a very small, social distancing hangout to celebrate graduating since all of the other celebrations in my area are cancelled. I've only invited a few of my closest friends to celebrate with me, but I thought I'd invite her too since I thought she was still one of my better friends. I sent her the invite and let her know that my parents would be willing to drive her there and back to City, as well as she could stay the weekend like we used to do. She initially was like ""um I'm not sure"" and I said oh that's fine, you don't have to confirm until a few days before the hangout anyway. In my heart I knew that she'd say no but I stressed in my invite that this event was really important to me and that I'd love if she would be there. She then texts me back a few days ago, saying ""Oh I forgot that I made plans with friends for that entire weekend."" even though I sent her the invite one month in advance.

I knew she wouldn't have been able to make it anyway because of how she's been flaky before but this was kind of the eye opener to how much she's blowing me off.

I feel like she's been trying to push me away for awhile and I haven't noticed it until now. I didn't grow up with great communication skills in my household (my family has always dealt with problems with total silence, sometimes for months on end), so I'm not sure if cutting her completely off and ghosting her entirely is appropriate but it's the only solution that I can think of that won't make me look even more stupid/have her turn the situation back around on me (her placing blame on me instead). Even if I was to approach her about it, I'm sure she would make up an excuse or not even listen to what I have to say because she doesn't even want to make 5 minutes of time for me. Plus, I wouldn't even know what to say. 

So Reddit, should I completely cut her off or is there some other solution that I'm missing? I just need advice on what to do. :( I'm not even sure if this is a friendship I want to save at this point...

TLDR: I think my friend has been trying to push me away for awhile by making up random excuses when I try to chat, call, hangout, etc. I invited her to an important event for me and she flaked like I expected she would, which led me to recognize the signs of her pushing me away.

768,"When I was a kid it felt fine just spending time playing around with the family or friends, watch movies and series all day, masturbate, whatever. It was fun and there was always some balance to it all. Now I feel guilty and inferior all the time.

Right now as of the age of almost 27, working, which helps with the ""excess"" of free time, I see a lot of people from my social circle frown upon my love for videogames. More so, I see it myself, I don't want to play anymore, I use it because I don't know what to do with my free time or because I want to hangout with my friends as it's otherwise impossible, but even with games it's rare that I get them online so I end up playing alone to kill time, waiting for something to push me outside my comfort zone. And If I don't play I masturbate, for hours. This leads to very very bad habits in which my emotions swing completely and I have no desire to do anything.

I rarely have any motivation to do anything. Sometimes I think of fun cool things to do, like working out, going running, building a birdhouse, but at the slightest obstacle I quit and default to my addictions.

On top of it all my girlfriend broke up with me recently, so all the time we used to spend talking, texting and watching series is now also free which makes my issues more evident. It also intensified my emotional rollercoaster.

I'm a programmer, so after a day's work I need something outside of the computer, maybe something social or that doesn't involve a lot of thinking so I can relax and feel genuinely happy about it and not some addiction fulfillment with ""empty"" pleasure.

I have talked with a friend of mine and he's given me the his psychologist's contact which I still have to contact and hope I'll get some help, but until then, dos anyone have any advices?

Last week my father lost his academic job with a major university because of the pandemic and his entire department was let go due to cut funding. His health insurance benefits was what I grew up on and his academic status allowed for me to get my full degree with little financial burden. My insulin which use to be $15 to pick up 3 vials is now closer to $900. My semesters that use to be about $1,000, I now need to spend closer to $8,000.

I'll admit I've had it good and took advantage of that by putting my money away and utilizing my time to succeed with school, work, and family. Now I have close to zero savings, I feel emotionally stunted, and have a fear my life may derail right now.

771,"I am at my wit's end, any advice would be appreciated.

Our 4 y.o. dog is unfortunately clinically obese, and I have been restricting her diet and exercising her every single day in hopes of getting her weight back down to normal. She eats about half of the amount per day that's recommended on her dog food. She has been tested for hypothyroidism, but the vets said that her thyroid levels are normal and we should just watch her diet and exercise. However, I've been doing that, and she is not getting any better.

I am pretty certain it is because my dad gives her table scraps every time we have dinner. If we have any meat with a bone, he will give it to her and tell us to give her ours also. Today I tried explaining to him that he shouldn't do that, because it is unhealthy, and he said: ""I only gave her a few yesterday"" and ""dogs in our country back home (we are not American) lived off of table scraps and they were fine."" He also doesn't believe me when I tell him that our dog is overweight and says that ""she looks fine"" to him and that the vets ""are just saying that to be mean and discriminate against her"" (????). 

I always get pissed when trying to explain (obviously, I think), and then he tells me to stop bothering him and to stop being hysterical. He completely refuses to listen or admit that he might be wrong, and thinks that me getting mad is a sign of weakness. He does this with any conversation I try to have with him, and I'm completely at a loss with how to get anything through to him.

773,"Hey guys, I write this with a huge lump in my throat and I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this. 

I’ve noticed in the past few days that my (20M) older sister (25, let’s call her Lily) has been acting completely out of character. She’s generally a positive, ‘spiritual’ person as she likes to describe herself.   

Currently, she lives with at home with myself and my mother. My relationship with my sister is neutral, though since I was young, her and my mother tend to argue a lot, have these fall outs and go without speaking for a while, then things go back to normal where they’re speaking again... for a bit. Lily tends to isolate herself in her room for the whole day, which is something that she’s been doing for years and has always been private about her life. Since lockdown began about 3 months ago, her former employer refused to furlough her due to issues like lateness and conflict at work, which has lead to her becoming unemployed. 

Fast forward to present time, my mother and I have both observed that she hasn’t been eating the whole day (if she does, it’s a small meal) and she hasn’t been sleeping. I was going up to my room and she pokes her head out of the bathroom and asks me “Is the front door locked?” I respond with “Yeah, it should be...” and she says “Good good, I’m just really awake, do you know what I mean?” I respond with “Yeah”. After this conversation I was really confused with what had just happened. I think nothing of it. 

The next day, I go upstairs and she approaches me saying “You alright bro? If there’s anything you need to talk about I’m here. I’ve finally found myself, I know who I am.” I respond with “Alright, I know” and she proceeds “You’re all protected. You, mum, [lists my nieces and nephews names]” “You’re protected bro, do you hear me?”. At this moment I’m really concerned. My mum has mentioned her speaking about “my people” and referring to her boss at work as a “mother witch”. 

She’s also convinced that she is a teacher, though she’s never worked in this profession. She’s been writing this “book”, but when you look at the writing the sentences they’re non-aligned and random words...

My sister is a massive germaphobe and has been getting onto us about washing our hands when we get stuff from the store, wiping things down etc. The past few days, she’s been going out to the garden for about 15 minutes at a time, but today my mum caught her outside barefoot. My mum told her to come back inside and has been asking her if she’s okay, and asking if she needs to see a doctor. Lily seems to be in denial and swears she’s okay, but these actions are completely out of character and it’s starting to freak me out, and my mum is really concerned for her wellbeing too. 

We don’t know where this sudden high has come from as the past few weeks she has been on conflict with my mother, and out of nowhere it’s like Lily’s this brand new person. 

We don’t know what to do... It’s currently lockdown where places are shut, and I don’t know how to approach situations when Lily interacts with me because this is completely new to me. 

We’re convinced that this is signs of schizophrenia, and I’m thinking there’s a bit of paranoia too. Do I let her know that I’m worried about her? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I’ve taken to Reddit because I feel like typing this out is going to take the weight off of my shoulders from all of this stress and concern.

Also, if there’s confusion, feel free to ask more about the situation and I will clarify.

• One of my uncle's on my mom's side passed in his early 30's to cancer (unknown what type).

• One of my youngest cousins on my mom's side was diagnosed with cancer at 5 years old in his spinal cord (just below his brain). He is almost 9 now and in and out of remission, but doing ok from the last time I checked in.

• Uncle (1) on my dad's side passed from a very fast-moving cancer 2 years ago (unknown type, as we didn't know he had it until after he passed)

• Uncle (2) on my dad's side is T1D

• Grandma on my dad's side is T2D. March 2020 she is diagnosed with breast cancer, May 2020 she has a full mastectomy.

• Sister (1) diagnosed with T1D 3 years ago

• My 2 other sisters and I got checked for diabetes after sister 1 was diagnosed, everyone is fine, I have Hypoglycemia but it's manageable

• November 2019 Sister (2) started developing a mass on her shoulder blade (in the bone). January 2020 she began getting it checked by doctors. May 2020 she had the mass removed and had a biopsy done. Today (June 1) she got the results of her biopsy back, she has Carcinosarcoma and will need to go for further testing.

776,"I'm interested in participating in NCT04368728, a US trial of 4 different potential coronavirus vaccines. All of them are mRNA vaccines, which instruct immune system cells to produce antigens similar to that of the coronavirus. As a result the immune system will (theoretically) produce the antibodies for coronavirus immunity. Anyway, I want to join the study because while I am contributing to public safety by following social distance guidelines, I want to do more to help. I also want to be able to get out of quarantine sooner, but only if I'm immune. Since I am young and don't have any underlying conditions, I am not extremely worried about adverse effects. But my parents are worried about side effects, and have talked with me about one extreme case from a different study. They are trying to discourage me because they are worried my studies will be interrupted or that I will have a severe reaction. I understand that they want to protect me, but at the same time, I have been seriously considering entering a vaccine trial since mid-March, so I'm firmly set on it. I've requested more information from the trial site, so that I can weigh any lifestyle changes and risks that I haven't been able to find already. I have been researching, and while there is a lot of uncertainty about the potential of the trial, I do believe that it's something I want to go through with. Basically, my concern is whether there are risks I'm not taking into account and if participating is the best choice for me.

778,"Yesterday we were having kind of a small dinner party for us 4 at my place. I [20M] got ready first and while she [19F] was doing her makeup, I was in the kitchen cooking. When I needed help I called her over. She came in a tank top and seemingly fully ready except for her hair from the waist up, but from the waist down she was bottomless. At that point it didn't really turn me on because I'm used to her naked and I was busy and distracted with cooking.

A bit later our friend [18F] texted my girlfriend saying that she's there. Because I had my hands dirty and we were expecting our friends to arrive separately, my girlfriend asked me if I'd mind her opening the door like she was. I was hesitant since the friend had never seen my girlfriend naked before, but I didn't want to make her wait outside in the rain so I just said okay.

After she opened the door I heard not only the voice of the friend we expected at this point, but also our male friend [19M] who turned out to tag along in the same car. There was laughter and lots of ""awkward""s. I quickly washed my hands and went to join them. They were standing there, chatting and laughing. After I greeted our friends, my girlfriend excused herself to go finish getting ready.

To my surprise I was really turned on by the whole situation, especially when she went upstairs and all 3 of us kinda gazed until she was completely out of sight. Then, and a couple of other times during the night, I had to sneakily cover my erection caused by this.

Is my reaction to this wrong? Should I talk to her about it or just act normal and never bring it up?

779,"So I live in NYC, and being that it’s an urban area, there’s a lot of racial tensions and just a lot of angry/grumpy people in general. 

I’ve lived here for a few years, and even before COVID and the protests, I’ve had multiple situations where I’ve been verbally berated by people for things that I think aren’t justified. (Like not crossing the street fast enough, or being accidentally in someone’s way for 2 seconds). 

I try to be aware of my surroundings and respectful of other people’s space, but when you live in a crowded city sometimes there’s traffic, or cramped subway cars etc, and people are smushed together. 
It happens to me all the time. I get bumped or squished but that’s just part of city living. 

The thing I’ve noticed however, is that the majority of the people who have ever really been verbally abusive towards me are POC, usually Black men. 

I want to just be understanding that when they say things like call me a “stupid fucking white bitch”, that I shouldn’t be hurt by it, and it’s just a result of the years of systematic racial oppression causing them to lash out in anger towards the system of white supremacy that I signify to them. 

The problem is, I was pretty severely abused as a child so when someone is belligerent towards me it really triggers me and makes me feel unsafe. It’s gotten to the point a few times where I’ve gotten off of the subway and thrown up, and from the sort of ptsd and emotional response those encounters trigger. 

I know that sounds really extreme but that’s how bad the trauma I have is. 

I never know what to say or do in those situations. One because I have trouble handling conflict due to my abuse past, and two because I don’t want it to seem like I’m “weaponizing my white girl tears” to further oppress people of color. (Especially when it comes to the white female and black male dynamic).

784,"Not even sure if this is possible, but my mother has always been a source of negativity and toxicity in my life. My younger brother and I grew up being emotionally and verbally abused by her. I was often spanked out of anger for things that were trivial (i.e. I flushed all the toilets in the house at the same time once and she spanked me hard and threw me in my room when I was like 5 - that's just one of the incidents I remember). She has never been maternal and has openly admitted that the reason she had children is because my dad ""wanted kids"".

My mother refuses to seek help for whatever mental illness(es) she possesses. Everyone else is the problem not her. As far as she is concerned there is nothing wrong with her. I have gone to therapy for years in order to learn how to cope with her lack of accountability and her heavy denial. Despite all of this, I have still loved and desired/maintained a relationship (strained - but still a relationship) with my mother. I now have kids of my own and cannot even imagine treating them the way my mother treated me. Also, my mother's idea of being a grandma is just buying the kids things and nothing else. My 7 year old daughter has told me many times over the last year that she doesn't like Nana anymore. That Nana is mean. That all Nana does is yell at her. Due to this my mom hasn't babysat our kids in over 6 months.

This last Holiday season she was so terrible, so selfish, so angry, etc that something changed in me. I no longer have a desire to talk to her, to call her, to see her. I find I am angry with her all the time again... so much so I am back in therapy.

I want to cut her completely from my life and just have a relationship with my father and my younger brother (6 years my junior), both of whom I am very close and have healthy relationships with. Only problem is my parents are still married and if I want to see them, I have no choice but to see her. Not only that, if I tell my mom I am done seeing her, it will genuinely break her heart because she won't see it is about her. Is this even possible to do? If anyone has a similar situation, or experience to share... or even just words of encouragement, I would be so grateful. Thanks all.

About a week or two ago I noticed two weird skin tags on my genitals. I have had sex with one person before my current boyfriend who I’ve been in a long term relationship with. My current bf was a virgin before we started dating. I practiced safe sex and used condoms with the first guy, but one time he secretly took it off. I noticed pretty quickly but still, there was a few seconds where we had sex with no condom. That was almost a year ago. 

I went to the OBGYN and they removed the skin tags, and then today I got a call from them saying I have HPV. I don’t know what to do. Im going to tell my current boyfriend, but the guilt and the anxiety is killing me. The only person I really want to tell is my mom, but she doesn’t know I’ve been sexually actively before and she is pretty conservative. I am scared for her reaction.

I told my older brother who I’m super closed with, and he told me it’s super common and that I need to tell my boyfriend, but it’s up to me to tell my mom.

789,"Tw: abuse, rape, depression.

5 years ago, my then boyfriend, who I lived with, became slowly more controlling and abusive, until he became physical and started to rape me.
I stayed in this situation for more than a year.

It's been 4 years now. I was able to recover part of my life, but I feel like I'm loosing my mind.
I rarely go out, if I don't have to. I have 3 friends I talk to, and no one else, and one of them can't stand me anymore cause I'm a wreck.
I used to have a lot of panic attacks and nightmares. It's better now, but crowded places make me uneasy and interacting with stranger or people I don't know really well usually trigger in me an anxiety response. 
I can't stand physical contact, except for a few people. I had sex again, but it's usually painful cause I get nervous and stiffen, so I don't do it until I really like someone. 
All the things I liked to do don't give me anything anymore. I don't feel anything, just fear and loneliness.
I just want to be able to be myself again.
I was never popular, but had a few friends, I used to go out, I had many hobbies and passions. I had dreams for my future and now I just don't have anything.
I know I should go to therapy, but I can't afford it.

So, I'm asking now, how can I have a normal life again?
Do you have any suggestions?
If any of you lived through something similar, how did you manage to cope with it? Have you have a normal life now?
How do you become able to make friends again, and go out, and do things...?

Jones Brown Law: “Unfortunately, many people tend to misunderstand the process and purpose of a typical background. Most background checks are to see if you had any arrests and/or criminal convictions. The point is not to find your every secret but to check if there are any criminal history. Now if you have a permanent restraining order that ties into civil court records, it is possible for the order to appear in a background check.” https://jonesbrownlaw.com/2018/07/can-restraining-orders-affect-my-job/

New Mexico Criminal Law Offices: “A general criminal background check, like those done by employers, should not show a restraining order, as that is a civil matter.

794,"I don’t post often so I apologize if this is worded poorly. I live in San Jose, CA (for safety I won’t say where in San Jose) and life has slowly turned into a hell here. I’ve been here all my life, what little of my family that’s left lives here. When the virus struck and I had to help my elderly grandparents get groceries we would get yelled at in the parking lot to “go home with our China virus”. My grandfather immigrated from Hong Kong over 50 years ago but my father married a white woman so I am half asian, half white.

My grandparents can’t move, they don’t have the money to and my grandfather was terrified he’d be assaulted if he left his house because of his ethnicity, so I do the shopping for them now once a week. I look just asian enough to earn the same comments. Now I was assaulted when I was 14 and that really fucked my mental. I am beyond paranoid I am going to get assaulted when people look at me for too long so these targeted racist insults scare the life out of me. Luckily they kinda calmed down after a while.

Now San Jose is one of the cities with rioting and protesting though not nearly as intense as some with recent events. When the protestors got into traffic on the freeway and stopped everyone for hours I was terrified in my car. They were going up to cars and smashing windows in and a woman came up to my small car and yelled at me for being a bigot because I looked white. I just started crying. I hate racism and I never use someone’s race as a basis for anything. I can’t go to the police for protection because all my friends say “all cops are bad” even though only the bad ones are publicized and I can’t stay home because I’m so anxious someone is going to break into my house and rob and attack me. 

My home town is a living hell where I feel like I’m a horrible because people assume that since I’m white/asian I am the epitome of evil. Maybe that’s just my little area I’m in but I’m legitimately worried I should move somewhere but I don’t know where. And I’m not sure I could leave my grandparents alone here either. Will this pass? Should I just move? I’m not sure what to do anymore.",01Jun2020,1

So I've always had a really rocky relationship with my sister, and so has everyone in our family. She has said the absolutely foulest thing anyone has evwr said to me and our mother, but thats a story for another time. 

We have not seen eachother in months due to corona. The dilemma I'm in right now is that she invited my mother and I to her daughter's birthday party. I accepted and asked for gift list. I just found out that it wont just be us(we're a tiny family now), but ALL her friends. It will put us near the limit for how many are allowed to be near eachother in our country(20). 

Our mother is old and has serious issues with her lungs, so if she gets corona... well... after finding out about the amount of people joining, I voiced my concerns and to put it nicely, she did not give one shit about our mother, but said I could stay home if it makes me feel better. 

What Im here for is... what would you guys do? I think having a large party the second the tight quarantine is over is nuts, and quite frankly dangerous, not only to our mother. We have a responsibility but she's just back to normal now...",01Jun2020,1

I have this friend that I know since we were children ( our moms were friends) and sice last summer I developed a lot of feelings for her. I told her that I liked her and wanted to be more than just friends but she declined and said that we better not ruin our friendship.
Since then I had a girlfriend that really f***ed me up emotionally and after the breakup I started to love my initial crush again.

The problem is that I wanted to feel better and get over it but because we are in this friend group together we see eachother almost every day.
The shit part started at a party for the new year when we got drunk and she was staying in my arms ( that made feel so good) and then we were at a party 2 months later and she got drunk again and the same thing happened ,she stayed with me more open and close than usual. That passed and after another 2 months this happened again and I started thinking that she has feelings for me ( I forgot to mention that she is kinda shy and doesn't talk very mutch). 
I tried to talk with her about what happened between us and she told me is nothing and she doesn't like me it's just because she was drunk.

Now the bad thing is what happened yesterday, we all got sooooo drunk ( the friend group , including me) and we started cuddling on the grass and when I tried to kiss her she turned her head. Apparently my friends thought that we really kissed ( because we stayed some time lip to lip close). I tried to apologize to her and say that it was only because I was drunk but she said is ok and as long as she doesn't remember what happened I don't have any reason to feel guilty. Now I am very embarrassed and I don't know what should I do or think.

Any thought/advice?

802,"When I was in school, I always felt energized by all the people around me and I felt more of a need to do things. Laying around doing nothing would hurt my image so I constantly work hard to be better and not be hated. Obviously I don't do everything for image. Sometimes I'm nice to people just because it makes me happy. Another reason is that I don't get many things. I don't mean just material things, but even friends or recognition. I've tried with the friends thing but nobody I know really connects with me and I honestly just don't get their sense of humor. I feel like the harder I work, the closer I am to actually getting things. 

When I'm at home, the only people I'm around are my parents. My dad is gone most of the time because he's an essential worker. And around my parents it feels different. I don't have the need to be competitive or keep up my image. I don't really like being at home because the lack of energy around the house just drains my motivation and I end up feeling like a glob of human just doing nothing. I've tried to keep myself motivated by telling myself that if I work hard, I'll be a better person when I go back to school and finally get things. But at home theres a lot less pressure. In school, one wrong move and your reputation is seriously injured. At home, nothing I do seems to make a difference. I know that it will make a difference in the long run, but I'm so used to automatic consequences that my patience is about zero. The worst part is that the lockdown keeps getting extended. At the beginning, it was supposed to be two weeks and then it got longer and longer. Now the estimated date in July 4th. Nothing I do at home is going to make the virus go away or make things open sooner. 

Now I realize how little self motivation I have and how dependent I am on other people for motivation. The people around me give me energy and now that there isn't anybody, I'm struggling. It makes me feel like such a hypocrite because the one thing I have always wanted is independence. I want to be able to handle things, but this whole stay at home thing just shows me how I really can't handle anything without other people. I used to be so positive and I used to think that if I work hard, I can do anything. But now I'm falling down this negative pit of self sluggishness. Not that theres anything wrong with slugs. Slugs are great animals, I just would rather not feel like one. No matter how much I think positive and look forward to going tpback to school, nothing can convince the rest of myself to feel better.

806,"I've tried about every type of schedule/plan out there, with daily plans, timetables, weekly plans, 3-day schedules, ordered lists, unordered lists, schedules with allocated durations for each task, and so on. In the end though, the longest I manage to adhere to any of it consecutively is around two days.

I just can't seem to do what I've planned at a particular point in time (be that at a specific time, or on a specific day, etc) when I know that I can do it much better (quality + efficiency wise) at another time. OR when I feel that there's something else that's more pressing than the task I planned.

And it's true that the quality and time it takes to finish a task see vast improvements when I'm in the right frame of mind, or energy level, etc. I can focus much better, lose my train of thought less, and come up with much deeper and more comprehensive insights. It's just that these headspaces and moods don't follow a strict schedule and don't lend themselves to structure very much.

My focus largely depends on what I feel is most important at a point in time (not necessarily what I rationally think is most important). My motivation/mood depends a lot on energy levels which are often out of my control.

This is an issue because there are many responsibilities I should fulfil that I almost never feel are important. For example, I can't bring myself to feel that regular homework assignments are the most pressing concern I should be dealing with at most points in time, even though rationally I know that they are very important.

The other thing is my condition at a particular point in time. I know people who can ignore their tiredness or low mood to complete a task if they feel it is important. I have a great deal of trouble doing this and I have lost many hours of productivity to sleep (I seem to get tired more easily than everyone) or sitting at the table staring at my work and getting nothing done while feeling progressively worse.

Anyways, one of my best friends called me up on Saturday saying she was wondering if she could borrow one of my guns. I asked her what was happened for her to need it. She told me she was having a polite debate in a comments section regarding her views on the Black Lives/ Blue lives matter. One of the comments apparently who was a black woman was getting heated with her and threatened to come get her and her family that night. She pulled up my friends address, her sisters name, and other valid information of hers.

I was freaked out upon the initial thought of this so I told her sure that she could come get it and I gave her a .22 pistol with some ammo.

I promised not to mention anyone about it. Later night, we got into an argument with her in a group chat where, me her and 5 other close friends were talking about the protests. Shes very far right and has horrible views towards the African American community. She mentioned that looters get shooters isn't wrong to say for the vandals and thieves. We were all very intrigued by this, tried to fix her thinking, told her she was racist and blocked her from the chat.

Now I'm really concerned. This girl, who I have to cut out now as well to keep the respect of my family have to cut out is in possession of my weapon after her strong beliefs of looters needing to be shot. I know shes not such a person and wouldn't go to that drastic measure. Shes not that evil, just her views are butchered.

We spoke and she said she asked if she could return it on friday just for any reason. I said if you still suspect you are under the radar from that lady then fine. Im really concerned on even if this is right

After Covid-19 a lot of people have faced struggles, including myself (f18) and my mother. She has been forced into selling our home and she has decided to take the opportunity to move 4 hours up north (3 1/2) without a pee break.

817,"I think I could be pregnant. I'm 18 and my boyfriend is 19, and the reason I think I'm pregnant is because of two reasons. One, I think we had failed the pullout method (yes, we know it was stupid of us to try it.) And two, you're going to think this is weird, but I had an extremely vivid dream of holding a newborn, and my mom's reaction to the entire situation was so realistic, like there was no weird antics that you'd expect from just a random dream. I wasn't even worried I was pregnant until this dream happened, despite what happened in bed (I know I should have been worried). Now, here's something extra weird: the family has had kind of a history of seeing their children in dreams/visions before even knowing they're pregnant with them. That's the biggest reason why this dream stuck out to me as a reason to be worried I might actually be pregnant. But, I could be wrong. There are becoming more ""signs"" (for example, I'm days late for my period) as time goes on but still yet nothing to solidly proving this.

Anyway, if it turns out to be true, I want to know what I can do. My mom and I have sort of once spoken about what to do in the event that I accidentally pregnant. She said it's ultimately my choice what I do but she will try to talk me into putting it up for adoption. I'm thinking of agreeing but only after I try my hardest to get on my feet and be able to support this child. So, I want to know how I can do for that.

You might need to know that I'm a high school dropout and have problems that'll affect my ability to even hold a job. I'm planning on getting my GED and trying to get a job, anyway, but if that doesn't work out, the best I can think to do is just commission my art which I'm planning to do anyway. I guess I can also sell things I've crafted, and I have a few books I've written that I'm planning on publishing, too, if that'll help, but those two things I have very little knowledge on how to do. Of course, my boyfriend is going do what he can to help. I have no doubt that he's going to be able to get a job and do good at it. He's also done amazing in school and is graduating unlike me, so he has a good chance, but we're not sure which job he'll go for yet. I'm not sure if he's ever planned to get a job, because he just wants to go to college and then make video games. I've wanted to be a video game designer myself and plan to work with him on that, but it's going to be long before we'll even be able to do that. I also just don't want him to be the only one bringing in money, I find that unfair to him, especially since it wasn't his plan either for me to get pregnant. So, I just what I can do, and if you have advice on what I can ask him to do as well, that could also help.

As a result of knowing this and being bothered by it, I started being more flirtatious and jokingly saying things like ""oh yeah look at what could have been"" but after being flirty last night too, I really rubbed myself the wrong way, even though she is sort of flirty back, I just feel like I have been pushing it and its really fucked for her bf, i'm deciding to stop that today because I don't know if she is being flirty back because she wants too and she regrets not going for me or if its because she feels like she has too because of how I act, she could even be joking for all I know, she has a very outgoing personality. 

But lets say that she breaks up with her boyfriend (which might happen within a month by the looks of it) and by some miracle I am there and she likes me back and we become a couple, would I have been a second choice? Or would I have been too late the other times?   And if I have been the second choice, how should I feel? Or if I was too late, how should I feel? Should I just drop it now and not look back on it

Also side note, should I tell her that i'm sorry for being flirty and pushy and a bit jealous or should I just leave it alone and let her get the hint? And is she a bad person for being a bit flirty back? Even if it might have not been that serious, which I have no idea of. 

Tl;Dr: I have liked a girl since January, I asked her out once but she was already with someone, I went away for 2 months to focus on school and myself a couple months after with her knowing and when I came back I found out that she liked me before I stopped talking to her but she has a new boyfriend now. I have been flirty ever since and she has shown some flirtation and regret back at times but im not sure how serious she was about it, but im deciding to stop. Should I tell her im stopping or should I just leave it alone and she will figure it out? And if we get together after this bf that she seems a bit rough with, would I have been a second choice or too late the other times? How should I feel if I was a second choice and how should I feel if I was too late? Also is it messed up that she flirts back a bit?",01Jun2020,2
823,"To clarify, I’m 16.
I have really bad social anxiety and to try to fix it, I joined a discord server full of people who have the same interests as me. When I joined I mostly just messaged people, but I wanted to take the actual step of talking to them and joined a voice channel. When I joined they asked me a few normal questions you would when you first meet someone but then they asked for my age, I really don’t know why (I think it was cause I assumed they were also 18 and I wanted to fit in), but I told them I was 18. After talking to them more I’ve found them to be really funny and welcoming people who are also 16 or close. I know it might not seem like that big of a deal but I feel so guilty that I lied and I also don’t want anyone to think I’m 18 and get into trouble. What do I do??",01Jun2020,1

829,"I'm 29 years old, male and gay. I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend (31) for 8 years. We live together and are really happy.

However a year ago I got back in touch with a boy from my past. At the time I was 21 and he was 18. We became close friends, and it briefly became something physical, but it ended quickly -  I didn't want to hold him back at university, and I just met the guy who would become my boyfriend. And apart from a few conversations over the years we never really spoke again until last year.

Since then we have pretty much spoken every day via Messenger. We both have partners, and he is completely in love with his boyfriend. We have a lot of common interests and beliefs, and generally get on like a house on fire. I don't know why but we just seem to implicitly trust each other with everything - we're so similar in so many ways. 

What makes it complicated is that we often end up talking about sex. Like, a lot. We are both very open and talk about our experiences with guys. But it's become confusing - neither of us wany anything beyond a friendship but our conversations keep circling back to sex or sexual things, and it almost feels like there's something unresolved there from our past.

What kind of friendship is this? Are we both kidding ourselves, and should we try and cut off ties? Is there a way to reshape our friendship onto a more completely platonic territory, or is this energy something that will always bubble up under the surface?",01Jun2020,2

839,"


I’m 13. My cousin Hailey, is 18. She’s like an older sister to me. We Snapchat and talk to each other everyday and tell each other almost everything. She always gives me advice on things. I don’t get to see her much because she lives out of state (I live in AZ) but when my parents take me to visit her (she lives outside of DC) or when she comes here we always do stuff together. I haven’t seen her in person since July when she came here for a week. 

With everything that’s been going on lately, the protesting and rioting, she has posted things like “block me if you support trump, f*k the kkk, white supremacist, block me if you think all cops aren’t bad cuz they are, block me if your mad about riots, etc” she also posted “if I block you, it’s personal, idc how close we were, if I think ur racist, blocked” 

Two days ago, She asked me if I wanted to fly out to dc and protest with her. She would pay for my flight. My parents saw everything that’s been going on in DC and think it’s a terrible idea, plus she wants to riot not protest. I was explaining the difference between rioting and protesting and she blocked me. She said “you know what f*k you you racist lil b*tch, we aren’t family anymore your human scum” and blocked me. On Snapchat and on Instagram. She still hasn’t unblocked me. I think she blocked my number too. How am I racist??? I just said my parents won’t let me fly out there because it’s extremely dangerous and I don’t want to be apart of rioting. That doesn’t mean I’m racist. I’m not? I understand peaceful protesting but vandalism you can get arrested for that. I don’t understand what I did wrong. I told my mom and my mom was going to send her a message and she blocked my mom too. 

I’m upset she blocked me because I don’t understand why. We were so close and talked to each other everyday. I was just trying to explain why rioting is not a good idea. Like destroying stuff",01Jun2020,2
840,"Well I've recently been having a lot of issues with my self esteem the past couple of years and my teens on and off , I'm 22 years old female. I'm just using this as a throwaway account. 

I have a lot of confidence issues particularly with my face, the thing is on quite a few occasions while I've being out I've been insulted by complete strangers just walking past me for how I look and I feel at breaking point. I'm crying as I write this, I was just out for a walk and as I was out I swear some dude with his pal not far off my age just shouted at me 'you're an ugly mug'. But it's not that unusual and I'm really struggling to believe this is just coincidence anymore. I'm just trying to get on with my life and hoping to go back to college after lockdown, I just feel as though I'm going to have to always deal with crap like this anymore  - I really can't. I don't know how I'm going to do it. I can't imagine my life being like this feeling so ugly people are pointing out, I feel like some circus freak. I stay within Central Scotland in an area that could be nicer, I do wonder if it has something to do with youth here as it normally is guys my age that say stuff to me.

I have previously been to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy to deal with my issues and was told I had Social Anixety, my therapist was great and helped me through some tough times last year where I felt really low. It wasn't just my looks I also had a lot of stuff going on, but my Social anxiety from all this is why I went to begin with. I finished it late last year.

I always come online to read when I feel anxious and I notice it always talks about having confidence and nice clothes, but I always try to get nice things that are flattering and wear makeup out. And I really don't mean to sound stuck up but I don't have any features that stand out like a big nose or forehead. It bugs me though because it makes me think I must just have an unlikable/unattractive face which seems much worse, I'm not overweight either and try my best to look after myself by washing daily and using face creams. I just don't know what else I could really do, I try to look after myself and make the effort. I live in Central Scotland and I could be in a nicer area, but I do wonder if there are some people here that are just not nice. I have my friends and have been asked out a couple of times by guys for dates in the past few months. I'm speaking to one the now who seems lovely, I don't even know if i should be considering it the now since my confidence is so bad though. 

I'm sorry for the long post but I feel so low and I would really appreciate some help and well if this is normal. Thanks for reading",01Jun2020,0

843,"I (21F) come from a really small Midwestern town, I have since moved to a small city in northern Minnesota, but still keep in touch occasionally with a few friends from high school in a group chat. This group chat is mostly conservative people except for me and one other, and over the years some in the chat have started to become more progressive in how they think which is awesome but others still stick to their ways. For years I would sit and listen to what they have to say and we would debate. But the debates only happened when a few were on my side. Since protests started on for George Floyd's death I noticed none of them except the other liberal have spoken out at all on this topic which is rare. So I sent a message asking what they are doing to help and if they care about whats going on. Some say it wasn't my business of the news isn't developed enough yet for them to speak out. I said you can speak out for the fact that a black man was publicly murdered by police. I argued with cited sources and philosophy and comparative politics that I study and school. In the past before I was in school they would say I couldn't argue cause I was not attending university no matter how many sources I cited, now when whats going on falls under my fields of study they still say I have no clue. I am not fishing I genuinely do not know if I am being the toxic one for repeatedly calling them out.

I (f23) have two very close friends (both women close to my age), one of which has lived with roommates before and is fortunate enough to have her family supporting her. I am also in a similar situation as her, where I’ve lived with other people as well and my family would be willing to help me out in case anything happened with rent and whatnot. Our other friend has never lived on her own, and has always had a job but is always just scraping by. She has on multiple occasions asked us for money (nothing over $40) and has never paid us back, not that we expected her to but still. I have paid for the majority of her food and drinks whenever we go out because I can and I want to be a good friend, but it’s gotten to the point now where it’s kind of expected for me to do that (which I understand is my doing). She doesn’t have any money saved up ever, but she has a new job which is paying her better so that might change. The problem is that the three of us all live in our parent’s homes, and we all want to move out. Yet my more irresponsible friend talks about it a lot, and believes that we all are going to be able to live together. My other friend and I definitely want to live with each other but we don’t want to live with her given her track record with money, yet we feel awful because she lives in a pretty toxic household and she hates living there. We’re getting close to having enough money saved up to move out, and we’re dreading having to talk about this with her. We want to keep it positive and explain our reasoning without making it seem like we’re pointing fingers. Either way we know she’s going to be mad, but we don’t know how to go about it exactly.

850," I was a developer at a really crappy tech company for 10 years. I left to go into software management at a much larger company. Last year they wanted to move me to product management, but instead I quit the job completely and took a dev contracting role for a lot more money. That contract has dried up, and honestly I wasn't very good at software development anymore. So I took a full time role as a developer at my current company (really small start up). However, I continue to make mistakes at work. I get wrecked all the time, and I have lost all my confidence and self esteem. I really dont like the role I'm in. I took the role because I needed a job, but i really feel like the more effort I put into the job, the worse I do. I miss basic stuff, like forgetting to merge in latest changes before making a release. I've been applying for dev jobs, but I can't get through any technical interviews. Everyone always says they like me, but no one even wants to move forward past a phone interview. I dont even get phone calls about management jobs because 90% of them use tech stacks that im not familiar with. I'm a .NET guy, which is becoming more and more irrelevant by the day. What can I do? I've been applying for months now. Should I even be looking at development jobs? I am so lost right now. I have become extremely jaded in my current place. I have spoken with my boss about my current frustrations, but he didn't offer any advice other than to get better and ask other peoples opinions before I submit my changes.

853,"This is a long story to try to fit into a summary, but the backstory is extremely important, but I’m going to try my best. I had some long time friends that had been in a friend group of 4 (including me), and we had all been friends for nearly 5 years. One of them was my very best friend, Friend A, and about a year ago, she broke the news to me that she was moving across the country with her family. I was heartbroken, of course, and already started making plans with her to make her time before she left amazing. I talked to the other 2 friends in the group about having a going away party for her, and they agreed. I planned everything, I paid for the food and a cake, we even did it at my house. 

Before this, I’ve had a “friend” in the group (Friend B), and we hadn’t been getting along very well as of the time being, but as what a normal person should do, I pushed our differences aside for Friend A, because I wanted to make things good for her and not make the situation about myself. 

Fast forward around a month, and I’m really busy in the summer (for summer practices with sports and other things), and this was when things hit the fan. 

Friend A, who I haven’t had much time to hangout with, texts me, and tells me that they are moving the next week, and all they want is their stuff back. No word of hanging out or wanting to see me, and naturally, my feeling are hurt, and I ask what’s wrong. I am told that Friend B and Friend C (Friend C is extremely passive, and doesn’t have a huge part in this story) have been telling Friend A that I am a toxic person and I don’t need to be around her, even though I show no traits of a toxic person, and I truly do so much for them all, especially Friend A. I was honestly dumbfounded and hurt, because these were my closest friends that I thought cared about me. I of course message them asking them if they thought I was a toxic friend, because “no way they would think that about me, I’m not that kind of person, they know that”, and I get a call from Friend B. Friend B promised me that the two of us were having a private conversation, asked my side of the story (when Friend A told me the three of them were hanging out without me) and attempted to get me to badmouth the other two, and I told them I knew of their plan, and then was accused by Friend B of doing things to Friend A and C  that I never did, and things went on for a while, until we hung up the phone, and I never spoke to them again unless I absolutely had to, Friend A moved without a word, and I tried my best to move on and find friends that cared about me (thankfully, I have). Throughout my school year, fake rumors were spread about me, and things got really hard for me, but I pulled through, and finished up the year strong.

-

Backstory is over. 

Friend A has had some movies of my deceased grandmothers that were very important to me, and had been supposed to send me over a year ago. I had asked multiple times, and then Friend A finally came in to visit, and told me they had my movies. They asked to go out to lunch with me, and they would give them to me, and that they weren’t friends with Friend B and C anymore. I agreed, because I want the movies I grew up watching with my grandmother back, they are important for me to do anything for them. I had a feeling that I was being set up about the lunch thing, and that this was a way to “get back at me” or something. So, someone who has the other friends’ social media saw that all 3 friends were hanging out again (after I was told by Friend A that they were no longer friends) and I think I’m being set up to be publicly made fun of, but I have to get my grandmother’s belongings.

Everyday for 3 years, my goal was to be prepared enough to qualify for this test. I just received the email this morning that I’ve advanced to the final test in this process (this process starting back in April).

I have a nice set of family and friends. Their birthdays are spread out across the year. Probabiy works out around 2 birthdays per month but I find having to constantly think about and spend money on gifts draining. 

It's not just birthdays, it's friends children's birthday, baby showers, engagements and everything else. To be clear, if I had more disposable income I probably wouldn't begrudge it so much. Its the fact I can barely afford to live, live a modest life and the fact that you can't get anything for your money these days! I feel like i give lame presents but that's the most I can afford. For example, my 3 neices were getting re-christened (yes I mean they were christened twice because my sister remarried!) and these kids have the best of EVERYTHING. I couldn't bare to spend money I didn't have on gifts they don't need so I made little sentimental boxes with poems and crafty stuff instead. I know my sister thought I was complete cheak skate. 

Those select few who are deserving and grateful, I like to treat. It's the rest who I really begrudge spending on. Especially those kids who have everything and I can't afford to buy anything of interest to so I buy a token gift and they give me a token thanks. What's the point? 

Is this what life is? A constant cycle of spending  money on things you don't want to spend it on? To be clear, I don't expect anything back. A gathering in the pub with a few drinks is the best birthday gift to me- people's time.

Also to add, I'm the ""fixer"" in all my groups. I've always got time, patience and understanding. I think that's the only reason I get away with being so stingy. To make it worse, I'm not open about my stinginess. I'm forever trying to look unstingy and pretend I'm generous when really, I'm always worrying about money.

Anyone else?",01Jun2020,1
859,"I’m one of the lucky people working from home due to COVID-19. I am grateful to be working, and have been busting my ass since we are now understaffed due to so many people being laid off. About a week ago I took half a day off work because I had some of the worst period cramps of my life. We have an online system that we use to clock our hours/vacation/sick days. I clocked in half a sick day, called my manager and told her I had a migraine/cramps, and thought that would be the end of it. I only took the morning off, and I rarely EVER take sick days. I always have leftover sick days/vacation days at the end of the year. 

Today a member of HR approached me via email saying that she will require a doctor’s note. She is saying that due to COVID-19, she requires that I provide proof that I do not have the virus before I can return to work (I am required to go into the office for a day once every 2 weeks or so). I told her that given the current climate, I would rather not go in to the doctor if I’m healthy. I explained to her that I just had some bad cramps and a migraine and it was literally just a few hours. I told her it’s not uncommon that I have a headache when I have period cramps. 

After her whole spiel of how she needs to ensure the safety of workers, she then told me that if I wasn’t ill, I should change my input to half a vacation day instead of a sick day. This really angered me because I get paid out at the end of the year for vacation days I do not use. I do not get paid out for sick days. 

.... This is totally nonsensical, right? Like, if they are genuinely concerned about me having COVID, I should not be allowed to go in and swap out my sick day to a vacation day. Am I wrong to fight my employer on this? I do not want to go to my doctor’s office, possibly expose myself to COVID,  and PAY for a doctor’s note that says I am a woman and I get periods during a fucking pandemic. 

Any advice for what to do/what next steps to take is really appreciated.",01Jun2020,3
861,"I don’t want to go into too much detail but short version is, around Christmas time I went to a small get together at my childhood friends house, my fiancé couldn’t make it as he had only recently got out of hospital and was still recovering so it was just me. I knew my friend used to have a crush on me but that was years ago and I never thought he still clung to those feelings, basically. He got drunk, attacked me and pushed his way inside me. I got him off me and left the house. He texted me and said, and I quote “I like how your lips tasted.” And a bunch of other creepy stuff I don’t want to type. I don’t want to press charges or anything it would be too humiliating but I want and need to tell my fiancé, this has affected our relationship pretty badly, he knows something is up with me but I shut him down whenever he tries to talk about it. I know I’m an asshole but I feel so ashamed and I don’t want him to see me like that. We haven’t had sex in almost a month and whenever we do it’s awful, I know it’s me but I think he blames himself. I try and I desperately want it but when it comes the time comes I get scared and freak out. 

The only other person who knows is my best friend. She got it out of me a few weeks after it happened, talking to her has helped a little but I want to talk to my fiancé, I’m just scared. I feel like a cheated on him and I’m scared he’ll think the same and leave me. He told me years ago he would leave without question if I ever cheated. We both have always held that position and I’m worried he will consider this cheating, I technically had sex with another man.    I’m really scared to lose him but I can’t keep living like this but if I do I feel like it will kill me or make me lose him. I can’t do either. Sorry for the rambling I’m just writing as I think. I hope this is the right forum I’m not great with this site I mainly just lurk. Thanks for reading.",01Jun2020,0
862,"My boyfriend has pretty bad (diagnosed) OCD and is one of the nicest people I've ever known. He isn't in therapy right now but will be soon (stupid pandemic)  He feels excessive guilt for fairly normal things but this thing he is freaking out over is not normal. He confessed his guilt for trying to find images of naked girls aged 12-14 when he was 13. This was a once off as he never found anything on Google and quickly realised it was illegal. However, he feels guilty because he worries he could've  checked something younger than this even though he does not remember this. He just feels so scared that he could've looked up younger, maybe even 5 years younger or something and forgotten it as he might have merely typed it in and not really tried or was so guilty he managed to block it from his memory and it was over 7 years ago so its hard to remember

While freaking out he was almost certain he never actually did search for anything younger as why would he? His crushes were 12-14 at the time and he has 0 recollection of checking anything other than 12-14. The next day,  he said  that he is 99% sure he never looked below 12. He still has that 1% and doesn't want to promise he didn't go below 12 as it's too scary because what if he suddenly realises he did one day? He has said before about various memories  ""I think X thing happened when I was 14"" before only to realise in a calmer state a few days later  ""no actually X never happened, I just panicked because it was possible i could have but I have no actual memory of it and realistically I would remember it"". If he genuinely did and just can't remember, should I leave him over it? I've never noticed anything creepy before and I know all his passwords so I highly doubt he is hiding anything. He finds daddy/school girl roleplay gross and called his friend out on hitting on a 15 year old when he was 19, so I take it he isn't a creep? I'm still concerned that the 1% chance he did automatically makes him a bad person.",01Jun2020,1

There was a guy I really liked and would always talk to at parties in the fall and he’d always tell my friend things about me. Things ended up not working out with him because he sent me a picture of a girl in his room and when I got annoyed about that he asked her to his date party. He was always flirting with me and seemed like he really liked me but after all this him and I started to not get along or speak at all.
Than in January he got a girlfriend but at parties he would always try to get my attention. I would ignore him pretty much because he was in a relationship. He would stare at me all the time and go up to my friends he hardly knows to talk to them. Than when my friends and I were standing by his girlfriends friend group, he walked over and started flirting with her but was staring at me out of the corner of his eye the entire time and kept looking at me and than looking away. So I just looked at him and he did a full 360 turn away from her to talk to me and looked like paralyzed and nervous. I said hi and than turned away from him annoyed and he stood there looking heartbroken and ran off in the other direction alone. 
Than the next party I saw him at he was really pissed off at me even though him and I don’t talk. I looked up and saw him glaring at me me and than saw him walk up to me. He walked past his girlfriend and she tried to grab him and he ignored her. He than stood in front of me and just glared at me without saying anything. Anytime i was having a conversation with a friend of his he felt the need to walk up and say hi to one of his friends. Than he came up to me later and started talking to me Bri extremely cold and making rude scrunching faces at me. ThAn he rubbed my shoulder and turned his back to me and walked away. Even in March he would still just walk away from all his friends and stand in front of me and stare at smirk.  
Why is he acting like this. Even if he likes me I feel like he shouldn’t act on it &amp; I feel like it’s not okay to be obsessing over another girl while I’m a relationship. So I sent him a really blunt text asking him to please stop because he was disrespecting his girlfriend and he read it and ignored it than went throb and unliked all of my pictures and blocked me the next day.",01Jun2020,1
865,"Posting here because I'm desperate and the small subs more tailored to this kind of thing seem inactive. But anyway...

I was on anti-anxiety medication since age 12 and got off of it at 17. My first year of college was okay, but as long as I've been off the meds I've declined. I am 20M and I can barely function now. I have severe OCD and I was diagnosed with a mood disorder. I experience mania but rarely and I experience depression only about half the time. The symptoms of the OCD are much worse than anything I've had with my mood.

I have both obsessions and compulsions lasting all day. Sometimes I am just overwhelmed with scary/negative thoughts. Parents dying in horrific ways, disgusting thoughts, house break ins, WAY worse than that. I have compulsions. I can barely eat. I struggle to walk properly, most tasks I do trigger some kind of negative thought. I couldn't leave the house before, I have obsessions that inject strange or bizarre thoughts that distract me or make me lonely, things like paranoid thoughts or breaks from reality, it's not really psychosis though. I can't type certain words and I struggle to speak because I have so many weird tics stopping me from saying certain forbidden things. Every single thing I try to do, my brain says ""do this perfectly or X will happen"".

As for my life now, I'm unemployed. I quit my first and second jobs, and by the third one symptoms were so bad that I got fired. I can't handle basic instructions, I engage in compulsive thinking and organizing at the job and I over analyze social interaction. I've been trying for a year and 6 months to make my own business online using skills I had from before this, so I can earn money at my own pace, but even that is flooded with doubts, compulsions, perfectionism, just suffocating amounts of panicked worry. I can't do anything anymore. I can't even go to certain subreddits, I have compulsions with Reddit, where I make a post and type excessively. I really need help.

This is a living hell, and I can't do this anymore. I need advice or help on how I can possibly approach this. I have seen numerous therapists, none of that works, the only thing I've avoided is medication, but I'm starting to see that this disease can't be fixed without some kind of medical intervention. The side effects are awful, like I'm giving something up to get something else. At least until I've figured out my situation and gotten back to school/work. My life right now is totally stuck. Posting this is breaking one of my compulsions, hopefully I can keep it up for a while.",01Jun2020,1
866,"The following was written yesterday, a few hours after the exchange:

""A friend of mine shared with me his homosexual relationship with a very influential national political figure, of course, he didn't explicitly mention that they were engaged in sodomy, it was evident from the very nature of their relationship, and to infer that one hardly had to stress one's critical faculties.

The homosexual relationship is okay, that being with a certain wealthy and powerful forty-year-old married man is okay, as well, though it does scare me a lot, all homosexuals with power going around fucking young adults scare me, especially when they are married to the other sex, even worse, and has children, and I do not know exactly why but their pretence in society of being a straight married man with children does make the whole surreptitious activity a lot nastier and sinister. 

My friend, the best way to describe him would be is to say that he's an amateur conman, I suspect him to a borderline, he's always on about his mood swings and the possible infidelity of his girlfriend, to whom he's habitually unfaithful, and is distraught at the plausibility of reciprocity. 

I was always inclined to believe that every man is essentially good, and, as if it were a matter of fact, that evil invariably is banal, god lord! What am I on about?

The politician, I do not know enough to know how technically correct it is to employ this terminology when referring to him, basically, what I wish to say is, like you would expect of any politician to be, is corrupt to a tee. And my friend now wish to act as his benami--or is already so, as someone who is prodigiously street smart, he expects himself to have a number of benamis of his own.

My friend now fancies himself something of an Escobar, talking about the conversion of black money into white money, on the banks of Switzerland and Istanbul, about his successful effort in making millions exporting a rare species of snake.

After coming to know all this, I bethought myself that the vile thing that is human finds himself awake in an equally wicked and dangerous and capricious, precariously held, world.

I equally felt the urge to seize this opportunity and dip my toes into new waters.""

And today, there were a ton of red flags, this friend trying his best to convince me otherwise, him doing so only consolidated my assumptions rather than falter, the same guy who never picks up my call, calls me once in the afternoon to go smoke outside, that was fine; then again in the evening for a haircut, that was almost fine, notwithstanding I began to panic a bit; and at last a third time, this time I was sure it was death.

Is this schizophrenia? I am not clinically diagnosed, though I am Bipolar (NOS) and ADHD. 

I am 20. I am very sleepy, and only slightly paranoid or anxious, to that I thank the conversation I had with my mother. 

How do I not be their target, and make sure that they don't want anything to do with me?

Or is it simply this merely one of his grandiose con's?

I am certain of that the *in and out the anal* relationship is true. That the man of forty gave my friend his Audi and within the last two days a Mercedes is true as well.
The man of forty giving him money and somewhat politically influential is true.

Despite the whole lockdown and protests I couldn’t help but look forward to summer. I’m not sure why since it’s going to be the exact same thing that I have been doing but yet I was still excited. I don’t no why I was looking forward to this. Every day I wake up feeling like shit and go the bed feeling like shit too. 

I’ve always had problems with friends especially in the past school year. See I had friends but I really didn’t have anyone I was close too. During school I would hang with them but after school they would always hang and I never could go. They all became super close friends and I was kinda just there. Part of the reason that I never could hang with them was because of soccer. I play on a competitive level soccer team so I always was doing games or practices. Then because I never would hang with them I lost all of my confidence and was way to shy to ask if I could go. The thing is I honestly don’t know if I even enjoy soccer. I’m always anxious about upcoming games and practices and I spend most of my time nervous not even wanting to be there. My parents would never let me quit though. Luckily for me I became close friends with someone who invited me to hang out with them after school one day. And after that things were mostly better. 

Flash forward to now and everything seems to be going to shit again. I just learned yesterday that my friends are starting to hang out again despite Covid, which I have no problem with. The thing is i can’t ever go because I know my parents would never allow me to. I can feel myself slipping back into those old feelings of loneliness and honestly it scares the shit out of me. That was one of my worse times in my life and it’s all coming back. My one close friend who is the one that invited me to hang that one time is the only person I have really stayed in touch with since the start of the lockdown. He is having a really hard time right now. He is having family issues and other personal stuff that is making him feel like utter shit. I try to help him but I find myself just listening and saying sorry more than actually giving him helpful advice. He is one of the only people that makes me happy and it hurts me thst I can’t do the same for him. My soccer team got a new coach which is stressing the hell out of me. Next year I start highschool and with this whole covid thing I have no idea what to expect. I feel sick everyday and I don’t even want to eat anymore.

Heya people of reddit!  
So,  for quite some time I've had trouble deciding what I want to do with my  life. I've always had the problem of suddenly trying to plan ahead *(what I want to do after highschool? What Carrier, What Collage, ect)*, and finding something that interests me only to realize it likely isn't as fun as it sounds *(EX: TSA Agent)*, realize it's hard to break through into that industry *(EX: Any media based job)*, not being able to find what degree I would need for it *(EX: TV Show/Cartoon Director)*, or realizing that I likely wouldn't be able to survive with however little I would make *(EX: Indie Game Dev or Artist)*.

I've  always had an extreme interest in character design and character  writing (Such as character arcs, what a design was based off of, and a  character's dynamic compared to the rest of the cast).

I've  also always loved the more creative side of marketing (like directing  successful ad campaigns, being able to see what people like and make  accordingly, ect), though I've always been worried that I might get  stuck with a job that might stifle my creativity, or get a degree in  something I would never want do after the first few times of trying.

I  don't want to be forced to go for a dead-end desk job where I hate everything I do, or to be stuck paying student loans with a job that sucks the very soul out of what I try to do.

If you already had an idea of what carrier you were going to pursue before you got it and remember how you decided whatever degree was for you (Like via a website or if there's a certain strategy to decide?), please comment! I need help figuring out how to find what I'd want to do with my life. I still have a few more years until I actually have to worry about it, I just have a problem with being anxious when I haven't planned things out. It makes me feel more organized than I actually am.

**TL;DR** \- *I  don't know what to do with my life and I'm worried I'll be stuck working at a McDonalds or something else where I wouldn't actually be passionate. What can I do to figure out what carrier I might like or what degree I should pursue?*",01Jun2020,2
871,This past school year as been the worst I have ever done. It’s my sophomore year in college and it’s has been the absolute worst. At the start first semester my girlfriend broke up with me and that only made my minor depression worst so I had no motivation to do any school work at all. I had to drop the semester because I felt behind. The spring semester was doing well until the coronavirus. The transition from face to face to online only sucked. My grades dropped because of it and in one of my classes it was so confusing on how we were continuing online I fell behind in that class and got dropped. The semester ended and I got ok marks with the exception of that class. I registered for a summer class and a few fall ones. Half way through my summer class I got a letter saying I got put on academic probation and I can’t take summer classes. I’m already half way through doing amazing and I already paid for it. Idk if I can get my money back but I sent in an appeal a couple of days ago. But no response and now I’m starting to question if I sent it to the right email. The problem I have now is should/how I should talk to my parents about it. They have helped me financially and would be extremely mad at me.

The problem is, I might say something and nobody will respond, or if they do they clearly do not care. Therefore, per usual, I feel annoying.

I realized that other times when someone else texts they might not get a response either.

After I found out, I messaged his gf and asked her questions about his behavior and what's he been doing. She said that hes been taking xanax for a while, it went from bits to now 2 wholes; also said, ""he knew what he can handle"", so he takes more. She tried to tell him it's not right, but as teenagers I know they dont know any better. I know that is a ridiculous amount and shouldnt be taking them in the first place. Also, found out he has multiple ""plugs""
Apparently he has been taking them since he best friend passed away a year ago, while I was away in University. I wasnt home for the past 5 years so I didnt know what was going on back home. 
Today, his mom told him that she took them away (just the weed, doesnt know where the other drugs are). He is now aggravated and uses foul invectives.

876,"Hey Reddit, new user here looking for a sanity-check/other perspectives. TLDR at the bottom.

Not quite sure how best to word this question, but basically, I'm wondering how do other folks here deal with and/or talk about personal struggles (regarding mental health or general life problems) when you generally have a good life and there doesn't appear to be anything to be upset about?

For context, I'm a first-generation Chinese-American (26F) and have had a pretty privileged, ""easy"", life. My parents were middle class and took good care of me. I'm debt-free, college educated, financially stable, and am currently privileged enough to still be employed and working from home. I didn't have any physical or mental health issues as a child and am probably still fine today. 

Whenever I listen to my friends talk about their personal struggles, whether its regarding mental health or day-to-day troubles or family drama, I can't help but feel like my personal ""problems"" are petty and I just  shouldn't be feeling bad/sad about anything. Or like, my problems aren't real problems, just petty complaints, and there's no room to bring them up when other people are talking about their very real and serious struggles with mental health/family/finances. I think, ""What do I have to be sad about when my life is technically fine?"" ""My needs are met--what more could I possibly ask for?""

While I understand that you don't have to have had a ""hard life"" to have mental health issues or feel down, and that everyone is gonna have negative feelings at some point regardless of what type of life they've had, I feel like an asshole for thinking things like ""I'm stuck in a rut and feel like my life has stagnated to a stop"" when I'm already in a more comfortable position than a lot of other people. I want to acknowledge and be grateful for what I have, and I certainly don't wish misfortune upon myself, but I also want to express when I'm feeling down about where I'm at. I don't want to keep shutting up and shoving down those feelings forever, but I feel like I'd literally be an asshole if I talked about feeling down/stressed for apparently no good reason when my friends are talking about feeling stressed over family drama/financial distress/anxiety. 

So I guess I could use a reality check? Do I just need to get over myself? Has anyone with a similar background felt this way before?

Even my mum said to me earlier today that I’m abit socially awkward (not maliciously), so I’m really trying to work on it as I’m 23 and looking to get into the London job market which will require a good amount of social skills. 

I wouldn’t say I’m that socially awkward but others seem to think so. I feel like I’m just very contempt with my own company but I guess that’s not socially acceptable in society, especially in the working environment. So I’m just wondering if there is anything I could maybe do to work on these skills that you may know? Any advice for building a strong social skill set?",01Jun2020,1

So today accidentally spilled a large amount of hand sanitizer on my penis. It soaked right through my shorts and realised it was burning the pit of my penis and couldn't wash it off for 30 mins.

Is this really bad? Or will it just cause irritation for a while? It still burns

I get kinda stressed out about erectile dysfunction.

I guess not but could it somehow cause this? Am a bit anxious

885,"I was in my tenth grade woodshop class. I was like the only brown kid in a mostly white class. We were all learning how to do operate one of the machines and I was having trouble. I speak English perfectly fine, I'm just a bit awkward. While he was teaching me how to work the machine, he grew very frustrated at me and started yelling ""What's wrong with you!"" ""How come everyone else can do it?"" at me. Then he yelled, ""*do I need to speak another language for you to understand?*"". Whenever the other kids were having trouble he wouldn't say anything like that at all. It felt a lot like it was directed at me specifically. This guy is completely rude and openly mocked the gender neutral bathroom. He also calls the overweight black girl ""Big Momma"", is that a bit offensive as well?

I'm a 15 french girl, and, with the advice of my GF I told my mom about what happen in my dad's house after an other fight with my dad. My dad use to beat us everytime we make a small mistake, like shock us or kicking us in the belly. My mother and my dad are divorced, so my mother ask me if I wanted to live with her and ask for my childcare so I wouldn't go again at my dad's house. 

The problem is that I have two (younger) siblings with my dad. I don't want to leave them alone because I always try to protect my siblings of him.

My GF then propose me to file a complaint against my dad so he will lose the childcare of my siblings.

Exept I don't know if this will work, if he will really lose the childcare of me and my siblings (because I don't want to imagine what he will do to us if we tell the police about it), and..I don't really want to do that because..he's my dad.

I told them I would like to adopt him, and keep him permanently as he grew so attached to my other cat and I. She told me multiple times “the original owner hasn’t been in contact since she brought him here, she has a deadline that’s coming up so he will be yours” she told me this for 4 months. 
Today she called me and told me she’s going to pick him up because the original owner wants him back. She said I could not have him, although I asked her about the deadline. She said there was no deadline all the sudden. She kept talking herself in circles. 
She said he was her emotional support pet, we asked to see the paperwork to prove he was and she said “well, he isn’t a legal emotional support pet..”

My brother and father are racist. They claim they are not racist, just ‘stating facts’, but they judge entire groups by the colour of their skin. Blaming everything on people of colour, thinking of them as less. They don’t speak of them as people equal at birth. It is horrible, disgusting, backward. They are obtuse, arrogant, and ignorant to the way in which it is socially acceptable to conduct ourselves.

When I tell my father off, and say this is not appropriate or acceptable in any way, he listens and takes in it — before he forgets and goes on as usual

My brother however is harder. He has anger issues, he can’t take not being right. Anything I ever say against him is met with rage and tantrums like a 5 year old (he is 30). It’s impossible to tell him he is wrong without causing a huge fall out.

I do not want to lose touch with family, but I cannot listen to them say racist things, even in jest. If I say something they get angry and we fall out, if I say nothing I am part of the problem.

Then today I did the same thing although I didn't wake up till 830 and I only got up because my phone rang. As you can get is was my boss and he asked where I was. I told him I was sorry and I was on my way, which at that point i was as I had already gotten dressed and was headed tonmy car.

I was born in a city in the south, but for anon sake let’s say Atlanta, and been claiming that I’m from panama (im not, i was born in Atlanta but I have Panamanian ancestry) and been putting up this facade that I’m from there for like 4 years. I did this because I am very insecure about my ancestry as my dad is a mutt (not knowing who his non black father was) and my mom is American born Caribbean-black and native, again her not knowing about her side, so it just caused me to create a story in my head, to belong to a group and to be cool.
I also ‘had’ a small accent for a while but it just because so overwhelming to lie so I stopped. I thought people would think I was cool doing that. I speak French and English well and I shouldn’t be pulling off an accent for brownie points.
I’ve done a lot of self growth lately and I realized that lying is lame. lying isn’t cool and i wouldn’t want to pull a lie like this again. I want to come clean. Especially after being with my bf for so so long I can’t continue this. I love him too much to lie.
I lied because I thought it was cool to belong as I felt lost. Im okay with claiming my black side but my family doesn’t know anything about their tree so I agreed to take an ancestry test so I can lay this situation to rest.

I am looking for some advice on when to know it is the right time to euthanize a family dog. 

Background: my dog is a 13 y/o Shepard mix. Within the last year his health has declined. He is spending the majority of his day sleeping, is blind, partially deaf, has fairly bad arthritis that makes it difficult for him to get up from his bed or comfortably move at a fast pace; but, has a strong appetite, still going to the bathroom regularly (wears diapers just in case there is an accident), and will occasionally get a burst of energy that lets him run around the yard. 

He is given homemade food ( brown rice, ground meat, veggies, egg) 3X a day, CBD oil  and joint supplements twice a day. 

He doesn’t seem to be suffering, and I realize it is inevitable that I will need to intervene, but I don’t know when the right time to intervene is.

i wouldn’t classify my mom as mentally or verbally abusive but she has called me things and berated me many times in my life, but will switch from that to being very caring and giving. i know she loves me but this has severely impacted my mental health. before i went to college i suffered from depression and anxiety my whole life (i still do, it is just “triggered” more when i’m in the same home environment i grew up in). middle school got really bad, and i self harmed and finally got to see a therapist who diagnosed me with my depression and anxiety. my mom would scream and i’d go in my room and cry and think of killing myself CONSTANTLY. not a day went by from my very young life until i moved into college where i didn’t want to very literally, kill myself. i appreciate all my parents do and i help out as much as i can around the house and to run errands and help take care of my younger siblings. i even work but due to the pandemic i have not been able to work. 

i just feel lost because moving out is not a possibility at all and i’m sure my mom would be heartbroken and tell me how the rest of the family will talk about us (because we are very close with our extended family but if something like me moving out happened it would cause a stir). i tried to convince her to let me live in an off campus apartment or house because it’s cheaper and also i could move in early and not really have to live home (also it’s be easier for me to work bc i’d be able to walk to a job since i won’t have a car), but she insisted i stay living on campus. 

my dad is not like my mom at all and i only have 2 years of college left and i’ll probably be going out of state (or even abroad) for a masters and to work. i’m just not sure if i can mentally take it for two more years, especially since who knows what will happen for next semester bc of the pandemic, i might be stuck home for the entire semester. i have money in my savings but it’s not nearly enough to cover living costs for enough time especially since i can’t work right now and i will have no time to work once the semester starts due to my course load and work for credit. i guess i should just stick it out but seriously, any advice is appreciated because i’m stuck.",01Jun2020,1
923,"So I’ve had this “best friend” for the past 17 years of my life. Bit of back story is she bullied me in high school, stole boyfriends off me and got people to hate me behind my back ( I guess you could say I had some sort of Stockholm syndrome making me stick around). 

Either way we stayed really close, sharing many emotional experiences as we grew up. She’s a twin and a compulsive liar, her twin would often call her out on her lies causing her to lash out... she would always result to physical violence because I guess she knew she couldn’t back out of the corner? 

I digress last year a man that had been a close member of my family as my BIL for nearly 12 years committed suicide my whole family shook, I couldn’t move, talk and definitely couldn’t go to work for a while. I told “ex bestie” what had happened how we were feeling (I’ve suffered massively with mental health issues myself spending most of my teenage and adult life on meds/in therapy) anyway yeah she made absolutely ZERO effort to visit myself or my family or make any contact to see how we were coping... 

I drew a line in the sand and thought “fuck it I need real friends that will support us” being so close for so long she knew ALL my family and was close with them too bye and basically I cut my losses and left it at that. Fast forward a little she was due to be my bridesmaid in a couple months and she’s basically telling me she can’t make it because she’s promised to help celebrate her new druggy boyfriends daughters birthday (a week early might I add) on my exact wedding date... 

I don’t even know what to say to her?! I’m hurt and shocked except I’m not if that makes sense... I don’t know my next move, I know I’ve rambled cos I’m angry but I can elaborate if anyone can help me make sense of my thoughts 😕",01Jun2020,2
924,"I'll try to keep this short while adding all the information I can. As of yesterday morning, my dad was fired from his position as a security guard at a local prison. The reason(s) stated was ""undependable.""

To get the entire story, I'll have to go back about a month and a half. I had contracted Corvid-19 and had medical documentation stating this. Which he showed to his bosses, and took a 2-week leave for his, and his co-workers' safety. However, during this 2-week window, he had an accident and injured his back. This was also documented by medical professionals. Because of this, he was forced to take more time off work. Now, fast forward to Friday, May 29th, and his check never came through. Which was a massive hit to our family. His income is my family's only source of income. And with the whole lockdown, and pandemic going on, our savings are wearing thin. So, this incident was incredibly detrimental to our family. Even today, he has yet to receive his check.

That brings us to today, he had been officially terminated, and we're seeking an attorney to pursue the possibility of taking his employers to court for damages and wrongful termination. All of his time off was warranted by medical professionals. So, does my father have a case here? What should our next steps be?",01Jun2020,0
925,Hi so my ex bf (16M) broke up with me (18F) (we were dating before I turned 18) a couple of months ago. We have been talking about getting back together but he recently told me something that just made me lose trust in him. He said that while we were dating he talked to a girl online for one day. Now he did not specify how he talked to her or whatever but he did say he felt disgusted afterwards and had to break up with me. It makes me feel really angry. I was all for him and he did that to me? I’m not sure if I’m overreacting either because it’s not like he kissed the girl or had sex with her. He has BPD and depression. He feels extremely sorry for what he’s done but I told him that he’d need to show me that I can trust him again if we were to get back together. I still really like him but should I even get back together with him? I can’t even tell me friends what he did they’d basically tell me to cut him off. But he has issues with his self esteem and says he has no self control. any advice :( I wanna help him through these issues since he’s always been there for me when I went through shit.,01Jun2020,2

He’s lived with my since he was born and I’ve take care of him most of his life. I feel a lot of guilt in doing this. My mom told me that if it’s not meant for me, then I can come back home. I think I’m going to give it til the end of the year to see if this is meant for me. I plan to go home in a few weeks to bring my dogs to my new location. I just want to be reassured that everything will be alright. My nephew looked for me when he got home from school and I got teary eyed. I originally told myself that I’m going to give it a year to decide where I want to live before my nephew starts kindergarten. Now I’m more so leaning towards back to what I know. We shall see.

The biggest problem for me isn't the nicotine addiction per se(I think) but the action of smoking( having something in my hand, rolling a cigarette, especially when I have to wait for something). I tried it with chewing gums, going for a jog on a regular basis, mobile games for the waiting time. Do you know anything what would could help me?

931,"Don’t want to turn this into a text wall, but currently I am a 20 year old male living nearby Atlanta. I have been working for the last 3 years and just got a job stable enough to not count every single penny. I am miserable working in sales.

My ultimate goal is to finish college, I have about a year of credits, but I am 3 years out and my gpa was not amazing (2.75 or so). This was largely due to my parents leaving me to my own devices and then moving, leaving the house and my sister in my care.

932,"I (22F) told him(23M) just three or so days before my birthday that it was coming up. He didn’t remember the date even after being friends for two years but remembered the birthday of another friend of ours who neither of us are particularly close to. But that was okay and I laughed it off. 

But he forgot my birthday on the day itself and didn’t wish me. I forgave him. I actually told him he forgot and wasn’t even really mad. He had work and sometimes things slip through the cracks. He said sorry and wished me a happy birthday and that was that.

But now the other friend’s birthday came up and he remembered, wished her at 12 and actually made a nice drawing for her. And I just feel hurt I guess. We’ve been slightly distant lately (we used to speak for like half hour a day on average but now it’s like 5 minutes a day and we’re still close but just don’t feel that close) and this just kind of hurt me a little unexpectedly and I’m not sure if I should tell it to him or not. I’m not upset he made something for her. That was sweet. I’m just hurt that he not only forgot my birthday but didn’t even try and make up for it by doing something like this when he could do it for another friend who he’s not even particularly close with. 

How should I bring it up to him? Or should I not tell him at all? Try to get over it? It is in the past in a way but I really didn’t think about it at all until he did something for another friend. It’s not jealousy what I’m feeling per se but something like being taken for granted maybe? Am I just overreacting? Being petty?

TL;DR: My best friend forgot my birthday and then remembered another friend’s and made something for her and this hurt me because he didn’t do anything like that to even make up for forgetting- just said sorry and wished me the happy birthday.

936,"Hi reddit! 

Earlier this year, my mom passed away from cancer. It’s about to be 6 months since she passed and my fiance and I have noticed my dad talking to someone all day till the wee hours of the night. He started being a bit secretive with his phone too. He assured us months ago that he will never enter a relationship ever again, and that it shouldn’t be one of worries. But about a week ago, I noticed one facebook profile that belongs to a woman my mom knew when she was still alive. She constantly comments on my dad’s posts and pictures, flirting and what not. (my dad was smart enough to not reply maybe to avoid raising suspicion) 

Now, my dad started spending nights over his “friend’s” house to play chess AMIDST THE PANDEMIC. His phone is constantly shut off whenever he’s there. He texts me with a different phone number and I noticed that the texts’ format were the same as how the woman typed her comments on my dad’s facebook. This made me extremely uneasy, as I cannot bear to think of my dad having a relationship with someone else. I know that my dad is old enough and knows what he’s doing, but it hurts to kind of think that he’s replacing my mom that quick. I also understand that my dad has the right to be happy and be with anyone he wants, but this bothers me to a certain degree. 

What should I do? Should I ask him about it or should I just turn my back and let him do whatever he wants?",01Jun2020,1

938,"A girl that I've never met has been following me on Instagram for a while. She always sends compliments and positive messages. Sometimes my responses are pretty delayed because I've been going through a rough time. Last week, I let her know that and apologized. She started asking if I would call her to talk about it. I did and we had a really nice talk for maybe an hour. All week, she has messaged me every day. Sometimes she messages me to say something positive and sometimes she messages me because she wants to call and vent about her family. Some days I barely get out of bed and don't want to live at all. I was actually having one of my best days in a long time when she first called me to vent. I was in a good mental place, spent time outside/reading, making meals for myself. I immediately felt dragged back into crisis-worry mode. The second time she did it (two days later) I started to worry that it would always be like this. I don't want to be a selfish person. Maybe I'm just not in a place to have friends. Is it wrong to tell someone that I don't have it in me to be a friend or emotional support after they tried to be an emotional support for me?

939,"I'm 15M and I live in the uk, I know it might be helpful but I don't want to say which part. I feel like the people that live here are so ignorant and judgemental and it's really starting to get to me. This is really long by the way, I'm sorry if it bores you.

My family is racist but they don't think they are. When I go on walks my dad tells me to watch out for ""brown people speeding down the roads at night"". I understand that that happens but other people do that too. Last week I was coming home and a car full of white people sped at me and got out to shout at me (they were probably on something). They'll call them slurs and blame them for problems every race causes. It makes me extremely uncomfortable. I can't say anything because they don't realise how racist they are and they'll deny it or compare it to other countries. Our police are seen as nice people because they don't murder people of colour for no reason, but racism still happens. They just don't want to realise what these people go through and that what they say or do might not be as bad but it'll still hurt people.

It's pride today. I went online and saw posts from people from my school saying ""fuck pride"" and ""ignorant queers"" and now I'm crying. All this pride fall too. I'm proud of everyone, being a person of colour or a part of the lgbt(or both of course), must be very hard and I just want to make sure they're okay. I always hear about transgender people getting abused and murdered and feeling too unsafe to go to the bathroom for the gender they identify as. There's a kid that used to go to my school who I think is an adult now, he graduated but whilst he went to our school he got beat up for being gay. I've spoken to him before and he's so nice and sweet, I want to be friends with him. Once I was out meeting a friend and I saw (obviously I shouldn't assume) a trans woman, or a man wearing a dress maybe because he likes wearing them. I don't know their pronouns but I wanted to compliment on their dress but they looked upset and walked away. 

A lot of my friends, girls and boys and nonbinary, go through so much. So have I. I was surprised to live up to 15. I had to make myself better. Therapy and mental health systems here are horrible and don't treat anything seriously. I feel like people who are struggling for any of the reasons i've named already or just personal struggles can't get proper help because it's not like that here most of the time.

Also, no one seems to care about the riots going on in america because ""it doesn't happen here""??? Or white people saying that its not their problem. I've payed most of my attention to that shit and I'm planning on donating if I can. It makes me so sad but no one else seems to care about it. 

I know these things happen everywhere and I feel like I can't escape it. I feel selfish for talking about how it hurts me like this because it's not me going through those things. I don't know how to help anyone. I'm only 15 and it feels like there's nothing I can do because no one talks about it here. I really just want everyone to be nice to each other but they won't and I can't change that and it's breaking me down. I feel like I'm losing hope in everywhere and everyone, everywhere is so negative. How can I help these people? Is there anything I can do at all that might make any difference? Anything I can attend? Or especially right now, is there any way I can help with the movement in america? This is obviously a really big question but I feel like there's no where else to ask.

940,"I (18F) work at a restaurant and got laid off in March as did every other employee at my place. 

At the beginning of May my manager (56F)  hired back every single employee to help with carry out orders. Except me. I know exactly why she did too, it’s because she hates me and we never had a good relationship when I was at work. She constantly singled me out over others, yelled at me for no reason, tried to get me to quit one night, and threatened to fire me for doing literally nothing wrong. 

Me being unemployed is a very big issue right now. I am not allowed to be home alone (long story) so my parents have had to take off work just so I’m not alone. Working would solve this. I also have to pay for college classes and currently do not have enough and will have to drop out if I don’t start getting income. 

I’ve spent the past month looking for other jobs and have had some interviews but 0 luck.  Either I don’t pass the interview or I’m not qualified enough for the position to even apply. 

So, right now my life literally depends on getting this job back. I have texted her a few times and explained very professionally that I have changed, will do anything she needs me to do, and be a respectful employee. I even explained the needing to pay for college thing to her. But nothing. All she says is “Ill keep you updated” or no response at all. I even said that working just 1 day aka 4 hours a week would help. She won’t change her mind about me. 

So all in all, I’ve tried numerous attempts at getting a new job and have come up empty, and need this job back more than ever because even my family is starting to get mad at me for not going back to work but I don’t know what to do. How can I convince her that I am a worthy employee and need to work a little bit to literally save my life.?

I've had D three years and he's never really liked me but over the last year, it's just gotten worse. He used to let me handle him a bit and would sit on my hand for a while but now he bites me anytime I go near him, no matter how carefully I approach. I've tried just sitting by the cage with him but he just peaks at the bars of the cage screaming at me until I move away. I don't think it's driven by fear as he doesn't try and move away from me, he just goes right into attack mode. 

Honey I've only had five months, I thought D's aggression might have been from being lonely so I got H to try and fix that. It did not fix it, they get along pretty well but he's still just getting more aggressive. He seems happy when I'm leaving them alone, they chat and sing but whenever I go near them, they just stop.

I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong but it's clearly something and I just feel so disheartened about it and guilty. I feel bad even thinking about rehoming them, I don't want to ""give up on them"" but I can't help thinking they'll do better with someone who clearly can take care of birds better than me

I don't know if rehoming them would be the best idea though. While there's a chance they'll go to someone much better for them, there's also a chance they'll go to a worse home. At least here, while I'm clearly not doing the taming and socialising part right, they do have clean water and food and a large cage to call home, they're safe. I'm worried if I rehome them, they might lose that. Is it better to keep them so they'll at least be safe even if they're not very happy or try and find them a better home?

942,"Basically I'm a 22 year old who is experiencing separation anxiety before the separation has even occurred. I had a very strong attachment to my dad when I was a child, it was just me and him from day one and we spent every moment together. I was even homeschooled until 4th grade, so we never really spent a second apart except for the court-ordered week per year I'd spend with my deadbeat abusive mother and step father.

This resulted in me going through the stress that most people experience when they're toddlers, only I was 8, so the attachment was only that much stronger and ingrained in me. After a couple of years of intensive therapy and him going on his long work trips without me, I was able to become quite independent. Then to put a long story short, I was nearly killed by my stepfather, which undid all that therapy. 

I was sleeping in my dad's bed again, I couldn't even stand to be in a different room to him. He was always my confidant and safe place, we never really had a physical home until I started going to real school because we traveled so much for his job, so he was the only constant in my life. I didn’t even have friends until junior high, it was just him.

More years of more therapy and I managed to become independent again. I graduated high school when I was 16, moved out, but I ended up working with my dad. I still work with him, it's great, we're more like best friends now, I love him to pieces, but no separation anxiety...until now.

My dad and I live in separate states when we're not working together, I was staying with him so we could get some work done when lockdown started. So what was supposed to be a week has now turned into almost 3 months. Now that we're finally seeing the light at the end of the quarantine tunnel, I'm getting more and more nervous to leave.

My problem now is that I love that college, it was super close to my house (15 mins) and specialized in what I want to study (biology, I want to be a vet and they have an excellent pre-vet program). I spent the last two semesters (about a year) getting my shit together and working on my mental health. I would love if there was anyway I could go back, so are there any steps I can take to get back in now that I've straightened up my act? 'm not opposed to applying to a different college, but this was my top choice and, again, I would really love to go there again. The atmosphere was great and I really felt like the teachers cared about my grades for the first time in my life. I've read about contacting my old advisor, but is it weird to contact her after a whole year has passed with no word from me? She probably wouldn't even know who I am anymore. I also worry that because I failed out, I wouldn't be able to get into another decent college. Any advice is appreciated, but preferably advice about getting back into my original college",01Jun2020,1

Since day one I’ve seen horrendous behavior from the rest of staff that had gone unchanged. Because of the nature of the job management needs employees and is more focused on getting the job done than creating a healthy work environment. I’m slowly at the end of my rope dealing with my coworkers and dread going in some days.

I have a potential new job lined up but the hourly rate is lower. A bulk of my income would be commission work and I could potentially earn 1.2k more a month than I do now. I’d be a low level grunt with no say so in the company.

956,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub, as you can tell from my karma I’m more of a lurker, also, mobile


Context: 20F, was sexually assaulted by a friend with benefits October 2018 (wasn’t fully rape, but had hand stuff done despite my saying no, and that I wasn’t in the mood. His defence was that he was trying to get me in the mood).


When I say sober, I mean without alcohol. I haven’t really had sober sex since realising what had happened (it dawned on me March/April 2019 randomly, I like to think that my mind was kind of shielding me from it), and I’m not sure if it stems from that, or if it’s because it’s been a while since it’s happened (likely the former, even when I was with an ex during that time, I always put off sex, wasn’t sure if that was because the spark wasn’t there anymore, but it just never happened when sober, happened when drunk however).

I’ve been talking to a new guy (talking about a month, gone on two social distancing dates and only kissed once), and when messages get kinda heated, I feel nervous, or in some way uncomfortable. I reciprocate any heated messages, but there is part of me that still feels kind of, off. It’s not like I don’t like those kind of messages or the tease of it, it’s more just the thought of it happening sometimes scares me.

So, I don’t know what to do. I know I more than likely need therapy for it, and to talk to someone about it, but should I mention it? It seems like so much of a heavy conversation and I don’t want to scare him off because of this, and it’s not like I don’t want to (trust me, if things were normal and I was drunk (drunk enough to give consent, but still a bit out of it to like distinguish the fear) we probably would have by now) it just seems, somewhat frightening. 

I mean, it’s something I know I’ll likely mention at some point, because I’m okay enough to say it’s a thing that has happened (and it seems so silly because it wasn’t even really rape), but I just don’t know what to do. 
I guess I’m also scared that he’s only talking to me because of the thought of sex, but I’ve had those fears with other guys and they’ve not been true (I know that sounds rather sexist on my behalf, and it really is the more I think of it, and it shows I need my ego taking town a peg).

I don’t really know what the purpose of this is, I suppose: reddit, if you were in my position, what would you do? I don’t want to scare him off because I actually feel something for him, and I hardly ever feel something for anyone, but at the same time, if it’s got any future, I have to talk about it at some point, right? But I don’t want to talk about it yet because it seems so heavy for something so new

957,"Hello there anon, thanks for taking the time out of your day to read this.

As the title says, my parents are kicking me (Male, 16) out of their house. First, here’s some backstory:

I lost my mother when I was nine years old, and in 2017, my father re-married. Living up tot the stereotype, i never got along with my step-mother, and i was shipped away to boarding school. Some of the things that they have done to me are beyond illegal, but at this point i just want to get away from them instead of calling police, etc.

I don’t really want to go further into it, but lets say that its partially their fault and partially my fault. It has gotten to the point that when school breaks up I stay in a hotel instead of going home.

I live in the United Kingdom, so technically im an adult. My father is trying to put me in a situation that basically forces me to go into the armed forces. I believe this because my grandfather was a soldier in the SAS, but my grandmother wouldn’t let my father enlist due to the ongoing falklands war When he was my age. I am looking for apprenticeships (paid internships), but most of them are in cities like London and Manchester, which my father says is too far away. Another risk in this is that the pay for these jobs suck. some places want 40 hour work weeks in return for £10000 per year. 

So i guess in summary, should i leave my family behind if i get offered a job in the city?",01Jun2020,1
958,"Yesterday we were having kind of a small dinner party for us 4 at my place. I [20M] got ready first and while she [19F] was doing her makeup, I was in the kitchen cooking. When I needed help I called her over. She came in a tank top and seemingly fully ready except for her hair from the waist up, but from the waist down she was bottomless. At that point it didn't really turn me on because I'm used to her naked and I was busy and distracted with cooking.

A bit later our friend [18F] texted my girlfriend saying that she's there. Because I had my hands dirty and we were expecting our friends to arrive separately, my girlfriend asked me if I'd mind her opening the door like she was. I was hesitant since the friend had never seen my girlfriend naked before, but I didn't want to make her wait outside in the rain so I just said okay.

After she opened the door I heard not only the voice of the friend we expected at this point, but also our male friend [19M] who turned out to tag along in the same car. There was laughter and lots of ""awkward""s. I quickly washed my hands and went to join them. They were standing there, chatting and laughing. After I greeted our friends, my girlfriend excused herself to go finish getting ready.

To my surprise I was really turned on by the whole situation, especially when she went upstairs and all 3 of us kinda gazed until she was completely out of sight. Then, and a couple of other times during the night, I had to sneakily cover my erection caused by this.

Is my reaction to this wrong? Should I talk to her about it or just act normal and never bring it up?

However in order to save money I asked my father for some of his old clothes, so I wouldn't have to ruin my regular clothes while at work, and the more clothes I have the less I need to buy, because I need to replace a number after a late growth spurt.

However my sister thinks because I get some then she is entitled to some of our dad's old clothes of which she already got some just not as much as me, so she just steals it as she does the laundry. Which the major issue is my own bad memory so I just can't remember if it was mine but she stole it, or if she actually got it from my dad. It's not like it is only the old clothes she is stealing, but the majority of what she takes is his old stuff.

While I do have a bad memory, it's not like I am just suspecting her of stealing, but today she admitted it while trying to trade for a jacket that my dad gave me. I called her out before for wearing something that's mine, but I couldn't prove it.

I'm not an addict to either of those things, but until the lockdown forced us all to be inside, I was getting high every weekend pretty much. 
Its turned me into a person I dont like, and I am still struggling with how to like myself again. Just sleeping around and wasting a lot of my time and money. 
I want to give it up for good, I had gotten to a point where I didnt even enjoy partying with my friends (except the social aspect) because the hangovers I get are disgusting. I will throw up constantly for at least 24hours the day after drinking, I cant even keep water down not matter what I do. 
So I hate poisoning myself and want to stop, for good. I want to like myself again. My friends have the same habit as me but enjoy it and dont think I can do this. 
So anyone who has gone sober, whether permanently or just for a period of time, how did you make those first steps and not cave to peer pressure when back in a situation where having a line or a few drinks in a club would be as easy anything?

969,"When a man marries a non virgin woman?
My fiancé initially had a problem with my past (2 before him) I had an extremely traumatic first time during my mid twenties- he doesn’t know what happened - but I was originally very strict on planning to wait for marriage so I feel even more guilty that I met my fiancé only a year and a half later. He got over my past - so he says and has never brought it up since - but I can’t help feeling like he’s settling for me and would rather a virgin. 


I have been obsessing over virginity being a prize to a man and I was reading stuff on YouTube... 
If her history did bother him, she had slept with a couple other me, but still marries her? Is she safe, or will he treat her as ‘ less than ‘ this makes me so sad as had I waited a tad bit longer for him he’d love me more. 

I read a comment on a YouTube that  that said ‘ even if a man marries a non virgin he will not give her his absolute best like he would have done if she were a virgin ‘ and it got me wondering..  but then.. why marry her?

And there’s a whole bunch of other guys under this video talking about how virginity is the prize and they would rather a virgin etc etc. 
It’s sorta making me feel like I should let my fiancé go be with a virgin as it’s what men want deep down. 

We’re just about to purchase a house together and have one last bit to sign but I feel like before I do that I’d like to ask him if he wants to be with a virgin deep down he should go for it. I just don’t want to be treated less than and all these men all over YouTube seem to see women who aren’t virgins as less valuable, so what’s the point. I rather be alone. My past already makes me feel awful. It genuinely makes me want to just disappear. I put so much effort into waiting and I ended up losing it into the worst possible person instead of my amazing fiancé.

Some time ago, I ended up fostering my sister's cat for a few months. Now, this cat was old, it was her first cat, she will do anything for him. She also had a second cat, much younger, but that cat had some health issues and she was unable to care for that one the way he needed.

I offered to take him in as well, *many* times, because I know they'd been together for years. She said she'd think about it, but eventually came to the extremely difficult decision to surrender the younger cat to a rescue. It was not an easy decision for me to live with, but I support my sister's choice. The younger cat needed a better home and better care that she just could not provide. 

During that time, I confided in my bestie (because besties, obvy) about the situation. 

I was unprepared for the lecture I recieved.

It hurt. A lot.

I gave up trying to convince my bestie that I had done what I could, that it was ultimately my sister's decision. I recieved another lecture.

After that, I tried to rekindle our friendship, but my bestie would bring the conversation back to the damn cat. I was also trying to get out of a toxic work environment and I thought she'd be supportive of my decision to leave, because of my deteriorating mental health,  but I got another lecture about how negative I was, and that until I was in a better place to talk, to basically stay away.

I have been NC with my bestie until recently and even just texting is painful and bringing up feelings. Im literally crying as im typing this. She asked that we talk about where we are, and what we could do. 

I don't know that I can continue a relationship with this person, having been as close as we were.

I've since left the toxic work environment, so my mental health is better, but I don't know how to handle the steps to get back to where we were.  I freely admit I wasn't always the best friend/person I could be, but I tried, especially at my lowest.

973,"I am a grown-ass woman who visits another state once a year for Christmas. My grandma lives there and since her place is too small for all the relatives to stay at, I usually stay at my great uncle's place down the road. 

I never knew him well before a few years ago, but we bonded over a shared love of travel. I recently became unemployed due to the pandemic and he seems to have gotten this idea into his head that I would move into his place to drive him and clean for money. He's old and unhealthy so he can't do it himself but apparently doesn't trust hired aides not to steal from him. 

He has been calling me a few times a month trying to convince me to move to his place, and I keep telling him that I don't feel safe traveling yet due to the pandemic. He sent me $600 in cash unprompted and said it was for travel expenses even though I hadn't agreed to move and was just thinking about it.

Yesterday he called me and said some very uncomfortable things. He has mentioned watching porn a few times, and the first time or two I brushed it off as him just not having a filter. But this time was different. 

He said he would take me to the porn shop and buy me some nice underwear. He mentioned needing new porn and that he needs it because he doesn't have a wife and it's good for his prostate. He said he would show me classic porno.

I didn't do anything to make him think I would be interested in any of that. He told me not to ""rat him out"" so he must know he crossed a line. He doesn't have dementia so that's not an excuse. 

So my questions are:

1- how creepy is this? Is he a predator?

2- do I return his money when I start working again?

3- how do I get him to stop asking me to move there? What do I tell my family when I no longer want to stay there at Christmas if I even go at all? They all love him and probably have no idea.",01Jun2020,1

Is it right to be happy while the people around you are suffering? Is my empathy overreacting?

I tell myself my time will come, and that I can work hard at doing what I'm good at to help people, but I feel I should be taking a more active approach. 

My lifestyle feels so self-indulgent. I have a two bedroom apartment and a cat all to myself and I can eat almost whatever I want. Granted I don't wear diamond rings and it's not all flowers and unicorns, but I still feel guilty for enjoying myself. 

I read that happiness is genuine if you do what you want to, no matter if people are watching or not, but I still feel like I'm somehow fooling myself. 

I could be one of the happiest people in the world but I just won't let myself for whatever reason. I had the absolute time of my life for about six months, everything was going right, not too high or too low, figured everything out, etc, but then I got guilty thinking about this. I want answers and I won't rest until I have them. Already talked with my therapist about this.

Could it be my duty to be happy? It comes so easily to me when I'm not second-guessing myself like this. I could make lots of other people happy too, but only if it's genuine and without these doubts. How did I do it before these doubts came up and why did they come up to begin with?

This may be unrelated but I have had this dream almost every other night for a year since these thoughts started. In the dream I was slowly going blind except I could still see through my mind's eye and ""sense"" everything around me. To me this symbolizes that there is something huge in my life that I am blind to. I have never had such a repetitive dream before and it bothers me. If I have a dream more than once, it means something and then when I realize what it means, it goes away. But I can't solve this one. Please help.

981,"Some of her points:
1) No protests in history that have been violent have ever worked (said to two people both of whom are gay and one of whom is a woman) 

2) Made the point to at that the protests were bad because shops were destroyed which affects people’s lively hoods ( which is true but protesters have been seen literally grabbing people damaging property and looting and handing them over to the very same police they are protesting against) 

3) Says that because black people have had violent riots before that didn’t work neither will this one 

4) Completely disregards the reason why people are becoming violent. It’s not for shits and giggles. People are done with asking politely because it will not work anymore 

She is the type of person to say they are done with a conversation mid way through and then claim that you are looking to start a fight when you tell them that a conversation isn’t over just because they say it is.

I would greatly appreciate people’s opinions as to why or why not violence is needed in this protest whether on its own or as a response to being victims of violence.",01Jun2020,0

984,"hi folks,

I’m in college (barely surviving) attempting to get a degree. I have 1 more year left, I’m in summer school currently but I haven’t opened my books/online semester since it started 3 weeks ago. I have no more motivation left to learn, I took to many short cuts in my first two years of school which has left me very unprepared for academic writing / evaluating any sort of educational writing. I have a very hard time grasping the content of the things I’m reading because of lack of interest in the subject matter. I have until end of day today to decide if I should drop out and just work and maybe pick up school at a later date. I’m 22 I have a diploma my average the last 3 years of school was 70%. I think I’m capable of doing school just one more year. I just can’t get over the mental hurdle of trying to recalibrate my brain to analyze school material&amp; take care of the loose ends I have with grammar &amp; sentence structure in papers because I’m left feeling like a moron at every sight of red line on word.

988,"Very long post about the contradictory 1st world psychological and familial problems of a lazy irresponsible fatty coming up so anyone who might be unwilling to read such things please move on. So, heres the deal. I’m a single male child and ever since I was young, i’ve always felt like the people around me, my mom and dad, and my mom’s parents (i don’t remember my dad’s parents I was a kid when they passed away) have loved me a lot. Like in a way I haven’t seen in other kids, be it relatives or friends. And I was spoiled, a lot, as in my parents were a middle class to lower middle class family but they still did all they could to provide me with anything I needed and i’ve never had to do any chores in my life to this day. This is what i believe lead to me having no sense of responsibility or work ethic whatsoever (I had fair grades but that was all cuz of the countless tutors my parents would pay to make me pass not really hard work). I did think about it when I was a kid but not too much. 

As my parents were loving, they were also very protective of me. I remember my father frequently telling me how much i meant to him and my mom. It wasn’t a problem when i was a kid but as I grew older and wanted to have more independence it started becoming a nuisance as my mother was too overprotective. I started to smoke cuz my friends did and i thought it was cool, first cigarettes and then marijuana. My mom slowly started to figure it out (my dad was usually out of the country for work) and started to be even more strict, smelling my breath when I came home and the likes. Since I have no work ethic whatsoever instilled into me I’m lazy and fat, so I couldn’t really get a girl which usually teaches men to learn responsibility and make better decisions. So I spent most of my days smoking marijuana and hanging out with the guys. Didn’t do any other drugs or drink much because i wasn’t allowed to stay out at night, which i thought was terribly unfair cuz kids younger than me were drinking and partying (won't do other drugs, prolly never will). 

I didn’t smoke cigarettes much but I did do a lotta weed, cuz it was how i spent my days, high and laughing. My parents started to pester me to get a job (i didn’t) so i could learn responsibility and be a better person, cuz i’m an asshole, and i always used to have massive fights with my mother cuz i felt i lacked freedom. I love her a lot and i truly regret us having a bad relationship over this issue but i still feel strongly about my freedom till today. I was living a normal life (by my standards anyway) and I was happy but I felt like you  reading this are probably feeling right now, that my mom was a bit too overprotective. Then in the 10th grade i got so drunk in my school farewell that I passed out at my grandparents home and they had to call my parents. When i awoke the next morning, my parents were, and let me emphasize this, SHOOK. Even then they grilled me for like a month, then everything was normal. Now recently, another drinking incident occurred, which really pissed my dad off. He then dropped a bomb on me which i was NOT expecting. 

I was actually not a single child and my parents had had twins about 2 years before I was born, and they had died in about a month of being born as they were underdeveloped. This broke my parents heart, especially my moms, though not to take away from my dads pain. This revelation haunts me to this day, and they say they didn’t tell me cuz they didn’t want me to feel bad. A lot of things in my life suddenly made sense to me, including the overprotective nature of my parents and why they decided to treat me like some royal thing, when they should have made me work for what i got and showed me what life is really like. This news was too late however and my relationship with my mother was in ruins, we would talk normally one minute and have a massive tears and rage filled argument the next. 

No longer did I trust my family as the evidence they found of my marijuana use made them more suspicious, and i could see in their actions that they didn’t trust me to make decisions which pushed me farther away from them. I started permanently living at my grandmas place and didn’t talk to my mom for like a couple years. I don’t know what to feel, am i wrong for being lazy and unable to get in shape as i spent my life having to do absolutely 0 hard work? Am I wrong for smoking marijuana? Is it in some weird way my fault that my elder siblings had passed away, only for my grief stricken parents to be left with a useless hunk of lard like me? 

i’m confused and i don’t know whom i want this to be read by, or if i just want to express my grievances in writing for my sake. i just don’t know, if any of you can relate or give me some advice please do as i’m so alone, my parents don’t trust me, i don’t trust my friends enough to tell them this and i don’t know if i’m to blame or not for this, i know these sound like basic 1st world problems but, in my little world which has just me and my little family in it, it’s tearing everyone apart for the contradictions, duality and overall fucked upness of my situation. any help is appreciated. and if you just think its some fatty sharing his problems no one cares about, then don’t leave disparaging comments please. i’m in a very bad place mentally i just want some help and advice. thank you so much to anyone who chose to read through that.",01Jun2020,0

- I have alot of debt ($50,000) credit cards, loans etc, most of them overdue for months. I dont really know how to control it....
- No job right now
- Living at home with mom, in a rented apartment
- Poor relationship with parents
- non existant relationship with siblings (we live together but dont speak to one another, like nothing at all, been like that for 20 years)
- Undernurished (I actully became worked out and became muscular, but that went to hell as soon as corona came)
- poor grades: started going to school again so that I can have better career opportunities in the future
- failed relationships: I cant seem to maintain romantic relationships. They all end up leaving me

I just feel like I have to much to focus on, and it’s killing me slowly day for day. I can’t focus on anything because of the constant stress that surrounds me, that I end up not doing anything at all, digging myself even deeper.

993,"This is my first post ever on reddit, and it isn't an easy one to make. 

About a week ago, I made the biggest mistake of my life (so far). 

I accidentally hurt a toddler, and now everyone in my town hates me.

Without going into much detail, the toddler in question is my ex-girlfriend's child. 

My girlfriend, now ex, broke up with me over this happening, which is understandable. 

I am in no way condoning what I am about to say or trying to justify anything I have done. 

I have sought professional help and am currently being treated for my issues. 

So, the toddler was playing with something he shouldn't have been.
I scolded the toddler and proceeded to take him to timeout, standard procedure. 

However, halfway up the stairs to the toddler's room, he started thrashing and wriggling trying to escape my hold. 
Without thinking, I gripped tighter and subsequently left bruising and marks on the toddler. 

I proceeded to put the toddler in timeout, unknowing that I had caused damage due to lack of reaction from the toddler. 
After timeout, the night proceeds as normal and the toddler goes to bed. 

The next day grandma is coming over. Grandma brings a sprinkler and kitty pool. You can probably see where this is going. 
As grandma and the toddler are about to go outside, grandma says something along the lines of ""Are these bruises? Oh my god""

Queue the beginning of the end. 

Long story short, I left after a huge explosion from grandma and my ex-girlfriend. 

I check myself into a psychiatric hospital and tell them everything that happened.

While I'm in the hospital, my ex-girlfriends psychotic sister who has always hated me finds out about the bruises. 
She proceeds to make a Facebook post consisting of pictures of the bruises and pictures of me, stating I did it etc.
This facebook post currently has 1,113 shares as I type this. 

I now have nowhere to live, my entire town hates me, and I lost my job.
I have $800 and a car. 

What should I do? 

TL;DR: I hurt my ex-girlfriend's kid and now everyone in my town knows about it through a Facebook post with over 1k shares. I lost my home, job, basically my life. I have $800 and a car. What should I do?",01Jun2020,2
994,"So for a bit of background, I come from a very dysfunctional family. I’m currently 23 years old and am the oldest of 4. My father (who was also abusive) left my mother to take care of me and my sister, alone, when I was around 3 years old. A few years later, she met this guy, let’s call him C, and fell in love with him and, within a year, they had my baby sister in 2003, then later my brother in 2006.

C is very abusive and manipulative. From the time I was 5 or 6, up until I moved out when I was 18 to go to college, C has been in and out of prison for multiple charges: rape, abuse of drugs, selling of drugs, and whatever else he had done. But during the times he was home he would hit me and my siblings with objects and brought my mom’s self-esteem down, by gaslighting her. I feel that he never liked me and never tried to get to know me. He never worked, and never tried to be a father, even to his own kids and often would talk to me like I’m stupid. But what kills me most is the fact that my mom has always been in love with him and believes they are soul mates. She doesn’t like the fact that I don’t like him, and believes he is innocent and that everyone is out to get him, even though he is responsible for everything he’s brought upon himself. 

Currently, idk so much about my second oldest sister, but my 2 half siblings dislike him and want nothing to do with him. Due to the constant and continual abuse, I now have the burden of living with depression and anxiety, and am responsible for dealing with it and managing it in a very stressful life, which sucks 😔

I hate that when it comes to C, nothing is his fault. My mom blames the drugs for why he is the way he is, but it’s like, why would you want to be someone who is even abusing drugs, point blank period? But when it comes to me, whatever problems I have are all completely my fault. For example, sometimes I come home from college to visit my family, and if someone happens to steal money out of my purse it’s all my fault because I LeFt My PuRsE oUt, even though I wasn’t aware I can’t trust my family around some of my things. There are other things but this post is getting kinda long. 

Anyway, I don’t know what to do about him most likely coming back into our lives again, literally after history has repeated itself for the past 18-19 years 😒🙄 I don’t see what my mom expects to be different this time around.

997,"I am female/22 and I live in the UK. My step-mum arrived when I was in yr 5 un-announced after my dad supposedly returned from visiting his dad/my grandfather where he lives in another country. They brought tons of gifts, and now I look back it was probably to distract me and my sister from the fact my dad lied about where he went and brought back a random women he was already married to.

My step-mother has always hated me and then somehow turned it against me. When I was a child, for example, one occasion she holding the hairdryer so close and for so long it burned, I ran off crying but somehow I had to apologize for upsetting her.

Today, however, was her worst. I have impacted wisdom teeth and I have been suffering months not being able to see the dentist. Today I got antibiotics and decided to get some food so I didn't have to worry about making every single meal. When I got home I put my name on it so people would know instantly - I let my sisters know if they wanted some fruit to ask, and they understood that.

However, after I ate an unnamed cheesecake dessert she comes up and is shouting immediately that I ate her cheesecake (no name on the individual thought she claims it was on the packaging which the pots weren't even in). I asked her (not shouting) if she was angry if I put my name on stuff and she says she was. She said how would I feel if she ate my food with my name on it. I don't understand why that would make any sense as she only probably put her name on it as I named my stuff. I don't understand what I did wrong. I paid for it why can't I make sure I am the one to eat it?

I went and told my dad that she was scaring me and she stormed down and went to the kitchen. I was trying to escape to my room but she caught up and threw as hard as she could the rest of the cheesecakes, which most of the hit me from a meter distance. Apparently my dad said something at this point, but I not hear. I was terrified as I used to her acting threatening but not acting on it. I ran to my room after threatening to call the police after which she yelled that I should (I didn't call them).

My dad never came up to see if I was okay. I went downstairs to take a spoon down just as my dad was going to bed and he just said to turn the lights off. I sent him a skype message asking why did said nothing or see if okay and he just said he did, and that he not decided. I can't afford to move out, it is impractical to move out, I have my sister and cats which I leave as they are honestly the only reason I am alive right now. My head is a mess so sorry if it doesn't make sense. I am not sure what advice anyone can give, I just don't want to be ignored.

1004,"I wore blackface in High School for a Halloween Party. Next day, a good friend found out and told me about what blackface was in the context of American culture and how it makes black people feel upon seeing it. I instantly regretted what I did and apologized to the few black people who had either been at the party or saw the photos. It continued to haunt me (in my head, no one brings it up). Then, in college, I realized that it was the normalization of casual racism among my friends, family, and I that led to me to doing what I did. (I am now in my 20s and years out of college). I stopped making casually racist jokes, obviously never wore blackface after the first time, and have tried to be as sympathetic as possible to the huge problems that African Americans face in our culture. 

Despite all this, I still haven't been able to let it go. It's the skeleton in my closet. I think about it all the time. I even refrain from retweeting/sharing/posting anything about race issues (like these protests regarding George Floyd's murder), even though it would be supportive, out of fear that someone will say something like ""You hypocrite. You wore blackface in High School. You're a fraud."" I imagine becoming a public figure and having this come back to ruin whatever I build in life. Oh ya, I didn't mention...my dream is to become a film/tv show writer so my industry is jam-packed with the very people that I fear would never forgive me.

I know the obvious question for so many is ""Didn't you know blackface was bad?"" I'm not trying to excuse what I did by saying this, only to provide context as to how I got to do what I did: at the time, I truly was not aware of what blackface was to American culture and how wrong it is. I grew up with a minority (but not black) family and in a location that had plenty of similar families. Racist jokes were thrown around my whole childhood by both friends and family. There were no Neo-Nazis/Confederates/White Supremacists/etc. but there was plenty of casually racist jokes and attitudes like ""don't date a black person."" There were even a couple occasions that I can remember where kids put on blackface for things like school plays. This is especially telling to me, in hindsight, because it meant that the kids, their parents, and the schools' staff members ALL saw no problem with blackface as late as the mid-late 2000s. All this provided the kind of environment that breeds racist ignorance, like what I had.

I'm afraid now that teenage me ruined my life before it even began. While I did something cringe-inducingly wrong, I don't think it should define my whole life or mean the eradication of my goals.

How do i move forward from this? Do I show public support (reposting, sharing, etc.) for racial issues despite the possible fallout I may face?

Doing things with my fingers aren’t cutting it and I want to order a dildo or something of the likes. Its just my, you know, parents, and me being a paranoid freak.
1) Amazon’s shipping is really secretive but when I get a package I don’t want my parents to ask what did you buy because thats what they ask most of the time when I get a package. I’m thinking what If I show them something I already have and say I ordered that item but there is another issue..
2) Where would I hide it? I’m getting rid of my dresser and vanity soon so those two options are out, incase my mom needs something from my room and she goes looking for it I don’t want to wake up with my parents standing over me yelling and asking questions about why would I order this and such.. not too long ago I was in deep suicidal thinking and if I order a sex toy and they find it that’s automatic death (seems silly to kill yourself over that but I’m a little bitch!)

So I have had some bad mental health days lately. Not because of the pandemic or anything external, but because I have been struggling with loving myself and not being too hard on myself. So yesterday I started saying positive affirmations to myself. It was suggested to do it in front of a mirror for at least 30 seconds. The mantra yesterday was ""I am strong and confident."" And after a few second of saying it, looking at myself, I started to feel really emotional and on the verge of crying. I have no idea why as my mental state hasn't been that bad to where I burst out crying.

I can’t sleep at night sometimes because she is always on my mind and I tried to find out where she lives.

1011,"Which one of these scenarios are acceptable/unacceptable?

&amp;#x200B;

1. If your SO were flirting with a person they just met online/in-person at a party? If your SO told them about your relationship but still flirted? If your SO didn't tell them about your relationship?
2. If your SO casually flirted with people they saw regularly at the store in passing (a young cashier only at the register and nowhere else, for example)? In front of you? Not in front of you?
3. If your SO were flirting with an old friend online/in person?
4. If your SO kept were flirting with a person they just met at a convention that you went to together (a model, for example)?

These questions stem from some reddit posts and some real life experience.

For example, my father is 80 years old and married, but still flirts with the local grocery baggers at the store ""to make them feel good"" and ""be kind/fun"" even though he would never cheat on his wife (plus he's old, so he's harmless, right?) One time, one of the baggers actually went for him and he felt super awkward, never talked to her again. But imagine if he were younger doing this? Again, I just don't know. 

If my SO did this (we're in our 30s), I'd feel insecure I guess. Plus, my SO isn't the flirting type because he's just super direct. So if he were flirting, he would literally be trying to seduce somebody rather than anything else. 

What's your take?",01Jun2020,1

I try to eat healthy. I was pretty fat as a kid and got picked on/teased for it. After losing maybe around 30 pounds from eating healthy, I’ve noticed a change in my mom’s behavior towards my eating habits. She calls me skinny pretty often. I’m lying in bed watching TV. “You’re so skinny!” I’m eating blueberries. “You should eat the cake we have in the fridge! It’s going to spoil!” 

I’m really tired of this. She encourages me to eat junk food all the time, even if I explain to her that I’m just trying to do what’s best for my health.

1016,"I (13f) was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 3 years ago. Yeah I know I'm really young for that and it is common in older people. But after almost a year of trying to figure out what was wrong with me, they gave up and diagnosed me with that. I also have sensory issues so I don't take pain, or any strong emotion well. But the thing is, it only seems to be getting worse. I have soreness almost everywhere! Not a day goes by where I can say I'm okay. I feel it in my head, my back, my neck, my hip, my thighs, my shoulders, not kidding, everywhere. I'm always tired. I'm emotionally and physically tired of this. It's getting harder to do basic things like getting out of bed in the morning, going downstairs, staying awake long enough to finish my online school work. When COVID 19 hit that is when I started to feel depressed. I can't put words to a feeling like that. I'm just hopeless. I've been on 4 different pain killers for my fibromyalgia this year. I'm so behind on school work I might even fail the grade. I have really bad ADHD and have a pill to help me cope with it, but it only makes me feel sluggish and zombie-like. Add that and some chronic pain and you got yourself a failing grade! I have been to so many doctors, zoom calls, specialists, and therapists, that all tell me to do the same thing. Take your pills, keep up with physical therapy, and **think positive**. Words can't describe how much I HATE when people tell me that. I no longer have anything to be positive about.   


I used to be a really hyper, healthy, happy person. I used to be a paranoid perfectionist who got all her school work done and had lots of friends. I used to be a theatre kid, I adore singing and show tunes. I'm just a shell of my former self. I'm sad, hopeless, in pain, and have no energy to do anything. Not even text my friends! I've become very anti-social, I hide in my room with the lights of for my migraine and either sleep or cry. I've lost hope in all therapy and medicine. My mom keeps telling me that if I don't see any progress with my condition I'll have to be homeschooled (when I was in school I would constantly call my mom crying to pick me up because something always hurt me). Yes, I have an IEP, and yes we have adjusted it since my diagnosis. My mom is crazy worried about me and I feel bad for worrying her but what do I even do at this point.   


Please someone at least tell me they can relate to this. I really am desperate and don't know what else to do. Being told about homeschooling opened my eyes to what I have become. I want to get better but it's hard to do anything right now. Any advice will be appreciated, thank you for reading.",01Jun2020,1

Hey all! So my sister (23F) &amp; I (25F) are staying with our boyfriends (23Ms) in an AirBnb (that I got under my name) to attend our father’s funeral. After the visitation we got back from shopping while my sister was picking up food so just her bf is here. I smelled weed as soon as I walked in. We are in a U.S. state where weed is illegal, and my boyfriend and I both work with children. Our father was also a drug addict (Weed that turned into harder stuff. He had other trauma and I’m not saying weed caused it. But the smell brings up painful memories) and that is possibly the reason he just passed away. While we try not to judge this was incredibly insensitive and we could lose our jobs. We smelled it immediately when walking in so I’m sure the people who let us rent their house can smell it. He said he smoked it because was anxious being around so many people at the funeral. He is bipolar and has depression. There are several other issues we’ve had with him over the years (such as saying he wouldn’t have dated my sister if he’d know she had kids, saying he’d never be their stepfather “jokingly” after 1 year and now they’ve been together 2, he doesn’t have a car or license, and he’s gotten her to start vaping with weed). 

I have no idea how to handle this. He’s supporting my sister during this time. But he’s put us in possible legal trouble. It was strong, and if they smelled it downstairs they could call the cops. How do I address this?",01Jun2020,0

1029,"We’ve been going out for almost 2 years now, but the last year has been rough. He was a shy uncool virgin when we met and I was a decently-attractive popular girl. We ‘fell in love’ pretty hard and fast and moved in together but we’ve both changed almost beyond recognition now. He has become insulting, disrespectful and uncaring - I have become easily irritated, overweight and broke after finishing college (uni) in the middle of a pandemic. We have had a few large arguments over silly things like chores and money, and threatened breaking up a few times this year. We managed to patch things up and I tried my best to take on board his concerns but I feel like he’s always picking fights with me. When we went on a break for a little while, he was beyond rude and horrible about me and since then I’ve had huge insecurities. Imagine my heartbreak to find conversations on his phone with his brother, about needing to ‘set me straight’ and how his brother definitely thinks he should chuck me - his brother’s a misogynistic pea brain btw who sees women as disposable conquests. We are due to be moving house soon for his job and I have a suspicion he’s going to tell me I’m no longer welcome living with him. His mother messaged me saying: “when he moves into HIS new home you can come and rent his old room at my house”. I asked him about this message and he told me to ignore her and it was nothing. But I checked his phone again to find him telling his brother his “mum needs to watch what she says because she has a big mouth”. Wtf do I do?!? He thinks I don’t know! Do I confront him? He is not the good person he used to be and he has admitted he no longer cares about my feelings and opinions, but I’m still in love with the person he used to be. I feel insecure and disposable and worried that I won’t find love again. I don’t want us to break up but I don’t know how to fix things either. It feels like he’s moving up in the world by stepping on my head, as the balance of power and finances were so different at the beginning of our relationship. He needed me and now he doesn’t. My family always make casual jokes about ‘poor him’ ‘putting up with me’ and I think it’s slowly convinced him that he’s always in the right and no one will ever believe he would ever do anything bad - but they don’t know about any of the problems we’ve been having. Behind his facade he has exposed himself as racist, homophobic, transphobic, perverted and generally despicable in many ways. I also have nowhere else to go and he knows it. I have very little family, no family home, no money left and have lost many friends because of my devotion to him. I feel trapped.

1031,"Long story short: 
When I was 17, I was sexually assaulted by two people. It has been a couple of years since then and I am seeing a sexual assault therapist and have a meeting set up with a victim advocate. I need to get restraining orders against them because they stalked my girlfriend and continue to harass me. I have worked hard in therapy and on my own to be able to accept what happened to me and remove myself from my assaulters’ lives. However, I have a lot of fear about reporting them.

My biggest issue is that I know their friends will continue to harass me, and might possibly try to dox me. I worry they can make the issue go viral, because one of the people who sexually assaulted me happens to be a trans man. He has admitted to sexually assaulting me, and a witness was present. I myself am a member of the LGBT community and am active in social justice issues. 

I am worried that the justice system’s inability to sensitively treat trans perpetrators (and innocent trans people who have been accused) will reflect poorly on me. I feel like a lot of people will say it isn’t fair for me to report a trans man even though he has admitted to the abuse and I know he’s assaulted at least two other people. I would do my best to ensure his preferred name and pronouns are used, but I still worry I would be unfairly attacked even though he is one of the reasons I’m in this position. My assaulters’ friends will not believe they could ever be guilty, and will attack me before getting the true story.

I’m just really worried about the backlash. I feel like no one will have empathy for me and reporting will end up being a mistake because I will face further harassment. Will anyone care? Will it be worth it to report? Should my girlfriend and I continue to suffer in silence and try to heal on our own? I’m so broken by all of this.",01Jun2020,1

1039,is it too hot? i have fair athletic ability but the weather forecast is 100 fahrenheit so how likely is heat exhaustion? am i safe?,01Jun2020,1
1040,I’ve known that I’ve smell bad during when I was a kid at school people were coughing and sneezing and making passive jokes. I think that I smell like poop but I never smelt it myself. I always take showers everyday and wipe my ass and clean my ass with soap I always put deodorant on but nothing seems to help. My friends and family never confronted me about this but I hear them cough and sneeze sometimes. I’ve have sometimes get in awkward social interaction that when I talk to strangers I get insecure because they know why I’m insecure about and then I feel like they are judging me. This insecurities put my self esteem low. I’ve tried  body powder and perfume in my ass to take the smell away. I feel like someone put a curse on me I don’t like to live like this I feel like I’m going crazy I think I have some kind of Schizophrenia. I could clean my ass for an hour still smell bad to others. I’m okay with diet but I don’t want to try a diet for the rest my life I really don’t think diet would work. I’ve tried exercises a lot but nothing seems to work.I’ve never told anybody this I always kept it a secret to myself. I want help please any advice would work?,01Jun2020,1
1041,"No clue why this has happened.
I'm 15 and my dog called Dobby is about to turn 3. We are very close and I love him to bits.

Today, because of the extremely hot weather I didn't walk him (don't know if that affects anything, but thought it was noteworthy). At around 9pm I was stroking him and everything and we were fine. I went upstairs for a while and came back down at 12am and went to stroke him but he started growling at me. Eventually when my mum was going to bed and went to take him out to wee; he was following and staying very close to my mum, however completely staying away from me. Same thing happened, if I went near he growled. If my mum came towards me he would very slowly follow and growl once I was nearby.

Finally, I went upstairs and 20 minutes later my mum came into my room normql my dog to see how I'm doing. I was laying in bed. He seemed fine and I thought maybe things were normal. He jumped on the end of my bed and slowly started to walk towards me like he normally does to give me a lick goodnight, however started growling and I immediately jumped out of bed and thought ""nope, not dealing with this"" and went to the bathroom. I waited for my mum to take him to their room where I then shut my door and will not let him in now.

He normally sleeps with me however tonight he hasn't even scratched at my door to be let in. It's like I've done something and he's scared of me now?? I swear I haven't done anything to hurt him; I love him so much and it's making me upset to see him hate me.

The reason I got so nervous is although Dobby is a good dog, he has bitten people in the past. Not strangers, however once bit my dad when my dad tried to lift him into the bath (he HATES baths).

I'm just confused and sad. Any advice would be great.
I'm hoping tomorrow I'll wake up and it'll be better but I'm not sure.",01Jun2020,1
1042,"I have this very close friend who im kinda getting worried about. Shes told me several times in the last month that she needs to sort out her life, then all of a sudden she said shes doing amazing, not good but amazing which i was happy about because she was bullied in high school quite a bit and she has reallllly low self esteem. We just finished first year of university and I thought she was doing better with her confidence.

She used to post a LOT on snap/insta but it was mostly normal things. Now for the past 3 weeks shes been posting on her snap story LITERALLY every morning,afternoon and night(like midnight) several pics her face and ""being happy is amazing"" ""im so happy"" ""confidence is amazing"" ""wow I look so good"" and today she posted a screenshot of a definition of her name which was basically how amazing and perfect the person who has that name is.

I found that really weird because all these years ive known her shes never been narcissistic, now all of a sudden this.

To me this screams im not happy and shes been depressed a lot, she starved herself last year because she was insecure about her weight even though shes really slim. I know it seems like im  posting about her flaws but im addressing it all because I dont want her to do something stupid if she isnt actually happy which is what im suspecting.

am I stupid/wrong for getting kinda worried?",01Jun2020,1
