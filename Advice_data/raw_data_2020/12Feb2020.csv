0,"I got the opportunity to speak with a surgeon (my dream career) and have yet to do so. This opportunity was handed to me despite me not being the best speaker nor did I ask for it. Although I did not ask for it, it is very much appreciated. This surgeon is someone I had no clue about their status or anything. Regardless, their family member provided an email and phone number to speak with this person. I was already nervous, but not extremely so. Until I looked up this surgeon and realized... oh shit this is a high level surgeon who works in one of the best hospitals in my city AND they pioneered a certain type of non-invasive surgery. There are interviews with this person, they are basically famous in their field. So I’m back to being anxious about how to call and get the best possible scenario for myself: to shadow them and confidently ask some questions that don’t display how much of a pussy I’m being.


TLDR: I’m afraid of a top dog surgeon, which I know speaking to will further my journey to the medical field.",12Feb2020,1
1,"Okay so I feel like a total failure.



The trope is typical: I was a really smart, extroverted and charismatic kid and teen. Teachers loved me, always great grades, kinda studied but never too much. People were always complimenting my achievements, seeked me for help with homework and tests, you know the drill.



Then college came around in march and oh boy was it a shock. Life got HARD, suddenly I was not that special or good at anything at all. I had to start studying and applying myself for real this time, and falling from that high was hard. The first exam I failed had me in tears for a few days. But I pulled through. A friend and I would always go to the library together and pull long study sessions and help eachother out. It was super nice and helpful, and it was the thing that helped me adapt. 



But relying on one person is never a good idea. She suddenly stopped talking to me. Actually, she talks to me as if we were not close, as if I'm bothering her. Never wants to meet up to study or just hang out. Is always annoyed or angry at anything I say and I don't know what happened, and she won't talk to me. We got super close and now I feel I don't have anyone to talk to in the same way. I just feel super alone. She is always with this other friend of ours, and I honestly feel replaced. It's not even jealousy, I'm just hurt. Instead of having us both as friends, they got really close as we used to be, and she pushed me away. She is also taking her to our spots, our special tables, our coffee shop, our favourite park... It just hurts a lot. I know I don't ""own"" those places but it's just weird thinking of going there with someone else.



Loosing that closeness really hit me mentally, I'm an extrovert, I really rely on my friends and even though I do have more people, I'm not as comfortable with anyone else to that degree. Life in general has also being hard and it sucks that when I tried to talk to her about it, she shrugged it off, called me dramatic and to ""man up"", and that she is the one dealing with the real shit. I'm not denying she is going through a hard time herself, but I don't think you can compare struggles that easily. An example would be that she is always telling me how lucky I am that my family has money and I don't have to work yet, but on the flip side, I have a lot of issues with rejection and violence with my family, and her parents are both sweethearts. I'm not saying I have it harder than her, just that it's different types of having it hard. Whatever.



The thing is, my study routine also got totally off the hook. I truly needed her to be accountable and able to get out of bed and go do shit. I had this really important exam tomorrow, and I'm not going to show up. It's shameful how little I actually got to study. I think my younger self would be so disappointed in me. All the people that have high expectations will be crushed. And all the people who wanted to see me fail will be right.



 I never realised how hard it is to do things when no one is there to congratulate or reprimand you when you succeed or fail. It's just so much easier to never get out of bed and just lurk around. No one worrying about you. It's summer, right now we're in am exam period before the school year starts and I decided I wanted to pass one of my pending subjects (a really hard one). It's the only one I was going to attempt and I didn't even get to the point of actually showing up. I'm so disappointed in myself.  For now, it's just one subject but I really don't know how to get back on track. March is coming, and with it the begging of classes, and I am utterly terrified of what's going to happen. If I will be able to juggle everything going on without losing myself in the process. I honestly am open to any and all advice. About routines, about friendships, about being able to do shit on my own... Whatever. I'm just desperate and want to figure this out before it actually makes an important impact in my life.

3,"I have a pretty good job, in all honest. But when I got a raise about two months ago, my boss (the VP of the company) pretty much said I'd reached the cap of what I could expect, unless I just branch out into a different role at the company.

I just happened to see a job posting for a job that's almost exactly what I already do. Except instead of living in DC, it would have me moving to San Francisco. I'm okay with the idea of moving, but I'm honestly not sure what to expect salary-wise.

So I just... didn't include my personal ""salary requirements"".

4,"Any advice on how I can change? I'm 26F I've never been a relationship. I've always been the ugly girl in the group. No guys have ever shown interest in me. I've recently lost a lot of weight, but I still have an ugly face. I was thinking of going to see a plastic surgeon to see what modifications can be done to my face. 

I'm also somewhat introverted but I do have lots of friends. I don't have problems making friends guys or girls, but like I said no guy has ever been intrested in being more than friends. 

Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? Or what else  I can do differently? Whenever I ask my friends they always tell me I just haven't found my person and that I should wait. However, they been saying the same thing to me since I was 18 and now I'm 26 and nothing has changed.

6,"Throw-away (obviously).

I have a client that we custom developed software for them back in 2017.

The scope was:

* **Track rental properties**
* **Track service calls / repairs**
* **Record payments / apply coupons**
* **Track inventory of maintenance warehouse**

We built it off Odoo, a highly customizeable platform. Everything works as described.

THey paid 50% down in November of 2017. When the main system was completed, they paid the remaining 50% in April 2018.

We spent three months training the staff and preparing them to transition from spreadsheets to an ERP.

In July of 2018, the requested custom reports, and submitted a PO for that work.

We worked with an off-shore report expert but could not make it work. The reports they want are very strange and complicated. But we continued to work with them to get them the other reports that were easier to customize. 

We agreed to just keep that PO open and we would continue to look for a consultant to work on the custom reports.

Then in October of 2019, they call us in for a board meeting. Their attorney is raking us over the coals, telling us everything is broken, nothing works. We were shocked. We were under the impression that they have been using the software and aside from their weird reports, everything was fine.

We then spent a few weeks, cloned the server and took 12 employees to log in and perform functions as they would. Everything worked fine. We also looked at the log and found that they have not even logged into the software.

From what we can determine, they are resistant to change, and are trying to put all the blame on us with their Board of Directors. Basically throwing us under the bus.

A few weeks ago, we told them everything works and asked them if they want to be retrained, even though the hands on part of the contract is expired.

They came back a few days ago and are demanding a full refund ($13,700). 

How would you handle this situation? This is our first big upset customer. Assuming the software works, and the training went well. They know how to use the software. They know how it works. They just refuse to implement it. 

We could offer to $0 out the 2nd PO for $6000 for the custom reports, even though they owe us about $1500 in work done on that PO. But the initial PO for $13,700 (for the software), is done, delivered, paid for and closed.

How would you approach them?",12Feb2020,1
7,"so i joined reddit because i didn't really know of another place to ask this so here goes. 

i (F17) have a boyfriend (18) who i really really love a lot, but i recently came off of a year relationship that was extremely abusive and messed with my trust a lot. my boyfriend is a wonderful guy and has always been so loving and understanding and he never ever lets me doubt that he loves me as well. 

my problem is with his ex though. she's so much prettier and skinnier and just a lot better looking than i think i am, and i find myself getting jealous of her all the time. we're in classes at school together and we dance together and i just feel like crap every time i think about her because i just feel like she's so much better than me at everything, and i'm such a downgrade for my boyfriend. 

i've told my boyfriend this &amp; they're still friends (genuinely friends, they literally just snapchat each other their foreheads like twice a day) and it slightly bothers me but i don't wanna be that controlling girlfriend who says he can't be friends with someone. 

i'm just at a loss at how to stop feeling so intimidated by her when i know my boyfriend would never do anything to hurt me. i just always feel so compared to her in every aspect and don't know how to stop it, and i'm tired of always feeling upset because i get reminded of how much better than me she is.

10,"So I live in an apartment building, and about a month or two ago I heard these two little boys (under 8) in the hallway around 9 pm at night. They were unattended, so I called security, because I was worried about them.

 But since then, these incidences have started to occur more frequently and longer in duration. It usually starts at about 7 each night, and sometimes even around 10 pm. I think its a family that has visitors often, because there are many kids of different ages, tonight there was a girl that had that high pitched scream a child under 4 would have. They will run up and down the halls, chase each other, and be noisy. I don't know the situation, but I'm guessing its something along the lines of the kids get antsy inside the apartment, so the adults have them go run around and scream to blow off some steam. Childrens laughter is wonderful, and I know that small apartment building isn't fun for kids to be cooped up inside of, but it can be very disruptive when I'm trying to do work. One time I was on Facetime and the person I was talking to couldn't even hear me because this one boy was literally just screaming. I've tried to drown it out with music before, but sometimes its when I want to go to sleep. I'm too scared to go knock on the family's door, because I'm a young girl that lives alone, and they speak a language that I don't. I feel like I'm being a 'Karen' but its starting to really get on my nerves, and sometimes I'll look out through my peephole and see my neighbours looking outside at whats going on.

11,"So basically, I hold two main grudges that have affected me for a while.

The first was from when during more than half of my middle school life, my mom downplayed my emotions and ignored my opinions. She also acted ignorant about my mental health, despite my constant anxiety attacks and me begging for her to take me to a therapist or something. I forgive and love her, but I’ll never forget that. I’ve stopped telling her about how I feel because I no longer trust her with my mental and emotional health. She’s never said sorry, because she believes she was in the right and thought I was overreacting.

The second was from a little farther back up until now. My brother has always been a brat, and has done horrible things that he twisted to make me and my sister look like bullies. My mom has always taken his side, and because of his little- I mean HUGE tantrums, she no longer wants to be involved even when he’s “abusing” me, if he hits or punches me (which he has done before). I hate him for it, and he’s never once apologized and STILL continues to be rude to me unless he wants something from me. And his favorite phrase is “that’s not fair” because I almost always refuse what he’s asking of me, and suddenly IM being selfish in his eyes. 

I haven’t forgiven my brother. He’s a bit better now, but I’m always rude to him. 

I guess these things affect me so much because they’re reminders that my mom hasn’t supported me mentally- whether it’s defending me and helping put up with my brother, or with my anxiety attacks a while back.

I want to let these grudges go, but I feel like I can’t do that until the problem they’ve caused is gone- which it never will. My mom will never take my mental health seriously or help me out with my brother, and I doubt my brother will stop being selfish. I’ve had a talk with my mom multiple times, nothing helped.

So Reddit, how do I stop holding a grudge against my family?  (Btw this was a bit of me ranting, so sorry for it being long)",12Feb2020,1

Lately I've been struggling a lot with emotion. 
I literally can't feel sad or sympathetic, and I'm not sure why. I've been like this for most of my life, however I've just now been thinking about it. 

My sister, father, and step mother have all been getting increasingly angry at me because I'm not acting empathetic toward anything. I have trouble catching on to other people's feelings.

For some background, I've been like this as long as I can remember. I've never been sad when a family member has passed, or a pet, or a friend. When I was younger I would always fake being sad, but thats become much harder to do. As a child (ages 3-15) I was heavily abused by my mother, I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it, but I was considering that reason.

17,"My dad is my employer, pays for my living situation and I'm in the process of divorce (I got used for a green card) - he's very controlling however loves me very much - he can be an asshole, but also can be a very loving kind soul - however I can't tell him anything that he doesn't agree with me doing or he'll lose his shit at me

I've been getting a divorce for the better part of a year and am tired of my life being put on hold.  I had no assets and under $500 to my name at the time of separation.

I am 22 and live in California.  In California the law states that assets are divided at point of separation to my best knowledge, though everyone else says it's at the point of divorce.  However, I have looked it up repeatedly.

I have been in a relationship with a wonderful girl for a little over half a year who treats me wonderfully, I love her, but my dad still treats her as an outsider when she's not around.  He treats her kindly in person, but he's always waiting for her to slip up once.

My girlfriend and I are planning on moving out from both of our current living situations into a place that is decent and that we can afford.  She roommates at someone's house and I live with my parents.  Everything is looking like it's going to work out with the place that we are looking at.

My mom feels a bit bittersweet about it all because she feels like I'm abandoning her to deal with the aftermath with my dad.  She recognizes I need to be independent and need to live my life.  But at the same time it hurts to not have her full support.

As far as my current living situation, my dad constantly talks to me about work.  Our personal relationship hinges most of the time on how our work is going and if I'm making consistent forward progress.

When I don't work, I deal with a lot of anxiety and lately we argue pretty much every night.  I don't want to continue living like this.

I also don't want to tell him I'm moving out until I've moved out.  I just want to text him, but I feel guilty doing that.  But if I tell him in person he might lose his shit and not let me leave.  And I don't want it to come to that.

In his defense he supports me in all things that he agrees with me on.  Like me working, or feeding me, or things that benefit me in his eyes, like me taking courses online or getting this divorce finalized.

I don't ever have more than 4-5 hours at most during any day where he doesn't check up on me.  However it feels like keeping tabs?  He has a camera on the front door and if I go out he always calls me and asks where I'm going, so I go out the garage usually now.

He says it's just because he misses me and wants to say hi, but then he is concerned that I'm not getting enough work done?

It feels like I eat, breathe, and sleep ""work"".

He also pays me technically less than minimum wage and doesn't allow me to get a job of my own.  When I say less than minimum wage, I mean I am paying him back for helping me with the green card which is a mandated cut from each paycheck that I rarely get.  But he also can't really afford to pay me fully?  Or so that's what I'm told and I don't think he'd lie to me.  So the mindfuck is that he wants what's best for me, loves me, but tries to control every aspect of my life.

I know he will react terribly no matter how I approach telling him that I'm moving out.  But I don't want to hurt him.

It's very difficult, but I know I want to move out with my girlfriend.  But I don't want to deal with any form of abuse with leaving.

And I mean I'm 22 so it feels a bit dysfunctional?  But he's always helped me when I've needed it.

What do you think I should do?  How should I handle it?  If I get up after 9am he tells me I'm getting up late, and it I go to bed before 11pm he has tended to be frustrated that I'm not making enough progress with work and I find him very intimidating..

Anyways, thank you for reading.  And if you decide to offer advice/insight, it is much appreciated.

I know he won't want me moving out, let alone moving in with my girlfriend.  But quite frankly I don't know if he'd ever be okay with it..  sigh.",12Feb2020,1

27,"Hello to whoever may read this!

I could really use some advice and insight right now, and thought that I would give Reddit a whirl. I’m currently 16, and living with my parents. I attend high school in Canada. Without going through my entire life story, I’ll try to keep my reasoning as short as I can for why I’d like to move out. 

Over the past several years tensions at home have gotten increasingly high between me and my parents due to a variety of conflicts and issues, primarily my marks in school and time I’m spending online or playing video games. For a few years my grades have been struggling. My parent’s high expectations and constant pressure caused me to really begin to break down, and I quickly became extremely anxious and pessimistic. I doubted my abilities and began to blame myself for not having the strength or determination to improve on everything that I saw as being a flaw with myself. I became a perfectionist, needing everything to be done exactly right, and agonizing over every mistake. I became deeply depressed and at my darkest moments, suicidal.

I eventually managed to gather just enough courage to try to talk to my parents about it, and find a solution. I went through several sessions with a therapist, and they helped to some degree. I learned how to deal with the negative thoughts and it greatly improved my mental state. However, nothing changed at home and I was just as stressed and anxious as ever. Several years later, I’m still extremely stressed and things haven’t improved. I’ve tried so hard to fix things, but I don’t feel like my parents listen to what I’m trying to tell them or realize just how much this is affecting me. Over time I’ve grown to be anti-social, anxious, rebellious, and increasingly angry that nothing is changing. I find myself lying about many parts of my life, because I no longer trust their judgement. I have no energy and absolutely zero motivation to complete my school work. 

I’ve come to realize that as hard as I am trying to turn this around, the option that now appeals the most to me is to become independent and live on my own or with a roommate. I don’t intend to cut off contact with my parents, and don’t want to leave on bad terms, but I’m worried that that will happen anyway. I want to wait until I’m at least 17 to move out, but I know that my parents will take it poorly. I’m not sure if they would be sad that I was leaving and not understand why I wanted to live on my own, or angry that I didn’t try harder and am just delaying things and running away from my problems. Probably both. I feel that I could live a good lifestyle if I left, but am unsure about how I would find a good place to rent and how I would manage my finances. It’s pretty daunting, but I feel an increasing need to leave and become independent. 

TLDR: Feel the need to move out at 17 due to stress from parents. Not sure if it’s an absolutely unrealistic idea or if it could solve my issues.",12Feb2020,1
28,"Before I start, I just want to mention that I am very non-confrontational, and try to be quiet and not disturb my neighbors as best I can.

Anyway, this whole situation started around the end of December when my downstairs neighbor and her dog moved in. I heard her dog bark a lot, but I gave it around a month to get used to being in a new place and figured it was probably bored or lonely during the day. It also barked nearly every time anyone would walk past her front door, which is how I know it was her dog that was barking all the time. Obviously, I don't know the woman's work schedule or anything, but it seemed like whenever the dog started barking, any time of day, there was no effort to quite it down. Oftentimes it would bark and howl for over half an hour. Last Thursday, I went to bed around 10:00 PM since I had a work trip planned for early Friday morning. I was woken up by barking three separate times, the first time I didn't check the time, the second time was around 2 and IIRC the third was around 3:45. This was more than I could tolerate without trying to do something about it. 

I also noticed that whenever she leaves or enters her apartment, she always slams her door closed. Nobody else closes their door that hard in my building of 12 individual apartments.

Finally, and I don't know if this is her or not, but there has been a lot of dog poop that hasn't been being picked up recently, including a couple that were in the middle of the sidewalk. In the lease agreement, there is a section about picking up after pets.

On to what I did to upset her. I wrote her a note and put it on her door saying:

""Please do something about your barking and howling dog. It woke me up 3 times in one night a few days ago. Some barking is fine, but what your dog does is excessive! Don't believe me? Set up a webcam or microphone. There are people and websites that can train or show how you can train your dog to be quiet.      -Thanks, This whole building.""

&amp;#x200B;

All I wanted was some peace and quiet. Maybe I was a little more accusatory than I had intended (oops) but notice that I didn't mention the poop or door slamming. Her reaction to the note I left on her door was not what I expected. 

I think it was around 2 or 3 in the afternoon that I left the note. About an hour or two later, I heard her get home (door slam) and a few minutes later, I hear what I can only describe as stomping, slamming, or bashing. I think at one point, she even got up on a ladder or table or something and hit her ceiling (my floor) multiple times with something hard. Even with the most crazy winds, thunder, or children running through the outdoor hallway between apartments, I've never felt my apartment shake so much. I was honestly kind of scared that some big brawny guy would come up and bang on my door until I came out to get an ass beating. As I stated earlier, I am non-confrontational, but needless to say, my heart was pounding. Eventually I settled down and everything has been fine after her initial outburst.

The next day, after work, due to the outburst, I went to the apartment office to let them know of the situation, knowing they wouldn't be able to do anything unless there was some sort of evidence of the barking or stomping/slamming/bashing. Apparently, she had gone to the apartment office earlier in the day, to let them know her side, stating  she thinks she knows who wrote the note (how?), and that her dog never barks and wasn't barking the night I was woken up three times. (Considering I've heard her dog bark quite a lot over the course of the last month, I think I can recognize the sound of her dog and distinguish it from other dogs.) The apartment office staff said exactly what I was expecting. They couldn't do anything about the situation since everything presented so far is just hearsay.

ANYWAY, I've been collecting my thoughts on how to potentially resolve the tension between us. I'll put some good quality dog treats (to show that I don't dislike dogs), and some Milano cookies (for her, not the dog) into a gift bag with an apologetic note. Currently, the note draft says:

""Please accept this bag of goodies for you and your pooch as a peace offering. I hope we can forgive and forget each other's tomfoolery. I sincerely did not intend to upset you with the previous note. If there is anything I can do to make up for my indiscretion, let me know.        -Cordially, (My apartment #)"" 

On to what I would like advise about. Given the whole situation, what would you have done? How could I have handled the situation better? What would you have said differently in the note?  /r/&lt;AmItheasshole?&gt;  (Yes, I'll post this there too. Isn't there a way to post to multiple subs at the same time?)

If you want to post funny comments, I'm ok with that, but I do want some genuine advise on the situation.

This is the longest post I've made so here's the TL;DR.

TL;DR: Neighbor's dog barked a lot, I wrote her a non-confrontational note asking her to train it to be quieter.  When she read the note she hit her ceiling (my floor) multiple times hard enough to shake my apartment. What's the best way to resolve the situation.",12Feb2020,1
29,"So I (25F) have a friend (23M) who we will call Josh. He recently got in trouble at work for failing a drug test but didn’t get fired (though they typically fire them). He was very upset when it initially happened a few months ago and hasn’t talked to me much since but he recently found out his punishment from his actions and yesterday when I asked him how he was and what was going on and he said everything was horrible and he wanted to kill himself. 

I’m sure there is more going on but I’m not trying to pry to much because it truly is none of my business. But at the same time, he said he wanted to off himself so it’s hard not to pry because I want to make sure he doesn’t do anything. 

Well josh stopped responding to me yesterday and I kind of blew up his phone a little bit and this morning when he finally answered and he just said “I’m good”. I feel like he’s lying. I mean, I know he’s probably busy with work which I understand, but at the same time I want him to answer me as soon as he can. I have a flight feeling he probably doesn’t want to kill himself, he just thinks he does because he is so stressed out, but either way I’m not taking a chance. 

So my advice is, what should I do? Blow up his phone, or just let him talk to me when he is ready? What should I say to him ?

Also to add, I have suggested he go get therapy or talk to someone or make some life changes and he always says “I don’t think I need that” (he clearly does).",12Feb2020,1

33,"Hey y’all. So. I’m a 17 y/o fm who is gonna be turning 18 soon. When I was about 6 my parents divorced due to varying reasons but one of them being my biological father was an alcoholic. My mom was single for awhile but when I was around 8 she met someone and he basically raised me from then on. 
 
My biological father has messed up in the past (gaslighting, had us lie to our mother about whether the legally mandated supervisor was there or not on visitations, and so forth) 
He is a vet and was honorably discharged due to injuries. (Important)
When I was 12 he tried to get custody of me and my siblings (we were gonna change our names and he didn’t like that, dough it than started a custody battle) 
He said some nasty things about us, my mother, and tried forcing us on visitations. He even called the police once. He also had clear favorites and wasn’t super nice to the kids that weren’t his favorite (aka be this certain way or I’ll be kinda mean to you) I’ve got some issues bc of that 
Anyway 
After that, we stayed with our mom 
My step dad is basically my father. He has been the main father figure in my life since 8 and honestly is more than I could ask for. He was young and came to our family to raise three children bc of his love for my mother. He moved countries (from Canada) for us 

After the court battle, I stopped having contact w my bio father and it’s been quite a bit of time between now and then. I am the oldest of three siblings. The youngest absolutely hates him and won’t see him. The middle sibling goes on visitation And still has contact regularly 
My sibling said that he has been changing for the better and really misses us. He’s my bio father and I’ve been through a lot with him. I have started calling him sometimes and talking about life and such. Was even gonna bring my now ex boyfriend to visit (never done that). I can see he really cares and wants to help me in life. He even has been talking about how since he’s a veteran, I can get financial aid for college and has been giving me resources and ideas for it. He’s putting a lot of work and care. It’s hard to explain but I guess he simplest is I love him a lot and I see how much he knows he’s made mistakes and is trying to make things right. 

When I was tween years I really wanted to be adopted by my step dad. He was my dad and I wanted nothing more. For a birthday present me and my siblings made fake adoption papers and gave them to me. So this wasn’t a pressure at all by my parents. Me and my siblings wanted nothing to do with my bio father and being adopted by my stepdad was natural bc he’s the one that basically raised us 

So the dilemma is Should I be adopted or keep things the way they are? 
If I tell my bio dad (or he finds out some way) that I’m gonna be adopted his heart will be broken 
Also the veteran financial aid things is important bc if I’m adopted I won’t be eligible so I’d have to tell him the resources he’s giving me won’t apply bc I’m not legally his child anymore 

If I tell my step dad and mom that I don’t want to be adopted bc of him it will probably hurt them too, even if they don’t show it. And now that I’ve wanted it for so long, there is pressure to jsut do it ya know. 

Also I’m case anyone is wondering, I’m not unsure bc of the fincail aid. I’m not shallow like that and I’m not gonna use my bio dad for money. This is all in the name of who’s heart should I break lol. 

I’m unsure about what I want to do and want to do and how I should break the news to either parties of my decision. Please help me out y’all. This is my first reddit post btw so I’m really sorry if I didn’t do it right",12Feb2020,1
34,"I cant fucking stand him. He takes every little think and makes it into a huge problem. If I do anything around him its ""disrespectful and rude"". If me or my mom get into an argument with him hes always right no matter what. He constantly calls my mom fat, calls me and my brother lazy, called me useless before, and has probably called my mom and brother some things I dont know about. He also tells me to ""just remember"" every time I forget to do something, even though he knows damn well I have adhd and cant help it.

I stopped self harming for 4 months and hes making me want to start again. I wanna go back to where he was barely in my life but I cant stay in a mental hospital until I'm 18. 

Whenever I'm upset I tell myself ""I want to go home"" but I never understood why. I've realized that it's probably because it's not home if hes there. I want to go to that fantasy world where my mom chose a normal man or where she had the income to not need to get support from her spouse. I dont think I've ever been genuinely happy before at home, probably because hes been in my life since I was 4. In fact, I remember genuinely wanting to be run over by a car when I was like 8 or 9.

40,"TL;DR: what is my reason for living? 

Im 18, I fell on extremely hard times about 5-6 months ago in that my mental health was completely failing. I became homebound and had to drop out of my senior year of highschool. All of my friends, whom I had solely supported with their own major issues (family, mental health, finding a girlfriend, etc.) left me and cut contact promptly after I had to drop out. Every single person I had known no longer wanted anything to do with me seemingly over night. So here I am, months later with 0 friends and my only close family members all being well over 50 struggling to find meaning. 

I'm worn out of video games, I'm tired of reading, I've exhausted my movie/TV show options, and I cannot seem to reclaim any old friends. Whenever I try to get back in touch with someone that has nothing to do with the friend-group that originally left me, they end up slowly or sometimes quickly cutting contact with me as well. The last I've heard of my best friend of 16 years was him telling me he was on his way over to hang out. Shortly after that I was blocked on his social media and never heard back from him again. That was maybe 3 months ago now. 

Anyways, I'd try getting a job but that seems unobtainable as well considering I've tried my luck with practically every minimum wage job available in town (that's within a reasonable distance to where I live) and have not even gotten as far as hearing back from any of them. 

That leaves me with: no job, no friends, little family, out of school, decreasing amount of hobbies, and a declining mental health state. I guess my question on here then is what is my purpose for living? Does this possibly ever get any better?",12Feb2020,1

I am currently a sophomore right now. I wouldn't say I'm involved in school but it's not like I do nothing. I'm in Honors ELA, in my schools Engineering/Architecture academy, and I'm in few interactive clubs/CSF and I do lots of volunteering. But apparently that isn't enough. My dad thinks I'm going to regret not doing some type of sport in high school or outside school, which I won't. He tells me I'm a loser because I do nothing. I do rec soccer in the fall fpr my city but missed it this year because of late registration and I quit swim in the summer because I hated it. I tried out for my schools soccer team last year but didnt make it because most players at my school are club or have been playing their whole life. I didnt try out this yeat for the same reason and they think im not doing it just to not do it. But i know i have no chance cause im not into it like that and i only made last cuts last year because they didnt want to end tryouts early(even though they already had their teams made) He thinks that just cause I don't want to do anything means I'm insecure or scared. I just don't care for it to be honest and he is now threatening to take my phone and laptop away if I don't sign up for something by next year.

 I know how sports are and the relationships you make but I have more important things to do like working on my education and getting into college.  Junior year will be specifically stressful and I know anything taking up extra time will hold me back.
What's worse is that compared to my brother, I'm a ""loser"" we only recently discovered that he is sort of a musical prodigy, he has perfect pitch, he does band(trying out for honor band and all that) and he's  in swim. My parents praise him for this while I struggle to work hard in school just so I can get in my dream college/career. My school also has these letterman jackets that you put patches on for academic abilities and sports abilities and they want me to get one but I just don't care. Its just a expensive jacket and i dont need one to know what I've done in school. They just want to brag to their friends about what I can do but it's all just too much now.

Sorry if this is a lot to read, it's my first post but I kinda needed to have the whole context. My dad won't believe me when I say I won't regret not doing things or when I try to tell him i don't need to do sports etc. in school just to have good high school memories/achievements. The more they enforce this the more useless and not enough I feel. I just don't know what to do or how to tell them this in a way I can actually get through his thick skull.

44,"Hi everyone.

My friend can't seem to stay afloat, and I need advice. He is 30 years old. I first met him last year after he moved into our house from the streets. He lived with us for free for 3 months, when he got very sick and was hospitalized for 3 months. Then he moved in with a friend downtown. He got kicked out and moved to someone else's apartment, and lived there for a few months, for free again. Then he decided to move to Hawaii because ""the angels were telling him to"" , and lived there for about 6 months, living in and out of homelessness. Now he moved back here, lived with a friend until they got sick of his shit, and they kicked him out. Now he's living on the streets in the freezing cold, and I don't know how to help him.

I already know my roommates don't want him living with us. Frankly i don't either, he's a total energy vampire. He acts like he deserves everything; deserves your money, deserves to live in your home for free. Deserves all of your sympathy. From what he told me, it sounds like he's been living this way for the, couch surfing for free essentially, for the  past ten years. The only job he's really had is a gogo dancer or stripper, and now he is under the belief that he will become a famous dj... 

I really don't know how to help him. My plan is to give him some money and maybe buy him a meal, but i'm broke and work all the time so i don't have much to give.

I've been having panic attacks, getting really irritable with a short fuse, and crying a lot lately over this.

Which is COMPLETELY unlike me - so please be gentle in your responses? I'm here because I really want compassion and clarity.

**LONG STORY SHORT:**

He (38M) and I (28F) meet 1.5 years ago. Fall hard for each other. Our relationship to me has been the best ever; we are always joking and laughing, get along great, cooking meals together, going to the gym together, dates, etc etc.

Not too long ago, we got into some seriously heavy shit- and I really haven't been myself since. I miss myself. Which feels weird to say but it's true.

Over Christmas and NYE, friends from out-of-state came into town to visit. One night while he was away at work and we were enjoying dinner and drinks together, they jokingly asked me when him and I are getting married. The next week, I felt inspired to gently bring up the topic with him. It basically turned into a fight that lasted two days. GREAT. 

By the end of the fight, we figured out that it was just a misunderstanding/miscommunication and all is well. yay!

About a week later, we started having trouble in the bedroom. He couldn't stay hard and I was unsatisfied with the other things we tried instead of p in v. This went on for about two weeks and my emotions were running so high I was considering leaving him ( this is about the 4th or 5th time this has happened during our relationship )

I'm glad I didn't leave him

We get this resolved, and then another few weeks later we talk about the reality of me leaving my current apartment to move in with him at his house. We both agree. He gets the 'go-ahead' from his brother ( they co-own a house they inherited ) and now I'm feeling scared and hesitant about doing so. But what I cannot understand is: why?! I was so sure of this before, now I'm having cold feet.

Basically, over the last 2 months or so I have felt myself slowly growing more and more discontent with my relationship and with him. But for the life of me I cannot put my finger on exactly why. I've been checking out other men a lot, getting really annoyed with some of his daily habits, etc etc.

But then sometimes we go out to dinner and everything feels so magical and good again, and I regret ever feeling that way toward him and want to work to be the best girlfriend ever toward him. 

WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. HECK. 

is going on?

Is this some childhood trauma I need to work out with a therapist? Daddy issues? wtf?

Or do I just need to go on a damn vacation alone for the weekend to get right in my mind?

So my girlfriend recently told me that she feels empty inside whenever I'm not physically around. Even if I'm texting her and replying her early and all she sometimes feel empty. She has been battling depression and anxiety for a long time now so i just wanna be there for her. i know i can't 'treat' her depression or anxiety i just wanna be there for her and support her.

However I found out too that she has been talking to her ex and telling him that no one understands her like he does. And she tells him that she feels empty when I'm gone and maybe I'm just temporary or short term happiness for her. She doesn't know i know about this and like whenever she is with me she tells me that she sees a future with me and she wanna meet my parents and i feel that her feelings for me is very genuine and nothing feels like it's short term. 

I'm just really confused right now. I don't want her to know that i know about her conversation with her ex. I just want her to not feel empty when I'm not around because as much as i wanna be around her 100% of the time, I know that's impossible.

57,"I will try to be as clear as I can without too many details. Over the past year there has been a mentally unstable regular customer at the college campus where I work. Since I am the only one working at the area where she spends her time I am the only one around often.

The customer has violent convulsions at times, rants and talks out loud to people who are not there, shakes computers and pounds keyboards. She often is caught using the staff phone and loudly swearing when she has been told not to. She plays loud music and eats at the computers and sometimes tries to sleep in a chair. She always has her things with her and appears homeless and often is on the phone with family members who pick her up. (I do allow her to use a different staff phone if she needs to contact her ride as she often does not have a phone with her.) 

In her rants to me she has accused people of watching her and taking pictures through their glasses, told long confusing stories (about carrying an old woman on her back for three years straight, about being on trial for murder, about her brain buzzing and exploding inside her head, etc). 

Where I work nobody has to be around her but me. I have tried to tell higher ups my concerns but unless the customer discloses that she is mentally ill I am not allowed to offer any resources because that would be discrimination. I also cannot tell her to leave unless she causes a prolonged serious disturbance or gets violent

I feel really bad for her but also scared when she is around. She has refused to leave when we close before and we don’t have security except a few nights a week. It’s to the point where I feel highly uncomfortable in my own work environment and feel the need to hide from her... It’s not her fault but I just don’t know how to keep working like this.

Does anyone have any advice? Leadership doesn’t have to be around her so they don’t seem to see her presence as an issue but it is even driving other customers away because they are scared of her. I feel awful asking but there it is.",12Feb2020,1

59,"Last year of high school I met a friend, we became very close. I have my best friend but somehow I felt even more comfortable at times with my friend (A).  We matched background and spend endless hours laughing. She and I could cry with each other, laugh at and with each other and she even went as far as breaking up with her boyfriend (already in the works) at the same time my ex broke up with me so we’d go through it together. ( as a might as well) 

We clicked like never before, even my father loved her to death. She was like the sister I never had, I went through a lot of turmoil with her and for her. Then she met a guy online, super sweet... but married him within three months ( 1 month of physically knowing each other). She began to change, flipped her person and began to laugh less. She was always with him not a day in the week to TEXT her friends. Mutual friends noticed, she skipped out on prom for him, and then it was a sudden loss of any contact. She didn’t talk to me in class, didn’t talk to me during lunches, didn’t text me and ignored me on graduation. Fast forward a few months I texted her asking her wtf happened.  (I’d talked to her previous but she refused to accept she changed, it was pointless) 

I got a story about her family and excuses and found out she eloped. She moved away didn’t say bye or give any clues. She promised to keep in contact. A month ago after 6-7 months not contact, I found out THROUGH FACEBOOK she’s got stage 5 cancer. I managed to see it off a friends Facebook who happened to have her... I cried for days, felt angry and hurt. I didn’t find out the stage until I reunited with our mutual friend. Same thing for her... now it’s a more than likely death situation. I don’t know what to say.. I had to have some fault... she wouldn’t tell me if I did. I don’t want to regret not speaking with her, but I don’t know if she just didn’t care for me and didn’t want to say so. It didn’t feel that way. My mutual friend thinks she’s scared... I don’t know what to do I just keep crying at random, I feel stupid and dramatic slightly like a creep... 

She’s made new accounts and friended everyone but me... it hurts so much I don’t know what to do...",12Feb2020,1
60,"So I’m a college student and I drive myself to school. I used up all my refund money to buy a car because It was a necessity to have. I shouldn’t be depending on anyone to take me to school and take me home. I’m in a group chat with some close friends and we all attend the same school. One of my friends asked if someone can take her to school and I offered. A semester passed and I took her to school and then to her house. Now while this is happening, my little brother would walk home after school since I didn’t have the time to pick him up at 2pm. I would lie to my mom and say that someone was picking him up (it’s like a 10 minute walk from his school to our house). Now that I’m in a new semester I still take my friend to school. I take 5 classes so based on my schedule, I have only 2 days that I know that I can’t pick my little brother up. On Friday’s, I always pick up my brother. But on the last two days I can’t since my friend gets out of her classes at 2:30 p.m. I get out at 12:45 p.m. and have to wait on her to get out of her classes and drive home (30 minute drive) take her to her house and then go home. I’m usually home at 3:30 p.m. The issue is that my mom has found out that I don’t pick up my brother and wants me to either charge my friend each week or pick him up and refuse to drive her to school. I know that I’m suppose to charge her but it’s not in my personality to ask her for the money each week. I know that my mom is right but I don’t want to admit to my mom that I should go to my friend and demand her the money. What should I do and how should I mentally deal with this? How should I tell my friend about this?",12Feb2020,1

We used to hang out a lot. This year is our senior year of high school and, in our school they segregate us into our specific work areas (i.e. arts, engineering, economics, etc.), we all went into different areas. I understood that we would stop hanging out as much as we did, but as it turns out, they now hang out without me. They go to parties and don't even invite me. They aquired a new group of friends - that are also my friends, but not very close - and now hang out with them more than with me. And now, when I go to their classrooms to talk to them, they're always busy, or have to be somewhere else. They take like 2 days to answer my texts. I'm sure I didn't do anything to them. And now that I let them know I'm angry and stopped putting the effort to talk to them, they ask me why I won't talk to them. Am I right? And what can I do, should I just let them go?",12Feb2020,1

Most of the time, I can ignore it and shrug it off but within the last week, drama has erupted. Someone who isn’t an employee has brought drama in and I have been blamed for it by the owner because this person doesn’t like me and has a vendetta. 

I was doing my best to shrug that off but I found out from a friend that my boss was talking about me behind my back - saying to other employees that Im the worst employee they have, I dont work, I do the bare minimum, I dont do enough to help out off the clock (lol), I cause drama, and they want to fire me. Then they let the aforementioned person (again, they dont work there. they are friends) mess with the schedule and take away all my hours,  hasn’t said a word to me about this. Only told my coworkers that they “are going to cool down and talk to me this week” despite the fact that I have literally done nothing wrong.

65,"My grandmothers funeral is in two days, and I’ve just been notified that I will be giving a speech about my grandma. 

I wasn’t too close with my grandma. I would say we were close because of how often I saw her as a little kid, rather than having a “best friend” or “she was my inspiration” type relationship. That is not to say I don’t have fond memories of her. I remember a few awesome moments I have of her, but since I moved away to a different state around 5th grade, any relevant memory is over ten years ago. So I wouldn’t know what memory to talk about, or how accurate they would be. But most of the time our relationship was kind of awkward. (Me not knowing what to talk about when I’m with her)

Honestly, I would rather not speak at her funeral, and just want to mourn, but I feel like I would be an asshole if I didn’t speak.

68,"So basically, I’m a 17 year old male and a few months ago this 15-16 year old insulted my disabled mother in front of his group of friends to be hard and act cool, all she done was ask him to stop swearing so loudly around my 2 year old niece.

I was inside at the time in the shower and when I got out I was greeted with my mother being upset that some fucker just took the piss out of her outside her house albeit maybe minor? She was in hospital for the majority of last year I would cry myself to sleep every night because I never knew if I was going to see my mother again but that’s besides the point,

I’m not a violent person believe it or not I’m a ex kick-boxer (stopped for a bit as a break then the whole situation with my mum blah had to stop) and I’m pretty well disciplined due to my heats of karate I’m a big believer in violence isn’t always the answer yeah it is for a lot of things but I feel as if the majority of the time you can shrug shit off and honestly with having the ability to kick the shit out of someone at will I don’t really get shit off people.

But this little fucker man I’ve been thinking about it for a while one of the friends he had with him texted me later that day and told me she’s sorry for what happened and gave me some insight and that she dislikes him and my initial mindset was just ignore it it’s just a small insignificant thing and besides my mum has short term memory loss from PML endured brain damage so she isn’t effected by it

But then I seen him today when my dad was driving my home from school and I don’t know what came over me but I switched everything around me went quiet I went from having a good conversation with my dad to focused straight on this guy and I stared at him for a good solid 15 seconds and said “I’m gonna break his fucking jaw” as we drove by until he was out of sight, then I snapped out and told my dad because he was confused and I mean I don’t know what to do? 

What happens if I see him on the street and I flick into this kill mode and jump him in pretty scared at the thought of that as I really don’t want drama but it just boils my fucking blood how he would take the piss out of my mother with a walking stick and a 2 year old with her for such a simple question of to stop shouting swears in front of the child.

69,"TL;DR My best friends brother made a sexual joke, I tried to get him out of my life, now he’s trying to turn everyone against me by claiming Im abusing him and getting people to sexually assault him.




I’ve never considered this person a friend. They are my BFF’s brother (or F) and I’ve always tolerated him. He’s a smart ass and always gets on my nerves.

On Thursday, he ‘jokingly?’ accused me of cheating on him with another boy in my class. This pissed me off because comments like these made everyone in my school think we were dating. After this I subtly told him I was a Lesbian, hoping he’d stop the comments. 

On Friday (aka the next day), another another boy in my class was pointing the “nut button” (for those who don’t know, its a button you press while pointing at someone to make them “ejaculate”, just stupid kid stuff) everyone, and eventually me. As soon as he pointed it at me, F said “No! Don’t make her nut thats my job!” That made me really pissed off because I told him I was gay to get him to stop, and he didn’t. Plus, I had told him months earlier that that made me uncomfortable.

Another another another boy (we’ll call him T I guess) went up to F and “sexually assaulted” F “for me”. T had just grabbed F’s butt, but in a different circumstance, where T actually felt something for F, I would consider it sexual assault. T doesn’t like F like that, and only did it to “avenge me” I guess, but I’m not sure if thats considered sexual assault. Either way I in no way asked T to do that, which will be important later.

After this, another another boy (the same one with the nut button) went through my phone and computer without my permission, showing all of my stuff to his friends and laughing. This, along with the comment, made me cry (I cry when I get angry). My teacher took me out into the hallway, and I briefly explained what happened. She let me leave early and talked to F about it. I went to one of my other teachers and asked for F’s seat to be moved.

That would have been the end of it, but no. When I got home my mom knew something was up, and made me tell her. I was supposed to go and see a musical with my BFF and F that Sunday, so my mom talked to F’s mom and said i wasn’t going unless F wasn’t going. F’s mom refused to keep F home, so we decided that I wouldn’t go. 

Eventually, F’s mom checked my BFF’s (we’ll call her B) phone, and her texts with me. In the texts, I explained the sexual assault thing, with no context. It sounded very bad, just saying “sexual assault” and nothing else. This prompted F’s mom to call my mom and ask what was going on. I explained to my mom, and she relayed the message. F’s mom was furious, saying the only reason why F said the joke was retaliation against me for the sexual assault and... calling him gay? He should have expected that, considering the fact that he told me every day about how he had married my male cousin because my male cousin had lost his rights to marry who ever he wanted in a fencing match. Thats very gay.

Anyways I didn’t end up going to the musical, but I thought that would be the end of it. Nope.

F’s mom gave F specific instructions to not talk to me. Yet he did anyways. Correcting my french project as I present it, even though he has no right too, and a few other things here and there. I just thought I would make myself clear and keep ignoring him.

Today in french class, he comes up to me at the end of the period, asking if I could move seats in biology (in the class where I had asked the teacher to move his seat away from me, because we sat right next to each other) because he has ADHD. I told him it was not my problem and to talk to the teacher. He said “it is your problem”. I said “its not my fault you didn’t leave me alone”. Then, oh boy, he says

“not my fault you told me to kill myself”

what?

I never said that to him. EVER. I used to be a pretty rude kid with no filter in elementary school. When I realized I was hurting peoples feelings, I became hyper aware about what I said. So I know for certain I never said that.

He said he would tell my teachers I said that, and turn everyone against me and walked away.

After French, we had History together. First, he tried to get another another kid (nut button kid) to sit next to me, even though he went through my stuff, and I don’t want anything to do with him anymore. He turned to my friend and said “i feel sorry for you, but not for her”, because we both had to sit next to him. I sat through the whole period, anxious, because I knew I needed to talk to him after and see why he was being such an asshole. My friend noticed something was up, so I explained to her (apparently, he was listening in on our conversation, because he texted me, saying to stop lying to (my friend)).

After class, I walked up to him and started asking why he needed to be moved to a new seat because of ADHD. He said he can’t focus in the back, though he only moved 1 row backwards and to the side. I kept asking, because it didn’t seem right, until he finally said “i have priority seating, I’m allowed to ask a teacher to move me, and make them move me there. I’m just moving there because I like sitting there better.” Great! So now your using your legitimate disability just to piss me off? Thats just pathetic. I told him straight up what he had said and how douche that was, but he just went back to his old story.

Finally, the icing on the cake. History is our last period. So as we walked to out busses, he said all of the following;

“You’re abusive!”
“You’re a bully!”
“You made T sexually assault me!”
“I hate you!”
and even more bullshit.

I’m sorry this was long, but I really need help. Should I go to my school about it? Should I ask his parents to get him to stop (again)? I’ve already tried explaining why he needs to leave me alone, but he just throws insults at me and never lets me finish talking. He’s egotistical, and thinks he’s entitled to what ever he thinks he’s getting out of this. Im scared to confront him privately, because there have been multiple instances where he has thrown things at his sister, choked her, and even call her fat to her face, when she struggles with her weight and is starting to turn anorexic. Plus, I freeze up in confrontation and go blank, not realizing whats being said until i think about it afterwords. Yes, I messed up by calling him gay, but he never said it bothered him. We both called each other gay all the time. I honestly think he’s using it and the suicide thing for sympathy points.",12Feb2020,1
70,"I've posted this on R/adviceforteens but I got no responses so I'm gonna try it here.

I've been diagnosed with anxiety and severe Depression. School demotivates me so much and I just can't go anymore. I get bullied alot and have no friends which means nobody is there to help me.

The stress school gives me is too much for me. I've tried committing Suicide before but my previous attempts have failed. I have resorted to a self harming Because there is no tiger way to relieve myself of the pain.

I started taking absences but my attendance got to about 88% which the school said was too low. They are now threatening my parents with a court case if I take more absences.

I've been put on medication yet nothing seems to work. I've gotten bullied even more since people found out I was depressed. My grades are failing. I honestly have no clue on what to do next.

I know I may just seem like a spoilt teen who is making a fuss over nothing just because she doesn't want to go to class, which I probably am, but I'm just stuck on how to proceed.

Update- the school contacted the council. Not allowed to go into details, but they keep threatening my parents with prison. They say I have had 13 absences since September which is nearly one a week. My dad tried telling them I was sick but they said they will contact the doctors. I've only been to my doctors once for physical illness as I can't really go for mental illness since they don't really do anything for that. Help",12Feb2020,1
71,"I’m at a crossroads.

I have a goal to move out of state to NYC this August , because, as ignorant as a statement, I am young and have nothing too drastic to loose. I fell in love with the city upon touch down last year, and told myself I had to live here, to find and follow “hubris” aka myself. 

I have a job that starts on the 24th of February that’s temporary, it pays 5$ more than this other job, that I may get, that starts on the 15th of March, but this other job is permanent if I pass the exams for it after a few months in.

Job A (24th), would allow me to achieve my goal faster and more comfortably than Job B (15th)providing less  room for fear and comfortability, all the while job B provides stability and longevity , but confines in state for 2 years before transferring.

I have wanted to move for years and now I am being provided outlets for doing so, I just don’t know what to do. There is the ‘smart route’ which leans towards stagnate stability, or there’s ‘rush’ route where I can save my money and move on a whim.

I’m not sure if this makes any sense whatsoever, I overthink things, I know, but my biggest fear in life is allowing myself to stay stagnate and confined to locality, resulting in an internal regret of fearing to ‘just do’. But at when and what time is ‘just doing’ ignorant, vis à vis when and where is it the right decision?

I grew up in an abusive household. I was physically beaten, mouth taped, slept in the basement, etc as growing up. I washed blood out of my own clothing. CPS got involved once, but no lasting changes. I've been in the ER for an injury, and I silently begged for help there, but nobody heard me obviously. I lived in terror. 

As an adolescent, I was abused by a family friend giving me a ride to work (14-16). His body was my first and everything about it was repulsive. 

So almost 18 years of abuse in various forms, surrounded/associated by mannerisms and language that I could ""escape"" at school. My trigger is my very own race, a sad fact of self hatred and shame. It is not intentional

I am now 34 and live in a Midwestern town. It is very non-diverse. Whenever I see an Asian, I have an automatic knee-jerk reaction of disgust. I know that it has nothing to do with Asians as a whole, but it is so engrained in me. I hate myself for this. When dating, I cant look at Asian profiles; they make me sick. 

Racism isn't actively thinking malicious thoughts, with intent. Sometimes it is just a reflexive feeling based on past experiences. I am trying. I swear. I don't have much interaction with Asians but even in grad school when I did, I thought they were inferior. My brain is just trained to view them as a threat. The only people who hurt me were similar in this way and my brain processed it this way. 

I'm sorry. I'm trying. It is not on purpose. So I do stupid things I watch YouTube videos with Asians. Right now I am watching one with a guy who has cute dog named Milky and cat named GB. It is adorable. He is funny and I watch other videos with fun and positive vibes mostly funny content. Maybe slowly I can work up to real life stuff.

82,"We have a cousin who is using our address to (try) and open credit card accounts and apply for loans using different names. She is 28 years old, orphaned, has a drug problem, living rent-free at her friend's house, and to the best of my knowledge, does not have a job yet. She has a history of ID fraud and got into legal trouble in the past due to her now ex-boyfriend manufacturing fake IDs from their apartment. She also asks me and my family for money constantly. We have been getting mail with different names from different banks / loan agencies since early last year. At first, we thought it was a mistake and we'd return the mail with a note that said ""That person does not live here"" but as the mail kept coming, and she kept asking for money, we soon made the connection that it was her. She and her mother also used to live with us before her mother, my aunt, passed away, so we *do* also get her normal mail as well. Recently, she has been using her dad's name to apply for loans and they have all been getting rejected under suspicion of ""ID fraud"". I forgot to mention that she ruined her mom's credit and put her into massive debt before she passed away. She has a problem. 

All that being said, the main problem is that we do not know how to confront her (or if we even should). She is a compulsive liar and will deny anything and everything that is thrown her way. I have been trying to document everything in the event that something with our address being connected to ID fraud/theft emerges, and it is so frustrating that we have to deal with this. We also do not want to confront her because she is, to put it bluntly, not a good human being and we worry for our safety. There is no doubt, it is her using our address, but we also do not have solid evidence linking these fraudulent mail to her. What would you guys do? Should we report it to the police? Confront her?

84,"Hello, i never did something like this before because i feel off inside my own personal limbo up there, but i feel like i will need to make decisions sooner or later, like im running out of actual time and since the internet has been a good friend of mine since i can remember, i wonder if it can help me but in this sleepless night.  
I dont want to get into detail but more like ask people that may or may not visit therapists regularly.  
If so: Why do you do it? does it help? What were your expections?  
If you dont but genuinly feel like you should ( as i do as long as i can remember): why are you not doing it?  
Sorry if i dont make any sense. What i actually want to know is: Is it okay to never get therapeutic help and manage life on your own when you are sure there is no real help another person can get you? Or is it something you should most definitely strive for.",12Feb2020,1
85,"Hello reddit, I’m (18F) I was extremely bullied during freshman year of high school by a group of kids. One of them threatened to rape me after school and that has always been the worst memory of mine during high school. I eventually transferred out and had no contact with anyone there. 

But this one girl continued to lurk on my instagram and follow me each year of high school even up until now after I graduated. She allowed her friends to bully me, dated my first boyfriend and made fun of me amongst other things. She wasn’t my friend at all during high school so it was very weird that she would keep tabs on me. 

I confronted her today and it feels like a weight has been lifted. I told her to leave me alone because we literally had nothing to do with each other when we were in high school. And it’s just all around weird that she’s watching me. She finally blocked me. Have you guys ever confronted a bully? Do you think it’s the right thing to do.",12Feb2020,1
86,"Throw away account. Very long so I apologise in advance.

So, three years ago, my parents put a large sum (around $8k) of money into my bank account to hide it from social security since it was an inheritance and my mom owed money or something. It was just to be kept until they needed it or when the whole debt situation blew over. 

I moved out of state and fell on hard times for the first year (plus did and still suffer from extreme depression where just getting up in the mornings is hard).. I started using the money to supplement my rent and bills. I did not tell them anything because I was already embarrassed with my situation and they were already trying to get me to come back home because they think I can't succeed where I am, and that the rent is too high (it's well below average, they just don't understand that rent is just a lot more than when they used to pay ((they're in their 70's.)) I'm in my 30s, have my own life here, and am still in the closet- to them- because they're homophobic. Not to mention where they live, there's literally nothing yet rent is $400 more a month. So there's no way I was going to move back home. 

The money ran out by the end of that year.

About a month ago, my mom asked for the money for an emergency.. and I made up an excuse to avoid telling her about it. 

I used to talk to her everyday because she's my world. I love my mom to death and miss her. But, I have been avoiding her and talking to her a lot less since I started using the money, just so she wouldn't have a chance to ask about it. I maybe talk to her once every two weeks now that she's asked for it back. And it's very brief filled with excuses to not be able to talk long. 

It's killing me because I miss my mom, I want to see her because I have PTO and haven't physically seen her in almost 3 years.. but there's the huge issue of this money now looming over me. My depression is at its worse to where I drink when I get home.

I had planned on replacing it but it's a large sum and could take a year to do so with my current job, after rent and bills. I could try and get a second job but I already push 50 hours with this one. I'm still severely depressed but also stressed from my main job. I've been physically ill on more than one occasion from just thinking about telling them. Christmas was when she asked for it back- that night I was throwing up and passed out in my tub. I'm staying at work longer just so I don't have to go home to think about this.

I don't know how to approach this situation. I need to rip the band-aid off and let them know. I just don't know how to go about it and how to prepare for what may happen. I don't believe there's anything legal that could be done since there's no contracts or written agreements about the money. But I'm to the point that, if it made them happy or was a solution, they could sue me. My valuables and my entire life is built on thrifted items so there's nothing of value to sell. My car is a POS barely worth the scrap. I don't qualify for loans of that amount, either. 


Thanks for reading this if you made it this far.

**tl;dr: I owe my parents a large sum of money and they don't know. They're asking for it back and I don't have it. I am dying inside by not telling them but also by not having it. I need advice on how to tell them and how to prepare for any situation as a result.**

Any advice is welcome. I am going to try crossposting this.",12Feb2020,1
88,"Before anyone suggests just moving out, or simply asking him to move out, I would love to, but it's a little bit more complicated than that. I'll use initials in my post to make it easier to follow.

I live in a 3 bedroom flat in the city along with a good friend of mine (H), and a third guy (K) who moved in around October last year after the room became vacant. H and K are from the same small town and used to be best friends as children, but have gone in very different directions since then.

As soon as K arrived in the flat, it became a struggle to live there. He's constantly being toxic, negative, angry, messy, loud, rude, aggressive, racist, sexist, homophobic, clingy, annoying, draining... I don't have enough words. As soon as he enters a room he just won't stop talking and demands all the attention with his negativity until we are forced to just hide in our rooms. On top of that he doesn't seem to have a life of his own and follows us wherever we go, so it feels like there is no escape. But as toxic as he is, he can somehow be friendly at the same time, so as of yet, it's never gotten heated enough to confront him about his actions / personality.

I've talked to H and he feels just as trapped as I do. Ultimately we'd like to find another flat together, or for K to leave. But we're not confrontational people, and K is his childhood friend. From K's point of view, they still ARE best friends. How could we possibly justify moving to another place in the same city, just not with him. Or asking him to move out.. I think it would break him, and as much as I don't like him, I wouldn't want to do that either.

Finally I can't imagine sitting him down for a serious chat would go very well either, he's not the type of person that would react well to that, but even if he somehow did take everything we said as constructive criticism, it's not like he could just change his entire personality.

If anyone has any ideas as to what we could do we would be forever grateful.",12Feb2020,1

92,"\~throwaway account

I'm a senior in high school (f) and recently my friend group broke in half. Tbh the split isn't the problem - there was a lot of toxicity and we were planning to break from this half after graduation. There were 8 of us - me, my brother (twins), 3 other girls, and 3 other boys. My friends and his merged this year when one of my good friends, lets call her S, had a breakup. Since then there's been some tension (she tried to date the lot of em) but I had thought it calmed down.

My brother M hadn't really been talking to the guys - lets call them C, J, and K - because they put him on a ""no call list"" meaning they didn't want to hang out with him. C's mom and mine had a conversation where this came out. During this convo C's mom admitted the boys blame my brother for most things that happen while they hang out at her house (they used to go almost every weekend).

Well the other day things got bad between everyone again, and I was telling my mom how S kept coming up to me all upset because M wasn't talking to her as much, and how she didn't understand why he was upset she had thrown a pencil at him. (eyeroll). At lunch she vented to C J and K (she is now dating J) and C kept saying they were ""gonna finish this' and ""take care of him"". I was talking to my mom about it, and she asked if I thought she should call the Deans up. Based on older stuff that went down this year, plus C's strangely violent attitude I said yes. (for reference C has been a little violent before - he pushed M over once during an argument. at the time we excused it as jokey but now idk). My mom explained everything going on with C J K and S to my Dean and we assumed he would monitor the situation

Well C got pulled into the Dean's and was given two weeks detention (we later found out he admitted to one sided bullying M). J texted my brother furious, blaming him for what went down and calling him pretty nasty names. My brother replied trying to explain, but instead J said they weren't friends anymore and sent him a screenshot of K agreeing. S sent a text to M and I telling us she didn't want to hang with us anymore. I tried to explain over text what happened to J (pretty much told S I didn't care whether we were friends or not), but it resorted to petty name calling and threats *again*. We all ended up in the deans office, S was sent out multiple times for being disrespectful, but otherwise everything seemed fine and he made us promise to be civil.

While in the Dean's I was going to bring up a text message S had sent to me about C's mother (bunch of lies about her, was bringing it up for relevant reasons to the larger issue) but decided to send it to C privately instead as I didn't want his mom in trouble for lies S was telling. I asked him not to tell anyone I sent it to him because I did not want any issues especially when I thought everything was OK after our conversation with the dean. Well he turns around and immediately tells S.

Now throughout this entire situation S has been spreading rumors about the group of us who split from them, including saying my brother sexually harassed her. Now, the two of them haven't really spoken since he told her he didn't want to date her, so I don't believe it (for more reasons than that but I dont want this to be too long) but her definition of sexual harassment is that he asked for nudes. Ever since C told S about my texts from him, the level of shit talking from her has gotten 10x worse. I can have up to 5 kids a day come over to tell me about the things she's saying about me and my friends.

Is there anything I can do to try and stop this situation? I've tried to bring it to the adults before and it didn't work but I don't know what else to do (and in case anyone is wondering, my parents are aware of everything)",12Feb2020,1

We’ve always been friends and hung out before since we have mutual friends within our group, but a couple months ago, we started texting more often and playing games online while talking about our lives and such. We’ve found that we have many similar interests and and even think in a lot of the same ways. I’ve been there for her, supporting her and helping to cheer her up when she needed it. She’s called me an extremely sweet and kind guy, and called me a friend for a lifetime(red flag?). She’s also been really kind in return, even declaring a ton of support for my dream as a music major. I invited her to come with me back home to visit for spring break, and she said she would love to. We’ve even talked about visiting other places together. If the relationship was to stay platonic, I would still have an amazing friend. But I have this desire to pursue something beyond just friendship. It might benefit to say that a he broke up with her ex back in October, and sometimes she brings him up, but only to say negative things about him. Even so, she’s only brought him up a handful of times and she doesn’t talk about him a lot.

106,"Apologies in advance, this might be a long one.  
There have been some really, really bizarre things going on at my job lately and the way they are being dealt with by management is making me doubt my own judgement. I genuinely feel like I am going insane and I'm convinced there is something wrong with the way I am perceiving things.

I (23/F) started a new job as a trainee dental nurse in May 2019 which started out great. I was made head nurse within 2 months and had a good relationship with the practice manager and the practice owner, who are married and run the business together.  
Although it is a very small family run business there is a high staff turnover of about 25 people in 2 years and in the last few months we have had multiple people start at 8am and walk out of the job by 9am. The practice has also employed an outside HR company to resolve any issues for them.  


In August a new employee, lets call him Steve (30/M), started at the practice as he was the younger brother of one of the dentists and was struggling to find work after moving here from India. He joined as a trainee dental nurse and I was given the task of training him.  
Within a couple of weeks it was apparent he had very poor English and would very obviously pretend to understand me when I spoke to him.  
I raised my concern with the practice manager (who is rarely on site and more often than not works from home) but she insisted he was just sloppy, but perfectly capable of understanding English.

When I told him important information about infection control etc, he would stare at me blankly until I finished talking, then chuckle and nod.  
He once came to ask me a question, which I answered then asked ""Is that okay, do you understand?"", he smiled and nodded again, then later his sister approached me and asked the same question he asked me earlier and said ""Steve said he asked you earlier but didn't understand what you said.""  
I made him a simply worded training booklet explaining all of his daily tasks to try and help him since it was obvious he was not doing things right and I would end up working up to 3 hours unpaid overtime at the end of the day to finish all of the jobs, after everyone else went home.  
One day I asked him to do the jobs on page 5 of his booklet (minor things like changing the bins in his surgery and wiping down the surfaces). I was in a rush and couldn't do it with him. He said okay, walked off and 10 minutes later reappeared looking confused. He had his booklet open on a page about tooth extraction and I had to help him turn to page 5.  
I have found him walking around the stock room with patients blood on his gloves on multiple occasions, despite me telling him this is dangerous for obvious reasons.  
I have tried so, so hard to be patient with him even when that meant having to repeat myself 10+ times with a smile on my face, then end up having to do the job myself later.  


During a more serious incident, he filled the dentists water bottle (which is sprayed into patients mouths to wash away debris during fillings) with undiluted clinical grade surface disinfectant instead of water.  
When I came into the surgery and realised what had happened, a patient was complaining his throat was ""in spasm"" and was coughing so hard he was gagging.  
I managed to get a message out to reception to contact the practice manager since I wasn't sure what to do and was concerned about the safety of the patients who had been treated.  
I later showed Steve the bottle of surface disinfectant next to the bottle of water and asked him if he could tell me the difference. He looked at both bottles, clearly labelled, and said he could not.  
When the practice manager arrived I tried to tell her what had happened but she insisted on speaking to the dentist (his sister) and I was told to let the dentist take charge of these types of situations, even though I was the only person who knew what had actually happened at that time.  
The practice manager asked the dentist if the patients were all healthy with no medical conditions, which she replied yes to, although the patient who complained of a spasming throat was on a drug called methotrexate, a common chemotherapy drug in cancer patients, among many other medications. He had already left the practice, still coughing, and was not contacted until 24 hours later.  
Steve was given a warning.

Small, daily things began to wear me down such as having to repeat myself 10+ times, finishing my jobs faster so I could then do his, being constantly frustrated and not listened to, working unpaid overtime daily and generally watching him bumble around doing nothing while I worked both our jobs. None of this has ever been acknowledged by my manager although I have asked for help on multiple occasions.  
By late September I was crying daily at work, having near daily panic attacks, trouble sleeping and began relapsing with an eating disorder I'd been in recovery from for 5 years. I was signed off for 5 weeks by my doctor who suggested I may have had a nervous breakdown. I was put on the maximum dosage of antidepressants, sleeping tablets and beta blockers, none of which I have ever taken in my life.

I came back to work and things had just continued to deteriorate.  
Steve recently asked me how to tell if his instruments were sterile as he couldn't understand the sterilisation machine - after he had worked there for 5 months.  
I began physically showing him how to do things again as I knew he couldn't understand verbal communication, however this did not work either.  
All surgeries apart from my own were becoming so disorganised as so many things went missing that the practice owner suggested that I should start doing random bin checks and daily instrument counts to make sure Steve wasn't throwing things away (he has been known to do this).  
Steve also began talking to me rudely, telling me I'm not in charge of everything, walking off while I tried to give him another help sheet etc.  


I have a close relationship with the practice owner as he is the dentist I work with on a daily basis, and one day he was venting about Steve and told me he had recently taken a Fuctional English exam and failed, his exact words were ""He cant even speak fucking English, he failed his exam!"".

Over the next few days basically things got on top of me and I took an overdose and tried to kill myself. I was signed off work with stress again.  
A few days later work contacted me and asked for a meeting with HR. I told them I was struggling with Steve and especially with his new attitude. They told me he was probably only rude to me because I had already been rude to him, I am just nitpicking and I just need to leave him alone. They have told me they want me to consent to them seeing my full medical report from my doctor and want me to have a meeting with Occupational Health to determine whether I am fit to work.  
Although I have tried to tell them that Steve's lack of capability has been difficult and has a huge knock on effect throughout the practice, I am the only person who works with him on a daily basis so nobody else sees what his job performance is like, except for his sister.  
Everyone is now insisting Steve can speak perfect English and probably only made the mistake with the surface disinfectant and was unable to read the steriliser because he was having a ""busy day"".  


Before I returned to work on Monday I received an email from HR saying that I am not to have anything to do with Steve and not involve myself with any of his tasks, to be professional and courteous to all staff and patients and work as part of the team, and any unacceptable behavior will be dealt with as a disciplinary matter.   
The day before I tried to kill myself I brought in muffins for everyone, took some of receptions workload because I thought they seemed busy, then worked 10 minutes after everyone else while reception finished early to roll their cigarettes and chat, which happens daily. This was an average day and gives a pretty good idea of how hard I work, making that email feel like a bit of a slap in the face. 

On my first day back the receptionists both gave me the silent treatment. The day I tried to kill myself I went home during lunch and woke up in hospital the next day, so I'm assuming they had to cancel on patients who were already at the surgery and may have been angry at them. I can understand that, but they also know I've been having mental health problems. I made them both coffee to try and break the ice a bit but still more silent treatment. 

At the end of the day I left and text my manager saying I wont be in for the rest of this week and will be contacting my doctor and will keep her updated. She hasn't replied.

Please be serious with me, I am not looking for sympathy or agreement. I genuinely feel like I am going insane because surely this scenario can't be real, surely for people to be behaving like this towards me there must be a reason?   
My friends and family all think I am right, but they are only hearing things from my perspective. I have tried to be objective as possible but I really don't trust my own perception of things anymore.

I used to be so happy before starting this job, if people didn't know my name I would often be described as ""the girl who's always smiling"" and now I am crying at least daily and still on 3 types of different medications. I try really, really hard to be as kind as possible all the time and am known for being the type of person who can't do enough for others.

I kind of feel like my mental illness is being used as a scapegoat to dismiss everyone else's poor behaviour but I as I said I don't trust myself.

We got passed all of this and moved in together and got married. 3 years now later I was uploading pictures from my phone onto his laptop which he told me to bc I thought I had deleted pictures from a trip and they would show up there. Well I found pictures of him and her and it shows him cheating on me more then I knew even after she had lost the baby while he was with me. Maybe this was in the past but I'm not so sure i can trust him. And i havnt said a word but its killing me and i have already been diagnosed with major depression in the last 2 weeks.

I care for him deeply and I know he is the way he is because he’s deeply fucked up. We came from similar pasts and I know how he evolved into this but he seems willing to change.

118,"My father is a sperm donor and I have been aware of this since I was about 12 years old. Recently, through ancestry.com, I was able to get in contact with my donor’s brother who was able to identify 9 of my half-siblings using ancestry and 23andme. 

Before talking to me, he had been in contact with 2 of my half-siblings so I knew concretely that they were also aware that their father is a sperm donor. I reached out to both of them and it went really well so I would love to talk to more of them.

My fear in reaching out though is that these other half-siblings are not aware that they are donor babies. I would hate to harm a family relationship by revealing to someone that the father who raised them is not actually biologically related to them.

The other 7 half-siblings the brother identified have all used some kind of dna testing site so they have to have some idea that their dna matches are kinda wonky. All of my half-siblings have come up in the “Close relatives” section of my ancestry results. But the explanation for close relatives on ancestry includes aunts/uncles, half-siblings, grandparents, and sometimes first cousins. 

I had a lot of close relatives I had never heard of so it was easy to assume they were related to my donor and I can only assume that the other half-siblings have the same results of people considered close relatives that consists of people they had never heard of.

I have all of their names and I have found social media profiles on most of them. We definitely look alike and their ages fall in line with when our donor was active with the sperm bank so I can be fairly certain that I have the right people. 

I really want to reach out to them but it’s definitely an ethical dilemma of possibly revealing a family secret. I’m not sure how to go about approaching them because of this and would like some advice about how to do so, or if I even should.


IN SHORT: would it be wrong to reach out to my donor siblings without knowing if they are aware of their status as a donor baby???",12Feb2020,1

121,"My school is changing everything for the worse.

They are forcing people to stay in their fine arts track for two years, they are taking away study hall from freshmen and sophomores, they aren’t letting students manage teams for sports credit, amongst other things. 

I am part of the minority at my school.
I’m too dumb for honors and too smart for regular classes.
I am incredibly passionate about Latin.
I am the lead female singer of the school cover band.
I am gay and I freely talk about the girls I like with guys.

My school has gotten rid of a few things that affect me.
AP Latin,  protective rules for LGBT students, track team management, and worst of all, the cover band that I’m in.

I know the cover band thing may not be too big of a deal, just sign up for school of rock or something.

But my friends and I are in love with it. Most of us have been dreaming of being in this band since 6th grade (school is 6-12). We are good at what we do and we don’t affect anyone. Still they got rid of our class. 

When we got the news, even the most stoic guy in class started crying. We were all devastated and the administration will not let us appeal to get our band back.

I want to strike back. My parents have me under a vice so I can’t explicitly say “fuck this school”.  Changing schools is out of the question. 

My punk opinion is to toss Molotov cocktail in the place and do something really dramatic that involves multiple profanities.

I unfortunately can’t do that because I go to a Christian private school and they will definitely expel my ass. 

The school has arranged multiple town halls to get our opinion, but they’re biased. They only invite the students who are happy with the school as it is. I know this because the dean deliberately did not inform people who are vocal about their problems with the school about the town hall. That includes me and the entire band and most of the LGBT students at school (i know this because we have to watch out for each other).

So the recent email to parents says that most students are happy with the new changes to the curriculum. Super wrong.

I am a sophomore with zero power. I have no way to speak out against this without facing punishment for speakin my mind and bullying for actually sticking out and not going along with this.

I don’t know if any of you have had to deal with an oppressive private Christian school in the heart of republican Texas, but please if you have any advice, I really need it",12Feb2020,1
123,"What's on my mind? 
What isn't? 
If you can answer a question with another question who's to say that's not an answer? 
Who's to say the problem isn't that we can't find an answer, it's that there is never just one, but many? 
If you want to find your own path you've got to pave it yourself. 
We're so quick to get discouraged when we realize the knowledge everyone else seems to have mirrors our own, but how could you possibly expect to learn something truly new if the only knowledge you seek is what's already been found?
You want to be different, you have to BE different. 
You want to be different, right?
You want to make a difference right? 
In some way, shape, or form.. 
And if you don't, you must want peace right? 
If the knowledge we have, mirrors the knowledge of millions, wouldn't you think that contradicts the desire to be different? 
To be seen, heard, felt. 
It's not to be different that you're searching for, you feel the way you do when you do because you are different, even if you don't see it. 
Somewhere in you there's always going to be something you want, there will always be a million reasons to let it go, but I'm sure if you think deep enough there's another million reasons to reach for it. 
There will always be an equal argument to everything you believe in. 
You are meant to stand for what you believe in, but somewhere in that context they forgot to remind us that not everyone's beliefs mirror ours.. mind you I said beliefs not knowledge.
The problem never truly lies within the problem, it lies within your response to it. 
Whether it be race, sex, religion, sexual preferences (or none at all), any and every ""problem"" you may find you face 
We weren't taught problem solving because everything in life was easy, but exactly the opposite. 
I find that many of the things I preach are advice I either once couldn't, or can't take now. 
Today I found, who am I to say any of you are wrong? 
Well, who are you to say I am? Any of you.
We we're always told to ask questions, so we did exactly the opposite, because we're always told the answer lies within, it may, but who's to say your answer is the only one?
Everyone is still trying to find out who they are, if you're still trying, you'll die trying. 
Why? Because what you once knew may be looked at in a different light tomorrow? 
If knowledge is power then we all have power, we're all just trying to figure out how to use it.
I'm not here to change your mind, I challenge you to change mine.

133,"Now, to preface this statement, i actually was cool with this woman for the first few months of living with her and i still get along fairly well with her to avoid any issues with my roommate over her. The problem is that she initially moved in with the intention of having my roommate help her get back on her feet to get a new place.  It became very apparent, however, that her plan was the complete opposite. From the moment she moved in, she ordered things non-stop online like clothes and makeup products and air pods and bought  dishes to put in our kitchen, which, at the time i considered to be a kind act by her but i hadn't realized that may have been indicative of her intentions of not moving out at all. Fast forward 2 months into her living here and she bought a BRAND NEW 2019 car that costs her over $400 a month before she quit her decent paying job for a job that pays only $10/hr (so this car is more than a quarter of her income) so she pays for nothing but the dog food in the house and the utilities (which are pretty cheap out here per month). Now, i understand that people make mistakes and I'm sympathetic to that fact, however, i can't shake the impression that this girl has manipulated my friend entirely and even he has told me that she is an absolute narcissist once. I guess I'd just like some perspective on this. I don't really have any control over the situation and frankly i don't want any control over it, but i can't be blind to the manipulation. This girl has even attempted manipulative tactics towards me that i called her out on such as asking my other roommate (who agrees that her behavior is horribly manipulative) to go dog food for her, which SHE was responsible for, when he doesn't have a car, which means he'll ask me to take him rather than her asking me, which if she had asked me, i would've been much more ok with it.

Recently, I have become good friends with a girl, lets call her Laurie.

None of this was a shock to me. Her health was declining before the cancer diagnosis, so when I found out it really just felt like ""oh ok, another health problem"" and wasn't shocking. She's been in treatment for a long time (a couple years), and I guess I always I felt like it wasn't going to work, so when it didn't and they decided to stop treatment, I also wasn't surprised. Honestly I was already thinking stopping chemo was probably the best thing for her. 

Through all of this I haven't really ever felt upset or sad. I haven't been close to my mom since I was a pre-teen (I'm 23 now) just because our personalities don't really mesh. I just never really found her pleasant to be around and we have nothing in common. She's never been abusive, I just didn't like her I suppose. When I lived at home, I often wished me and my dad could go to dinner or to a movie by ourselves because I'm much closer to him. Many times I've wished my mom was more like my friends' moms because I liked them as people a lot more. I don't really talk to her at all, and she also never texts or calls me, so I'm not ignoring her or brushing her off or anything. 

I feel like I'm a horrible person for just not being sad about this. I know she's dying and she probably won't live for another year, but when I think about it, I just feel nothing. For the last several years, I've felt that I'm very apathetic in general, in that I rarely feel very strong emotions and when I do they don't last, especially happiness or other positive emotions. I've wondered before if that's a sign of depression, but I've never spoken to a doctor about it, so I don't know. 

I'm just worried that this isn't normal I guess. I wasn't close to my grandparents who have passed away so I've never really experienced death like this before. Maybe all the feelings will hit when the time comes, but maybe they won't and I'll still feel like a freak. Should I talk to a counselor about this even though I feel fine? Or just accept how I feel as something I can't really change?",12Feb2020,1

I [14F] really, really want to spend the night with an internet friend [14F] (let's call her K for now) I had recently met at a convention a few months ago, but haven’t seen since. I desperately want to go, but I don’t know how to convince my mom. K and I and one of my other friends (who my mom does know, and whom I have spent the night with before. Let's call her R) have been talking online ever since, and she brought up a free convention in our area. My mother had said previously I couldn’t go because she already had plans, and she didn’t want to drive me around all day, so I thought me spending the night at K’s would be a good compromise, and K had also invited R. But my mom doesn't want to leave me at someone's house who she doesn't know, and whom she thinks I met solely on the internet, for some pretty obvious reasons, plus she lives fairly far away.

157,"After our manager left 6 months ago, the owner of our vet practice took over most of her responsibilities, and does not want to hire a new manager. I understand this, but as the most senior receptionist, I am concerned that we will continue to have problems with reception, as she can't really come into the lobby so we are very sectioned off, and there is no one in a position of authority. I wish she would give me a bit more authority, or at least someone.

She has been very frustrated regarding the receptionists, because of the ongoing issues with many of them, and recently fired someone who was often sick, which would leave us short staffed, and also hired someone new. This is good because all of the receptionists have been incredibly over-stressed, both at trying to do the same amount of work with less people, and because she and the other staff are often frustrated at the receptionists. I've been trying to stay involved, but often I've found she gets stressed and frustrated when I try to ask her what is going on sometimes, because she is so busy. So I've tried to take a step back. 

My present concern is that there are a number of days coming up that will be very busy and we will not have enough people. I don't think there is any plan for that. This weekend I am especially worried about. It's supposed to be my weekend off, and I was going to celebrate Valentine's Day with my boyfriend. I don't know if I should try to bring this upcoming shortage to her attention or not. If I do, I may be asked to work on my weekend off, when I've already had a very long stressful week. I feel like I often go out of my way to try to take charge and work things out and make sacrifices like this, and I would really like a small title bump and raise if I continue to do this kind of stuff, and perhaps some credit. I feel like since there is all this frustration with the reception staff this has extended to me even though I have not caused any problems and do my best to solve them. I feel that if I come forward with this problem and work this weekend, it will won't really be very appreciated and the bigger problem may be ignored.

If I don't bring up my concerns, I'm worried my employer won't realize how much being so short staffed will effect this weekend, and it may make for a very stressful weekend for everyone that works. Or she might realize later in the week and want someone to come in anyway, and that will probably fall to me as no one else will want to come in. I also feel maybe being short staffed this weekend will finally show everyone that we need to plan better, and that we can't just keep leaving reception short on people, and that we need to have someone have a bit more authority. But I don't want things to have to be difficult to have that point hit home.

Should I bring this to her attention and sacrifice my weekend even if it's likely no one will appreciate it and still no one will understand why it's important to keep reception fully staffed? Or should I just assume since I am not management that this has all been worked out?",12Feb2020,1

I just wanted to have some advice in how I can gain weight and probably muscle too. I am 16 years old, 193cm tall and weight 68.5 kg.

I play soccer as a goalkeeper 4 times a week (Mon-Thu), practicing for 80-100 minutes two days and 140-160 the other two days.

Anyways, I wanted to know some exercises that I could do in the gym or house and eating tips so that I can increase my weight.

165,"So im trying to leave out the long details.. ive been pretty isolated from people most of my life, im now 28M and struggling to just talk to people I feel like. I mostly only get along with women which is also really hard when I am in a relationship (not atm) because my half of ex girlfriends all thought I was cheating on them with my friends/co-workers when nothing was going on, I lost most of my friends a long time ago because of the drama. I know I should have just dumped the mas the saying goes bros before hoes but I was dumb.

Anyways.. I like just having a small group of friends but I like to talk to those people A LOT, I feel like this annoys most people? My favorite things to do are just play video games while chatting about random stupid shit that happened in our day or just talk back and forth about problems or bounce ideas off each other. I also like to play sports but cant find anyone my age who does that anymore, or even just go for a walk and talk about stuff..

Problem is I like asking people what they like to do or talk back and forth about stuff that happened throughout the week (I guess thats gossip?) even if its kind of bad things and people dont seem to like that anymore? Im not trying to dump my problems on people I feel like to me thats a meaningful conversation and its not just about me im trying to talk about them as well, however people dont like to talk about that stuff at all ive noticed... Even with the few friends I still have its gotten to the point where I ask them how their day was and they just reply ""good"" and wont say anything else so thats just the end of the conversation.

its gotten to the point where I feel like I dont even know what people talk about with their friends anymore, the one friend I have mostly just looks at memes all day and when he comes over he sits on my bed looking at memes on his phone and then I awkwardly sit in my computer chair a few feet away and dont know what to do.

166,"Ok so basically to start this shit off I haven't spoken to one of my favorite friends of 6 years in weeks even though we sit together on the bus and at the same lunch table. The first day I started not saying anything, was because the night before I got screamed at by my mom along with other shit and had one of the worst panic attacks of my life (I was hyperventilating and crying so hard to the point where I physically couldn't speak for over an hour and my face and hands went completely numb to the point where I could hardly use my hands either along with other things so ngl that shit was kinda traumatic). Since then I've been pretty much constantly depressed and more anxious than normal, along with almost constantly feeling like absolute shit. (Also btw I should probably note this didn't all happen soley because my mom yelled at me there's more to it.) Literally the only full two days I was happy tho was when I got to see one of my favorite bands, korn, live which was actually really fucking amazing to be able to do but that's besides the point. So basically this is gonna sound stupid but I've just been way too fucking demotivated and depressed and anxious and shit to try to talk to him again even tho I really want to and he hasn't made even the slightest effort to talk to me either. I should also note that this happened before, awhile ago, and I texted him asking if he even wanted to talk to me anymore because he wasn't talking to me along with other shit like for example taking up to 3 days to reply to me when I text him and constantly seeming bored around me. In said text I told him why I wasn't talking, which was because I was in a shit mental state, but also said I wanted to talk but was just too anxious and was hoping he would talk to me so I didn't have to lead entire conversations. He replied to that with something along the lines of, of course not I just thought you didn't want to talk because you weren't talking. So idk if he just thinks I don't want to talk again even tho I explicetly stated that I want to talk to him?? Or if he just doesn't want to talk to me?? Or if he doesn't wanna bother me?? I know I should just talk to him about it again but everytime I plan to my anxiety fuckin skyrockets and I just pussy the fuck out. So how should I approach him about this and figure out how to control my anxiety while doing so? My mom does this thing where she limits data use on my phone at 9:30 every night since she refuses to believe that I go to bed at a good time which is in like 5 minutes so if anyone is takes the time to respond to this, which I would greatly appreciate, I probably won't respond or anything until tomorrow.

172,"I am the senior most receptionist at the lovely vet hospital I work at, and after the manager quit 6 months ago, the owner/head vet took over. She did give me a small raise and a bit more responsibility at that time, which was very much appreciated. However, I've been trying really hard to keep things running smoothly, and I have been really hoping for another raise and a title bump.

At first I felt my efforts were being noticed, but since the owner can't come up to the reception area, and I don't have any authority, there have naturally been a lot of problems still. I think she hoped they would taper off, and they haven't, and she's been over worked and on edge. Lately, having to deal with so many issues regarding reception, she and the other staff have felt very negatively about the reception staff, even though it's just a few people creating the problems.

I don't think there is any getting around the fact that someone that can be in the reception area needs to have some authority. I also feel like I take care of some things that no one else does/can, and although I make a dollar or two an hour more than most of the receptionists, I've also been there longer, and I would really like a raise if I am going to be doing these things and more. I also wish I was consulted more. I understand if she doesn't want me doing it, but someone should be at least I feel.

I've been trying to take a teeny step back from bugging her with stuff, but still take care of things when I can in the background, and letting her take charge of the management things without interference or trying to be consulted. But things are still not going well. And all I hear lately is how bad reception is, and I don't think anyone notices or cares what I do, only that reception still has so many problems, but I don't think it's fair to expect me to be able to fix that because I am not in a position of authority at all. I don't know what to do.

Should I talk to her and risk sounding ungrateful and frustrating her with bringing up more things she should do and decide about regarding the receptionists, or should I take a step back and hope she sees what I mean, or should I keep doing what I can behind the scenes and hope it is noticed?",12Feb2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

* I broke up with bf of 2 years, Mike, as I wasn't fully happy, he told a few lies, wasn't listening, and needed space to think. This was when Mike was on a 1-month overseas trip as I had tried before but Mike would ""sway"" me.
* Mike harassed me using explicit photos/ videos to try to get me back. E.g. he was reluctant to delete my photos and out of the blue sent me a very explicit video with ""should I delete this too?"", ""you're making me do bad things"". He later said he was so hurt because I broke up when he was away and feeling alone.
* I was no contact with Mike, took MDMA at a music festival. I believe I had some kind of psychosis for weeks after. I am normally very sane but started believing the angels were talking to me, doing witchcraft spells, scrawling nonsense in a diary, not sleeping, etc.
* At the festival, I met Mike's friend, John, \[20M\], and then talked to him online for 2 weeks. He was over the to nice, understanding, and reassured me he would not tell anyone what I told him. I told him about how Mike had harassed me. I met up with him, got very drunk and made out with him with light fondling.
* John had some kind of vendetta with Mike and told their entire friend circle about Mike's harassment and us hooking up. No one told Mike. I found out, and after 2 more weeks, came out of psychosis gradually, instantly felt horrible and told everything to Mike. Mike was humiliated and felt I betrayed his trust. At the time, I felt like I didn't owe Mike to not talk to John but I now know this genuinely wasn't really me.
* How do Mike and I move forward? We both want to be friends. We are both young/ figuring things out right now but years down the track I can see us being more.

I can see how ""psychotic break"" seems like a convenient excuse, but that is not who I am as a person at all and I have random scrawlings I made, etc. as ""proof"".",12Feb2020,1

189,"Title says it all. I don't relate to my friends. I have friends in and out of school and out, I'm not a social outcast or anything. I like them, but sometimes they just act in ways that put me right off them entirely. They're not terrible people, but I just don't fully connect with them like they do with each other: I can never be content with them

I went to a summer camp in Italy last year and this year too, and there I met amazing people. People whom I absolutely connected with. Friends that I love and cherish. Honest, direct, caring and funny friends. It's been the best experience of my life. After the first year, I met with some friends again at the camp this year. Problem is that I live in Scotland, and these amazing people are  hundreds of miles away. We keep in touch, but these are the people I want to live near.

I can't really articulate the problem I have here at home properly. Everyone here just seem to be so snide at heart. Very roundabout in their means of getting what they want. They're alright friends but I know they'd trample over the top of you to get what they want. I've seen it, I think it's where I live because I've seen adults alike act and think the exact same. I don't know if any of you empathise with what I'm saying, I hope you do.

It's a massive problem because I feel so so so alone. So isolated. Nobody cares, not really. I can't talk to anyone about it because there's nothing they can do, I've tried. My only fucking consolation at all in life is texting those cherished mates from holiday. 

I don't know if I've done myself any justice in this post to be understood, but all your support is dearly appreciated.

TL;DR: I can't connect to anyone where I live on a personal level. Everyone I do connect with live far far away (not via internet, via Summer camp)",12Feb2020,1
191,"i've been on a never ending journey of becoming true to myself, but today i've hit a huge realization that almost everything i do has been done or said by everyone else and i've just picked it up. it's not always bad, for instance i've discovered a huge passion and gift for music because of it. how do i come to terms being genuine to myself and stop copying others? i pick up small habits, or ways of thinking from others and become jealous when i don't have and act a certain way, subconsciously i become whatever i'm jealous of almost always. i struggle unlocking any creativity usually because of this.",12Feb2020,1
192,"I need help asap. I've met someone who is am so attracted to. Her mind is beautiful, her body is beautiful, and pretty much everything I can think of about her is beautiful. Over the past few months we have become very close. So close that it's obvious to our friends and colleagues think something more should be going on. Truthfully I feel like I want to give this person everything I have to offer. I can feel that she wants the same, but is being reclusive because she has a boyfriend. Now this looks bad, but between them it's an unhealthy off and on relationship that is clearly going nowhere. They break up every other week and it's longish distance. I've been a good boy and have been semi-reapectful of the relationship..There is a massive dilemma. She just got kicked out of her parents house here and she has nothing else to do but move in with him 200 miles away. Quitting her job and everything. This feels like a once in a lifetime connection that we have, and I've said everything I can to her without overstepping boundaries. Do I just let her do this and not get in the way? What else can I do? She clearly wants more from me in terms of our relationship, but I think she feels like she is stuck between a rock and a hard place and needs to move because she has nowhere else to go. It's fucked up, and I can only imagine what's going on in her head. Anyway I just want to know what I should do. I'm seeing her for the last time tomorrow and am really nervous as to what I should say...help.",12Feb2020,1

194,"Him &amp; I broke up a long time and I still haven’t moved on
We both fucked up a lot. But I was super immature and young and DUMB and did more. And I just wish I met him now. I’ve grown so much and learned so much.. but I know that’s obviously not possible. 
I want to move on, I know he’s moved on completely. I don’t know how I can or why I haven’t. 
We speak here and there. We spoke last a couple months ago and we talked on the phone ALL night literally. But after that it’s just brief like happy bday and one check in, that’s it. 

He was my first bf, love, and time. So idk if that’s why it’s so hard? Idk. He’s several years older so he has experience and none of that matters to him anyway. 

I just don’t know what to do. How to move on? Should I call him and get everything I feel off my chest? Will that help?

Or just keep going how I’m going? It’s just as painful as the first couple months after we broke up, I am losing my shit. Tired of this shit",12Feb2020,1
195,"I’ll try to make this as short as possible. I’m a 36 year old woman who has spent the better part of half her life sick with ulcerative colitis and anxiety. Recently I’ve pulled myself out of a health crises that almost took my life. That crises created emotions and resentment in my family, mostly from my three younger sisters. During that time I had essentially no support from them. If anything they acted up more. The toxicity it created along with their lack of support and immaturity resulted in me sleeping on the floor of the empty apartment above my home. All of my sisters are within ages of understanding. I decided for my own sanity that I would just forgive and move on. I learned that attempting any form of communication from them to get understanding and apologies just ended up in screaming matches where they brought up my past health and blamed me for stuff. Example I carry the blame of one of my sisters drinking problems because she was upset my parents attention was on me. Instead of getting an apology the victim card gets pulled and I’m more of a villain than before. 


Now that I’m back on my feet again I work really hard from home and managed to meet an amazing man who has been part of my life for 4 years. We’ve been engaged for 1 year now. Finally after all the suffering  and anger of watching my friends and family go off into the sunset with their careers, weddings, pregnancies and homes ... I felt slightly human again with being engaged. Sure starting life at 36 isn’t favorable but I’m grateful to be here and have the chance. 

I’m still too sick to work a real physical 9-5 job. Because I do not work in a stable job none of my family members take me serious. I do not have a voice and half the time I’m invisible. Anytime I talk about having hopes and dreams it’s not even acknowledged or somehow I end up hearing patronizing tones in response. I became the family punching bag too. It makes me feel mentally sick. 

My now 30 year old sister got married 5 years ago while I was in the midst of my crises. She had a huge beautiful wedding and was gifted a gorgeous new 2 story house that most people could only dream of living in. Guest rooms, marble bathrooms with heated floors etc etc. My parents were so happy for her and they had holiday get togethers there. It tormented me because yeah I was jealous. 

So then it was just my 27 year old sister and I cramped up in my parents basement. She wasn’t in any rush to move out. So every night she made me miserable by coming home drunk and stomping and talking on her phone. She loved smoking pot and would smoke joint anytime she pleased even though I would instantly feel sick from it. We would fight daily and my mom would scream at me blaming me for her chest pain instead of telling my sister drug use wasn’t acceptable in the house. Common sense and courtesy wasn’t something I was allowed to have. Eventually she meets a really nice man and she lucks out. My family allows her to go live in my late grandmothers apartment above us. 3 bedrooms all newly renovated at a really discounted rent price. 

The basement was left behind for me. Both my sisters only took what they wanted and left their actual garbage and furniture behind as my responsibility to get rid of. Over the course of a year pipes broke multiple times, black mold crept into the bathroom and I fought with my parents to get help fixing it. No one was in a rush for me. It took over a year to get the bathroom fixed and now I’m living with no kitchen. All I hear about are my sisters lives and new apartment features. 

My parents own multiple properties but share half with my extremely wealthy aunt. Because I do not have what is considered a real paycheck coming in I’m not even considered for anything besides the basement I’m in. I’m not looking for free hand outs but my fiancé and I can easily afford the rent my sister is paying. I just wasn’t considered for the place because I’m me lol. 


The past month my married sister went through hell with my brother in law. She discovered so much and lost everything. She’s living in my parents dining room. They’re likely to get a divorce. I’m upset for her and have tried to be by her side. She owns a cat and needs an apartment to stay right away. My mother came up with the idea of evicting one of their tenants down the block and having my fiancé and I move in and my sister can take the basement. I’d pay a set amount of rent and she would pay the remaining amount so the original rent fee would be covered. I live in NYC. Rent is expensive. 

So for the first time in my entire miserable life I feel happiness. I also feel guilt because my happiness and future relies on my sister’s divorce. The past few days I’ve cried nonstop because having these hopeful feelings during this time is a complete mind fu*k. Then all the pain of my past and treatment from my sisters comes back to the surface and I feel anger. Juggling emotion after emotion all day is making me feel like I’m going to snap. 

My only chance of happiness and a normal life is to have this opportunity. The cheaper rent will allow my fiancé to take care of me when my sales percentages change. At 36 my lifelong dreams of a normal life, marriage and all that .. the window of my young years is closing. The basement I’m in is tiny and since I word from home the rooms are full of inventory. 

Now I just wait and see what happens to my poor sister, hope my aunt agrees and try not to have a mental break down while waiting. 

The advice I need it to be told that my negative thoughts and wishes aren’t evil or wrong and that it’s ok to feel happiness during a time like this. How would you feel?",12Feb2020,1
196,"First off, I want to say that my cousins have been a big help. I’ve learned and felt so much better while here. I do have lots of stress but from things that are not caused by them. I’ve become a better person and am excited to go back to college. 

Just a few hours ago, we got into a fight. They were telling me I’m doing a good job at being productive and getting things done but I have stuff to work on.

Like 1, no shoes in the house. 2, clean my room and clean my mess and other small house rules they have. Granted, I am very good at cleaning my mess but a lot of the other things I’m not good at (cleaning my room).

But here’s the thing, I feel like they want to control me and make me do whatever they want. I have been running errands for them since I’ve been here cause they let me stay here rent free but I feel now they are just using me. Maybe that’s from my dad, who was and probably still is (he says he’s changing now but idk) abusive and very controlling. Deep down I feel like they just want me to have etiquette, which is good but at the same time, I feel like they want to control because of my dad. Are they or am I wrong. If so, how can I get the idea of them wanting to control me out of my head because I do want to be a better person.",12Feb2020,1

199,"So this is some background. So, I recently married my husband, we dated for 6 years in a long distance relationship. Sometimes he visited me until 2018 he moved permanetly with me. We married the past december. 
His mom and dad came and we got along with my parents. They both stayed in my new apartment for my married life because i had no other space where to receive guests. I slept for 2 weeks in the floor of my mom living room and my husband with my brothers.

The day we married she got sad and cried because the adrenaline and emotion over the top for both of us had some mistakes in our speechs. She felt very bad for it. We didnt do alot, we tought it was her sadness about seeing his son marry and that she would get over it like every mom does.

So, I go to my honeymoon for 3 days and cameback to my mom house, my mother was concerned, mother in law said stuff in a passive agressive ways saying my mom ""taked his son from her"". 

Well, they go after another week of me sleeping in the floor with other women and little sisters. 

After the wedding that mother in law is non stop texting me. Asking me why we dont move out to her state, and trying to make me travel in vacation days to spend with them.
I dont have the money, i still have to buy furniture for my house but this woman is non stop.
At first i really tried to empathize but i can no longer tolerate it.

She ask if i will sleep with my mom, and that me and my husband should not sleept together to not infect each other of cold. She trys to pish me to sleep with my mom or stay with my mom and let my husband alone in our house

She says she is depressed and i tell her she should go to therapy and look for his husband support. 
And recently theyre using my husband grandmother to make him comeback, making him think she may die and he should visit her before it. 

We donthave the money. We are trying to go along with our daily task and needs.
I feelt concerned a bit, i never saw such family before, or such mom, because my father in law actually told us he was happy to see his son working to build up a family unlike my mother in law who feels like a woman who had a spoiled childhood, and cant let go his son. 

Maybe i am wrong, but this has been for 6 years and doesnt seem enough time to wrap his head about it.
Is she obssesed with her child? 
I would love to have insight.",12Feb2020,1
200,"To explain the situation: my sister has struggled with depression and mental health for a while. I feel like this has been one of the root causes for a lot of her struggles, either with physical health or caring for herself. 

She's still living at home for free with our parents while working part time in retail despite having a college degree. She's not earning anywhere near enough to make a dent in the loans she took out (took a couple more years to finish), and is trying to pursue a professional degree but is also taking longer than anticipated with that. I suggested to her to stop working while she's in school, since that should be her priority, but she didn't listen and likes to earn whatever pocket change to spend frivolously. This has placed a lot of stress on my parents, who have to pick up the loan repayments for now since she can't really afford them, although she has started paying some of the interest. Since she's turning 26 soon, she is also not going to be covered on our parents' health insurance any longer, which she'll need for some of the medications she's on (and just to be in a good spot overall).

My family and I have recently tried to switch our approach of lecturing her/telling her what to do (nothing ever stuck with that approach) to being much more supportive. For example, since she hardly cleans her room, I spent some time to clean part of it with her to get her started (I've been depressed and know how much of an impact your living space has on your mental health), but it soon went back to how it was. Whenever the inevitable serious discussion about health or finances or the future in general comes up, she gets annoyed/shuts us out/changes the topic. My mom gets very frustrated at this, and rightfully so since she picks up a lot of the emotional and financial burden. It's very hard for me to see this dynamic because it's like my sister doesn't care or notice how much my mom does for the whole family. 

I love my sister and my family a lot, so I'm trying my best to help everyone. I've also realized that we all get old eventually, so in a way there's a time limit on when to act. Like my parents, I just want to see my sister become independent enough to where if something happened to the rest of us, she would be fine. I've already moved out so it's harder to play an active role in helping. I am scared that, if something does happen to our parents, she would rely on me heavily to pick up whatever my mom is currently taking care of. Of course I would help her, but at the expense of my own financial goals, much like how my mom had to put hers on hold.

I know that it's her life and she has to learn eventually by herself, and my attitude has shifted from disdain to acceptance, but it's still painful to see the toll her behavior takes on the rest of our family. I was just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and how they got themselves/someone they knew to invest more in themselves. We all care about her a lot, which is why we want to see her succeed regardless of what she ends up doing.

TL;DR: Sister has had long-standing mental health issues, places a lot of emotional/financial strain on parents. What can we do to help her help herself? Specific ways to support someone without doing something completely for them?",12Feb2020,1
201,"When I was 18 I was head over heels for this girl who I had been friends with for a while. She was 23 at the time. 

When we dated it was a mess. And it ended cause we were having fights and I was cussing her out. After the breakup she rubbed it in my face how she’s with someone else. Just a mess. 

Been like 2 years now. And as life goes she is a client at my job. And I was assigned her case. Every month I have an appointment with her. 

When I see her I am professional and always try to be kind. If I see her around our work and I’m not working with her I’ll stop and say hi as well. 

I haven’t been with anyone else for past 2 years. I feel like I should apologize again. Or just leave it?",12Feb2020,1
202,"Hello wonderful people, today was good, and I came home to talk to some of my friends on Discord. I decided to look for a quote in the search history of the Discord server from someone because it was relevant to the topic. Now I've known these people for four to five years now and had lots of good times with them, I recently got back from my LDS mission last year and they added me to their discord since it was something that came out on my mission, now, I don't really talk about my beliefs or influence them in any way and they're not of my religion whatsoever, so this has never been an issue. Anyways I stumbled upon some old conversations months before I joined the discord server, and they were talking about how dull and an 'irritable of a person' I am I have a quote, (I replaced my name on the server with my Reddit name)  


 I'm gonna mark this message for deletion, but Desenbigh has been one of them. I find him a pretty dull and pretty irritating person to be around and I honestly don't want to talk to him

*\[*11:50 AM*\]*But I also feel like telling him to leave me alone for like Ever Is way too mean

*\[*11:51 AM*\]*I said last night there's a fine line between speaking your mind and just being an asshole and I honestly consider flat out telling people you don't want them in their life at all is sorta assholish

*\[*11:53 AM*\]*I always kinda thought people like Desenbigh or nameless  (another such person I know irl) would sorta go away if you keep making excuses as to why I don't talk to them often ""Sorry I didn't see your message"" or ""I'm busy talk later"" but they seem to keep cropping back up   


  
\*\*\*

This entire time I thought I had good friends, and other's kept talking like this afterwards about how ""annoying and dull I am"". I left the server without saying anything after I read this, didn't want to cause more drama then what needs to be. Should I have left? I haven't gotten an DM's asking about where did I go and it's been a day since I left. I feel like they were just putting up with me because they didn't want to hurt my feelings, I also haven't messaged any of them since. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little depressed now and need advice how to handle this professionally, this entire time I thought I had nice friends but I guess not. Maybe I'm over reacting?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: got home from an LDS mission, never talked about religion with my friends out of respect, joined my friends on a discord server that I've known for years, accidentally found a conversation of them talking about me behind my back months before I joined the server. Left the server without saying anything. How should I handle this professionally?",12Feb2020,1
203,"My friend got outed to her Christian homeschool family as a bi athiest around New year's. They took her phone, claiming it was because she was on Tumblr. (She wasn't doing anything bad on Tumblr, mind you. She was just on it).  I was in contact with her younger sister during this time, who said that my friend had not stopped crying, that they were forcing her to read the Bible, and that they were claiming that she ""couldn't know that she's bi""

I saw my friend at an extracurricular a week or so later, and she looked terrible. Cuts on her wrists, making some pretty scary ""jokes"",the whole 9 yards. She had talked about having depression that her parents refused to treat before, so this scared the shit out of me. I decided to reach out to her dad, and I sent him a rather long text saying that their daughter needed mental health help and that they couldn't force religion on her. Said it all respectfully and whatnot. sent the text, then my mom gets a phonecall from friends mom, friends mom tells my mom I'm gay. Whoop de doo it looks like friends family is the asshole, right? Nothing happens after that.

A week later, I find out that my friend has been pulled from the extracurricular that we were in together. I have the instructor text *my friend* to ask why. *My friend* responds with a message about how I'm making stuff up and slandering her family and ruining their reputation. I'm over here all like

WTF 
My friend hates her family. I didn't make any of this up, I have receipts. 

So I text her mom an apology, subtly prying to see if I can get more info. Apparently, they had done some mad level of stalking and found my (other) reddit account, in which I had posted on r/advice a short little piece asking for advice on how to send the text to her dad. In the post, I said something about how her mom was very anti-LGBT, and how my friend was scared to death of her as a result. Well, her mom said that my post was"" making things up"", ""taking things public"" and ""making her look bad"" and was ""saying that she was putting her daughter in harm's way.""

She also said that her daughter's ""bad mood"" (did she mean her depression symptoms? Idfk) was due to the extracurricular we were in together. So. Um.

So I sent her a single screenshot of a text my friend had sent me about how she's scared of her mom, and I said ""what am I making up?""


And that was that. 
Nothing else
No other texts

I did reach out to her cousin, who told me that he would talk to my friend and make sure she's okay, and get back to me with any information that he found.
He blocked me about 2 hours later.

So, um yeah. Please tell me that I'm missing something and that maybe I did make it all up. Also, is there anything else I can do? And if not, how do I cope with losing my best friend?",12Feb2020,1

206,"So I work at a grocery store as a front end supervisor. Roughly five months ago I was offered a promotion to a full-time supervisor from my old store manager who had been transferred a couple of weeks prior. The job would have been the same thing I had already been doing but with guaranteed forty hours and benefits. I accepted the job and was told I would be transferred to the store my old store manager was in about a month. after a month of waiting, I asked when I would be transferred and was told there had been no news.  Another month of waiting and I finally told that my transfer was not happening due to an acquisition of two other stores in the area and that the job was given to someone else. I was however offered the same job at the store I work at, so I simply wouldn't be transferring. After about a month or two, our store manager was transferred and was replaced by our new store manager. I noticed when I checked my schedule that my hours were cut from forty hours down to thirty-two, and asked my manager why that was. I was then told that my original transfer had not been approved by HR and that the mangers had had no right to offer me that job. Because I was already promised the job they would give me the second type of full time they offer which is thirty-two hours and benefits I will call this full-time 2. I told my manager that this is not the job that I was offered, and was told that the new store manager was looking into it. After two weeks of no news, I was finally able to get my store manager and my manager together and ask what was going on. I was told by the new store manager that he did not know if he wanted me for the full-time position yet and that to just keep doing what I'm doing and we will see about getting me full-time because full-time is for people who are going to be promoted to lead positions.

---

####Situation overview:

I (mid+ 20s) used to (15-20+) expierence bad emotional distress (severe phobias but the distress was caused by an emotionally abusive parent who was in turn distressed by my situation = couldn't stand ""lazy""/passive people and she thought I am faking it all and being lazy).

To endure it (= when she was getting angry about the situation I caused (falling behind in life) = or technically, the disorders did), I learned the only coping mechanisms available to me (gaming &amp; talking to ppl online, as I had strong agoraphobia). Being capable is something still very important to me so I guess what I was escaping from was her reminding me exactly that, while I wasn't in a good mental state to face it (I needed to resolve my disorders first). She was basically telling me all the time about the consequences of all of this and I've lost my ability to face them since then - it's very hard for me nowadays to think about the future (I normally am kinda ""what could I do or be person, I am heading this way"" - now am I stale).

I no longer face the distress (= caused by her + my phobias are sorted out) but now I am left with unresolved situations that loop me back into the safe distress tolerance skills (I tend to look for distraction: music, talking to people, mindless activity without purpose).

I also seem to have periodical (months lasting) bursts of energy when I am trying to fix things by putting myself out there but then I suddenly crash (= feeling mentally tired / fatique), usually over some conflict or randomly, basically burning out (it's not like I am over-extending myself during those moments afaik). And then I fall into old patterns. So it's kinda like, employed + working on myself =&gt; crashing + unemployed + gathering energy for next wave. Except the hibernations are getting longer and longer zzz, I just feel exhausted.

---

**Now this is the part where I don't know what to do:** I am assuming that for me to stop avoiding it I need to face my emotions about the situations that call for escapism? I've been trying journaling when they arise and it's working nice except I kinda struggle finding the real causes or what am I avoiding (also as an anxious person I tried to understand where I am feeling tense when I am distressed but idk if it's good for anyhting besides more awareness). The next problem is I tend to go for escapism almost automatically, subconsciouslly - I need to give myself a, ""wait a second, you've been trying to keep yourself busy so much - is there a problem?"" Often I ignore facing the problem until the very deadline and might even miss it if I fail facing it.

**Life back then and now:** I used to be a person who was productive all time (learning stuff online mostly or digital creating or writing) but I have very hard time reengaging those hobbies, it usually lasts a few days at most and I feel anxious during them. My guess would be because they're like a pathway to emotions that I don't wanna feel...? My lifestyle right now is very low-pressure and low-achievement and low-productivity (not normal for me) and it's very possible I subconsciously have fallen into some pattern of not getting myself into anything stressful.

**Situations that are distressing for me:** anything that throws me back into reality (job, finances, trying to finish edu, realizing that my available choices don't correspond to what I want to do), ... likely more of them, I am too subconsciously self-protecting myself from thoughts that trigger it, it's a habit.

**Things I might be potentially trying to avoid:** everything my parent distressed me with which ironically aligns with what I tend to beat myself about; mostly blocked it out but - trying to think of consequences, loss of edu, no proper job, not accomplishing my desires, falling behind in general, ""how are people gonna look at you"", activities that connect to the past, maybe the connection to the realization of what situation I got myself into.

**Triggers for burning out:** angry-people conflicts in a workplace (too stressful), any job available to me (all of them are extremely focused on repetition, it's extremely exhausting for me long-term), innability to resolve a problem (concrete task) due to it seeming too big or feeling indecisive (due to not knowing where I am heading)

^ I am likely forgetting some, it's partially hidden from my perception.

---

To roughly summarize my variety of unhealthy behaviours,

* in the past: disorders + distress (parent) =&gt; distress tolerance skills + dealing with my phobias but not with the emotional side of things

* now: no disorder no distress (parent) BUT stressful unresolved event / trigger =&gt; distress tolerance skills + emotions avoidal and or journaling in better case

* periodically working towards something for months (job, hobbies, signing up for courses) =&gt; triggering event =&gt; avoidance and letting the problem escalate, disengagement of job/hobbies/courses , burning out, fatique, escapism/apathy

* what I've been on and off doing to resolve some of these problems: having my SO talk with me about responsibilities like the job + journaling when I feel uncomfortable about sth (but struggling to get to the core of the problem) + turning off passive stimuli (so basically unhealthy distress tolerance skills) whenever possible (mainly music and PC)

---

Q1: What is the background process that causes a person to go for escapism?

Q2: What are the techniques to stop escapism/avoidance? I am assuming dealing with my emotions (through journaling) when they arise instead of jumping into _any_ activity at all, but I think there coul dbe more techniques...? Are there any publications on topics on this?

Q3: I cannot feel the negative emotions until the trigger happens, is it normal? I'd like to keep resolving them regularly but I don't know how to access them outside of those moments.

Q4: How to access blocked out thoughts that lead to activities I'd like to do &amp; re-engage my lost ability to look forward? I subconsciously avoid it.

Q5: How to stop burning out after I finally re-engage?

I wish I knew some techniques or even concrete name of the topics that concern my issues so I can go lurk for some client-handbooks in the library, aside from whatever thoughts you could add to this.",12Feb2020,1

210,"Hi I'm tired and this is boiling up to the surface so hopefully it all makes sense. I'm also going to generalize a lot to avoid people finding me.
I  just feel like I consistently do the bare minimum and dont understand things in school. I'm afraid I've missed the baseline of understanding and I think I already appear stupid to my classmates so now I dont know where to turn.
My grades arent what I want them to be due to a shitty ex that destroyed my will. I have no contact with him anymore but we are in the same place often and I literally get shaky when he is in the room. It led to me not finishing a lab today because he was there not even talking to me just there and I shut down. I'm pretty sure I pulled half my hair out just stressing.

 For context he accused me of breaking into his car while I was in another city and said he would call the police on me after I snapped at him after he'd been sending like... snapchats about how much he liked another girl from my class while he was a ta, isolating me from my class which also sucks still. I also said some wrong things and I'm not completely innocent but I NEVER went as far as he did.But this was a while ago and I still shut down. Hes been talking badly about me to his friends which I care more about than I care to admit too. But no one in my class knows that he hurt me like this and I just shut down in his vicinity which just makes me look dumb. And it really just sucks that I'm the bad guy in this scenario and I dont know how much longer I can handle it. I just feel stupid and helpless and I've already turned to authorities but it's not like they can regulate a shared space so nothing's changed.

So I guess my question is how can I deal with this. I'm pretty sensitive to what other people think of me and obivously shut down in his presence. I know I should also just suck it up more and not care but like.... how? He is more well liked than me due to being a ta that threw the parties (which of course I couldn't go to)

215,"My brother (13M) doesn't like me that much (18M). I'm not sure when it got to this point but it seems like we get into an argument every time we talk now.

First and foremost, I would like to say I do truly love him and would not trade him for anything or anyone else. I just feel like because of this, I am too controlling. I myself have been struggling with mental health issues for years now. Losing all my friends means that I really only have my brother at home. He's the only person I can talk with freely.

I can see why he thinks I am an asshole though. I do think I am too controlling but I'm not sure how to set a healthy balance. My parents are very hands off with parenting and does not know anything about online safety at all. For this reason, I am the only person to manage that side of things. I recently have become very hands off fearing I may be too restrictive. Basically I am the one who tells him what is right and what is wrong. I am not at the level of r/insaneparents but I do believe I am way past the level of ""normal"" siblings.

What prompt me to make this post was the argument and fight we just had. I entered his room after already having an prior argument and saw him deleting messages. These messages were to an online person. I asked him why he was deleting them and got no response. After a few more attempts, I grabbed his phone. He then started a fight against me for it. In the end, I got the phone but felt like I lost my brother. I'm here crying in my bed with my head hurting after slamming onto the bed frame during the whole process. I went ahead and told him I will give back his phone if he tells me what he was doing but he wouldn't. I asked why he stared a fight over it and he told me he hated me. I walked away because I couldn't contain my tears.

Arguments happens frequently but this was unusually big. Of course after the fight, we continued to say stuff out of anger and adrenaline. I know I can do better and I am hoping you guys can help me with it. I see my brother experiencing similar things to back when I was his age. This is another reason I may be too concerned about him.

We are assigned work on Monday and it is due Sunday night, and she does all her work the night its due. The issue is she doesn’t look at the class at all until that day despite the fact she knows she is part of a group project.

I don’t have time on weekends for schoolwork and I typically get everything done during the week.

218,"Tldr: shitty management, rude conversation, uncomfortable. Quit job or stay?

I got a job at a childcare center about three weeks ago, and started working about two weeks ago. I loved it at first but quickly found out that the directors are lenient. I mean, super lenient. There is no set schedule, they didn't tell me how much I would make an hour until I asked a week after she offered the position - I was waiting to hear back for more details, thus why a week had passed. They are so lenient that the employees walk all over them. Today, four people including the lead teacher called off. I have been sick for the past two weeks and today I was having a coughing party with both lungs and I couldn't do anything but cough and sleep. Hell no I did not want to come in. They asked me if I could and I said that I am not feeling well enough to work, and they implied in a super shitty way that the other employees were over their child-to-teacher ratio and I had a duty to come in. I get that they really needed help, but I don't like how rude they were about it. The icing on the cake is there is so much that I don't like about working there that it outweighs the reason I applied there, to get experience with children for my degree and career. I'm absolutely uncomfortable with the lack of a schedule, no direction from the directors whatsoever, the drive there (quite a bit of a drive from my town), and how immature the other employees act.

222,"For background, I previously worked in a finance role where I managed a team of a few people. Last month, my infant daughter was diagnosed with a serious medical condition which put a great amount of stress on my wife and I. At work, I had new members join my team, one recent college graduate and another transfer (temp) worker from a different office to assist us during the a busy time. These two new employees did not perform up to par and would show up to work late, leave early, leave mid-day and take extended lunches and were generally inefficient. As a result, I used some profanity when addressing on multiple occasions resulting in me behind reported to HR by them both and terminated. I was disappointed, but relieved to be able to spend more time with my daughter (and take some pressure off my wife who is not working to exclusively care for our daughter).

I've had a month off and have been working with recruiters to find a new role. I have only told them and potential employers I resigned from my job to take care of my daughter. Before leaving, I was assured by the HR department of my former employer they would only disclose the time I worked there and my position when asked by future employers. It is a Fortune 500 company, so I believe they are not willing to disclose much information due to misrepresenting past employees due to legal risks.

I just received an offer which I have accepted and as part of the onboarding process, I am asked why I left my most recent employer (resigned, terminated, leave, etc.). There is also a portion which states misrepresentation can result in termination whenever discovered. With that being said, would it be discovered I was terminated for cause during the background check? The only way it would come up is if the background check company asked my past employer if they would rehire me (which I am not sure if they would address). I am in California for further information.

In an effort to re-connect things that makes me excited about life, I've signed up for online continuing edu classes in music and have been curiously entertaining the idea of finishing my BA in Europe. I've also been excited at the possibility of open ended travel with a focus on going to places to learn specific music skills in hopes that I'd land in a better work life balance/perhaps build my own thing from my skills that can sustain a more mobile/travel lifestyle.  Giving back and teaching the skills I have also feels exciting. The world is such a big sandbox of possibility and that makes me happy.

230,"TL;DR: My Dad is slowly drinking himself to death and doesn't want to try to go sober anymore, what do I do and do I even have a moral right to stop him

My father is an amazing person. He's intelligent, kind, and caring, and he is a great dad overall. That being said, he has his vices, one of which is his awful alcoholism. As a kid, I never realized he had a problem. For as long as I can remember, he had always had a bottle of wine a night minimum and so I thought it was normal. I soon came to realize it was not. I started noticing things like how little my friend's parents drank and how his actions and words would slur and how uncomfortable everyone would get. Not because he was a violent drunk or anything, just loquacious and overly friendly in an uncomfortable way.

I also started noticing how cruel he could be to those he cared about in those liquor fuelled moments. He didn't mean what he said, or at the very least didn't fully comprehend what he was saying, but words did come out that were brutal and unwarranted. 

At a certain point of my life I had had enough and resolved to stop caring about him. And for a few years I was convinced I had. I distinctly remember thinking that if he dropped dead, my biggest worry would be the effect it would have on my sister and mom, but that I would be fine. 

My illusion of apathy towards him was shattered in the summer of 2018 when out of nowhere my mother called me to say he was in the hospital. I was about to embark on a road trip for a long weekend, but I dropped everything and travelled back home. Honestly, for the first 2 weeks I was completely fine. I was cracking jokes and smiling and trying to keep spirits up, despite the fact that my dad was lying in a catatonic state with a failed liver and kidney and liquid in his lungs caused by accidentally inhaling his own blood and bile. One day when my mom made the trip to the hospital while I stayed at home to work, I suddenly broke down. Apparently I did care. I cared a lot. Suddenly I was just a 19 year old kid about to lose his dad, or at the very least be stuck with a vegetable for a father. I was not ready for this wave of love and fear and shame that I felt. I still haven't come to terms with the love I feel towards him.

While he was in the hospital we would stand by him and speak to him, hoping that he could hear us and would come back to us. It was a surreal and awful experience and seeing him that weak and helpless and hooked up to all sorts of drips and tubes absolutely destroyed me.

Finally, after nearly a month, my pops started showing signs of life again. It started slowly. The first major change was when he finally opened his eyes. Then when his eyes started focusing. Then when he started remembering some words and names. Then when he was almost able to stand with minimal help.

When we finally checked him out of the hospital, he was able to speak and form coherent sentences, though he was a bit slower. From that point on things were kind of weird. He seemed to be in a dazed state for a long while, almost half awake all the time, but we were all just overjoyed that he was back with us.

A couple weeks after being released from the hospital, he tried driving to a liquor store to buy some booze. We stopped him and took the keys, but we all felt the fear that we were still on thin ice with him. For the next year and a half he struggled with quitting: going sober for a couple days or weeks and then suddenly relapsing or just having one drink after some signs of success and then falling back into his bad habits. 

During this time, my family tried everything we could to help him quit. Diets, seeking mental health professionals and doctors, talking with him as a group and one on one, getting other family members and friends to talk to him, all with no effect. Despite this nothing has worked. This past Christmas we found several stashes of alcohol around the house. He had even started picking up harder liquors. 

Today my sister called me with some sobering news. Apparently he was back to drinking heavily after a being sober a few days and he had said that he doesn't have a purpose anymore or even care about living per say. In essence, he had declared his cessation of trying to be sober. My sister said that he should keep trying and he said that it was selfish of her. 

All these events have sparked so many questions of my own. How can I help someone who doesn't want to help themselves? Do I even have a right to try and get him to sober up? Is it selfish that I want him to live even if he doesn't necessarily want to? How the hell do I deal with watching my father kill himself slowly, knowing full well that his death will be sudden and horrific and caused by alcohol? And if the best course of action is to enjoy what time I have left, how the hell do I ignore this?

Despite having friends and family to talk to about this, I feel so lost and alone. I don't know what to do, please help.",12Feb2020,1

I can’t do something by accident or accidentally lose my temper just a little, or they lose theirs. They’ll say something hurtful and then I’ll tell them they hurt me and they just tell me to calm down and that they’re being patient with ME.

233,"So I have a friend from college who’s a lewd IG model on Instagram, basically every photo is either of her ass or her tits,respectively . Well she was telling me the other day of the men who comment on her account and how she doesn’t mind comments such as “wow nice tits” or “damn what an ass” because she said she’s willfully putting pornography of herself that’s intended to arouse others. She compared it to a guy going to a strip club then getting kicked out because he told her she had a great ass. I thought about this and I have to say I don’t know how to feel,on one hand I find it to be filthy to make those types of comments, but on the other hand I’m not sure if I find it wrong due to the nature and intent of those photographs.

236,"So possibly the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes on (not exaggerating she is fucking gorgeous people) and I are distantly friends. Like very distantly, don’t even know if it’s considered friends. But we have some mutual friends. But a couple days ago she came up to me, literally out of the blue and started a conversation. It was really random. She said something like I haven’t seen you in so long my gosh, acting like we were best of friends many years ago. I see her around every now and then but we never talk. 

So am I looking to much into this? Writing it out, I feel pretty dumb. But she was pretty forward with it. What do y’all think I should do? Should I try to just start a conversation with her one day? It would be kind of weird because every time I see her she is always talking to someone else. And I don’t even know what I would say. Just stroll up and be like suuup. But then again that’s basically what she did to me and it was great. But of course I was completely caught off guard and responded reallly weirdly. I notice every time I talk to her I usually say something pretty dumb. 

Is there anything I can do to not make a fool of myself? And what the hell do I even say? Do I just walk up when she’s talking to friends?",12Feb2020,1

239,"For the last several months I've been feeling really down about myself and my job, feeling unappreciated and like what I'm doing is incredibly thankless and uninspiring. I've been doing the same type of job in tech for 11 years and recently turned 35 and am disappointed in myself that I'm still doing the same ol' thing that I'm not passionate about.

I went to school for music and am a lover of travel and learning new things. I have always struggled with the decision to quit my job to travel for an open ended period of time. I've had several gaps in my employment over my career and have taken 6 week trips mostly solo and always wished I had put my stuff in storage so I could travel for longer.

In an effort to re-connect with things that makes me excited about life, I've signed up for online continuing edu classes in music and have been curiously entertaining the idea of finishing my BA in Europe. I've also been excited at the possibility of open ended travel with a focus on going to places to learn specific music skills in hopes that I'd land in a better work life balance/perhaps build my own thing from my skills that can sustain a more mobile/travel lifestyle.  Giving back and teaching the skills I have also feels exciting. The world is such a big sandbox of possibility and that makes me happy.

That being said..I don't know what to do next per say. I've been so disconnected from my heart for years and have been in my mind living in a lot of fear and what if's. Stuck.

241,"This all started over the summer 2019. Me and a couple of friends were bored one night and thought it'd be funny if I write a funny, false, negative yelp review on an old annoying classmate's family's side business. I forget exactly what I wrote as it was a long time ago, but it was something along the lines of my child being molested in the parking lot. About a day later realizing how wrong that was, I deleted the review. Not fast enough though, as the kid's father had already responded asking to report this to the police dept. Long story short, this got brushed under the carpet until now. A couple weeks ago, a group of friends that I have not been associated with for a few years, decided to do the same thing as me except much much worse. Writing many reviews far more harsh than what I had done. Long story short, they were all caught. Now being the person who did this a long time ago, I took a laugh out of this because they actually were stupid enough to get caught. I even told my parents about it and they got a good kick out of it but made me assure them I had nothing to do with it. (Which at the time I believed I didn't) Anyways, these kids are questioned about their actions, and the family had all the screenshots. They even had mine. They asked the kids and the kid told them that I was the one who wrote. It has now been about 2 weeks since this situation has unfolded but the family has yet to step forward and reach out to my parents. A good friend of mine, who attends my same school, is deep into the situation and at fault. He has now talked with our dean about the situation and I myself was called into the deans office. He confronted me about it and I panicked and flat out denied everything. I honestly feel horrible and guilty for doing so but it was a first instinct. He believed me and dismissed me from his office after around 5 minutes. With all the denial and everything, the family still believes I am guilty with their only ""proof"" being from a kid who claims it was me. If what I am hearing from others close to the situation is correct, the family's next move is to come to my school and get this on my record as a misdemeanor. I find this all shocking considering that everyone who has been involved has had their families contacted and notified but mine has not yet. The chances of the family following through with this are unlikely in my opinion, but in the event that they do, considering that there is absolutely no evidence I wrote anything, is denying everything going to work? 

NOTE: Throughout all of this I have had no contact, conversations, or anything with the family making the accusations. Everything I am hearing has been relayed to me through other friends closer to the situation. Also, I have had friends close to the situation deny to the family any involvement I had regarding this but they don't seem to care. 

I recognize I am a fucked up person for doing this in the first place and lying about it, but I feel that in the situation I currently am in my life, I can't take any chances. I know this is fucked and I have feel horrible but any advice would help. Thank you",12Feb2020,1

244,"I’ve been dating a guy for a little over two months, and with valentine’s around the corner, it’s got me thinking about whether or not I want to be in this relationship anymore. He’s very nice and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with him, but we’re extremely different and our compatibility is questionable at best. We differ on the three big things, in my book: personality, religion, and politics (we usually just don’t talk about it, and if we do, it’s me talking and him agreeing with whatever I say). We live about an hour away from each other and only meet up on weekends, and to be honest, we spend most of that time having sex (it’s the best both of us have ever had, hands down). He’s a bad communicator, “doesn’t believe” in social media and doesn’t text a whole lot, so it feels like I’m single during the week and just getting fucked on weekends. We both agreed this was a casual thing, but we’re also not seeing other people.

So here’s the thing: I know he’s not “the one” for me. I don’t picture myself marrying or having kids with this guy, but I also don’t desperately want to break up with him, because I’m not really looking to settle down anytime soon.This time last year, I was in a relationship with someone for a VERY long time and was about to get married, so my friends tell me to just enjoy the casual relationship I’m in now.

We got a random roommate who happened to be amazing: sweet girl, never had any issues. However, she had to move out due to personal reasons.

Fast forward to February (now), 3 months after she moved out. We get a notice on our door that we have a new roomie moving in this week. She shows up with a MASSIVE dog, must be a lab or some sort of it. 

It has been growling, barking, trying to attack the two cats that have lived here for 7 months with no issues. Not to mention, the boyfriend living with her has been screaming and scaring me from the start.  Is the apartment complex allowed to just throw them in here with a giant dog?!

251,"I moved in with my best friend back in March. I was moving to a new state, getting out of a bad relationship / live in boyfriend situation, and was going through a lot of transition in my life. I wanted a fresh start and moved in with my best friend and her sister. Things were good for a few months but have gotten progressively worse. When I moved here I realized she wanted to control certain things about me, wanted me to dye and cut my hair, wanted to go through all my stuff and get rid of what she deemed I didn’t need, wanted to go through all my clothes and only keep what she deemed as cute, would come in my room and clean when I wasn’t home or even sometimes when I was just sitting in me room. Would walk in and clean it like it wasn’t up to her standards. I’ve brought her into my room after redecorating and asked what she thought and she’s straight up told me she doesn’t like it and this is what she would do and I should change this. 
Shortly after moving in , I was on a trip visiting family and she took my car while I was out of state and wrecked the front right side... I waited many months to get it fixed because I felt bad that she even had to pay for it cause it was going to be a lot of money. My parents hounded me to get it fixed so I scheduled an appointment. The day before my appointment to get my car fixed she ran into someone else with her car and totaled her car and messed up the other persons as well. My car is under my parents name and my parents still expected her to get the car fixed even though she was now out of a car. When I told her that she master manipulated me saying that it was obvious to her now that all the talk that we had each other’s backs was not true. That really crushed me and I didn’t understand why she was taking her poor actions and decisions out on me. I didn’t fall for it and still made her fix my car. 
We both have a nasty vaping habit (currently trying to quit) and one day while I was out at another friends house she came into my room and took one of my vapes out of my purse. I didn’t even know til the next day when I asked if she had gone and bought another one and she said “no I found this in your purse” she laughed about it and processed to keep it until it was gone. 

Whenever I cook she tells me what it needs or just straight up starts adding things to make it the way she wants it. 
I feel like she has absolutely no respect for me. And if I were to do the same things to her it would be a massive issue. I’m a very non confrontational person and also she is a very sensitive person so I feel like if I were to try and talk to her about this she would just get super defensive.

258,"I work in a pretty tight knit workplace, there are about 10 of us in my department and 50 of us in the building. So we all get to know eachother pretty well. I have a coworker who will routinely take food out of other peoples desks if they have offered her food in the past. We all know she is tight on money, which is probably why no one makes much of a fuss about it. 

A year ago, I would fill up my drawer with snacks and let people know they could have one if they needed it. But soon it got to the point where the drawer would be empty within a week, and 2 coworkers in particular would eat multiple snacks a day. So, I stopped filling up my drawer. This exact thing happened to another coworker of mine, she offered them food once, and a week later she realized they had eaten all but one of her pieces of candy.

Today I was at my desk taking a break, and this coworker walks over to the desk next to mine and *opens a tin container to see if there was food inside.* It wasn't on her desk, the person whose desk it was sitting at wasn't even working today. I went ""What are you doing!"" And she said ""I'm just seeing what's inside!"" I replied ""It's not yours, it's none of your business."" I felt like I was talking to a child, not a 35 year old woman. She started laughing and I went ""Seriously, that doesn't belong to you, stop rifling through her stuff."" And my coworker got mad and said ""Save it for someone who cares.""

I told our manager, and at first her response was ""Well, lock up your stuff."" After pressing the issue a bit more she said she would talk to this coworker. I'm just angry and disgusted I guess. I'm afraid we have let this behavior go on for too long, and this particular coworker will never respect our basic boundaries again. Is there anything I can do? Thanks Reddit!",12Feb2020,1

The land lord has given us till the March because they want to sell the house. We now have until the 22 of February before they get a court order to evict cause we were short for rent. 

I work 2 pt min wage jobs to save for a big move in April to another city. I had also booked a trip for next month in which I'll be gone for the majority of march.

She does commission work and needs a vehicle to make money. However she had gotten into an accident in December and the vehicle never left the shop. I don't have a license. 

Why were we short rent? I probably could have helped had she said she was short but I just sent my half and stupidly assumed she had hers even though it was totally possible she hadn't made anything for the last 2 months with no car.

So here we are. We need to find a place with no car, and I don't even think she can cover any damage deposit even if we do find one. 

Usually I'd throw money at this to solve it but I don't have much saved, I have enough for my trip and just enough to help me for 2 months once I move. This situation could eat all that rather quick. game over for me. should I wait it out? Should I spend my savings and cancel my move and trip?

265,"Hello Reddit, I’m a long time lurker, first-time poster. Sorry in advance for the long post. Basically, I have the opportunity to move—either to a renovated apartment unit in my current complex or to studio in a different part of town.

My 2 roommates and I recently realized that we would only be paying a marginal price for a renovated unit in my apartment complex, which would greatly improve our quality of life in our opinion (no wall-to-wall carpets, new kitchen, faces into the courtyard rather than the windows of the building next door). 

The big caveat is that I live in a very sprawling city without a car. It used to work out very well as I worked very close to my current place so I could rely on public transpo/ride share and still get home at a decent time. In the past two years I’ve started taking a series of temporary but steady contract jobs throughout the year, all of which are on the other side city. My city is notorious for awful traffic and without a car, my commute(s) could take up to 2 hours each way. As a result, I’ve started spending more and more time at my partner’s place on the other side of the city, but this isn’t a very viable long-term solution as they also have roommates (and moving out isn’t an option for them right now).

Because of this, I’ve also started exploring moving out to get my own place in a different part of town. I know that my roommates would not move with me because current apartment is better suited to their commutes. I found a nice studio apartment in a centrally-located neighborhood that I pass by often on my commute but am not super familiar with. This neighborhood definitely has a more urban feel and is very walkable and close to major public transportation lines. It will be more expensive for me to move out on my own than staying with roommates, not to mention giving up perks such as nice apartment amenities (gym, pool), a more residential neighborhood, and responsive apartment management. 

I love my current apartment complex but I often feel like I don’t have enough time or energy to enjoy it, even though I would be paying less if I stayed. I’m not dying to get my own place and my roommates are very nice people, but I often wonder if I would be saving more money, time, and energy from a shorter commute that would offset more expensive rent. I’m also afraid that, if I moved, I would be giving up a good living situation and experience serious regret.

269,"I honestly was considering not posting here, since I've had issues with other forums, but I don't really have anywhere else to go to for advice so I was looking to see what people here would suggest. Possibly a problem of mine, too, is that I keep asking for advice and such when I should just try making decisions myself, but it's good to get opinions from people who may have gone through similar situations.

So, to get right in, I'm a college sophomore and a transfer. I transferred for this year. I was at a different school last year. I loved my old school very much, and even now, all my memories of it are absolutely wonderful. I loved the community, the people, everything. I transferred because I got into an Ivy League school, that I thought would be better for my degree and better academically in my major.

Ever since getting here, I've been absolutely depressed and hated it. Bad enough that I've been going to therapy and it doesn't really help. I honestly never liked this school very much. Even when I visited years ago, I intentionally didn't apply first time around because I just wasn't vibing. But when I transferred I imagined I could re-create my experience at my first school anywhere. But yeah, it hasn't been working here. I have really few friends. I don't have a community at all. I constantly want to leave but feel like I can't. I said I'd leave after first semester if it got bad, but then I convinced myself to at least give it one more semester. I also changed some things for this semester: I moved dorms to go to a dorm that supposedly has a community (since all my best memories and best friends from my old school were in my dorm and so I feel like that could be a huge factor), and I joined clubs I liked. I'm pushing myself to hang out with people more, although my class schedule is very busy right now.

Like I said, it's still terrible. The new dorm is almost worse -- I don't know if they just lied to me, but instead of being in a really nice double apartment (sharing a bedroom) with no outside community, I'm now in a kinda small, ugly single in a dorm with absolutely no community (I've never even seen my neighbors -- it feels like I'm living alone) although I've only been here for a week and I haven't gone to any dorm events cause I haven't been able to. Hoping to do that this weekend to get a better idea as to whether there even exists ANY community here.

So, my problem is this. Switching dorms failed -- but because there just isn't a community here. I can't figure out whether or not I can make this school better for me. Because if I can find a way to be happy here, that'd be great. Although, I thought I could do that by finding a dorm community, which I'm starting to think this school simply doesn't have. So it comes down to whether I'm depressed because of the school itself and the fundamental way it exists (there are a lot of things that could cause this -- the environment is toxic, there's a lack of community, high stress, etc) or because I am a transfer who simply had to start over and I have no friends (which would also make me depressed and makes me wonder whether I would also be depressed had this been my situation going into my old school). For the former, that means I probably should leave. But if it's the latter, I'll be happier here than if I tried switching back to my old school. Because if I did that, I would be going in as a transfer, still barely knowing anyone and possibly being put in a dorm lacking community (as most upperclass dorms seem to do -- unless I'm wrong and that's just this Ivy school) which would just be this all over again, and I'm afraid of hating that old school and not being able to move out. So, do I stay here or go? Right now, I'm afraid of being depressed either way.

Of course, I also have a lot of small side decisions that go with this. Do I stay in this new dorm that still could possibly have community that I'm not seeing yet, or do I return to my old dorm that was really nice but just lacked any social aspect? Also, I got offered to be an RA, do I go for that in the hopes I'll find community, or do I live with friends in a much nicer dorm? Finally, do I drop this class that's kinda giving me anxiety but is super cool and is an easy extra credit? Because I'm stressed. Honestly this class may have caused me to anxiously type this whole thing up. I'm just stressed man.

My life's a mess. I feel a bit hopeless tbh. Advice is welcome.",12Feb2020,1
270,"Alright this might be the stupidest and most obvious question- but my brain cells have totally left the room tonight. Let me also start this by saying I have never dated a bisexual person in my life so I have no clue what’s offensive and what’s not. I was talking with my friend trying to think of ideas considering Valentine’s day is coming up- so I said “Aye what if I get her shoes that are the same color as the bi flag- bc like yk, shes bi.” And in my head I was thinking that it was a pretty smart idea. I then kinda thought that it might me a bad idea bc i don’t want her thinking i’m calling her gay in a bad way or something. Sorry in advance bc I kinda feel like an idiot rn ngl.

272,"So I'm a 17 year old student in Ireland. Safe to say school is not my thing and never has been. I've been playing sick to get out of school for as long as I can remember. I'm in my second last year and on average I can make it into school maybe once a week. I have crippling anxiety and depression that makes it nearly impossible for me to get out of bed every day. School makes my mental health so much worse and my parents are encouraging me to dropout. I'm constantly told I'm wasting my time staying in school if I'm not learning enough to pass the exams.

The thing is that I dont have a dream. No goal to reach for. I didnt think I would live past 13 so now I have no plan or motivation. So what can/should I do? I can't get a job. If I cant get out of bed in the morning theres no way I could hold something down. I have no idea what you actually need to do when you drop out. Do I need to do the leaving cert? Will I have to do something equivalent to it? To be perfectly honest, I'm an idiot. Sometimes even basic math can throw me for a loop. If I have to do some exam I can guarantee you I will fail it. 

What options do I have if I drop out? What options do I have if I stay in school and fail the leaving cert? Is college even something to consider if i have no passion and no good grades to back me?

My dad is the boss and the one that hires people for the well-paying and stable job that many people in the area move here just to be eligible to get. Unfortunately my dad can't hand out positions until one opens. So my man stayed with me longer than he wanted to just to get on my dad's good side and get the job when the position opened up. He lied to me the entire time and, I guess he was cheating too. This man knows the trauma I have gone through and still felt comfortable being with me, lying to me, having sex with me, telling me he loved me. 2 weeks after getting the job, he dumped me and ghosted because he is a coward.

I (26M) about a year ago (Oct of 2018) lost the love of my life. He died suddenly in a car accident. It was an on-again-off-again relationship I was a year ahead of him during our high school years.

I, without a doubt, felt more about him than he did towards me. I was the chaser in this relationship...he was a flirt and enjoyed people chasing after him.

He died suddenly in a car crash. It was an honest mistake; the fucking epitome of shit road design. A pure shit design - an on ramp followed by a pure shit highway design: he merged onto on coming traffic without any real way of knowing his mistake. And was hit head on by a Semi Truck.

Since then everyday day I drink about .9 litters of vodka, and have put on nearly 90 lbs of weight.

This particular Friday, my manager told me I was not allowed to stay past 11:30 because of labor costs. We were very busy that night so I ended staying until midnight anyway but I still couldn’t finish stocking everything I wanted to. The next morning, my coworker (D), who is usually a closer, texts me saying that I didn’t stock everything. This annoyed me because D usually never stocks anything for me when I open, but still, I apologize and explained to her what happened. Flash forward to today, when I opened, I noticed a few tables in the dining area were not cleaned up and had food and trash all over. I found out that D was the one who closed the dining area so I messaged her to let her know. I really could not have been more nice in the message because I honestly just wanted to let her know that she forgot to double check since she’s a shift lead. I guess she still took it the wrong way because she replied saying that bathrooms weren’t stocked on Friday and that she has no idea what tables I’m talking about. Again, I reply as nice and professional as I possibly could but in the message I mentioned that another coworker of mine (A) had cleaned the bathrooms but that I should have double checked everything myself since I am also training to become a shift lead. No reply. A couple hours later I get a message from A about how angry she is that I had blamed her when I was the one who cleaned the restrooms. My bad. I had confused last Friday for the Friday before that (because I’m an idiot) and completely forgot I really did clean the bathrooms that night.

Before she was extremely innocent and somewhat passive, but know she feels kind of the opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the timeline:

When I was 17 I was in a year long relationship with a boy that I had known for a while. We had a shitload of other issues and we ultimately broke up because of those issues. I was sexually assaulted and taken advantage of by one of my coworkers when me and my bf at the time were still together (was very drunk and might have possibly been drugged). Instead of telling my bf at the time, I lied to him and told him that I had cheated on him because in that moment I didn't want to even fathom that something like that could ever happen to me. It took me well over a year to come to terms with what happened, and through therapy, for the first time, I admitted to myself that I was sexually assaulted. It was months of mental torcher and telling myself that I was at fault, before I saw even a glimpse of hope for the future. Then I met my current boyfriend (who was friends with my ex at the time even though my ex treated him like dogshit). My current boyfriend is my absolute soulmate and we love and care for eachother very much, and if it weren't for him, I wouldn't be here today. He has shown me real love, and for that I am eternally grateful. Back on track: After the breakup happened, my ex then fucked the girl I was worried about for our whole relationship the day we broke up. Back to the main point. Here I am, 2 years later, still struggling sometimes and mostly just pushing the thought of it out of my mind. I still fear that I will see my assaulter in public, and my flashbacks affect me and my boyfriends sex life. I sometimes wonder if telling my ex what *really* happened would help at all. And then that thought gets immediately shut down by my other thoughts and fears of what he might say. 

I guess I'm mainly writing this to get it out of my system in hopes that it will help me with my healing process. Maybe someone reading this might relate (even though I wish nobody would ever relate to this). Maybe this post will help someone with *their* healing process as well. I guess this is just a shitpost that I will only glance at from time to time but yeah. Thats p much it. Hope y'all are doing well, sorry for such a heavy post.",12Feb2020,1

-landscaping due to flooding from the house being on an incline and pooling water

I had decent income but due to me being too nice I kept agreeing to take out loans for my family and now I have a small job at a gas station to support myself. All my bills are covered but barely any for investments. I am able to get a 30k renovation loan easily but I don’t know where to start.

I am constantly stressing about it since I get constant calls for bills I need to pay and wasn’t prepared for.

301,"Hi everyone,

Need some advice in regards to a problem that has literally plagued my household over the last year.

I'll just start with some context. My brother is 17 and a high school senior; he'll be graduating this June and has applied to a variety of schools, including state schools and private schools like USC and NYU.

The problem here is that my family is middle class and even though our combined income is low enough to receive some aid (very little), we make too much to qualify for anything other than a small loan through the federal government. 

The sensible decision for my brother would be to have him attend our local community college, work part time, and transfer to a 4-year university later into his college career. This way he saves up his own money and he doesn't cost my parents thousands of dollars for his education.

Now onto the actual issue:

My brother has been brainwashed by someone (presumably a friend or ignorant counselor) into thinking that he needs to attend a fancy, preferably private school in order to prove that he's getting a good education, which is why he applied to USC and NYU. This, while completely ignorant, is also causing problems for my family because 1) my parents literally cannot afford to put him through a fancy private school and 2) he is completely in denial of the fact that my parents are not willing to apply for a loan to pay for him to attend a school that will provide him with the same education as any other state school. For context, he's a business administration major and he does have a fairly high GPA of 4.5, if that makes a difference.

I need advice on how to explain to him that he's making the wrong decision, and how it's not that my parents don't want to help him, but rather that they can't. My parents already pay for everything -- the roof over our heads, both of our cars, and because my brother doesn't even have a part time job, they pay for literally all of his other expenses. I've tried being reasonable, using logic, using statistics, and I've also lost my patience numerous times and he literally just doesn't want to ""lower himself"" to the level of taking community college classes even though it's the only solution that makes financial sense.

304,"Am I really a selfish person for doing this to a friend?

Hello, I’m a 21 year old girl and the girl I’m talking about is 19. Let’s call her Maddie. Maddie and I have been friends for over 3 years now and we’ve never gotten into any fights. Ive gotten a long pretty well with her over the years until she met this boy. Let’s call him Chad. Chad and her dated at the end of her high school career and a little after she graduated high school. Their relationship was incredibly toxic. She was very needy in this relationship and VERY obsessive over him. She would talk about him none stop to everyone how in love she was with him. During the time that they were dating I put up with her relationship with her and bf. I just let her ramble on about her relationship. During that summer that they were dating Maddie and I were gong to move into the same dorm together. (Btw we go to the same college) We’ve both been planning it out for at least 6 months before Chad and her started dating. A week before we were about to move in Chad broke up with her. During this time I was at work and I kept getting repeating text messages from her demanding me to come over to her house, because her and Chad broke up. I couldn’t I was at work, but I will come after work. She later on agreed with me coming over after work to her house. I stayed up all night with her listening to her, trying to help her in anyway I can. She talked about how much she hated his guts and how selfish he was for leaving her. Then the next day she texted me nonstop saying how upset and sad she was. I was devastated to see my friend like this. I wanted to help her anyway I can. For a whole week I tried to help her as well has cheer her up. She would call me and threaten to kill herself to me. This scared me a lot so I contacted her family letting them know what was going on. Her saying that stuff scared me and I was really worried for her. A few weeks go by and her and Chad get back together. This made me upset, because I spent those weeks trying to help her get over him. Then she goes crawling back to him. Then after she got back with him she acted totally normal not treating to kill herself or self harm. I told her I don’t want to be dragged into you and Chads relationship anymore. It was really stressing me out and putting a mental toll on me. She said she wouldn’t drag me into it. Next day totally ignores what I had to say. Starts talking about her and Chad problems again. Then I remind her a could of other times one trough text. So I have evidence of me saying it. (This comes important later in the story.) Next week we move in together. Then a few weeks pass by then her and Chad break up again this time it’s worse. She starts talking about killing herself. She keeps me up at night and by crying all night. I can’t sleep due to this. She also talks about how much she hates his guts. She tells me he sexually assaulted her, but then changes her story multiple times saying he never did that to her. I can’t study in my dorm room, because she’s yelling and crying. She texts me in class demanding me to come back to the dorm and sit with her to comfort her. She asked me for advice and she won’t take any of my advice. She completely ignores it. I told her that I will get the RA If she won’t stop. She tells me don’t do that she doesn’t want any help. Then a few days pass and she gets back together with Chad and everything was fine again. She stops having melt downs and stop threatening to kill herself. At that point I told her enough was enough. I told her I was upset with her, because I told her the problem she was having with her and Chad was really affecting me. It was really dragging me down. I wanted to move out of the dorm room with her and live in a different dorm room. She said she understood why I was leaving and was okay with it. I told her I wanted a break from out friendship too. She completely agrees with that. I moved out a few months go by then her and Chad officially break up. During this time she’s going around spreading rumors about me to my friends saying that I was selfish and I never was there for her. She also told people that I would go around and talk mad shit about people/friends. Which isn’t true I never did such a thing. She also said I was self centered and only cared about myself. I confronted her about it and I said hey let’s sit down and talk about this. I have been told that you been spreading false information about me. She said she never did a thing and she would never do something like that to me. She refused to sit down and talk to me about the problem. She later on blocked me on everything. It makes me really depressed that this happened. I told people that I have proof from that text messages that she sent me. Saying how much I care about her. How I was trying to help her. How I told her I didn’t want to be dragged into her and Chads relationship. nobody seems to believe me. She has a bunch of friends, because of it now. everyone talks about how amazing of a friend she is. What should I do? Now all my friends don’t like me anymore. Everyone refuses to talk to me and every time I see a old friend they just give me a dirty look. I’m all alone in college. Was this truly my fault was i really a selfish person?

306,"I emailed my boss asking for more hours about an hour ago. But i’m starting to quickly regret it. I have really bad anxiety and I am afraid that it was the wrong thing to do, that it might have made a bad impression on her, it’s my first job. 

I am saving up to go to a family reunion in France in August. I currently work as an assistant full time over the summer helping with a project and during the year I part time work and study. During the year i work in a team with a sort of even amount of hours. We get to pick our hours on a roster and we all get 11 hours equally. I was going to pick morning shifts and usually nobody picks them but one of the people who was hired to work the weekends picked every single morning of the week to make up for swapping out of the long weekend shift. I have been working weekdays for about a year. I havn’t been able to work weekends as a student because my partner and I travel out of town on friday nights and come back on sunday. I was just really upset about it. I can’t really do anything about it though. But I just got a fire under my butt to work more. So i figured I would just ask my boss for more hours. I know the project is still carrying on while I study and this year I am taking less papers so I have more time. I have been saving up for this reunion for more than a year and I am about halfway to getting there, I graduate before then too so I will need more money. Otherwise I should have just applied for a second job. 

Well firstly, I regret emailing her. I should have spoken to her about it but to be honest I was afraid to. I emailed her to tell her about our overseas trip. I told her I was letting her know that I am now a part-time student. And if there were any hours for any sort of work available to please let me know. I cannot really tell if I am overreacting because of my anxiety. Im just afraid I will panic soon that I just made a bad impression now for being unprofessional because I really like this job. But I was just really asking if there was any work available???? Do I apologise?",12Feb2020,1
307,"please i really need advice or an outside perspective on this situation

i have a guy friend that i was super close too and ive known him for almost a year now. ive started to wonder if our friendship is toxic.

he likes this guy in our class and he wants to be his friend really badly so i encourage him to talk to his crush because i wanna support him and make him happy.
 but the one class we have together with his crush, he ignores me and doesn’t talk to me as if i don’t exists. only when he has no one to talk to i am his last resort to not being alone. 
He is my only friend in that class right now since he kind of ruined my other friendship with my other friend because he hates him.

because his crush vapes he thinks the best way he can get close to him is vaping. I told him that vaping is not good for his health and there are other ways that he could get to know his crush but he’s stubborn and refuses to listen.
He did vape before but he stopped after he met me. so i wanted him to stay healthy and tried to prevent him from vaping again.
to get close to his crush he befriends all of his crushes friends that are all doing drugs and vaping. but he says he likes risk in life and wants to be friends with them too.

the main problem i have with this is that he says that we are best friends but yet he doesn’t treat me as one. he used to at least but after he befriended them he treated me worse. even till this day he would say that we are and i did bring up the way i felt about him treating me, but he just said “well i kind of have to do what i have to do. i don’t want to miss any chances with ____.” 
we don’t talk in class at all. and when we do text or talk it would always be about his crushes friends or vaping.

i want to drift away but yet i dont want to because i miss the friendship we had so much and i didnt want to loose it. i wished it was back in summer when we were close good friends.

i wished atleast he didnt ruin my friendship with my other friend in my class. then i wouldnt be alone.

i just want us to be good friends again but he always put others before me despite saying he doesn’t care about them or he would say that he has to many friends to keep up with.

i don’t know what to do any advice what i should do or an outside perspective would be greatly appreciated. thank you so much.",12Feb2020,1

309,"3 years ago I broke my front tooth on a rollercoaster ride. It hit the bar and snapped in half and thus exposed a nerve.

I got a filling. The dentist was pretty chill about it and just made it look like it never happened. He just told me not to eat apples or any hard stuff head on.

Three years in, my ass didn't listen and I bit an apple and it chipped in the back. The entire filling didn't come out but it was still a pretty good chip to wear it would hurt whenever I drank something.

Went back to a dentist (my insurance changed so this was a new dentist)

The guy dentist pretty chill too. He told me I could just get the gap filled.

Then the dental assistant came in and demanded that my mom get me a vinnier cause it would last longer and is what I needed. The issue was that it cost 850 dollars upfront and my parents don't have the money. Meanwhile the filling of the gap would only cost 250.

So they did the filling.

The only problem is that the dentist made the broken front tooth shorter than the other. She said that it is to prevent a chip from occurring more easily but that shit has been fucking up the way I eat. Its like my teeth don't know where to land anymore and Im worried Imma fuck up my other front tooth/lower teeth in the process.

I know the reason why its shorter is to prevent a chip but Im like 99 percent sure it was cause I ate an apple not because I don't know how to close my mouth.

any advice?",12Feb2020,1

312,"I have been friends with Mark for over 7 years now. We met in Jr High School and became closer as time went on. After sophomore year I moved out of state but we still kept in touch. We've lived in separate states ever since. About 3 years ago we started visiting each other because we made enough at our jobs for small vacations. We've been so close for years and always there for each other. I just wonder if there was something I was missing that whole time because he let everything fall apart so fast. 

As stereotypical as it is, it all started last June when he started dating this girl Marissa. He had just got back from deployment and met her and had leave so he visited me and his family. Everything was great then. Just like normal. After his leave was over and he went back to base and continued to date Marissa. We didn't talk as much but he said he was busy with work and hanging out with Marissa a lot. I was happy for him. He hadn't had a relationship for like 4 years. One day I ask how Marissa is and if they've gone on any cool dates. He tells me they are in a relationship now and have been for a few weeks. I was happy but also hurt he hadn't told me. 

Now on my end of things, I had been having a difficult year and with my own relationship issues. I was going through a very difficult break up because my partner did not want it too end so we kept trying. But eventually I ended it painfully. Mark wasn't there for me at all. His tone had completely changed with me. A conversation couldn't be more than small talk. I wouldn't even talk about the break because I started to think that maybe that was inappropriate if he was with someone. I had confronted him multiple times over a few months because at this point he'd never initiate conversation and would only reply to me through Snapchat. He'd always be so apologetic and say he was so sorry and did not want to loose our friendship and that things would be different from now on he promised. And nothing changed obviously because I'm writing this to strangers online. 

Some weeks had gone by and we hadn't talked. I had just seen his Snapchat stories so I knew he was visiting his family with Marissa for Thanksgiving. A week later on his birthday I saw a post on his wall from his Aunt who said she was so happy to meet his fiance and happy birthday. Fiance?! I was so hurt he hadn't told me. I didn't even know how to bring it up cause we really weren't talking much at this point. And later I saw on Snapchat he was moving in with her. So I asked him about that and he said yeah they are married now so they found a place together. Again he had not told me any of this. He's treating me like a nobody. I want to be so happy for him but I feel like I'm in a compromising position cause I valued our friendship so much and he didn't communicate anything with me. I've also had such a hard time letting people go. I was with the guy I broke up with for 2.5 years. 

Flash forward to January he messaged me. And I kinda exploded everything I was feeling on to him. Probably inappropriate but I was having a bad day so I didn't really care at the time. He again said he was so sorry and acknowledged he messed up our friendship and that he really really wanted to make everything better. And that it wasn't just me he cut out but his family too. I felt bad. I really didn't know. So we started messaging every once and awhile and I felt like things could get back to how they were. He wasn't so closed anymore and I felt like I could share things about myself. But that didn't last long. Pretty quickly everything went back to how it was. It makes me so sad. I wish he would just tell me why and that he would stop lying to me about trying to make it right. 

Any advice on how to either confront him for answers or just move on with no answers?",12Feb2020,1

316,"
So my in-laws started rumors that my husband is abusive. 

Let me be more specific. 

My husband is the second oldest child, his older brother being a few years older then him. My husband (J) has always been ahead of his brother (C).

J went to college first, got married first, got higher scores, you get the idea.

Well long story short we fell in love fast and eloped (romantic for us, just the two of us) but as you might imagine it pissed his family off and they’ve been holding it against us ever since (get a life weirdos!) 

Recently things have been really good. J is almost done with college, I just got a full time job that I love in my career field, we moved into a beautiful house, got a cute dog and have been super happy and really enjoying our marriage (renewing our vows just a few weeks ago!) 

It wasn’t always like this, just a few months ago we lived with Js parents, worked dead end jobs, and had to take a break from college due to our debts. We were full time baby sitters and the laughing stock of the family. During this time C was in college and had a nice apartment. 

Well fast forward and now C is living with his parents just like we did and he’s taking a break too. 

But instead of just dealing with it he’s decided to lash out against his brother which he obviously has reason to be jealous of, and has started rumors about my husband abusing me. 

The worse part is that they lied about it to his grandparents, who don’t have much longer to live, and to his dad who is currently very sick! When we defended ourselfs the family just wrote us off and continued to just accuse him of the worst. He’s struggling in school now because his family texts him all the time about how aweful they think he is. 

He loves them and doesn’t want to be cut off from them. So what do I do to clear his name?",12Feb2020,1
317,"So about 5 months ago, I met a now really good friend of mine. She is super supportive and very nice. We hang out all the time at my place and sometimes go to the bar.

She asked me what my boyfriend (we have been together for 6 years) looked like about 2 months in to knowing her and I showed her a picture and she said he was cute. I agreed and soon they met. He doesn’t show any interest in her at all as we are happily together and I even mentioned this to him. 

So recently she asked me “does your boyfriend think I’m cute too?” after we were talking about him. I said “oh I don’t know, he thinks I’m cute but I don’t know what he thinks.” And that was that scenario. Then she went on to ask if he had Facebook or Instagram so she could become his friend but he doesn’t so she was a bit upset. 

One time when she was at my house, we had been drinking quite a bit, and she asked if she could use my deodorant so I brought her into my room. My boyfriend was there and she then asked if she could use his to which he said no. I thought it was kind of weird.

I’m not sure if I’m being paranoid or not. I just don’t want to lose such a good friend. Should I set boundaries?",12Feb2020,1

320,"I grew up in an average sized town and I lived there for most of my life. I have so many close friends and fond memories in that town. Most of my friends were lower class people(this is relevant later). I lived and went to school there up until 8th grade. I thought it was obvious that I was going to go to the public high school in that town with all of my friends and I was going to do well not only academically but athletically too. But my parents floated the idea of looking at more challenging private schools for me because they and a lot of my teachers thought I had immense potential. I wasn’t completely opposed to the idea so I went along with it. My eyes were opened to this whole world of prestige private school that I had never heard of before. There was this one school in a city about 1 hour away from my original town that my parents really liked, but it was really hard to get into. If I committed to this school it would mean moving as well. I toured the school and was really impressed by the teachers and campus, but I started to feel uneasy about the whole situation. After I shadowed there I realized that the kids at this school were extremely wealthy and most of them were pretty weird. Long story short I ended up applying to the school. A few months later I got an email from the school. It asked if this school was still my first choice. Keep in mind this was before I knew I was going to get in. I was left with a dilemma. If I say no to the email the school wouldn’t accept me, but if I said yes there was no turning back. I wanted to say no, but I wasn’t brave enough to tell my parents that. I ended up replying yes to the email and a few weeks later I got my acceptance letter. I realized I might of made a mistake that will affect me for the next four years of my life. The summer before school started was spent hanging out with all of my old friends before I moved. On the first day of school I realized that the kids in my grade were also extremely wealthy. I seriously tried to keep my mind as opened as possible, but I found out that most of the kids were either spoiled or unlikable. I did find a few friends though, and I still like them to this day. The first few weeks were not that bad. I actually enjoyed a few of my classes and I had fun. One thing that made the experience a lot better was playing on the football team. I soon noticed the extreme differences between private and public school. There are these super rich annoying kids that constantly make fun of me for whatever they can think of. The worst thing is that they continuously make fun of me for being on financial aid and the new, very small two bedroom apartment that I live in. The issue is that I can’t handle it like I would’ve at my old school. I can’t fight them because I would get thrown out of school, but believe me I would absolutely kick their ass. I am just sick of getting called poor. The kids at this school are so annoying. They have never had to work for anything in their life. Another aspect of the school that is tough is the academic rigor. I have at least and hour or two of homework a night after a two hour sports practice. I also hate how much social justice they shove down everyone’s throats. They always talk about all of this political correctness. Everyone is so pretentious.  School is just an overall terrible experience. I wake up and dread going to school. I feel like I am caught in this loop of doing the same shit every day. Wake up - Go to school - Practice - A ton of homework - Sleep. I just feel sad all of the time. I have started procrastinating a lot and I just feel like I’m letting myself slip. I feel so alone and isolated from not only the kids at this school but everyone in my life. I put on such a fake happy face at school. I have found a few things that act as an escape from reality. I play video games with my friends from my old school, I have gotten into weight lifting, and I love playing football, but stuff like that doesn’t make the sadness go away forever. There have been nights were I just stare at the ceiling for hours just thinking about how sad I am and what I can do differently. I blame the sadness on myself and I also tell myself that it will all be fine. I have cried myself to sleep, skipped meals, and stopped enjoying things I used too. I’m hoping it will all get better and I will adjust to these rich kids. They are so clueless to what the real world is like. In the back of my head I know that this is a great opportunity for me, and I am very grateful for that, but if I am miserable what is the point. Regardless, I know my parents won’t let me transfer anyway. I lost a lot of friends from my old school too just because they found out I was going to private school. I am still losing old friends because I never see them. I am not rich enough to be liked at my new school, but I seem too rich to be liked by my old friends. I know I am kind of rambling on right now, but I just feel unhappy all the time. Things just kind of suck right now. I just feel so alone.",12Feb2020,1
321,"I (25M) became friends with a girl online (26F) about 5 months ago. Over the course of time we chatted almost daily. I considered us very good friends. Until 1 day recently she was using my apology against me to get something she wanted. ""

I, of course, being the pushover that I am complied. The next day I told her I was too emotionally invested and needed to detach. At the time she interpreted that as me falling in love with her, which isnt far from the truth, but isnt quite exactly what I meant. 

The next couple days I unadded her on social media without saying anything. We havent spoken since (been about a week).

As I lay here in bed, I want to let her know that I felt used. She has many redeeming qualities, but the things that define friendship weren't really there. She didnt remember small details about me. She didnt really hit me up unless I hit her up. But shes very caring. If I told her I had a rough day she'd ask if I wanted to talk about it. 

So my question now is do I bother reaching out to her to make amends? Do I let her know that I'm feeling resentment towards her? Do I try to salvage a friendship that seemingly blossomed and withered within a small timeframe? 

I want to, but dont know if I'm just going to be laughed at for being overly emotional or needy or clingy.

327,"ive been sure for a few years now that I don’t ever want kids but now that the procedure is close im starting to get scared. I posted about this in the childfree sub and someone there said it’s likely the fear of closing doors and not leaving my options open which really hit the nail on the head

Im still 98% sure I don’t want kids but im worried about what happens if i do change my mind? Adoption and ivf are both expensive and I know reversal is unlikely so for all intents and purposes this is pretty permanent. Plus I know people who are childfree have a hard time in the dating world(im not single now and don’t plan to be anytime soon but i cant be 100% sure my  relationship is guaranteed to last forever, especially since she’s kinda on the fence about children which doesn’t help my anxiety) 

On the other hand im utterly terrified of having kids right now and part of the reason I want the procedure now is so i can prevent myself from making a hormonal decision at 30 or 40 to have kids that ill really never be able to take back 
People in my life have advised me to postpone it and take some time to think about it and im considering doing that but I can’t escape the feeling that everyday I don’t get the procedure is another day i risk bringing a child into the world

329,"My (21F) father, who's 61, has alot of health problems. Unfortunately as I was growing up he broke his back before I was born and was addicted to pain killers and was a heavy smoker. He is, unfortunately, still addicted to pain killers but stopped smoking after his first heart attack when I was a child. Add to this hes diabetic, has had 3 heart attacks and, no matter how much I try to tell him not to, eats alot and unhealthy at that. A few years ago he fell and broke his hip and me and my mom have been trying our best to take care of him. He refuses outside help and relies on us for almost everything. He can walk now but he almost always stays on the couch, sleeps, eats, and watches TV. If he needs anything he wants us to get it. Half the time he just complains to himself about wanting something and when we overhear it we get it for him and he snaps at us for ""taking to long"" even though he didn't ask us. It's to the point hes almost verbally abusing us and demeaning us for anything. Even when me and my mom leave the house for our jobs he will call us at work (we have separate jobs btw) and wants something or just to complain to us, this happens every day we are out of the house, sometimes multiple times a day. I understand he's in pain, but he always is moaning, complaining and talking to himself about nonsense loud enough for us to hear 24/7 when hes not asleep. We will be in the next room trying to sleep and we hear this. It's almost driving me crazy and wondering how much he truly is in pain, the doctors say hes not as bad as he seems to think he is. Is it just the reliance on painkillers? There's times I hear him talking like someone's there or singing/making noises and there is nobody there. I dont know what to do. I've dealt with this for years since I was a teenager but after he broke his hip it's much worse. I've tried to get outside help but he refuses it. If I try to get him to eat better he gets mad. I can't say or do anything as anything sets him off and he gets angry and snappy. My poor mom is dealing with all this too. I'm also wondering if hes psychofrenic like his great grandmother was due to him talking to himself and making up crazy stories. I dont mean to sound heartless, of course I care about my dad but every week it's getting to much to handle and I need help/advice.

344,"Jessica (the toxic suicidal friend) is having a mental breakdown. I don't know what to do. I was going to tell her that I didn't want to be friends anymore tomorrow. I know that like 2 people told me to just leave her, but her mental state is getting worse. I've been telling her and telling her to please go to someone at school, but she says she doesn't feel comfortable with anyone, even her favorite teacher. She says she's only comfortable with me. Jessica is ignoring all my advice and telling me that her mental state will go away eventually. She refuses to tell anyone and reach out for help. 

Jessica and her boyfriend broke up and Jessica is devastated. I know it's for the better that they broke up because Jessica and him used to threaten each other and get distant. I knew from the start it wasn't going good because they were both depressed and the relationship came out of a VERY bad start that pretty much reflected the rest of the relationship. But anyways, Jessica says that she doesn't want to live anymore. She's starving herself because she says she's too fat (she is an average weight). I keep telling her to eat at every chance I can but she says the only way she can be convinced is if I physically harm her. I don't want to do that. She thinks she is fake too and won't explain why. 

I want to tell a staff member at school, or literally just anyone else, but Jessica will harm herself even more. She already told me that. I don't know who to tell. I want to leave the friendship, but no one else will help her. She has other friends, but she refuses help from anyone else but me. It's putting a lot of pressure on me, especially when I have more projects coming up and other friend related issues. Most of the time, I feel like I have to stop whatever I'm doing to do stuff for her and text her for over an hour when she doesn't even listen to my advice. Jessica will turn my advice around to defend her actions, so I have to think about each word I say. For example, I told her that she will move on from her breakup because everyone does. She later told me that she would kill herself because it's ok to do so. I asked why. She told me that everyone moves on so what difference does it make. Jessica also never tries to do anything related to my advice, even when I offer to help her through it.

Anyways, I love both my parents and they love each other, however, there seems to be constant tension between them no matter what. The thing with my dad is that he believes my mother gets all the attention so he’ll often do or say things that brings her down in order for him to look superior. He might do this by talking to her like she’s stupid and say things like, “honey, I know this kind of stuff it hard for you to understand”, or he will make a big deal out of things that she’s wrong about. 

I’ve tried to talk to him about it but any time I do, he plays victim and say, “yup, it’s always dads fault”.

Living the 2 lives has really put me at risk for social isolation, so I don’t have a lot of supports during this hard time, just my fiancé and his/our (his originally, became mine when I moved in with my fiancé) friend group that basically invite him places, and me but only by proxy essentially to do things. I have friends at uni but because I have to travel home so often I haven’t formed any close bonds like past gossiping and going for drinks/lunch. 

With my family falling apart and the pressure of school I’ve been heavily debating if I should move back to the town with my uni in it. I’m tired of not having supports and I want to be near my family. However, fiancé doesn’t want to move, argues about it and doesn’t seem to understand why I do...

He wants a new job anyways as well, so it’s not career holding him back, it’s his family and friends.

350,"Some back story. My(23F) family is originally from up north and a lot of us still remain there. I don't talk to most of my family due to their crap (this is important later). My mother &amp; I don't call up there to talk to My Great Grandmother very much because of the other people who live there. These people were/are not good people to us in the past years. Its always one of them who answers the phone and it brings us bad memories. (Great Grandmother still has a landline). Me and mother live down south.

So earlier in the year my Great grandmother (GG) developed early signs of dementia and her health started failing. Of course my Grandmother (GM) immediately went up north to check on her and the bobbleheads that live with her were acting a fool. Just stressing her out, not letting her do things in her own house, and slight neglect. My Gran of course whipped this into shape. My older entitled first cousin, we'll call her Karen(EC), apparently was one of the biggest fools. 

The women in my family are stubborn and tend not to speak when something is wrong. I just found out today that, for a long while now, Karen has been preventing my GM from calling my GG. Won't let her speak to her or tell her how's shes doing. The only reason I know now is because my GM's other sister called today to complain about EC and I overheard. I am livid. As I mentioned, I NEVER call so I decided I should and was able to get my GG on the phone and let her talk to GM.

Now, like I mentioned before, GG has early stage demntia and she was sad that she had not heard from her daughters in a while. Their conversation broke my heart. GG was trying to understand why GM stopped calling her and GM was crying telling GG that she loved her and it will never happen again. I am young, so the older people in the family won't listen to me but I am so EFFING ENRAGED. 

What should I do? I know causing a scene will just stress GM and GG out and possibly cause all of us in the South to eff up those in the North amd that won't solve anything. I am trying not to 😢",12Feb2020,1

Tonight after a lot of ridiculous fighting with my roommates. I said enough is enough and one of us needs to move out. So I laid it out like this. Either she would have to pay my boyfriend and I out of our parts of the security deposit or we would pay her hers and she will leave. 

I found out tonight that she never planned on actually paying me back my part of the security deposit. I was supposed to leave in August and she said she would send me the money when the lease ends. Turns out she wants to stay in the house for a couple of years and lied about ever wanting to pay me or my boyfriend back.

So needless to say I don't actually trust her to pay me back my part. I gave her the choice to choose who leaves . I don't mind leaving I just want to make sure I get my money back from her.

If she chooses to stay and says that she will pay us back our parts, is there any sort of contact I can draw up that essentially says that she will pay us back or I'm going to take her to court over it?.

356,"If you think I’m a bad daughter, please let me know respectfully and explain why and what I can do to change. I really don’t need any insults. Do I know I have made a lot of mistakes and don’t some shitty things. I’m not a perfect person or the perfect or best daughter. What I don’t know is if the things I’ve done make me a bad daughter. 

So I live with my mom (53F). I go to a local community college, have a part time internship, and am doing well in school. However, I haven’t always done well when remembering to do household chores. There have been many times where I’ve forgotten to do laundry for some time that a I had a big pile on my hamper (I own a lot of clothes so not having clean clothes isn’t an issue). There have been other times I’ve forgotten to unload the dishwasher and make dinner once every week like I promised my mom. I’m starting with once a week to get accustomed to doing this and then I’ll see if I can do it more than that depending on my homework load. 

I am getting better at this though. I decided that I would use my google calendar that I use for homework (because that’s not something that I forget to check) to put reminders to chores in there. This has definitely helped me remember to do certain chores like taking out the trash and making dinner once a week. I’ve done some worse things than that like the time I forgot to write in my moms birthday card on her birthday (yes I know it’s awful). And I know what to do so I never forget it again. I have ADHD and I know it’s not an excuse for me being this forgetful, but it does contribute a little bit. However, I will still do everything I can to not be forgetful because I care about my mom and don’t want to be a bad daughter. 

So tonight when my mom got home from work, our dog threw up on the couch and in her bedroom. I was in the bathroom when this happened so I didn’t see this happen but I saw the through up after. She became very upset and I helped her take the things that cover the couch cushions off of the couch cushion and I guess I was doing it too slow so she yelled at me and got mad at me for moving too slow. It didn’t take me like 10 minutes to take the covers off. I just wasn’t doing it extremely fast like she would’ve. 

She also got mad and yelled at me for not putting the blankets and other cushions (the ones that didn’t have dog puke) on the couch right away after we removed the cushion covers that had vomit on them. So there are two reasons why I didn’t do this right away. The first was that my mom likes a lot of things in her house to be very peticular so I was worried if I put something on the couch in the wrong way, she would get mad as she already was mad. She took some of the cushions and slammed them on the couch cause she was mad. The other reason was that I was scared of her getting mad. She’s probably yelled at me at least 100 times since I was 12 so it’s made me scared of doing something that could upset her and her being upset. Idk if that’s a normal amount considering the situation or not.

She also got mad because there were these things left out on the counter that were from these boxes that were unpacked when I used to live in the dorm and apparently she asked me to put them away 5 times this weekend and I didn’t do it. I don’t remember her asking me this 5 times but maybe it was because I was super stressed because I had two exams coming up: one yesterday and one today so I had to study a lot and maybe putting those things away had slipped my mind. She also yelled at me and brought up this one time she had to wake me up when the cleaning lady was at our house cause I wake up to an alarm. This has only happened once. 

Basically since I was 12, she yelled at me many times for being forgetful, getting bad grades, and she used to be more hard on me if I would go to school without makeup. I do think she has reasons for being upset. I won’t ever deny that. I’ve done some shitty things and am trying to not make mistakes. But do I deserve to be yelled at this often for my mistakes? Am I a bad daughter here? That’s what I don’t know.

Like I said, I know I’ve done some shitty things and made a lot of mistakes, but I don’t know if this much yelling is justifiable especially because of the impact it’s had on my mental health. I’m now afraid of my mom yelling and her being upset with me makes me anxious. It didn’t use to be that way. Also I’ve thought about commuting suicide since I was 14 because I couldn’t take my mom yelling at me so much. I’ve told my mom I’ve thought about this and she was offended that I would want to commit suicide because of her being hard on me after everything she’s done for me. 

She does do a lot for me. I live at home without paying anything. She pays for my tuition, credit card, and other things. She cooks dinner a most of the time due to my homework load and I am very grateful for all she’s done for me and ask if she needs any help with anything if I’m not busy. She seems to think that because she does all these things for me, her yelling is often ok. She also seems to think that because of the trauma she went through as a child, because my stresses in life aren’t as big as hers, and because her yelling at me isn’t nearly as bad as what her mom put her through, my feelings mostly aren’t valid. Is she right? 

Also the trauma she went through as a kid is the reason why she gets so mad if something’s left out or a little messy. She told me this a couple months ago. Her mom had schizophrenia and was a big hoarder. I don’t think I’m a hoarder, but she seems to think so. I know that knowing this information, I should remember to keep everything clean and make sure nothings left out. I’m trying to make sure that my stress from schoolwork doesn’t prevent me from forgetting to do those things for my mom. 

So am I a bad daughter? Is my mom right to yell at me? Again, please don’t insult me if you think I’m a bad daughter. Please tell me nicely why I’m a bad daughter and what I can do to change.

TL;DR: I’ve done some shitty things and made a lot of mistakes and my mom has yelled at me a lot for it. I don’t know if I deserve to be yelled at and if I’m a bad daughter.",12Feb2020,1

358,"So, the place I lived before this had very reasonable rent so I was able to afford a decent car, and cable and all that fun stuff. I was forced to move and choose a place with my same roomate that on paper, I could technically afford. But now I have expensive rent, expensive car payment which started to drain my money. As time went on I started using my credit cards to supplement my bill money and it got a little out of hand. I knew it was a bad idea but I hated asking my dad for money. He would always give it to me. I felt terrible because I would ignore phone calls from him because I really knew I wasn't doing well, and I hated thinking: hes going to ask how I am, and I can lie and say I'm good, or I can tell the truth and he'll try to send me money, I felt very guilty and parasitic. So I did the former, and used the cards so I could make payments on time. 


I made a budget sheet and cut out everything I didnt absolutely need, which helped, but I'm stuck with this rent, and car payment, and it's not even worth trading down cause I probably owe 2 grand more then its worth.
I owe somewhere around 2500-3000 on the credit cards which thankfully could probably be much worse, but it's becoming difficult to make the minimum payment which is totally fucking me because the amount of interest that accumulates is like the same amount that I can afford to pay so I'm stuck in this cycle. The credit card company calls me 5 times a day because I'm late paying, I never answer because im just trying to keep it together but it stresses me out so much like every waking hour. 

What do you think I should do? I know if I close the cards, they still accumulate interest. Like if it was one number that I owed I could pay it down but it never goes down. Do I call the credit card company and explain my case? I'm sure they have heard it a billion times. Is there a 3rd party company that will buy the debt and I can make payments to them? Do I file for bankruptcy? 

I absolutely accept I am fully responsible for getting myself in this situation, I knew better, but felt I had no other choice. I work 6 days at almost 50 hours so it's also hard to think about a second job, but maybe I'm being a baby and need to suck it up to make more money. It's hard because this whole thing is really become the focal point of my life and I'm having trouble even experiencing other parts of my life because this weighs me down constantly. 

Any advice would be much appreciated",12Feb2020,1
359,"I (23M) have been taking dance classes, and been lucky enough to organically meet 3 attractive girls there. I have a good professional job, and I am in fantastic shape (I work-out regularly, and eat clean). I am introverted, and a bit reserved though, so it takes me more than the usual time to open up. However, most people who know me, tell me that I am smart and funny.

Here's my situation with the 3 women, I am unclear about what to do about it

1. First one - we started talking a bit, and I did ask her out, but she said no, telling me she has a bf. I stopped talking to her subsequently. Just hi's. I have been away for 3 months, and seems like she's been through a breakup (looks devastated af)
2. Second one - We got along pretty well. although she isn't exactly my type. we did go for a movie once, and chat online frequently. But I am not that into her, and not looking forward to having her as my gf. She's a nice person though. I like talking to her.
3. Third one - She is nice, we get along well, and she clearly likes me (so far). Seems to be my type. We always end up chatting, when she is taking the class. But we aren't close enough yet for me to ask her out, or make a move. But she is a bit infrequent to the classes, and I don't like taking the class hoping she'd show up. (So i just focus on the class, and taking things as they come). I find her interesting, but there's quite a bit of work to do before we get anywhere.

As I am feeling right now, I want to figure out what's up with 1, make better friends with 2 (so we can hang out as friends) and date 3. But i don't know if it's the right expectation, or how should I go about taking this forward.

How should I approach this situation? I am still looking forward to meeting new people as well.",12Feb2020,1
361,"Long story short I graduated year 12, went straight to uni and spent 2 years studying only to realise that I wasn’t enjoying my course and couldn’t see myself doing it as a career. As a result I had a mental breakdown, came home to live with my parents and applied to study a different course but unfortunately didn’t get into it. 

I am 21 now and if I reapply for my dream course next year I will be 25-26 when I graduate.  I feel like I am being left behind, all the people I went to school with will be in their 3ed year of uni next year and most of them have found partners and have moved out of their parents homes. Heck, even my younger brother will be finished his apprenticeship before I’m finished uni.

Ill cut to the point. My dad is a successful business owner and recently sold his house for 2 million dollars so he isn’t strapped for money by any means.

I had some pretty bad luck and have been out on medical leave for almost a year now while my wife is working and Im at home taking care of my daughter to the best of my abilities. I was the bread winner so being disabled is a pretty big hit and I had to take out a loan to keep the family afloat till I can get back on my feet.

Meanwhile my dad lives a lavish life drives nice cars and wears really expensive clothing.

As a dad I couldn’t fathom my fortune not being my daughters . I mean literally everyday I wake up and do the things I do to ensure she is safe and happy.So it’s really shocking to me that my father can go about his life without really caring what my finances are or even offer a dime to help out. I mean we have a pretty good relationship but he doesnt financially help AT ALL.

growing up he was like that too and accordingly I became my own man and was doing pretty OK for myself but now I’m all fucked up and it would be such a relief if this guy (my dad) would toss me a bone. Ultimately I will recover and I will fix everything but it would be nice to have some help for once and not have to pay interest on a 20k loan.

TLDR my dads well off and I just had a pretty rough year due to medical issues... am I being  an entitled millennial thinking my dad would just help me out this once?

In the recent time I bought some books that I wanted to read. 

But the problem is, that every time when I start to read them, I feel like ""it's too much"" at once. I can't remember all details or any advice given in the book.

I always feel pressured into remembering anything and if I didn't touch the book for one week I feel like I could start new from the beginning.

That causes me to actually dislike reading, since I feel more stressed after than before.

E.g. I am reading a book about speech tactics and human behaviour (just because of interest). But since I can't, of course, remember every sentences or trick, I feel pressured into making notes etc., but that feels more like ""learning"" than actually just enjoying a book out of interest. 

I don't have anything else in common with that kind of field, not in my job or anywhere else, I'm just reading that book because I'm interested in that topic, but I can't enjoy it, since I stress myself out too much. Reading a book feels like a competition for me against myself.

I (20F) just got back from spending the past semester studying abroad in China. I was supposed to spend this current semester there as well, but with the outbreak of the coronavirus my program was cancelled and I was sent home early. 

While this was upsetting for a multitude of reasons, as I had grown to truly love China, one of the most upsetting things about going home was that I was leaving behind my boyfriend (20M). We had only been officially dating for a month when we were told I had to leave, but we had been very close friends for about 4 months before that. He was my best friend in China, and the only guy that I’ve ever felt this strongly about. 

Since I’ve been home, we’ve still been in daily contact, and our feelings are just as strong as ever. But I don’t know what to do. It could be anywhere from 8 months- 2 years before I’ll be able to go back to China, even though I’m definitely planning on going back. 

Is trying to have a long distance relationship even a feasible idea? He says he wants to wait for me, but we’re both so young and this is both of our first relationship. Is it fair of me to ask him to wait for me? There’s also the cultural issue, and the fact that certain members of my white Southern family probably wouldn’t be so pleased that I’m dating a Chinese guy. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as I’m very torn on what I should do. It’s too soon for me to say I’m in love with him, but I do love and care about him very much. The idea of not being with him breaks my heart, but could that just be my youthful naivety?

After a long time of consideration and thinking I know I want to do this, even if it isn’t forever. It’s good money and I could really get back on my feet doing it.

393,"I don't want to make it long because I feel like shit. 

My grandfather is an alcoholic and today he was very stupid in the morning and was bothering the lady who cleans my house and I saw him sending kisses to her and bothering her. The lady told him to leave or leave her, did not see well. 


Now I arrive from work and my mother tells me that my grandfather was walking through the house of a woman with questionable reputation who lives in the next block.

My grandma, She still works as a nurse and my grandfather retired years ago and until a few months ago he went back to work as a watchman in a municipal building and all the money he gets he goes and spend it on alcohol and whores.


 I have a gigantic resentment to people like that because my dad was the same before he died and although I love my grandfather so much shit is getting out of control and although I have my uncle ""his son"" and my brother ""his grandson"" it seems that no one gives a shit qnd they let my grandfather do this shit. 

I feel that all the responsibility falls on me and I would like to have nothing to do with my grandfather but at the same time he has taken care of me and practically has ""raise"" me and my brother. I don't know what to do and I know he's going to get old soon and if it's not me or my brother, he's not going to have anyone.",12Feb2020,1
396,"TLDR: starting high school this year, need advice on how to connect with others better. 



To be honest, I’m not very active on Reddit, so I’ll just try my best to explain things as well as I can. Sorry if it seems awkward or forced. 

In the short amount of time I’ve been alive, loneliness seems to cling to me like static. I didn’t have any friends until I was about 7 and I have no strong ties to my family aside from my sister who is 8 years older than me and has been consumed by work for a majority of time. All of my friendships have either fallen through or feel distant in a way. I know that  since I’m the person who seems to be attracting these types of relationships, the issue lies with me and that’s why I’m here. I desperately want to change. 

(The next paragraph is essentially a run down of the relationships I’ve had throughout my life in case it gives better background. )
For as long as I could remember, I’ve yearned for a “true connection” where there was mutual love and acceptance for each other and things felt natural to all parties. This true connection made everyone feel safe enough to confide in each other and disclose secrets and generally be open with each other. However, the first half of my life (I’m 14) was void of any connection. My mother and father were busy working parents, my sister was a teen grappling with her adolescent angst (just as I am right now) and we didn’t have visitors often at all. I had no friends in school and even then, in grades 1-5 I felt isolated. My elementary school was filled with snobby parents and kids and I felt like I had to fit some sort of gimicky role in order to be accepted (or laughed at, but hey I was a lonely kid who would take any companion.) However, as I entered middle school, my friends started to be more open with me. They’d tell me about the issues going on in their lives and I was so so glad. I felt like I was closer to that “true connection” I’ve dreamed of, and it was nice until I became co-dependent. Their issues were now mine and I lost myself in an odd mixture of concern, frustration, anxiety, and helplessness. I was in a bad place and organized away to cut off ties over the summer with a few other unsatisfied individuals. These people were special to me. They were the closest to true connection that I’ve ever gotten to. I was happy for a few months and then they left me with little to no explanation and was heartbroken for months. Since then, I’ve repaired myself a bit, but I still feel lost in my group, like they don’t understand me. 

I’ve recognized many things that could be holding me back, such as:
•isolating myself when unhappy
•hiding my thoughts, wants, and emotions when they can cause conflict
•taking on an almost martyr-like role in relationships and neglecting myself 
•waiting for the “right people”
•confining myself by thinking “nobody can understand/connect with you and if they can, they don’t want to”
•confining myself by thinking that the people who will walk into my life will hurt, disrespect, or leave me if i give them enough time


I understand that I said a lot when few words were necessary, but I very desperately want to change and if the background helps anybody understand a bit better, I’d consider it worth it. I start high school in September of this year in a large school and want to be able to feel understood and connected to someone, whether it be a friend or a lover or anything else.

But what do I do who do I call WTFFF there is definitely something up there and I am terrified and the most confrontation I have had with it is knocking on the ceiling as it bumps around and just listened in terror

401,"So, I want to pursue a career in Adult Entertainment. I signed up for a website and got a multitude of offers due to being a fairly attractive girl, some of them being very legitimate with portfolios included with references and websites. This has been a very tempting route for me as I am at a point in my life where I feel as if there is nothing for me here where my home once was. I no longer have a home of my own and the money in these opportunities could really help me get back on my own two feet and maybe come back here when I am in a stable position. However, one issue presents itself: the remainder of my family. I have cut most of them out of my life due to their toxic surroundings and attitudes, but for the ones who remain in my life.. I am unsure of what I would tell them. I have considered telling them that I am pursuing a career in modeling, but I am afraid they will ask to see the results of the shoot or worse even want to attend it, and if that were to happen... the jig would be up. I can’t dare tell my brothers and mom this stuff. So, how do I go about this? I realize it’s bad to lie and especially about something so big, but in this case... I feel as if it’s justified.

404,"So to start this off I do understand that you can't be diagnosed over the internet and advice does not substitute for an actual diagnosis, I am simply here to ask if there is a posibility.

 Heres a bit of background: I've been wondering for years now if I might have OCD but I've been afraid to ask my parents to take me to be validated. I was emotionally neglected as a child and as you can imagine messed me up pretty bad. It's made it really hard for me to reach out and ask for help because of a huge fear of being a burden and that is why I have yet to ask in person incase I'm completely off the tracks. I am currently diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia and ADHD incase that info is needed.

Now on to the actuall topic. I have suspected I have OCD for a while is because I obsess over certain things and can't do certain thing without doing another first very often. I cannot be in a room with a door open, it makes me physically uncomfortable and I HAVE to close it or i cannot do what I need to (study, eat, sleep. anything in general). I cannot submit an essay, begin a youtube video, put on full screen etc unless the arrow is EXACTLY in the right position. There are so many more things that I feel like I have to do, It makes my skin crawl and makes me feel physically sick at times if I dont do the specific thing. 

If i wrote everything down it would make this entry to long but i hope that gives you a small gist of things. So psychologysts, people with OCD or who have a loved one or a friend with OCD, id there a possibility I might have it? should I check it out just in case?",12Feb2020,1

I moved to Canada  in 2017 and met this wonderful woman. We have had our ups and downs, were separate for a while and then got back together.  
I have been having some anxiety which has just surfaced within the last two years.  
Just some backstory is the fact that I live with some extended family. I've lived there for 3 years now and honestly Its just an incredibly toxic place. Being there puts me on edge and it feels like i've been walking on eggshells. Being there just perpetuates my anxiety.  


I've made plans to move out this april and then move in with her in June (which i am very much looking forward to as being away from the toxicity and finally having my freedom).  


My girlfriend Is wonderful, shes kind, loving and gives you that look that you know youre in a safe place. Late 2017 we broke up because I just kind of went numb... I think it was a mix of everything from home and just needing to finish exams for university that stressed me out beyond belief.  
Come 2020 we've been dating for over a year, stuff is good. The problem is that for some reason i feel distant or disconnected sometimes. Shes amazing and being with her makes me feel calm, happy and at ease. 

My biggest fear is that the feeling of numbness will resurface. There has been no signs of it but its something that arises often and i'm not sure how to just enjoy.

He tends to get a little bit annoying with nonstop gossip and is generally somewhat lazy on certain tasks. The problem is the yelling. It stresses me out so much I can't stop thinking about quitting. I switched shops (same job, different butchery) just two weeks ago and the guy (Ted) who got me the job had some high expectations, and it feels like I can't really meet them because I'm stressed out that much all the time. When Bob makes a minor mistake Ted goes rampant, he has no problem taking it to the boss and making a bigger deal than it is. But when I make the same mistake all I get is a smile and a ""oh, dont worry about that"" 
My boss of course is aware of my mistakes but rarely talks to me about them, he goes on and...yells at Bob for being a bad mentor instead. Bob's expertise is not so great, but he's a peoples person whereas I'm quite good with any given task, except i'm a lot more introverted and hate having to sell my product forcibly. At this point i'm just not sure what I hate the most:

•Yelling and my whole team including part-time Stacy(21) who's passive aggresive with me at all times.
•Piles of papers and all the missing passwords
•Getting hyped and undermined at the same time
•Myself for not doing my best and feeling like 2/3rds of the team are projecting their bad feelings towards me
•Working for someone else
•Doing something I'm not quite invested in

I'm pondering if I should quit or find the farts in me and force through a few months until I pass my drivers license. But at the same time I'm unsure if I'm just going to keep having issues everywhere I go because of inability to deal with work environments? Honestly if I would get yelled at by my current boss like Bob does I'd probably quit the same day.

415,"First, I’ve been having a few issues the past year at my job, and now I’m at my break point with it all. 

Starting last year in May 2019 I moved to a new department since it was a job I had my mind and goals set on for the past few months; was excited to start the job except for one issue, I was being harassed by a guy. We are just coworkers and I did not like him in anyway besides friends. Well, he kept trying to convince me to hang out with him and just give him a chance; he was very persistent about the whole thing. I got sick of it and eventually told him yes I would hang out with him but kept canceling because something did not feel right to me and I didn’t want him to get the wrong impression. He got pissed and started talking shit about me and putting me down to basically our whole department, which I did not deserve and this gave me tremendous anxiety, especially since I was nothing but kind and understanding towards him. This really cut into my training and I let it get to me so much that it made me sick but he didn’t care. Well, a bunch of my coworkers got sick of his bullshit and told my managers and HR on him; he eventually left me alone. Things started to get better, we eventually talked it out, I forgave him and we moved on with our lives but that experience still sticks with me and I’m afraid to talk to or connect with anyone else at this point. More happened but to much to write on here. 

Another situation came up with one of his close guy friends, who  worked in the same department with us. I was just being a nice and kind coworker to this guy, did not like him in that way either was just being myself. And he started to take my kindness wrong to and thought I was into him; and I was not. We got along well for a few months until back in September 2019 when he got really pissed at me for wearing a dress to work and getting looks from different guys when we where in the kitchen grabbing coffee one morning. I found this to be really controlling, weird and creepy so I started to distance myself from him and he talked shit about me to and is still persistent to this day, trying to talk to me and be friends but I’m afraid to talk to him and be nice to him in fear that he will take it wrong again. And I’m tired of people blaming me for his actions, I’m a kind person, I don’t deserve this type of treatment. I never sent off any special signals or even shown interest one time. I don’t have to be with someone I don’t want to be with or show interest if I don’t want to. I did nothing with any of these guys but still to this day I still get anxiety trying to talk to any guys at work in fear he will find out and talk shit about me or tell that person false stuff about me. I know it’s just a job but I spend a good amount of time there and I feel so uncomfortable and anxious but I don’t want to say anything in fear that I will end up becoming the problem. And I know it seems that way but I’m not and done with people taking their shit out on me. 

The current situation is with my desk mate, he’s a 60 year old guy that sits next to me and basically micromanages me and it’s starting to get annoying. He also makes uncomfortable and inappropriate comments about my appearance. But the biggest issue is that he monitors my time. Sometimes I will be late for work and he keeps tabs on me and will message me telling me how I should not be late for work or take longer lunches, when I don’t do these things on purpose. We are not even on the same assignments anymore, I just sit next to him and I get all my work done everyday and get positive feedback from my current team. I’m doing the best I can but this is the last straw, I’m done with people taking their emotional garbage and issues out on me, I don’t deserve it anymore; and I’m At a breaking point with it all. I’m a grown ass women that doesn’t need to be with somebody just because they want something from me and for damn sure I don’t need to be monitored. I had a discussion with my manager yesterday but I’m afraid that I’m going to lose my job because this guy knows a lot of higher ups in the company because he has been there for five years so he thinks he can do whatever and get away with it. I just feel like I am being treated unfairly and this is starting to turn into a bully type situation because this guy talks to the two other guys mentioned above and I’m pretty sure they talk shit about me. It makes me feel so alone because I always get the bad parts about me/my flaws/ mistakes and other negative stuff pointed out to me all the time and I don’t need it from people at work. It has made me extremely anxious and not trusting of anyone. I’m starting to think I’m the problem, and I’ve been going to therapy to help with the thoughts and to help me cope with it all but I’m sick of having to manage other people’s issues because they can’t manage them on their own. There is more to this story but I don’t want to write it all out. I just need advice on what I should do next because I’m at a breaking point, like I said before. I don’t want to quit my job and I know I need to make some positive changes. Any advice would be great, thank you!",12Feb2020,1

419,"Hey reddit, a little bit of preface, I work in Downtown Los Angeles at a restaurant/bar that closes pretty late. Every day I park in the same parking structure across the street because it is discounted for employees for the building I work in.

Tonight I got off work and walked to the parking structure and began my ascent up the stairs as I had parked on the 3rd floor (as I usually do.) The design of the stairway is kind of important to the issue I’m dealing with so bare with me. It’s about 8 stairs up, then a landing which u-turns you up to another 8 stairs.

I climbed up the stairs tonight and when I got to the landing before the final 8 stairs I needed to take to get to my car, I notice a homeless man slumped up against the wall. He was facing the set of stairs I was walking up. Eyes wide open just fixed straight on where I was walking up.

At this point I got really nervous, I was alone and maybe this man would try to give me a hard time or try to rob me or something. I decided it would be best to just walk past him and up to my car without making more eye contact than I already had.

I got up to the landing where he was on and he hadn’t moved a muscle. I decided to pass him and not make eye contact. My goal was to avoid conflict because he was obviously high out of his mind. Once I passed I glimpsed back for a brief second to make sure he wouldn’t come at me from behind. In this moment I realized he was foaming at the mouth and his eyes that I had locked eyes with earlier were clouded white. I stood there for about three seconds staring at him and realized he was dead.

Now the thing I’m here to ask you guys Is how do I cope with this? I locked eyes with him and for some reason I can not get that image out of my brain. It’s like it’s stuck with me forever. I’ve never seen a lifeless person before but I feel like I can’t sleep because every time I close my eyes I see his cloudy white pupils staring back at me. I feel like I’m back in that stairwell again.

I’m scared to have to go back to work because I’m going to have to park in the same spot and go up the same stairs. The image of his dead face looking back at me won’t go away and it’s absolutely terrifying. I don’t know if I will be able to go to sleep tonight because I’m still so shaken up by it that image. I really need some help here guys. Thank you so much for reading.

420,"alright so this is kinda difficult. it was around 2:15 am and me and my other friend were at gym parking lot getting ready to leave and my other friend calls me crying. 

he’s also drunk, and keeps repeating “i fucked up, i fucked up.” now we’re all 18 so he usually hides a bottle of liquor in his rooms for time like this. me and my friend offered to go to his house and talk to him but he kept saying he wants to be alone.

he didn’t tell us what was wrong only that hue fucked up and wanted to be alone. from experience ik being alone is a horrible feeling and makes things worse.

so we would’ve just went to his house either way, but there’s 2 reasons we didn’t. 

1. It’s 2 in the morning we would wake everyone up.

2. He has a history of getting in problems with his parents so that’s most likely what happened.

On the other hand it might be an opportunity to make new friends and she's also a really nice girl so I would feel bad about making up an excuse and not going. What should I do?,12Feb2020,1
422,"I was a compulsive liar since I was 8 (19 now), I've taken it too far and I want to get out, but I don't know how.   


Some context:

Lying came almost as a reflex for me once my family moved to California. Back then, I think I did it just to be more interesting or ""cool"" to all the new people I would be meeting. It's continued on all the way into high school, and right now, I'm just living the two lives I made for myself by lying to people, both online and in person.   
A lot of the friends I've lied to in person aren't friends anymore - either because I've come clean or we parted ways for one reason or another. Those hurt like hell, because I felt that they were real.   
It's a similar story for me online. I joined a small community (I was 13 at the time) and lied about who I was for basically the same reasons; to seem ""cool"" and basically attention seek. Fast forward a few months, I felt comfortable ""revealing"" who I was and instead of coming completely clean, I created a new identity for myself. That new me was a mix of truths (I was who I was physically) but I'd grafted in some lies for essentially all the same reasons.   


A few years later, I'm still very close friends with them, and even in a relationship with someone based off this fake personality. I'm having fun, so is she, so are they. Everything is good and relaxed. Even the relationship seems real; I care for her so much but I've lied to her ever since we met, and I've lied to all of those friends ever since we've met.   


How do I get out of this? I've been trying for almost a year now to just stop and tell the full truth, but I've never been able to tell the full story. I've only ever been able to tell a little more of the truth, and a few lies to help make the story a little more coherent. I want to stop the lies and stop faking who I am, but I'm so scared of the hurt that I know is coming. I know I'm going to hurt, that I've accepted that; but I'm so scared of hurting the others, especially the girl I've come to love. I've tried to tell the truth so many time, but every time I try I end up falling back on a little truth, and a few more lies.   
I've done all the self loathing and the guilt, and I don't think that will ever stop; I just want to know how to get out, at least so I won't be hurting them anymore.",12Feb2020,1

428,"So I work at a bar.  I'm not a bartender, bouncer, or a manger but most nights by the end of the night I'm the only guy there. The bar I work at is the latest opened in my area so we get a lot of restaurant employees from around and business people because of the hotels and commercial areas around.

I'm 6 foot 200lbs. Not big but I do go to the gym often lately. I prefer handling situations with words but if someone swings at me I'll swing back. 

Tonight we had a situation escalate between restaurant workers of a different place and business people from out of town. I really dont know what happened. Being the only guy there I put myself in between them and separated them. That worked till they called each other out for pointing at each other. This confrontation was much more heated. One of the business people was antagonizing me saying I couldn't kick him out. I didnt want to use physical force to kick him out only because I didnt want to risk my job and a law suit. I just stood in the middle stopping a fight from happening but being antagonized by the outta town busness people. I had help from other people which kind of got out of control but miraculously no actual fighting happened in the bar.  The restaurant regulars left but the business people stayed and kept antagonizing me asking me who I was side I was on. 

After everything, I felt like I was too calm. Like I should be yelling and forcing one group to leave ( even tho the business people would have pushed to be more physically) but that would be a fine line to walk for me. 

At the end of the night no fighting happened in the bar. Just a huge scene. Maybe the restaurant employees might have hard feelings towards me and maybe a fight happened in the parking lot. But that's outside of my problem. 

Any advice on handling situations like this?",12Feb2020,1
429,"We're both 20.


My main question is whether or not this is a healthy relationship that should be retained, on behalf of her actions and mine.  

Apparently, her and this guy have been talking for 4 months but were made exclusive in the span of a week between the following events. My friends' theory is that she cheated with me, regrets it, and is covering her tracks, but that's just speculation.  
I've been friends with this girl for 4 years and we've been very close. We've talked for probably... thousands of hours at this point. She's the only person that gave me a hug every single day in the 11th grade after my mother passed away. I love her very much and we... were, very close. There was always something between us, enough for our peers to notice and comment on it, but nothing ever happened due to the two of us not being single.  

We've maintained contact since graduation and, although she goes to school 2 and a half hours away, have seen each other and talked. I went through a bad break up of 4 years that she helped me through in August, for example. She was back in town last month for Christmas break and we got together for lunch, and the next day she said she wanted to see me, so she came over to my house and we smoked pot. I kept getting lost in her eyes so I just asked her if I could hold her hand, and we did, for about an hour.  

It's a month later (last week) and she's back in town. I come over to see her the night before she goes back. I pick her up from her house and we go sit in my car at a park and talk. Eventually, I hold her hand again. I keep getting lost in her eyes again so I just... crack, and tell her I want to kiss her. She says she's always wanted to and we do, for 20-30 minutes, in picturesque fashion, as the playlist I'd imagined this happening to, coincidentally was on. There was some sexual contact and besides that it was extremely intimate, passionate, and sensual. Afterwards, we held each other and looked at each other, smiling for 10 minutes, telling the other what we liked about them, reminiscing, laughing. I dropped her off and gave her a kiss goodnight.  

I make plans a few days after that to go to my friend's house show in the town she lives in (huge college town) and see an old friend. I tell her this in the beginning of the week and that I'm going to the house show (twice), and we plan to see each other Sunday. Later on in the week, I'm still texting her and telling her about the house show, and it finally registered to her, after the third time, that I'm going to a house show in her town and that house show happens to be the one she's going to, and I tell her I'd be happy to see her there.  Anyway, she shows up with her boyfriend. I'm having a good time and dancing, and after the final band's set I motioned to her to see if she wanted to go get stoned. She nodded her head, and I headed out back. A short while later, she comes outside, alone, although she'd been glued to her boyfriend and friend the entire night. I ask her if that's her boyfriend, she says yes. I tell her ""I..."" and point to my heart, and at her, and she says sorry. She didn't owe me any explanation, but she poured her heart out. I asked her if she was sober, and she said no, but she meant it. It was extremely sappy, things like ""I've always cared about you,"" ""There's just something about you"", ""I feel like I can trust you"", ""You're such a good person inside and out"", etc. and tells me ""I love you"". I'm really taken aback and I tell her similar things back and told her that I loved her as well. We planned to see each other Sunday, she went back inside, and I smoked some more pot and then immediately got obliterated out of heartbreak.

 So the next day I ask if I can see her and we make plans for Sunday, as we did originally. Sunday rolls around, I wait an extra few hours at my friend's house, and she cancels, so I leave. I told her I wanted to talk to her and it's okay if she doesn't want to, but she calls me at midnight. I told her I just wanted to talk to her sober and apologized for a drunk voice mail I left her (it was just saying I love you, nothing crazy). I told her that I wasn't wanting a relationship necessarily, or for her to drop this guy for me or anything, but that I had feelings for her. She told me she didn't have them back. She was extremely baked and wasn't being honest with me, and in fact, I felt wasn't being respectful towards me. The way she spoke was extremely demeaning; I told her she didn't need to tell me anything, if this is uncomfortable for you it's okay, and she said ""why would I be uncomfortable? not like a huge part of my life is telling me they have feelings for me haha"" - talking to me as if I were a toddler, just treating the conversation very much like a joke, and a lot about her - she asked what I meant by feelings and I told her I just thought she was an amazing woman, and she said ""oh haha what makes you say that?"" Just not treating it maturely. The thing that hurt me the most out of that conversation was that she was extremely dishonest the entire time. She wouldn't be explicit about anything and I told her it wouldn't be her fault, not to feel bad and that her feelings aren't her choice, but she would just not be straight with me at all. She contradicted herself a few times about things but basically told me that she doesn't have feelings for me, and she's with this other guy. I asked her if she felt anything when we kissed last week, and she said ""not really, but I've always wanted to kiss you"" (?). I explained to her that I felt close to her when we had that moment and she said ""haha well yeah, it's because we were in close proximity"" - it hurt, because the way she was in the moment, and the things she was saying made me think it wasn't just my moment, but ours. I asked if she needed let go and she said no, so we made small talk for another 10 minutes, and at the end agreed to be friends.  

I'm pretty fucked up about this right now, and I don't know if I should talk to her anymore. I don't understand how you can be so important to someone for so long, have an extremely intimate and sensual moment with them, a week later tell them you love them and how much you love them and why, and then the next day telling you they don't care about you. It's up to her to do whatever she wants and she doesn't owe me, but I honestly feel like her actions weren't... the kindes. I'm not sure if I should be friends with her anymore, not only because I have feelings for her and it would hurt, but I feel like she's playing with me, and I feel disrespected. I feel like just an option to her. It feels like filled niches her boyfriend didn't and that's the only reason she cared about me. I don't ever get that vulnerable around anyone, and I thought she thought that I was special to her. I'm just not, and I don't know if I can handle talking to her, and I don't know if she really loves me.

tl;dr: close friends with girl for 4 years, platonic with feelings but a week ago made out, coincidentally run into her at a house show with her boyfriend, she comes outside and tells me she loves me, how much, and why, and then the next day tells me she doesn't have feelings for me but ""cares"" about me. not sure if she really loves me, if I should continue being friends with this person, or if this is a healthy relationship.",12Feb2020,1

But somehow we got together. First days were ok, I was blinded by love. But then came the red flags.
She wanted to sleep over and even to move in. Now I'm 15 and still living with my mom so of course that I had to decline her offer. I told her that we can still meet up and such but not that often since I had to take care of my mom and such. She started crying and that's when I cracked and let her sleep over.

436,"I work nights and sleep during the day. 

My place is currently under renovations during the day time. 

All my friends have moved away looking for work or in university still and two places I know I can are not quite enough during those hours and I don't want to wake them up at 2am. 

I have been paying for a hotel 3 nights a week ~$120 a sleep. 

I was talking about it in front of a newish coworker and she said that her parents have a guest home they use as an Air B&amp;B.

I'm not very comfortable because I dont know this person very well. She's 18, went to the same high school I graduated from and I'm 28. 

Not only that, she offered and asked her mother and said I could stay for free the next day at work. 

This could save me a ton of money but from the brief interactions I have had with her, I'm not sure how reliable she is. 

Either way, I'm thinking of sleeping in my truck parked somewhere quiet at this point. 

I'm definitely not broke, I just cant fathom eating big mac's in the hotel bathtub at 3am just burning through my bank account. 

I asked for her mother's number and she said that it's ""best we talk as little as possible but I'm welcomed"". 

Should I just take her up on it? I mean, we all live and work a few blocks from eachother. 

Maybe I'm just being paranoid from my lack of sleep. Also my work buddies are probably going to ask why over staying at their places. 

The truth is I just want to crash on the couch in my sleeping. I dont need a whole guest house but I know staying at my work friends places they will want to drink/talk.

One spot isnt ideal because he lives with like 4 other people that party all the time and the other I know for sure will keep me up gaming/drinking.

446,"So I went to the store earlier today after class to buy a pen. Just like normal, I went up to the store clerk and tried out some pens that satisfies to my liking. I was suppose to buy this $1.40 pen but the only catch was I wanted a 0.3 ballpoint but the pen they had was 0.4 and for me it somehow had a drastic difference. So I went for a cheaper pen which cost only 69¢ (I bought 2 of them, btw.). After that, I thought of buying bond paper because I remember I ran out of it the other day and oddly the clerk that assisted me with the pens kept narrowing her eyes on me which I, myself was getting uncomfortable but I thought it was nothing so I shrugged it off. After that I went up to the floor above the floor I used to be in to buy a stitch cloth because I remember my sister needed one for her project. When I got there, for a second I placed one of the pens on top of the stitch cloths so that I could check my wallet to see if my money would be enough then suddenly the clerk who assisted me awhile ago came up to me with a mad look on her face and asked “Do you go to *name of my school (a Catholic school)*?” Out of confusion I stuttered, “Yes.” Then she noticed that I was now holding only one pen and asked “Where’s the other pen?” and then I said “It’s right above the stitch cloths.” and as I turned to look at it the pen somehow fell underneath the pile of stitch cloths and I still had to dig it out of there as proof that the pen really was there. When I finally got it, I said, “Here it is.” and then she said to me, “You shouldn’t be like that, you come from a Catholic school yet you show this kind of behavior outside.” I was completely confused and speechless. She then asked me “Are you going to buy the pens?” I said still confused, “Uhm, yes...” and then she took it from me and went to the cashier. I was contemplating on what she said meant and then it hit me, SHE THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO STEAL IT. Before going following her to the counter, I took one of the stitch cloth and bought buttons for my project and then I proceeded to the cashier. The two woman on the cash registrar were giving me weird looks as I paid for the items. The total of all the items were $2.70 and I paid $20.00 since it was the only thing on me and I also needed change. The cashier then asked “Do you have a smaller amount?” then I said “Sorry, but I don’t.” and so she then asked this other guy clerk to go to the other cashier to get change for $20.00 and had me wait. The whole wait was nothing but awkward silence. They prolly really thought I was going to steal plus I wanted to clear the air but I was too shy. I’m very introverted since I grew up not getting to go out of my house often. So it was prolly the most awkward thing ever. When the guy clerk came back and then they finally gave me my change I said “Thank you” very shyly yet what they did was just stare at me with one of the clerk’s eyebrow raised. And that made it even more awkward. I really don’t like them misunderstanding my actions. They judge too easily. I wasn’t raise to do acts like stealing. My mother is a teacher and my father used to join the military and I go to a catholic school and that’s what I portray outside? People disgust me. I just wasn’t able to speak out for myself because first, I was confused and second I’m too shy. 
Even though it was the only near store in my place, I’m never gonna buy there again. 
Anyways, even though I didn’t do anything wrong why do I feel guilt as if I did do something wrong? 😩😣☹️

Basically, I'm wonder if there is a way I can try to calm him down so he doesnt end up hurting himself or others in the future? Even though the guy is not someone I talk to often, I dont want to see them getting hurt in the future if there is something I can do about it.

452,"(no using?)
We aren’t using eachother if we are both pleasing eachother. Like sending pics and doing the sexting. Like I’ll help him out when he’s horny and he will help me out. That’s what I think. Like I don’t think that’s using. We are both giving eachother something. And getting something out of it. 
(using?)
But. if when I say I’m horny and he don’t help me out? Claiming he’s busy...But I help him out? And then I let it go. Then I say I’m horny again and he says he’s busy again...is he just using me for his pleasure but won’t give back? Is that using? If so I would either cut it off or speak tf up. 

And I’m kinda scared to start it again with this guy if he texts me back. And wants to start it up again with me. I know it will be good but he will start to change.

Last week I decided I owed my ex an apology for some truly questionable things I did and said during our relationship. 

She responded and was happy to hear from me. We talked and have been talking for the past few days. The other night was great, it felt like we never even broke up.

She found out I was moving there, and was quite excited to hear about it. I think that has a lot to do with it, because if it wasn’t for the distance I doubt we would’ve broken up. We just click so well.

However, I’m so stressed about it. I find myself constantly worrying about her texting me or whatever. I haven’t felt this way since the breakup.

464,"Dear reddit,

About 11 years ago, I was studying abroad in Germany and was in Rome, Italy for a long weekend.  I happened to meet this Australian girl, we’ll call her L, at the hostel who was solo backpacking around Europe.  My group of friends went out and invited L to come.  L and I broke away from the group, went dancing, explored the city, ate some döners, and stayed up late talking.  But my most vivid memory of that night was us on a public transit bus, just us two, at roughly midnight or so, just talking.  As we roll through the night, everything around me just fades away.  It was uniquely intimate.  I remember wanting to ask her to marry me right in that very moment.  

The next morning I left the hostel and gave her a hug as my group left.   And completely no way to contact her.  That week, I called the hostel from Germany, and asked her name.  Found her on Facebook and connected.   At the end of study abroad, I very nearly went back for two weeks but my visa had expired.  We eventually went our separate ways - she to Sydney and I back to the US.  That one night on the bus never quite left me. 

Fast forward five years.  I’m living in the US, had just started a company, and was in a serious relationship.  The company took off.  Both sides’ families were expecting marriage.  One day as I’m sitting at my desk, head down working, I click over to Facebook for the usual 2 minute escape from work.  One of her pictures pops up on my feed.  My heart stops.  I remember what I felt that one night and instantly thought to myself - I don’t have these intense feelings with my current girlfriend.  Eventually that relationship fizzles to a stop, mostly because I’ve realized I’ll never have the feelings that I had that one night.  

Fast forward three years, I am single for a while and start dating a bunch.  Met some really great girls.  Never felt anything close to what I felt in Rome.  Dating felt fun again but never really found the right person. 

Then, two years ago, my thirtieth birthday approaches.  I decide to fly to Sydney for a solo vacation for two weeks.  I needed a real break from my business that I started - I stayed in Bondi Beach - only opened my laptop once the whole time and thoroughly disconnected from life back in the states.  Task accomplished.  I did have other motives on this trip.  I wanted to find out why this feeling had haunted me for so long.  I needed resolve.  

I was going to ask L for a cup of coffee.   

Either one of three things was going to happen in this situation - 1) I’d meet her, see that she’s no longer the person I’d met that evening or 2) I’d meet with her and fall in love or 3) she’d ignore my message.  

3 happened.  

On the flight home, I came to the conclusion that I had the exact answer I needed.  I thought that I just had a really fun night in Rome, had a deep connection with a person, and a great experience with a stranger.  It made sense to me, too.  I was so young at that time.  I felt like I was clinging to a moment in my life, rather than a true connection with this person. 

Since this trip, it’s been fine.  I hadn’t thought about her since.

Fast forward to today - I’m dating again.   Currently seeing somebody who checks every box.  And it seems mutual.  We’re supposed to get together tomorrow night. 

Then, this morning, I wake up at about 3:45 in the morning.  I’m a very heavy sleeper and this never happens.  

I dreamt I had finally met up with L.   We were in this room together.   The windows were open, the sun was warming.  It was a nice spring day.  I confessed everything to her.   She cried and said she had felt the same absence from relationships and had never forgotten about me.  I cried too.  

Poof.  My bloodshot eyes open.  It’s not even four.  I’m staring at the ceiling for the past hour and half.   All of the feels come flooding back.  I’ve relapsed.  It feels like Rome was last night.  It feels impossible to date other people right now.

My question is this, my beloved reddit - what the hell do I do?  It’s been over ten years.  I feel emotionally paralyzed again.   Should I go to a therapist?  Should I sell my company, pack my stuff up and move to Sydney?   Should I end my current relationship?  Should I go back for another trip?  Maybe a few months sabbatical?  Have any of you had similar experiences?  Am I insane?",12Feb2020,1
465,"Recently I went to the movies with coworker 2. We got there early and we were talking before the movie. She asked me if I had heard about coworker 1. I said no what about coworker 1? She said ""oh you haven't heard, I don't think I should tell you then. I can tell you but it has to stay between us, ok?""

Ok in text it sounds like coworker 2 is gossip-y but she really isn't. In the moment it felt more like 'oh shit vassie98 doesn't know now it's gonna be weird should it tell him' kind of thing.

I was curious so I asked coworker 2 if whatever that thing she heard about coworker 1 was came directly from coworker 1 herself or if she heard it from someone else. She said she heard it from coworker 3 and 4. I don't know where 3 and 4 always get their information from but those 2 are always in the know about everything.

I said to coworker 2 ""No thanks. Whatever it is I don't want to hear it from someone else other than her just in case it's important."" And that was that and we just carried on with the evening without a single mention about whatever *the thing* about coworker 1 is.

I don't need to know whatever it is. Big or small, I don't want to be part of the gossip behind coworker 1's back. But should I tell her that people are talking about her back. Not specifically mention names. Just mention that it's happening.

I have so much going on right now that i’m not sure i’m going to be able to commit to this job as much as i’d like.

My vet advised me not to leave her unsupervised longer than 5 hours while she’s on her medication that she needs to take daily to avoid seizures, but I am the only one who can let her out or ever be home with her as my boyfriend has two jobs he’s been at for years. I am so overwhelmed and frustrated by everything with her, and all the other bad luck in general right now but i’m not sure what else to do. I think the best thing for me to do at this point is to be home for a while until everything is sorted out, or find something I am able to do from home because i don’t want to have to be calling out every week. I hate that it’s what i have to do, because i do enjoy the work, find it relatively easy, &amp; think it’s exactly what I was looking for, it’s just been bad timing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll keep it as short as I can while trying to get all the information out.

I'm an international student living in Canada right now, I've been here for about 2.5 years wasn't doing great at my program and struggled achieving the grades that I wanted. Also some background important info, I have 1 sister and 2 brothers. The sister and my eldest brother are very close to me and I appreciate them more than anything in this world. The 2nd eldest has been a thorn in my life ever since I can remember, always trying to torture both the eldest and me, also constantly demeaned and threatened my younger sister who is slightly mentally delayed but the sweetest human being alive. After about 1.5 years in my degree which was Winter of 2019 where I got a phone call from saying my mother had cancer, my mother which is my favorite human in the whole world. I obviously freaked out and brokedown on the phone and told him I'll be coming to try and visit them soon. I've started developing symptoms of depression insanely fast day by day and just felt like I couldn't face the situation, I couldn't build up the courage to go see her for god knows what reason, I just felt like I couldn't, she couldn't see me like which worsened my mental situation an all time low. Now I've always been happy go lucky person till that incident happened, he would keep calling me and telling me why I still wasn't there and I'd explain that I just couldn't face the situation and was seeking therapy, I was honest and admitted to him how I felt mentally, and he told me he completely understands and just keep him updated, so I started building slight hope...

The phone calls started coming in everyday by him calling me and telling me the worst things any human being, used what I said about my mental health against me, he told I should've just suicided like I said I felt like because I wasn't there for my mom, I told him I've sorted it out I'm coming to see her and him, he told me no it's too late now. He'd keep saying if I was a man I would've went and saw them, and this would happen everyday and it was just a repeating cycle which put me at my breaking point, if it wasn't for my girlfriend (still with me) I would've been gone. Life just wasn't worth it at that point.

My entire stay here in Canada is paid for by my mom who I couldn't get in contact with because he'd blackmail me to her, would go through her phone without her realizing to block me so I couldn't ask her to buy a ticket there, I was shit out of luck, through some luck I managed to survive for 3 months because I still had access to my mom's bank app so I just kept sending the monthly funds at every due date of the month, eventually he figured out a way to stop that, mind you while still calling me to threaten me and tell me I'm screwed and should just sell everything I have here and figure my own way back home. It felt scary... Really scary, scarier than anything I've ever felt, being in a whole different continent with no source of help, I could barely eat, I survived on ramen and tap water for a while, my GF would try to get as much groceries as she can but couldn't afford to keep both of us alive (we live together).

Eventually my little sister manages to contact me through Instagram and basically spilled the beans about him to me, told me he would force her to give her phone to him so he could go through it and stalk what I'm doing, now being from Qatar which is traditionally an Islamic country, he'd try to show my aunts and uncles about the fact that I have pictures with my GF up or whatever (I don't add extended family on my Instagram, not even him) and calling me a player and I'm ignoring my schooling to party, just because I looked happy in some pictures it doesn't mean I wasn't battling with suicide every night.

Skip 3 months, my little sister tells me when they're leaving to go back home (my mom is being treated in Manhattan, NY) so I borrow some money from my GF and fly to Manhattan with the address my sister gave me and explained the entire situation to my mom without trying to make him look like a bad guy, my big brother and I would always tell her how crappy the other person is to us but my mom is very forgiving and would never punish him for some reason, which I don't care about I don't need to be his brother I need to be her son, and if she wants him to stay as her son that's fine but I don't want anything to do with him. She says go back and finish your degree and kept sending me my monthly paycheck again and I've kept in a lot closer of contact with her. All is good for now.

Skip to last week, my mom is still in the US being treated and she's about to be sent back in about a month's time, I get a call from him which I didn't see, and then 2 miss calls from my mom's phone number, I call my mom back within 3 minutes of the misscall and I get told by one of her friends with her about the fact that she fell in a coma from an infection, I asked her questions and it didn't make sense but I said I'll try to get my visa done ASAP to be able to see her. 2 days later I call shit ""brother"" and ask him how's the situation is, he says why didn't I call earlier, I explained to him I was up for 2 days trying to get my visa done ASAP I just need a doctor's note so the US Embassy can approve my emergency interview request. He basically blames everything on me, tells me I'm the reason my mom is in the condition she's and tells me the worst things I've ever someone tell me in life, I didn't care and stayed very formal with him, he told me I'll just wither away here and die and forgot about ever receiving anything. I try reaching to my younger sister, nothing, I'm guessing he took her phone away for good this time so she can't reach me. No one else I'm calling that is in my family could help, he had them all believe I was the bad guy. My big brother already has loans and issues to take care and he works for the military so he can't leave to go see her either. This guy is putting me in the same exact situation and controlling what my fairly sick mother gets to hear about and doesn't get to hear about. He just wants all the money for himself. He's never had a job, he's 30, was born a girl but decided to inject testosterone to become a man so it caused a whole range of emotional and temperament instability more than he's already had growing up (I'm a psychology student). I've been doing the best this semester than I ever have at school, I was pretty much acing my exams and quizzes and was super driven to get my degree (I have ADHD but now I'm getting both behavioral and medicinal treatment). 

Now the real question is, what do I do. I can't freakout because then I won't be able to think straight, my bills are approaching fast and the food in my fridge is almost finished. I could sell my car but then I couldn't go to classes because I wouldn't be able to afford the bus. Honestly if I wasn't medicated I would've thought just leaving this world for good would've been the easiest solution. I don't want to go back home, I have a degree to finish that I already put 2 years of work into, I want to marry the girl I'm with, she kept my sane and took care of me. What is there left to do, it's scary enough going to classes because my car's gas meter is running lower and lower. Insurance, rent, Internet, and phone bill are coming in the next 5-15 days and everyday that passes the fear and anxiety are rising really quick.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the extremely long post... I just feel like I need to keep talking to someone about because that's what my therapist recommended last year, I don't know what to do.... How do I get in contact with my mom, I know he's exaggerating the details, he has last time too.

472,"Ok I like to to start off by apologizing in advance for any grammatical errors and spacing.This is my first post and I'm typing from a mobile device,and  sorry it long.

  Ok so now for some context of my situation I'm a guy who has been close friends with the same 5 people ever since high school.We have been freinds for some years now.We are all in our early 20s so we have stick with each other even after graduation for about 2 years now there a 3 males and 2 females in our group.we have a long and rich history together adventures good times bad time fights, ect. And I consider them to be my second family that how close we were.We even have our own group chat.




Anyways so the problem started about a year ago when one of the Fantastic 5 will call her S started dating a Guy will call H now S and H hit it off well and as far as I know H is a pretty cool guy S had just broken up with her last boyfriend and we were supporting her through that heart break so H was a breath of fresh air for S in these troubling times.And at the beginning months of the relationship everything was fine she was happy we were happy that  she was happy we were all hanging out all the time and overall having a good time it seem like things were on the rise for H+S and our little group.But then alot happened S moved in H to live with his parents house after only 9 months of dating.S fell head over heels claiming H was the one and as there reletionship grew her presence within our group lessen.


   it started with small things like she wouldn't hang out as much she would constantly leave you on read she wasn't responding to the the group chat and this went on for months.And then it got worse I went through some personal issues and S  wasn't there to support me when I needed her (luckily one of the other fantastic 5 help me thank you E)she didnt have money and use that as justification to try and bail on one of our freinds birthday,we had to practically fight tooth and nail just for her to show up and she missed another freind birthday completely stating it was on the same day as her mother in law birthday. Oh yeah I forgot to mention S and H got married only after a year of dating so with all the things S has done understandably all the males of the group were pissed.The only one who didnt mind was the other female in the group E. 


   And this isn't the first time S has done somthing like this she did it once before in high school with another guy S ghosted us because she thought he was the one.to her credit she didnt do it with guy before H so that's good.so all the males in the group agreed that we were all hurt and felt abondon and we were worried she dicth us well it turn out when H proposed to h
S, she came back excited she was actually talking to us but still butt hurt me and the guys instead of telling her how we felt in a mature honest conversation we  just ignore her I know childish but we were butt hurt.Anyways so we were icing her out as she was suddenly walking back to our lives.And she tried to talk to us but we ignore her and I know that bad on our part. So she left the group ,that happen months ago. 


   Well in those month of radio silence I finally spoke to S recently.I reach out to her for an explanation of all the things that took place and why she did that.She responded with that I shouldn't play victim that we were the ones that iced her out that she grown past this and doesn't care anymore she basically wanted me to apologize and said we were toxic and the other guys reach out to her earlier(I wasn't aware of that)and that there supposedly cool with her.it really just pissed me off more that she not taking any responsibility for this so it ended there.

    My question is should I try to talk to her more like over the phone? Should I even forgive her?I know I demonized her alot but before this she was actually a caring friend she done alot of good  but just lately it feels like she changed I reach out to the guys and one says he forgive her and the other one is just as emotionally confuse as I am do I really want to just throw away our history?is she toxic? Am I toxic? I miss her but I'm still pissed. The group just feels so empty with out her as well should I try if for group sake?I feel like she still cares somewhat why would she still be talking if she didn't?Any advice is appreciated I know it long but thank you so much  for reading my story

I have been looking at apartments for a long time online and we plan on having our parents cosign for us and hopefully save up a few months rent in advance as a bargaining tool, but I’m worried our situation is too off putting for renters to consider us. Our credit scores are both fairly decent (high 600s) To be honest my boyfriend comes from a very well off background and has more than enough money to cover us for awhile as well as having helicopter parents who would probably insist on paying the rent anyway. I’d like to change our lifestyles to become more independent and get more stable jobs when we have more opportunities.

My ultimate concern is that most applications online for apartments worry me because they want proof of income and on paper both of us are unemployed and if I answer honestly we look broke. Will having co-signers help? Should I call after applying and explain we can pay the first 3 months up front? Or am I just out of luck until I can get a stable job?",12Feb2020,1
480,"So, I'm from Lithuania, I study English and French at university, my last year, and I just took up a position of a substitute French teacher, a second foreign language, after English. There are two classes per week for pupils from sixth to tenth grade. I've never taught classes like this, I'm not even super good at French, maybe B2, but the school took me because their teacher broke a leg and it's hard to find a substitute for two months. Today I had four classes and just gave the pupils sheets to work with that the teacher had. I just want some advice, how do I best work with 12-16 years old?

481,"I want to report abuse for a classmate of mine. This is because another friend of mine is very scared to do this herself, and she has been the one who he has been talking to about his bad home life.

BACKGROUND 
This all came up recently, when she admitted that one time he came to school with a black eye and told her his dad had hit him. This was brought on by a discussion of his spiralling anger management issues and frequent outbursts. I belive this to be because of poor home life: He has several sibling (not an exaggeration, one for every two years roughly) and I know that enviroment can be stressful for him because they're all cramped and in each other pockets.

 His parents are totalitarian about grades and after school activities. They are none negotiable despite him hating it and the stress and commitment it puts on his life. He often expresses worry about bad grades or doing something wrong, saying ""They are going to kill me"", or ""They won't understand, they'll be really mad"". 

WHAT I WANT TO DO
I want to report this, because me and my friend are very worried. However, we do not belive if we went to our school to report this that they would take this to the police (but we are mostly worried that they will tell his parents, and that they will take it out on him). 

We also do not belive that if we told the police that anything would be done about it (either due to lack of evidence/ saying it was a one time thing or his dad having active military connections).  This again leads to a possible scenario that may put all the kids in that household in danger. 

I know the right thing to do is report it. But I want to give him and all the other kids the best possible chance for saftey. And I feel that we can't, and really, I just want advice. Should I talk to him, possibly try to support him as best I can, or report this (I do want to do this, but I am torn) to either the school or the police? I'm young, and I've never had to deal with something like this before. 

I know I could possibly get other students to testify about his behaviour and possibly find someone who was there when he went to school with a black eye.",12Feb2020,1

I'm worried that my mom will see his history but blame it on me, so I could tell her but I don't want to embarrass either of them and I don't want to cause them marriage problems either. And I also deleted it because I didn't know what to do, so now I have no evidence that it was my dad watching and not me.

Currently in senior year of high school and am struggling a bit with keeping my patience.

Been with the same group of friends since pretty much the start of high school, and we still get on, also gotten closer with a few other people who are now in the same group.

I know obviously people within the group will naturally be closer to others, but recently it seems like there’s a rift between certain people.

The attitudes some of them have towards both me and other friends seems to vary from day to day, almost a mob mentality that trickles down from one person to anyone else with them at that time.

For example one day we could all be fine and getting along, and the next day if I’m with a certain part of the group it’ll just be a really shitty atmosphere with a lot of unnecessary bullshit that gets really personal, pretty much on the verge of straight bullying, but sometimes its okay.

Its just immature emotional responses for the most part to small things that they might still have a grudge about, and it comes out during these times when they have some sort of backup.

I’m trying not to bite and to just go with it, hoping that that they wear themselves out, but its still fucking unpleasant and I’m wondering what’s the best way to keep the peace.",12Feb2020,1
488,"Hello, im 17 years old and attending a german school currently, I'm in 12th grade. After finishing this year I will have Fachabitur (professional high school degree).  
In the first half year of 12th grade my marks went straight down hill and I thought that I would need to leave school this year. This is why I have applied at my local municipal bus company in order to do an apprenticeship to become a bus driver, my application has been accepted a few days ago. Now, that I got my report card, I know that my marks are way better than I originaly thougt, which means that I could stay at my school. So, now I have two options,

\-stay at school for another year and achieve Abitur (a-level) or  
\-become a bus drive

Becoming a bus driver would be my absolute dream job, the only thing that I don't like is the salary. Abitur is the highest degree you can get in germany, I would have a lot more possibilitys.   
I would also prefer to stay in school, because I'm with my friends there, have holidays, class trips and so on.

Im currently not sure what to do, I would like to school, but on the other hand, becoming a bus driver would be my dream job.

Unfortunatly, you cant make the decission for me, I will need to do that on my own, but I hope that you all maybe have a good advice for me.

I(F20) am currently in second semester in university in a tech stream. (really loving school) 
I have had now 3 groupworks with 4 people(always guys) everytime, and we always in the start sit together down and brainstorm and it always sounds like everyone is interested and positive. 


 However always before a deadline when we haven't discussed or when we haven't done anything/had contact recently, I often text them on the whatsapp group something like ""came up with this new feature, opinions?"" ""how's it going with everyones part? Extend deadline?"" or ""meet this week?"" or ""we can show teacher this"". I never get a reply?!?? If I'm lucky I get one guy who replies but the rest then? Whats their opinions? .. Whenever I bring idea's I feel that they are too scared to argue with me and don't say anything? 



Im not even the group leader but sometimes I feel like a dictator? 
I don't know what I'm doing wrong? It's not like text 24/7 but I'm the only one bringing up new ideas after a while and trying to plan shit when we aren't sitting together. So I guess compared to everyone else I'm texting a lot. 
We rarely sit together otherwise I would talk there.. We all agreed to aim for the highest grade yet why is everyone treating it like an individual assignment?

My older sister and i got into a huge argument because of something that was her fault and she kept swearing at me and calling me a faggot in front of all my family.

498,"I want to know about the usefulness of a Degree in Bachelors of Science, possibly math major from one of the top 3 universities in HK. My Cantonese sucks so l couldn't resort to any local forum but from what l have read, my basic impression of the job market and work culture with regards to engineering/science majors is that they could not get good grades to enroll in Medicine/Law/Business programs in Uni, so they were forced to take sci/eng prog. As a result employers do not really value us and will pay less.

While this viewpoint is not totally mistaken since the entry requirements for stem majors are relatively lower. It does force a lot of people to give up their ambitions for other fields with better job prospects. I don't want to take that path but it would be great if some local hker can clarify the situation here in HK. Besides teaching or getting into a grad school and securing a tenure at a university. What other paths can a math major take in HK ?

499,"Without going into detail about the dysfunctional background of my family... trust me. It's a lot.

The plan is to move into my childhood home. Paid off, in my mum's name. My mom doesn't live there. Just got (another) crazy tenant out. Drama is over (for now) and mom is getting excited for me to take over. Mentions getting the electric in my name (which I have already done) and, ""by the way, taxes are due, I just found out."" Things like that. 

The best part is, she is fixing up her bedroom already, the biggest one in the house btw. She jokes that the ghost in the house will only allow the mother-in-law to sleep there. Joking and manipulation tactics aside, I am open to living with her. It's the shadiness that pisses me off. 

From what I understand (because she will not be assertive and tell me what she plans on doing) my mom wants:  
1. For me to take on all financial responsibility for the house (which I would expect nothing less) which only includes taxes on the house (around $2,200/yr I believe), utilities, and anything other living expenses. Great. Sounds fair. 

2. Continue residing with her boyfriend and my little brother in the next town over, about an hour drive one way if you're driving the speed limit, out in the country. However... 

3. Will not admit that she LIVES there, or here with me and my future new husband. 

So basically, I foresee her wanting to move in, and/or having come-and-go rights. I would rather her be all-in or all-out. She wants me to save her bedroom for when shit hits the fan with her man? or when she gets tired of him and wants to chill at our place for a week or so, then go back to her place? Then, my younger brother will feel he has the right to do the same if this is what she is going to be doing. So my family will use my home, that I will be actively living-in, caring for, paying for, as a come-and-go place. 

Simply, I would either want compensation and a polite notice for visits, or nothing at all. I just want to be respected as an adult and have my own space. Is that so much to ask?  Am I asking too much? I just really value my boundaries. (I have had them set up in the past to guard myself against drama and bullshit.)

It's HER house. In HER name. She will use this against me. I can give more details if you need but please help me construct a pro-active conversation script about this so I can avoid any drama in the future. I am feeling pretty hopeless about the no-drama thing. My family is ALL DRAMA, ALL THE TIME. My mom is a MASTER at manipulation. I love her, she is a huge-hearted person, but this is a fact about her. 

I am 26. My mom is 52, and my little brother is 21, if that means anything at all. I am really excited about living her but don't want my family to leech off me and invade my home with their toxicity and drama. I love them and want them to visit, truly. I just want my fucking privacy. What do you think? 

TL;DR: I am moving into a house in my mom's name but I want it to my home. How do we have a conversation about healthy boundaries so people don't ""come-and-go?"" (She wants her bedroom to stay open and has started moving her stuff in.)",12Feb2020,1

My current school is not really the greatest and I couldn’t see myself fitting in there for another 2 years.

Anywhooo.... I'm planning on proposing to my girlfriend and I need a little help with tweaking a proposal idea.  

My girlfriend is a primary school teacher so I think it would be a really fun idea to propose on the last day of school (mid july)  

I work in a packaging company so I have access to create bespoke and different sized boxes.  

One idea I had was to ask the head if I could have 6 boxes in the end of year assembly for all 6 teachers, a bottle of wine in 5 of them and then me in the last.  

I'd number each of the boxes and then put all teachers names in one hat and then numbers of the boxes in the other hat.  

For example, teacher 3 is pulled out the hat and box number 2 is pulled out the hat. Thst teacher would then open box number 2.  

I'd make sure my box and my girlfriend names are not in the hats.  

My only issue is I could be in the box for up to half hour and it would be very dark. I don't want the box to open and then I'm shielding my face from the light like a loony.

long distance is hard.. i feel that if he was here with me by my side and that if i can see him whenever where ever this wouldn’t be a problem. should i wait it out and see how it goes first? is what i’m feeling normal and these doubts will go away soon? or shld i make it clear to him bcs it’s unfair to him now?",12Feb2020,1
516,"Im in a bad place right now. With my girlfriend ""taking a break from me"" also meaning breaking up. And the lack of friends i have to talk to through this difficult time. Im contemplating on going back on my antidepressants. I stopped taking them once i met my girlfriend because well..i was happy. Everyday feels like a battle now.I mainly been putting off taking them because i never wanted to go back on them again. When i took them i felt nothing all the time. I'd get episodes of anger. But most importantly the side effects sucked. I developed a tremors/twitching from them. As well as a weird balance of never getting enough sleep or always being tired. 
With all that happening i had little to no motivation in life. 

If presented with the same thing I'm going through. What would you do?",12Feb2020,1
518,"Hi, I have a sister. She’s going to be 28 this year, I’m 19. I don’t like to complain about someone or write bad things about anything about anything. But, I really need help. To introduce this situation, let me give a summary of her personality:

1. She likes attention, not like a popular kid but literally (she even told me once) wanted to be treated like a president of the country, aka playing master while our family acting like servants. 

2. She is (perhaps) arrogant and non-reflective. Once, oh wait, more than once. literally. Almost. Every. Single. Time. From what I said in personality number 1, she places herself important over others. For instance, she is almost 28 now, by this age I believe a number of people would probably be working already, planning their own dream and life goals. I respect my sister, I really do. But her arrogance such as constantly using my parents money spending on useless things really gives me and my parents anxiety. I don’t mind her using our parent’s money, but using over $300 for an app that can make her ‘famous’ (which is what she wanted) in Wordpress is seriously, to be frank, a horrible and idiotic idea. That IS my opinion of course. I understand she is arrogant because...if I have to think deep, she doesn’t want to face conformity, she doesn’t want to be ‘average’ I guess. But I feel so wrong that she keeps over spending money abroad which has a high currency compared what our parents earn in our home country. Plus, our parents are almost 70 now, mom has reduced mobility. I legit, feel so bad to even spend my parents money on buying other stuff, not even a subscription on Spotify. Because I understand how friggin hard it is to earn money. 

3. Obsessively competitive. Being competitive in a society is reasonable. But my sister is so obsessive in ‘winning’ me, meaning she wants me to lose in everything and she win. She’s the kind of person who would do anything to get what she wants. I can feel her thirst and malice of wanting me to end up in despair because I happen to have gotten birthday gifts from friends. She would keep comparing me with her to my parents, complaining non stop from day till the time we go to sleep. literally. I am not lying. She wants to have a better phone than me, more friends than me, etc. She wanted me to not live good life and I can feel it. And that’s just one of the situation of her wanting to defeat me in ‘having a better life’. She doesn’t have friends, but wait, the list keeps going on. NB, I always clearly, obviously show no interest in beating her in whatever what she wants to win in. She still does it anyway. 

4. I don’t like to be a rude person, but I am so surprised how undeveloped and insincere she is despite being sent abroad to study. She often told us that she wasn’t able to make friends, even if she do it doesn’t last long. Initially, we thought maybe the friends she made are toxic, but she’s the one who’s toxic. Real life situation here, she likes to keep having her friends treat her lunches even we do always constantly send her a large amount of money to enough for life expenses. Her reason of using her friend for free lunches, is so she could buy the latest Samsung tablet using the money we sent her. Even after treating her lunches, she wouldn’t even be grateful and keep being negative instead. Let alone a friend, she does this to her family too. 

5. Her greed. Ok look, I get it. Greed is human nature, but if you really cherish something, you might put that selfish attitude beside. Once, I was moving from my house to school dorm. Because I have 8 boxes of items, and needed help in moving to my new dorm, my mom asked my sister if she wanted to fly back, she said yes. And when she came back the first day, she did. Not. Help. At. All. Ok, that’s fine, maybe you’re tired so you didn’t help, but every time I open the boxes to unpack my stuff, she’ll shove me over, or push me aside, and without my consent, shoves her in into the box and touch anything that caught her interest. If I’m lucky, she just touches it. Worst case scenario, she complains why I get to have it and grabs it for herself. Example, I have a few extra exercise books, she takes it. 

6. She is not reflective at all. Because she’s abroad, we haven’t gather as a family for almost 3 years. We met her yesterday after a 14 flight, we were happy that we are going to meet her, but sadly, she ends up complaining non stop and fighting with our parents on DAY 1. FYI, today is only DAY 2, and her actions are becoming lethal, seriously. 

7. She stalks. She stalks my friend lists. Gossips about them, worst come to worst, trash talk me by messaging to my friends.

8. Money lover. Always uses parents money. We nicely asked her to try and work to start supporting herself because our parents aren’t immortal, but she didn’t and even came up with bad excuses of not doing it.

9. Her jealousy. Literally. 

10. Many more, but too tired to even think so much about her negativity.

Like I just said, today is just day 2 of us meeting my sister. Because her seek of attention is so deep, she keeps complaining and comparing me with herself. She had a better life before me, before I’m born, our parents bring her to 5 star hotels to eat buffet. She had 3 servants serving her. She can do whatever she wants. She get new things, I get hand-me-downs (until I am 16). Lots more. Every time, I try to be a good sister, as always be considerate, every time if I want to buy something, I’d think about her if she needs anything abroad or would sometimes ask her if she ever needed help in anything. If she’s studying, I didn’t bother her or anything. I respect her even though knowing she doesn’t really like me much and is jealous of me. But today, her toxic personality made my almost 70 go mad, she almost had a heart attack after scolding her. I tried to tell her to not to scold because sometimes scolding makes a person develops worse. But after seeing our mom almost died because my sister can’t ‘get over things’. I had enough. It’s been 19 years, and I need advice, and I need serious help. I don’t care, I let her do anything she wants with me, my stuff, I don’t care if she already ruined my childhood,etc. please, I just wanted to live a simple human life. 

PLEASE, I NEED ADVICE.",12Feb2020,1
519,"A bit of context: I am in my final year of highschool and I have to make a choice on wich Education I should follow. I was set back two years, but I recoverd from it. 

Here are the reasons that make my decision making hard:
-the times I chose something I like, it always backfired. Like using drugs, I eventualy became a addict, but I have stopped using it since January 2019. So I am clean.
-my childhood was pretty rough so I always had to choose for things I needed instead of wanted.
I also have take care of broters and sister later in the future.
-game making is something I think will like, but I am unsure if it will and I am also unsure on how much money I will make with it. I am quite artsy and good with concepts and I have also a technical mindset. So I think I will be good at it, but my lack of experience and unwarrented future scares me.
-Choosing something that will pay wel. For example electrical engineer, scares me because I am scared I won't be able to do it and I am also scared rhat I will dislike it.

Even though my parents and I have been reminding my counselor, she still hasn't submitted them yet. We have also contacted the school vice principal (2 days ago) who hasn't replied yet.

530,"Here's some background info: 

I work as a barista in a small coffee shop.
All the staff members have been here for no more than a month, apart from myself and the manager.

The manager has decided to quit the job and has told us that we will be taking over some of his responsibilities but there won't be an official manager. 

Since I have been here the longest, the owner of the shop said that I will be taking up slightly more responsibilities than the others. And that we will all get a raise in our salaries.

Now here's where it gets confusing. Since the manager told us of his plans, I have had one short 1 on 1 chat with him where he explained a few things to me. Then there was a big group meeting. 

However he's been having multiple 1 on 1s with New Guy where he takes him to another building. Then New Guy comes back and starts acting a little more ""managery"" and less like a new guy (not in a bad way of course as I happen to like the new guy)

I'm not upset that the new guy might be a manager, I'm more than happy to keep my role as a general staff member while prioritising my studies. But I'm upset about the mixed signals I've been getting and the lack of training from the manager. 

Should I ask the manager if he's going to fire me or act as if I know nothing and start applying to new jobs?",12Feb2020,1

540,"I live in a 3 person household that was a very minimal paperwork (literally intialed a generic lease), venmo landlord rent, no background check type place. Were in charge of utilities and the oldest roomie volunteered to handle and split the monthly payments and cleaning supplies. It's really nice for the price and I love the area so its perfect for me. I use to live with 2 young perfessionals until 1 abruptly moved. He got a random Facebook guy to sublet his lease. 

Dude was ok at first but started paying ultilies late the 3rd month he moved in. Then I heard he was paying rent late as well. Turns out he got fired from his job and just lounges around the house now, smoking weed all day in the house, and shagging some girl he met on Craigslist. It affects my other quiet roomie way more than me, but he's now 2 months behind rent and utilities. The rent isn't our concern, but we are soley responsible for utility payments and I had to split his half last month (im just making enough to get by atm and can't afford to do it again). Landlord contacted us saying he's a problem and is going to get an eviction notice Saturday if he doesn't pay what he owes him. He's aware but is still constantly home doing the stuff I mentioned. 

We're having a house meeting about it on Saturday too and I'm a bit worried. Firstly I don't think we can compel him to pay anything. Secondly hes a hot head. My roomie said they confronted him about payment while I was gone on an out of country trip and he slammed the door in their face. He's apparently ex Marines who got dishonorably discharged early in his career for reasons I never cared to ask. 

With this in mind, im worried about my stuff. I own alot of the furniture and kitchen appliances upstairs (coach, tv, tv stand, dinner table, chairs, etc).

I thought he is gonna say whats my problem and how can we change on it.

546,"I (36) have been in a relationship with this person (30) for a little over a year. Last week, she was pulled over and her car was towed and impounded by the police. She called me to come pick her up and I was there within minutes. She told me the insurance company made a mistake and even though she had insurance it wasn't with the registry. She had leased this car before we got together, but I knew her when she had her previous car. There seemed to be inconsistencies with the story but I took it for face value. She spent the next day complaining about how the insurance company made a mistake and how she was waiting for them to make the updates to get the car. There were lots of details about how they made a mistake and they would pay for any inconvenience (towing/impoundment, etc)

The weekend goes by and on Monday morning she comes to me crying saying the car may never get released from impoundment. She tells me that her estranged father helped her get the lease on the car and that it was actually in his name and not hers. Her father is out of contact with her and they are unable to fix the problem, so the car will just be left at the impound. I told her I was very disappointed with her lying about the situation and that she just needs to be up front and honest. I am not mad about the situation but I am upset about the lying. Nothing is more important to me than the truth.

The next day I get the mail and see something from the insurance company with her ex boyfriend's name on it (somebody she hadn't previously admitted to being in a real relationship with) Immediately my hurt sank as there was clearly more to the story. Later that night after the kids go to bed I ask her if she has more to the story she needs to tell me. She says no. I am not the type to go digging things up and put people under a microscope and I always give the benefit of the doubt. However, I knew there was more.

She got angry and asked me what I knew. I told her I just wanted the truth. She proceeded to get very angry and saying I was accusing her of doing wrong. I was calm and just asked for the truth. She eventually tells me that her ex and her dad worked out some kind of deal (details I didn't pry further into) that she could pay the lease and keep the car. Still doesn't explain the recent impoundment of the car. She goes on to be angry, threatens to leave, break up, etc. I was patient and waited it out and she calmed down and apologized. 

A few other details. I have been cheated on multiple times in my life - as recent as three years ago my wife of 6 years (12 years total) cheated on me with a woman... The person I am with now constantly tells me fibs that I forgive, turns down the phone when people call so I can't hear and is not forthcoming.

551,"I'm on mobile, so sorry for the formatting. 

I work for the state. It has come to Management's attention that since I internally promoted at the end of October and was under a new to the state supervisor, each day I did overtime, my monthly utilization report (MUR) was short by however many hours I worked overtime (either 1 or 1.5 hours). My supervisor at the time and myself were unaware that it was wrong. That supervisor has now promoted (within) and my unit is being overseen by another supervisor until her position is filled. Each day of work, we are required to clock in and out and use SharePoint to track our work for the day. At the end of the month, our MUR's are checked by our supervisors, signed by both ourselves and our supervisors, and our time sheets are submitted, signed by the same people and personnel. 

At the end of January, a supervisor in my unit told me and my old supervisor that my MUR is short for each day I did overtime. Neither of us were aware it was wrong. She had me ""find this time"" but didn't like that I was just making up the time and adding the missing time to batches since I didn't have ""proof"" that's where the time I'm short went. 

It's now mid February and this same supervisor (who is not my direct supervisor, nor has she ever been) has been closely auditing my time and MUR and has now given me each day since the beginning of November, telling me my batch tags don't match SharePoint or my time doesn't match and is having me go through and fix this. 

I'm covered by the union, but I'm not sure what I would even say or do about this. She is not my direct supervisor. She has her own staff to supervise, yet she's nitpicking each and every day since I was promoted and having me fix it. We are a production unit. This is affecting my production by not working and trying to fix what was done months ago and already signed off on and something I already got paid for. 

I guess I'm just trying to figure out if there's anything I can do or say to get her off my back. Yes I'm applying for other jobs and have an interview next week, but that doesn't help me in the mean time.

so i live with my boyfriend, we have for 6 months now. in that whole time, my family and his family have thought that he is paying 100% of the rent etc. they all think i have no job, truth is i make money on onlyfans and selling nudes/custom porn.

this is only a temporary thing until i start uni so of course i dont want to tell anyone. but i need something to tell them that i’m making money from because my boyfriends family think i’m using him. 

i’ve tried and cant come up with anything, the job hunt where i live is so difficult. so if i told anyone i had a real job in a cafe or something they probably would look it up and would want to come see me working (my family would anyway), and i’d also need to tell fake stories about days at work and stick to a fake schedule. is there anything i can tell them? like an online(?) job thats okay enough to make rent but not a valid career choice so they still understand me going to uni. our rent is £400 a month if that helps 

thanks :)",12Feb2020,1

554,"So basically you have to choose a major in 9th grade where I live and the two most common ones are math&amp;physics and science. I personally am very good at math and I love the jobs you can get into via this major (for example IT,mechanical engineering,electrical engineering) but my dad insist on forcing me to study the science major and become a doctor which I truly hate and his only reason is that doctors make more money in our country while I can easily get scholarship to a better place if I study math well. Now I dont know what to do. If I don’t manage to convince my dad to let me study what I want,I will either have to make my decision and have my dad treat me like shit for the rest of my life or study a major and have a job that I hate.

556,"As the title says. Yesterday a washer flooded some floods ceilings below us, it made a fire alarm a floor down start beeping. Maintenance came and shut it off but now there's another one beeping on a even lower floor. I can hear it faintly in our apartment and it's driving me insane. The issue is, my husband can't hear it and keeps calling me insane and saying it's in my head. It's not. I went down a few floors and hovered near some doors to try and find it, I'm pretty sure I did as it got louder as I went 2 floors down and towards one of the buildings ends. We have several vacant apartments right now and I think it's in one of them.

But no one else seems to be able to hear the infernal beeping, it's driving me insane and it's been going on for 12 hours. When I put on headphones it's gone, ear plugs too. So I know it isn't in my head like my husband keeps saying.

I only got 3 hours of sleep because of it.

What do I do? Do I call maintenance and tell them I hear a fire alarm beeping but I'm not sure what floor it's coming from because it's faint? My husband isn't going to help me figure it out, and I can't stay here with constant beeping. I don't know what to do? Do I call the fire departments non emergency line and ask if they can find it?",12Feb2020,1

Just keep in mind that all of those people are doing such amazing things for their community and the world as a whole and I support them to the fullest, I do not hate them, dislike them or hold grudges in any way, shape or form.

But within that 5-10 min timeframe, I went from looking for motivation to, having a full-blown panic/anxiety attack.  Although being happy for their achievements, I couldn't stop my mind from thinking that I can never amount to even 1% of their level of success and I should just quit.

I felt a mixture of emotions from anger &amp; disappointment to jealousy &amp; hopelessness.

567,So I've had a crush on this guy for 6 months. We're kinda friends but not really that close. Anyway he's obviously not into me and I'm pretty sure he's talking to another girl but I can't seem to get over him.. Any advice?,12Feb2020,1
568,"I looked around on the internet for an answer but from what I've found it's all the same generic advice: prepare what you need to do, deep breaths, dress up if it helps, don't be afraid to make mistakes, take a public speaking class, etc etc etc. Basically, good advice, but not relevant to my situation at all.

Now I suppose my situation is a bit of a weird one in the sense that I know all these things, and none of them are an issue for me... if I'm standing in front of a room full of people. I'm not afraid of public speaking, nor uncomfortable doing it. I don't have a fear of failure that's stopping me, the occasional screw up comes with the territory and I can work around it just fine in the moment. Give me any subject I have at least moderate knowledge about and an hour of time to prepare and I'll happily present to a class, or a board of directors, or another random large audience.

I also don't have a fear of the camera that I know of.nVideo chats? No problem. Skype meetings? No problem. Someone with a camera crew in tow wants to ask me random questions? No problem. Random picture moment? Sure, why not? Just a camera? For some reason I freak out and freeze up and get stressed about it and don't know what to do.

For some reason I just don't know how to make it work when there's no real audience at all. It feels weird, or wrong, or whatever, I'm not quite sure what the issue even is. And yes, I've tried imagining an audience, it doesn't work because it's just not the same in terms of communication, interaction, subtle feedback in people's reactions, etc.

It has never really been a problem for me until now (I didn't even know it was a thing for me until a few hours ago). Now I just started a course to hone some skills and of course the first assignment of the entire thing just has to be a volg like video assignment with a 12 hour deadline (though at this point it's more like a 6 hour deadline).

569,"So a couple of weeks ago I handed a note to a cashier at my local convenience store with my number on it and I told her that if she wants to have dinner she should text me. Now my phone number is foreign since I went to study in another country and the next time I saw her she was just as talkative as usual. Since then I was out of town and completely missed more than half of the times she had a shift, but whenever I'd seen her she stopped engaging in any form of chitchat and she hasn't texted me.

For some background, she's been standard cashier nice with a smile thrown in all the time, however, at some point, she started talking to me and asking about my day and make a couple of jokes, which would happen all the time whenever she saw me, hence I decided to do the note thing and I went through with it in a bit of an awkward-quirky way, related to my cat food purchases which she commented on a few times in the past. She seemed surprised and smiled and then I left the store. I saw her again in a few days and nothing changed, except for me not receiving any text.

I was expecting that if I won't get a reply, then it's a clear no, however, her starting some chat the next time made me think that even if I get a no, she'll still want to talk whenever I go to the shop. As such it came as a surprise when she stopped doing it.

My three main assumptions are:

1. It's a clear no and I shouldn't think too much about it
2. She tried reaching out, but I haven't received anything due to my number being foreign so she took that to mean that I was just joking around or something (texts or calls not reaching me because of this is actually quite common, as it happened with a pizza delivery a few days ago).
3. Given I have never initiated a conversation (even after giving her the note), she is actually interested but wanted to get to know me a bit better before texting, but I have failed her by not showing any interest in this regard, which I'm guilty of, mainly because I tried to not make it awkward after she hasn't texted me back.

What do I do guys? Or better still, is there a way to probe for the second option or third option I laid out without making her feel uncomfortable?",12Feb2020,1

It's a long story, not their fault) shafting me pretty hard on the deal to fix it. The way this was fixed was my SO getting angry on my behalf and leaving a negative review detailing the incident, and then the owner being honorable enough to call me and fix things. As you can see, I had no real part in things getting better, because I didn't have it in me to be assertive about the situation. Now, take this example, and extrapolate it across my whole life thus far, and then the picture of what I'm dealing with will be clear. So, guys, any advice on where to start?

575,"I’m gonna try to make this short.

It all started back in December. We had a final research paper to write, worth 25% of our grade. It was 10-15 pages long, and it involved months worth of research. I was sure to be meticulous while researching and writing because I knew how much this paper mattered. I was told that the due date was December 12th, the second to last day that campus was open. I turned it into my professor’s mailbox in her office building, where she said to put it. I emailed her just as a confirmation to make sure she received the assignment. 

I waited weeks for a grade. Nothing popped up. She finally put my final grade in as a C, and I became very worried. I checked my grade book and she completely neglected to grade the final paper. I flipped out and emailed her with my concern, and I literally got “calm down” as a response. She said “why did you wait this long to say something?” I became enraged but calmly explained that I had emailed her about the assignment when I turned it in and that I didn’t want to rush her, and I was giving her time to grade it. She then said that she needed a virtual copy by December 2nd and that I hadn’t turned one in, so I technically didn’t turn it in on time. Of course I’m baffled because I was never told this, but she said that since I’m a “good student”, she would grade it and take off 5 points for the lateness. I just accepted it because in my opinion it was better than nothing. 

A month goes by, no grade. I emailed the chairwoman of the board for my major to grade appeal, and she said she would be in contact with my professor. She later reached out and said that my professor was “intending” to grade the assignment, and to just hold out. It’s now mid February, the assignment was supposed to be graded well over a month ago, and there’s no sign of that happening. I decided to drop it, even though I had an A before the final grade dropped to a C. I figured I’d just let it go and work more diligently this semester.

Fast forward to now. We had 3 assignments due last night at 11:59, and I finished them all. However, my computer wouldn’t hold a charge, and I needed it to download a PDF of the assignment to turn into the dropbox. It was about 2 hours before the deadline, and I’d already gotten the other two into the dropbox. The computer finally died, and I decided to finish the assignment in Google Docs on my phone. I tried to download a PDF of the finished copy on my phone, but it wouldn’t let me export it. I decided to screenshot the completed assignment and turn that into the dropbox, and then email a link to the assignment document to my professor. I let her know what had happened, and that I just wanted her to be able to see it as a document and not a screenshot. I did all of this before the deadline, and figured that if she needed something else, she would contact me. 

This morning, I woke up to an email that said “Did you not read my note about no late assignments? I see two made the cut.” 1. I turned in something to ALL 3 drop boxes, so those didn’t close before the deadline. 2. I emailed her the link at 10 PM, 2 full hours before it was due, so that’s not late either. She literally has no excuse to not grade it.

What do I do? I feel like if I report her, they’ll just take her side. I’m so angry, I feel like she’s purposely not grading me.",12Feb2020,1

592,"I have a wife and a son (12) from a previous relationship. The three of us went to my mother-in-law's house for dinner. Within the house, there's something like an independent mini apartment where my wife's aunt (who we'll call Sarah) and her gay son (22, who we'll call Charles) live. 

From the start, Sarah told Charles to take my son to his room to play video games (keep in mind this ADULT'S room is another apartment within the property which makes it hard to supervise). 

This may seem weird to a lot of you guys, but in my family, we don't like having kids unsupervised with adults we don't really know/trust. We've seen cases where kids have been molested by adults within the family circle in situations similar to like this. 

Even though I'm a bit annoyed, I didn't want to be a dick and let it happen. I did act like I had to take work calls and went in to check up on my son, nothing weird. Then Sarah came to where the adults were hanging out and said she had offered a sip of wine to Charles and when he said no she kinda encouraged my son into drinking a couple of sips. It was funny to her (this family is actually very clean and barely ever drink). I don't think she did it out of malicious intentions, but I don't really give a fuck what your intentions are, don't fucking do that.

So the day after this happened, I told my wife that I didn't like Sarah offering booze to my son who's a kid. She totally agreed. Then I added that it was even worse because he was unsupervised with an adult that I don't really know. That's when flipped out and was really hurt and offended by me even suggesting that her cousin could be a perv. It was horribly awkward but I had to be honest and straightforward and explain that it's just a prevention issue because my family has seen shit that her family hasn't.

If you want to accuse me of being a homophobe, go ahead. I don't care. But the only reason that Charles' homosexuality is relevant is simply that it means that he's sexually attracted to people that are my son's gender. Simple as that. I would feel the same if my 12-year-old daughter were in the same situation but with a straight man or a lesbian woman.

596,"I am currently a 26 year old elementary school teacher at a low-income district. I was recently approached by a good friend to work for a relatively new (year and a half) company that is on the verge of blowing up. I do not have a business background but after looking at some numbers from the company it looks legit and has potential for a lot of growth. 

Teaching is a stable job with good benefits, o-k salary (as a young person), and weekends holidays and summers off among other things. This business endeavor will be more work but consists of skills that pertain to me such as leadership, quick critical thinking and problem solving. It also has slightly worse benefits and starts at a lower pay with the potential for much more growth and pay increase. 

The biggest risk is that if I choose to take the new job, it is in the middle of the school year and I would have to break my contract. If something were to go wrong, I’m sure it would be tough to get back into teaching if at all. I’m young and haven’t taken too many risks but it is still a challenging decision for me. Any advice on where to go from here?

Edit: I was a biology major and am teaching elementary school so no, I don’t know what I want to do with my life",12Feb2020,1
597,"I've been working for my Uncle for the past 5 months as his administrative assistant, because his other employee (let's call her Amy) is currently in school so she can help him with his work (he's an assessor for insurance stuff). Some stuff went down with Amy and his old admin team quit, which is why he asked me to help.  He asked me if I could work for at least 6 months to a year so he could dissolve my position so he doesn't need an admin team so he and Amy can just work alone, so nothing like what happened last year would happen again. 

Amy said that since I joined late last year, it would be easier on them and me for taxes if I didn't join payroll and just worked as a contractor.  The idea was in January I would be put on Payroll so I wouldn't get hit hard with taxes.  It's now the middle of February, and I asked my Uncle if I could be on Payroll, because I know he still wants to dissolve the position and I would like to be put on EI when this is done while I look for another job.  He said yes.  He told Amy.  Amy has been putting it off til next week, because she ""wants to have a proper discussion about being put on payroll with (Uncle)"". 

I get the feeling that she doesn't want to put me on Payroll now, because we're getting close to the 6 month mark.  Amy and I get along fine at work, but she's super neurotic and causes me a lot of anxiety and grief.  I've been working full time hours, and I'm being paid minimum wage.   I know I'm not the greatest with this job, but I want to at least be able to go on EI, and I can't do that if I'm a contract worker.  I don't know what to do at this point, as I'm stuck between helping out my Uncle, and trying to move forward with my life. 

Tl;dr: Don't know if I'm getting shafted from going on payroll by Uncle's other employee, even though that's what they promised at beginning of contract job. What do?",12Feb2020,1

I'm editing my CV and I'm just so bored of myself. Every night, the house saps all my energy, I wake up shivering and I spend every day building myself up to a version of me in the evening.

I've done some work experience and placements recently and they were good, but I had a fraction of the enthusiasm I'd want to have, they became things to get through instead of me enjoying them.

I've had a year going to a job centre type thing to help me get work and I've stopped that, they're just about ticking boxes and don't know what it is I do really.

I've tried all these things and now I've stripped them away because I think it boils down to the house, but I can't do anything about the house.

604,"A few months ago my boyfriend and I got into a huge fight (nothing physical) but it eventually had our friends 'involved'. I say involved in a really light way, because I told my best friend about the ordeal and my POV, while my boyfriend told his friends his side. Our group of friends is very small and they got to talking about our issues behind our back which is to be expected...but I didn't think they'd go as far as excluding me and my boyfriend from the friend group.

So, my best friend, I'll call her D, doesn't tell a soul about my personal problems until one of my boyfriends guy friends comes along and straight up asks her. She spills the beans and the following days are her and this guy excluding us from the friend group and creating their own group on Discord just to exclude us. I try to ignore it, and give it time.

Meanwhile, me and my boyfriend are working things out and we let everyone know we're fine and I expected everyone to just come back together and be ok...I was wrong. D was mad at my boyfriend for the things I was mad at him for and I talked to her MULTIPLE times about letting it go, that I feel good and resolved, but she wasn't having it. It seemed like she wanted to go on being mad forever and I didn't want that for her.  I talked with her time and time again but it was useless and it felt stupid that she would be so mad at my boyfriend after I've told her we're fine. The issue of me and my boyfriend fighting soon became more about her and her anger issues with my boyfriend.

 After my one on one calls with her I wouldn't hear anything from the others in our group and it just seemed like she was just getting the 411 update on how we're doing just to go gossip about it with the others. Lo and behold she's only checking in on me to confirm false rumors she's hearing from the others and I get mad at her for turning my relationship into a platform for her to get popular with my boyfriends friends. While 'making an effort' to be OK with my boyfriend she does these petty childish things like ignore him, mute his voice in chat, and play games with our other friends while deliberately excluding my boyfriend. I hit my limit with her antics and I confronted her about it. She broke down crying and played the victim in the encounter but I just couldn't stand it anymore. The pettiness, the hypocrite behavior, and the empty apologies. She wasn't sorry she had behaved that way but rather she seemed more sorry that she got caught acting that way.

It's been a few months now and she hasn't spoken to me since or reached out to talk with me. I admit I haven't either but it was at her own request that she needed space.

I think about her often, I do miss her. Though I wonder if I should reach out to her? In a few days it's going to be her birthday so I thought I would just message her a happy birthday wish. Then again, I believe as the one that asked for space, she should be the one to reach out to me to indicate that she's alright to socialize.

607,"I'm a 23M studying computer science at university and I don't know what to do with myself at this point in my life. Growing up, I don't think I've ever had any sense of direction as to where I wanted to take my life - I just always assumed that when I got older it would suddenly hit me, that I would one day find something to be driven toward. But here I am almost halfway toward my thirties - aimless, unmotivated, unambitious.

The reason I chose this major is because it was the only one I was mildly interested in, but I find that I don't seem to have as much of a passion for it as many of my peers. Many of them have extra experience with programming, have gotten internships or are atleast discussing what kinds of companies they want to work for once they graduate. But thinking about what I want to do with my life after university terrifies me, I have nothing to look forward to once I graduate.

The only reason I decided to go to college was because my parents were going to pay my way and I knew that if I didn't keep doing something after highschool, I would stagnate and become a useless person. And I've come to realize that my prime motivation to perform adequately through my studies is fear of failure - fear of letting my parents down, of wasting all that they've invested in me. For many of my peers, university is a stepping stone toward some goal in their life, but for me it's just something I'm doing to stave off failure - stagnation.

Last semester I struggled and endured a lot of stress just to pass my courses by the skin of my teeth and now that the new semester has started, I've found that my tolerance to endure more stress like that is dwindling. The new semester has started and already assignments are piling up, but I can't find the drive to do them. I just shirked off 2 homework assignments and a project because I rather play videogames and pretend that they don't exist.

I don't know what to do myself at this point, I feel like I'm going through some internal crisis.",12Feb2020,1

If I can describe him, he plays the innocent victim that has no idea what he is doing. He’s 8 year old and autistic, if that means anything at all. 

I don’t know what to do with him, he’s constantly breaking everything, he laughs hysterically when he sees what he has done. He’s gotten the same treatment as the rest of us. I just see him as a waste of space that leeches off everything and now he’s broken an £800 iPad. This is the final straw.

I just want him to be disowned already. Everyday I’m worried that everything I own will be destroyed one day. I don’t want to hear anything about protecting my things better as that topic just brings a whole load of other messes. 

All he does is screech all day, do weird things and when I say he breaks things, I mean he breaks anything we don’t keep an eye on. If we decide to be happy and relaxed one second, the WiFi box might be destroyed while he’s out doing his own thing.

609," 

Some background. I've been working at the same small consulting firm (only 15 employees at the whole company) since I graduated from college about five years ago. They currently employ one person who works remotely full time, but I don't think I want to go that route. I've got a few other issues with the place that are frustrating enough that I just want to start fresh somewhere else when we move. I'm very busy at the moment, but hours die down in the summer as most of our clients operate on a calendar year and don't need much from us from April to October. Quitting in August wouldn't leave my current company in a tight spot trying to complete the work I would have been doing.

In general, I'm super excited about this move, and the logistics of transitioning from one job to the next is the reason for almost all of my anxiety. What are some general tips to going about telling management that I'm heading out the door? I have no idea how receptive they'll be. If I'm being brutally honest, I think my work here is appreciated, but I also think they'll be more disappointed by having to train a new person to fill my role than saying goodbye to me specifically. Also, when is a good time to start contacting future employers? I don't have another job lined up, but I'd like to be able to start one quickly after moving. Finally, I don't want to burn any bridges when I leave because I'm sure they'll get calls from places I apply next.

I applied for a level 1 business administration course and really didn’t enjoy it but it was a stepping stone to another path, I decided to go onto an IT course of which I spent 3 years on and graduated with a diploma at distinction level. The only qualifications I have are GCSE English, Maths and an IT diploma and a Cisco qualification. 

Moving onto work experience, my first job if you will was on a community farm, volunteering. My duties included helping school groups, assisting with valuable adults, helping the day to day operation such as Looking after the animals, doing small building and maintaince tasks, cutting the grass, trimming bushes, planting, painting repairing fencing etc etc... I found it very fulfilling. 

My next job was a retail assistant in a convenient store, working on the till, experience gained in customer service and with the public. 

As hobby’s go I’m quite creative, I do photography and I also make scratch bulit scale models and I would love to find a job relating to this skilset, also worth noting I do really enjoy working with animals. Also worth noting I'm quite introverted. 

When a graduated from college I started a new IT support job, it’s got lots of positives to it, very good pay, and other benefits but after about a year I’m starting to think IT isn’t really for me, I’m wanting a career change, based on everything above what would you say would be the best career to get into?

(I want income too, why don't you help me get rich too?) Where I feel stunted is that she handles all of my finances. On one hand she's pushing me to leave the nest, which I understand and appreciate deep down, but on the other I have no experience with managing my own bank account by myself (It's under her name, she can see everything I purchase) no experience with taxes, and she wants me to go out on my own without any of this training that shes supposed to provide while at the same time stifling my growth by handling all of my finances (she made me sign a power of attorney). I'm 23 now, completely dependant on her, while being in the uncomfortable position of having no skills, no family training or advice, while being gaslighted and pushed out of the only safe haven I've ever known. I get SSI, and I went with her to citizen's bank and they told me I can't even check my savings or access my savings because it's under her authority. I feel so trapped and stunted and squeezed betweened being babied and pacified and being forced to suddenly become independent after being babied and stunted and having the growth of my maturity sabotaged by the lack of advice and training and raising me, and the presence of having all of my finances done for me. The only thing my current situation is preparing me for is not being prepared to be on my own and being forced to struggle. If no ones going to raise me financially then what good is the power of attorney? what good is not having my own bank account? 

Lastly, I want to apologize to reddit. I've been taking and taking without giving in the form of asking questions and requests and not providing any answers and feedback. The main reason is that I'm not smart so I don't see anything I have to add as meaningful and worth contributing. I'm only asking for advice about this because I feel my whole man child millenial thing is something that can be addressed, if only incrementally, through this lens as a microcosm.

616,"I (24m) have posted here before seeking advice as to what to do about my sister (22) (who has been my roommate since this past summer) who will not clean up after herself. I was given some great advice, much of which didn't pan out, but overwhelmingly I was told to just kick her out despite truly wanting an alternative solution. I asked coworkers and friends, many of them suggested the same thing, but I truly could not bring myself to do it as I felt I would be leaving her stranded and set up for homelessness.
To clarify the situation, my sister is a mess.
She moved in 9 months ago. She really needed a place to stay and could only afford a certain amount. When the time came to talk about rules, all I asked was for her to clean up after herself (classic mistake). Since then, I've been cleaning up after her every single day. I've asked her and asked her to clean up the messes she makes and all she says is ""I'll try to do better."" The last time I asked her to clean something (yesterday) she cried.
I am trying very hard to understand her situation. She got out of a very bad relationship recently and just last week got in what could've been a much worse car wreck. We've sat up for hours talking about the breakup, but she still isn't over it. Before all of this, I could tell she was depressed or anxious or has ptsd or maybe even all three. I know this because we've both been through quite a bit of shared trauma. To put it simply, we've experienced 3 seperate shared traumas. The first was our father's abusiveness towards us and our mom, the second, our mom's death, and the third our brother's attempted suicide. There's much more to it than that but a few of these events practically split up we three siblings for a while.
Last summer she needed a place to stay. I had a spare room in a very cheap house ($700/month) and was happy to help her. I asked her to clean up after herself, we clarified this wasn't a permanent situation, and I felt everything was gonna be fine.
Things quickly got worse. 
She had already been a mess before, but I was happy to have the opportunity to catch up with her. We stayed up and talked for hours on end it was really great. We still do, but it's been a bit strained recently.
She's a horribly messy roommate. She leaves open food in the fridge, she somehow misses the trash can quite consistently, she left clotted period blood in the shower multiple times, she never does her dishes without being prompted, she's taken the trash out maybe once or twice, she leaves used silverware on the counter, she leaves used pans on the stove, she leaves empty everything (cartons, boxes, etc.) right where she grabbed the last of whatever it's contents may have been. It is frustrating. I have tried to sit her down and speak civilly about things but she just ends up saying she'll try to do better only to not do much better at all, or at least only for a day.
I said earlier that I didn't want to kick her out out of risk of being homeless. Right now she's in school, has practically no job, and she just got in a wreck that totalled her car. If I told her to find another place to live she'd be homeless. She has nowhere else to go.
I really don't know what else to do. I've been civil. I've been frustrated. I've been respectful and I still feel like I am not respected. I love my sister and I want to be there for her, but I feel very used and disrespected. How do I handle this situation?",12Feb2020,1

TLDR: Got moved to a different department without my consent and without my manager notifying HR for the past year. Manager told me as soon as things are ""figured"" out i can move back to my department and get my actual job back. Manager plans to hire another very green and inexperienced individual that fits his racial background. All of his hires has been of his background. All of his support and bias has helped people in his background and felt purposely targeted.

Hello reddit im in a weird place at work where I have been moved to a different department without my consent.

So I work in IT at a law firm as a user support analyst and just over a year n half ago I was switched to the AV group due to me and a black colleague not exactly getting along and another person from the AV group who wasn't getting along with his group. The black Colleague in question is significantly older (im in my mid twenties and hes in his fifties) and has gotten complaints left and right where i would go to an attorneys desk to re-mediate or he would get in a spat with help desk and other contractors below him (two of which been fired because they couldn't deal with him and both were black individuals as well). I have gotten into big arguments with him and would usually stay quiet when he would yell at top of his lungs during my first two years with him. It was until my sports injuries started to mount up that he really started to complain. I had shoulder surgery in Feb 2018 and a grad 3 ankle sprain in July of 2018. Around September of 2018 after i got back from vacation my manager told me i would be moving to the AV team temporarily to get a break from user support also because one of the AV guys was not getting along with his group and was tired of his specific position. Granted the AV individual in question was definitely over qualified for that position and was hired as a hybrid role between user support and AV. I was here before him though is the thing and regardless my manager made the swap and basically told me I haven't been doing the same amount of work that my older black colleague was doing which I feel it is absolutely not true. Thing is he wouldn't show me any proof when i asked for what he was exactly talking about and another thing is most of the work my colleague was doing was delivering keyboards, mouses and installing computers while i took most of the difficult work in terms of troubleshooting. While I was injured and couldn't walk I figured he could handle the easy stuff but I guess he complained and this is how I got in trouble. Now before the swap I also had very senior partner in the firm sent an email to the CIO and all the higher ups that I've done an amazing job helping him in every technical situation, another regional manager sent an email to my manager asking him to get me a raise. Anyways the point is I was doing a good job but since I didn't do a good job in the way to make my colleague happy my manager basically demoted me into a position I have no interest in.

Here is where I feel the racial bias comes in, out of the 6 hires he has done 4 of them have been black and 2 of them have been fired already within a 2 year window. There's nothing wrong with him hiring anyone that is black is just that as long as HE likes them regardless of there qualifications or proof of competence then hes has to power to hire them with whats worse almost no questions asked. It sucks because his track record is so bad and hes brought on so many incompetent people making it very difficult for all my other colleagues. He also was the only one who gave extremely positive reviews to a black female colleague of mine who is in the AV group that he hired at the time whereas the AV manager (he is black as well) gave her an extremely negative review and shes in the brink of being fired. Here's is the thing i actually think she is a great worker though and do not agree with my av manager. Shes just a quiet individual. As for me I got a very positive review from the AV manager but a very negative review from my old manager. I am middle eastern and have done a really good job in both departments where my old team lead wants me back on the user support side and my current AV manager doesn't want to let me go.

Here is the other thing I don't understand because before the AV group was under this old managers branch, 4 people have left within a year under his control and then 2 people were fired (that were his guys) the second they separated the branch from him. Currently the entire AV group right now except for one guy (who is trying to overtake the team lead) is looking for another job as the AV group has just been so poorly managed. I could contact with any of my old AV colleagues and most of them would say he was a poor manager and a reason why they left. So my old manager got away with murder and the thing that kills me is that hes still looked upon as competent as he turned this department into a torn down home and now the new AV manager is expected to fix it while more people want to leave. Ill give my old manager this in the fact that he is a very slick talker.

Currently my title still says user support. So it seems they haven't processed this through HR at all and are trying to figure out a way to do this without paperwork, pretend to forget it, or build up a case against me in order to do it. Like I said its been a year n half but I would still like to go back to my old role as I was much better at it but how if my old manager is pulling all the strings and yet I'm still under him but working for another department? Also it seems even though he told me if a user support position opens back up that i could go back but i'm hearing rumors that he wants to give it to this really young black contractor (absolutely incompetent, hes a year younger than me and it seems hes in IT just for the money as thats all he talks about but hes good at kissing ass which my old manager likes) so it seems he has lied to me yet again.

I have been voted as a captain in two of our corporate sports teams and have never really had someone say anything specifically negative to me by a customer. I am currently way overqualified than any on the support team with an engineering degree and a couple of certifications which i do feel like finding another job which my manager told me i should probably start looking for. The thing is i really do like this company and was pretty happy here.

Now my question is simple is there anything I can do? Should I talk to HR or just forget about it and find another job.",12Feb2020,1
623,"It's my first Valentine's Day with a girlfriend, and I'm a bit unsure of when to do things. I have arranged for flowers and I've got her card and gift already. But when do I give each to her when the day comes? 

Flowers—I'm thinking to bring these to her door when I pick her up for dinner. Or should I have them sent to her at work? I don't have money for both, and bringing them to her door would be cheaper... 

Card—I have the card and I've already written in it. Do I give it to her when we get back to my place after dinner, or sooner? 

Gift—I got her a nice little gift (comes in a box about the size of a Rubik's cube) but, similar to the card, I don't know when to give that to her.

Everytime (that I can think of at least) he's on his phone and I approach him, he immediately turns his phone off.

The first night I was gone 3 pairs of underwear I had ordered arrived. He sent me a photo of all three pairs. That evening he partied. 
On the Friday he partied again and had a Schizophrenic guy over who practically trashed the apartment. I got home late Saturday night. 
The house smelt pretty bad and I made a comment. Then I went to go look at the underwear and there was only 2 pairs. I’ve torn the house apart looking for them and they are not here. He claims he has no idea what happened to them. Maybe that guy took them? 

Now I feel so uneasy and when I asked if we could talk he got very irritated and angry.

628,"Hi everyone. I’m pretty bad with conflict and confrontation and am hoping to get some advice about a situation I and a couple other friends are having.

Background: I (24F) have a small group of friends that I met through the job I worked in college; we’ll call them G (23F), J (24F), and D (27F). G and J still live in the same city I went to college in, D lives about an hour away, and I now live about three hours away. We have a group chat on Snapchat where we have talked pretty much daily for the past couple years since D and I have moved away. I generally drive up to visit them and other college friends every couple of months for a weekend, and they’ve come to visit me a couple of times as well.

Let me start by saying that I have never been J’s biggest fan. I didn’t like her when we worked together, I didn’t like her after our larger group of work friends started narrowing down to the four of us, and the more I continue to get to know her, the less I like her. The only reason I hang out with her is because I want to see G (who I count as one of my closest friends) and J always shows up too. G and D were a lot closer with J than I was, but they’ve been realizing how nasty she can be due to some recent incidents.

I won’t give every detail, but basically she is just a toxic person. It’s obvious it stems from severe insecurity on her part, but knowing that doesn’t make it easier to be around her. She’s constantly argumentative with G, talks down to D, and then sucks up to me because she knows I don’t like her. When we’re together, she’s constantly on her phone, and also has a loooot of problems with the men that she dates/hooks up with that she complains to us about. She also makes a lot of weird comments that simultaneously put down someone else and make her look smarter/more accomplished. I’m open to giving more specific examples of her behavior but for the sake of anonymity I’ll leave it vague for now.

About a year and a half ago, G, D, and J all went on a trip together, and she was so difficult to be around that G and D ended up doing basically an intervention afterwards about her behavior. She seemed open to the idea of self-reflection and change, and seemed to get briefly better. But now it’s either back to how she was before, or she tries to be sweet and it just comes off as disingenuous and condescending.

Here’s my question: my birthday is in two months and I already mentioned ideas for the party it in the group chat. We also have a camping trip planned as a mini bachelorette party for D coming up this summer. We don’t want J at either of these events (for a number of reasons) and are trying to figure out how to cut her out with the minimal amount of explosiveness. We’ve started by not talking in the group chat anymore, only popping in to respond if she says something. But it seems impossible to fade her out before the events we have coming up. How do we tell someone like that that we don’t want to include them in our lives anymore?

TL;DR - myself and two other friends are trying to figure out how to cut out a toxic friend before birthday parties, trips, and a wedding coming up this year. How do we do so with the minimal amount of emotional damage, to us or her?",12Feb2020,1

631,"I'm a 23M studying computer science at university and I don't know what to do with myself at this point in my life. Growing up, I don't think I've ever had any sense of direction as to where I wanted to take my life - I just always assumed that when I got older it would suddenly hit me, that I would one day find something to be driven toward. But here I am almost halfway toward my thirties - aimless, unmotivated, unambitious.

The reason I chose this major is because it was the only one I was mildly interested in, but I find that I don't seem to have as much of a passion for it as many of my peers. Many of them have extra experience with programming, have gotten internships or are atleast discussing what kinds of companies they want to work for once they graduate. But thinking about what I want to do with my life after university terrifies me, I have nothing to look forward to once I graduate.

The only reason I decided to go to college was because my parents were going to pay my way and I knew that if I didn't keep doing something after highschool, I would stagnate and become a useless person. And I've come to realize that my prime motivation to perform adequately through my studies is fear of failure - fear of letting my parents down, of wasting all that they've invested in me. For many of my peers, university is a stepping stone toward some goal in their life, but for me it's just something I'm doing to stave off failure - stagnation.

Last semester I struggled and endured a lot of stress just to pass my courses by the skin of my teeth and now that the new semester has started, I've found that my tolerance to endure more stress like that is dwindling. The new semester has started and already assignments are piling up, but I can't find the drive to do them. I just shirked off 2 homework assignments and a project because I rather play videogames and pretend that they don't exist.

632,"TL;DR at the very bottom, but reading it all should be done

several days ago I, a 36/M got a random email from a 26/F (at least she says so) girl from Russia (at least she says so) telling me about herself. when i asked how she found me, 
she said 

""I saw advertizing on the Internet where it was told, acquaintances to men worldwide. I decided to try it, and left the mail and some information. I so understand that it is some agency of acquaintances, but I do not understand as it works""

and she's saying how she doesn't remember the website.
now, i've been suspecting it's just a bot that will EVENTUALLY send me to a website but her emails (we've sent 3 back and forth so far) do seem unusually ""normal"", like telling about her pets and she's even sent unique selfies (all plain clothed, no nudity at all, unless you count a waist showing in two of them) and i even saw her cat in the background of one and her being outside in another. in her last email she says 

""Thank you for your letter! How there passed your day? It is pleasant to me to communicate with you:) I often think of you. We have to know each other better. I hope, our letters will help us to become closer. When I write the letter, I represent how I tell it personally to you. Write me more about your thoughts of what you think. So I will be able to recognize you closer:) I said to you that I try to tell you much that you knew about me more and our acquaintance was better.

Sometimes to me becomes very alone and just there is a wish to begin to cry: (I very much lack the man with a row which will support me always and to which I can entrust myself. you have addictions? I do not smoke, I can sometimes drink a glass of wine or champagne on a holiday.
 As I to spend much time on work, I have no lot of time to be engaged in search of the man. Now the Internet for me the only opportunity to find the beloved. Perhaps it will be you?:)
I will finish the letter and I look forward to the answer""

if this person IS real, i do plan on telling my girlfriend, don't worry about that. we have no secrets between us!

643,"This just happened today, Google recently suspended my entire Google account(Drive, Mail etc..) because of a serious violation of their rules and I suspect I know which rule it is.. even worse, without thinking, I requested an appeal so a Google employee will definitely look through the contents of my Drive.

Long story short, I found some illegal imagery on 4chan depicting minors and found it intriguing - there is no buttering up what I did.. I knew it was wrong but uploaded them to Google drive but shortly after, deleted them after re-downloading them on my tablet. Yes, my disgusting actions clearly point at my wrongdoing and I know I broke the law. I have no excuses for what I did.

If Google were to report me to law enforcement, my entire life will be ruined - I will lose my job, my friends and most importantly, my family and parents whom I live with (and work for, they run a successful middle sized company with two offices in a downtown Canadian city), which I'm close to. Even worse, the images were found originally found and uploaded from my desktop at work - which means police will cause a scene at my work place or at home. The boss's son possible being arrested at work.

649,"So I'm in Construction industry as assistant QS since I graduated at 23 and I'm now 26. 

For the first two years I worked in a non-traditional consultancy which focused on dispute resolution in construction. Experience there doesn't really count for my CV. And I was given trivial and piecemeal tasks so I can't say I learnt much.

Then I got the chance to get in this top multinational consultancy. It's very good for my CV and experience/ tasks/ trainings here are more all rounded which is good for getting the professional chartership (lisence). The ways to do tasks are up to standard here since many ppl don't follow standard and don't know the right or wrong ways to deal with things in this industry. I've been in this company for 7 months but I'm thinking about changing job again because of the bad boss situation (work directly with one of the directors and have no other ppl to work with or talk to since I'm the only team member in this ""team"", the most unusual ""team"" here; basically work non-stop and can't talk since I sit so close to the director, and the director scolds me daily) 

Now I'm thinking if I should go to another professional consultancy or a main contractor for my next job. 

If I'm going to another consultancy, I can continue to learn things right and have tasks from all aspects. I might need to work overtime a lot though just like in any other consultancy. I'd hope for a better people situation there (to have teammates, to work with people of lower heirachy and not so stressed, to have normal amount of socilisation etc.) But if the people situation isn't better, and I contunue to overstress and overwork, I would be trapped there since I can't change job again. 

If I go to a main contractor then it's not that good for getting the chartership since Contractors do things kinda randomly without standard, and tend to only have certain aspects of tasks but not all rounded. But I'd be able to station in construction site and see the actual construction process, and people and atmosphere at site are more chilled and fun so I wouldn't be so stressed out. An ex colleague (woman, has worked in this industry 10 plus years) also told me that after 30-year old, women generally wouldn't wanna station at site anymore so it's not bad if I do this in my 20s. 

Also, my husband and I estimate that after 3-4 years his career will be stable and will earn more than enough so we can start having children and I don't really need to work. 

So I'm thinking if I only work for 3 -4 years more where should I go next? Also I don't wanna change job again after going to the next job since it will mark me as ""jumpy""/ ""job hopper"" in my CV if I change my job so fast again. 

After the two jobs that I've had, I think I really want a more friendly workplace, since it's such a torment to go to a job knowing the unfriendliness that's gonna fill my day. So a main contractor is safer but what if the next Contractor I go to is not that friendly? 

Anyway The most important thing is happiness but I also wanna learn things. 

Any advice is appreciated.",12Feb2020,1

651,"Ok. So, background - my sisters and I were always close with our grandfather, who we lived with off and on since I was 7, and who helped raise us. When he passed, it was sudden and unexpected. We were distraught. At his funeral, we (me15 sis16 and sis17) reconnected with our cousin (30) and began IM'ing, calling, and he even stayed at our house a few times with his wife. That's all normal, right? Or, at least, ok, right? Right.

But, now, 10 years later, I struggle with some of the stuff that was really happening, and the weird stuff he would say and do.

For example, he would ask us what we were wearing. Almost every time we talked. We would laugh it off, and say we were wearing scuba gear, or a clown costume- something silly. He would laugh it off at first, but sometimes he would press us on the issue.

He always, ALWAYS, ""joked"" About how cousins could get married in Arkansas, and how cool that was. This then progressed to talking about how you could marry multiple women if you were a Mormon in Utah.

We always brushed it off as him just being silly and quirky, and also that's our cousin! We shouldn't be thinking he means anything by what he's saying!

His last visit, though, I remember him picking up an electric massager of my mom's for her bad leg, and he made a comment about how he could use it like a vibrator. On one of us. Like, that's weird, right? Cousins, men 15 years older than you, don't say stuff like that, right?

Now, I am almost ready to start sending invites to my wedding, and everyone (except my sisters) expect me to invite him. I really really don't feel comfortable with that though. I haven't had contact with him for years, and I have to desire to. Should I just do it to avoid family drama? Or should I tell my parents about what happened in the past, which will also only lead to family drama?

661,"I moved in August of 2019 from DC to Richmond with a ""plan."" 

&amp;#x200B;

My job title is a ""clinical research coordinator,"" which means I do loads of data entry, and I went from one employer to another in richmond to do the same. The pay for this area is decent, but I spend 8-10 hours a day plugging in numbers and I can't do this for the rest of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

The original plan was to get a business analytics certificate online, and hopefully within 6-12 months after finishing I would transition out of working in a hospital. Now, worked has had me slammed, and keeping up with the coursework was too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am looking for *any* job to get me out of sitting at a desk and doing admin ALL DAY, I just feel like this isn't for me and I want something entirely different. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've put in a bunch of resumes in this area and I feel like the traction just isn't moving fast enough for me to get the F out! 

&amp;#x200B;

I still am studying some python here and there, but I realize I need a quick fix, and I need it now. I thought about quitting - but money pays the bills... 

&amp;#x200B;

Its just the bigger problem here is I am being asked to do a job of 2-3 people, and expected to know medical knowledge that is wayyyyyy above my pay grade 

My rough plan moving forward 

1. Apply to jobs through Easy Apply on LinkedIn 
2. Apply to jobs I really want within the same employer but in a different department 
3. Attend job fairs when I can (sneak out of work)
4. Do the BARE minimum at work and stop feeling pressured by deadlines
5. Study programming SOME but not too much that it takes away time away from the job search 
6. Still workout -- see a counselor too

694,"In the late summer, a cat showed up on our porch. For the sake of clarity, let’s call him Bob. No tag, pretty filthy and skittish around us but not entirely feral. We fed him on the porch, like we do the two other neighborhood cats who are truly feral (Joe and Jack), and gave him space. Fast forward to November, he’s still hanging out on the porch but now he accepts pets, belly rubs, being picked up and is clearly a very sweet cat that is socialized to humans. 

As mentioned, we have two feral cats who live in our front yard, where we have a vegetable garden. We feed them and they generally stay in the garden. As the temperatures started dropping in winter we built a shelter for Joe and Jack, which went unused. Bob pretty much lived on the porch. 

In January it got extremely cold and we wanted to bring him inside. Before doing that, we checked our neighborhood Facebook page, Reddit and Nextdoor for missing cat postings, came up with nothing. We also took him to the vet for a checkup and to see if he was chipped. He is, but the phone number registered is from a town 45 miles north of us. The vet called on our behalf, and the person said that they don’t own a cat. Seems it was a registration screwup with the local humane society where Bob was adopted from, and the vet said that in their view, Bob was ours. 

We bring him home and he’s doing great, really just the best cat you could ask for. About a month in, we get a note on our front door from a neighbor up the street, saying they were relieved to see their cat sitting in our window. The note was written on a lost cat flier that we had never seen before. We live in a fairly small neighborhood, with just a few streets. We have a dog and walk around the neighborhood quite frequently and this was a first. The flier also noted that Bob is an outdoor cat that they permit to roam at will. Apparently the owners were housesitting an Anatolian Shepherd for an extended period, Bob got spooked and ran away. 

We were beyond bummed to lose this great cat, but we called up the owner. After a few days, they picked up Bob (and to their credit reimbursed us for the vet bills, though we didn’t ask for it.) We were sad to see him go but were happy to reunite him with his family, and they said they’d keep him indoors now that the dog guest is gone. 

It’s been a week since. Bob is still living on our porch. He cries outside our bedroom window and tries to dart inside every time we come in or out. It’s pretty heartbreaking and also frustrating that the owners are still letting him outside, untagged. It’s been raining all week and he really wants to come inside. 

We’ve been in touch with the owners, they’ve texted a few times asking us not to feed Bob or let him indoors, in hopes that he’ll return to his routine of coming to their house for breakfast and roaming the streets at night. Also to note, Bob is a big boy - 13 lbs. - and the vet advised us to feed him 3x daily, so we’re also worried that breakfast and street pickings isn’t cutting it. 

This morning was the last straw - with Bob aggressively protecting “his” porch space from Joe and Jack, chasing them into the street, just as a car was coming. Our street isn’t a highway but it’s heavily trafficked and no place for an animal to roam unattended. Thankfully none of the cats were hurt, but it’s incredibly frustrating. 

We feel like we’re in a no-win situation. We want to be civil to our neighbors, but are firm believers against socialized cats roaming outside (especially without ID). We love Bob and want the best for his safety, and we want our feral boys to be safe as well. Not sure what to do.

I live in Monemvasia, it's a rural village in Greece with a small population, it's like a normal town, supermarkets, schools, resteraunts, etc. Anyways, I'm in High School, and we explored everything. Every abandoned house, every cave, every illegal thing you could think of, we've done it. And normally, junior high-16 yr olds come down to the center of the town on Fridays and Saturdays, but due to a split in friend groups (we used to be a huge friend circle with little groups (cliques) that certain people got put in, even tho we were in the same circle). Due to the split, the smaller groups are now small enough to go to people's houses, and nobody comes down anymore, leaving a majority of us bored, as the magic of having a huge group and having a shit ton of fun is gone. Anyways, I went on this subreddit to find help thinking of ideas of fun things we could do, I listed the things the town has below (landscape, laws against certain stuff etc) and hopefully someone can help make Monemvasia fun again.

•Beach and water, a lot of it (cant swim until late March)
•a old castle, we've climbed up so many times it's boring
•lots of nice hiding places and walls for games like airsoft
•3 basketball courts
•2 Marinas

What MONEMVASIA DOESNT HAVE:
•Easy access to other big towns, we are quite seperate as the nearest big town is 30 mins to hour away by car
•a lot of area, about 1 mile in length, (maybe less)
•stuff we haven't searched (we have discovered every last bit of land there
• WEVE DONE EVERYTHING, played Cops and robbers, jumped off every cliff into water, basically caught ever fish in the marina 2 times over.

699,"Last night I called an Uber to take me home from the hospital. Within the first minute, he started saying some really concerning things. He asked why I’d been in the hospital and I told him I’d had an allergic reaction. He said “Blame it on the voices in your head. Always blame it on the voices.” He then randomly joked about us being chased by cops. After that, he launched into a five minute rant about how angry black women are. He went on and on about how you can’t argue with a black woman because she will fight you or attack you with a liquor bottle, whereas white women will just yell. He started doing impressions of black women (complete with finger wagging). I thought it was kind of hilarious and unbelievable that he was saying all of this to me (a black woman) so I recorded him and sent the video to my friend. My friend said that I should report him and that he could put a passenger in danger. It never crossed my mind to report this and I don’t want someone to lose their job. 

I should note: It also occurred to me (through the manner in which he was talking— excessively and fast paced) that he may have some sort of mental or social deficiency. I wasn’t extremely affected by this situation but am I possibly putting someone in danger by not reporting his conduct?",12Feb2020,1
700,"We've been friends for about more than 2 years now and we were in the same class, and still continued to text each other and sometimes see each other and go somewhere after we graduated, but around the end of December he started to text me less often, and stopped asking me to come along wherever he's going. We would talk normally when I texted but it seemed like he would rarely text me and I didn't know wether I should still text him or not. I didn't text him for a week and he didn't either but 5 days ago I texted him again and we talked but it was just me asking something and him responding to me and nothing else. Then today when I texted him again he replied but this time he started texting me about another topic and we talked just like we used to, without ending the conversation with 2-3 messages. I don't know wether I should keep texting him sometimes or wether I should just stop texting him and stop bothering him, and I don't feel like I could just ask him wether I am annoying him or not. I don't think I've done or said anything that could have made him act cold towards me either. I want to understand what to do fast because I don't want to continue to bother him.",12Feb2020,1
701,I am a 22 year old female interning in a physical therapy office. I’m a very shy person and it takes me awhile to feel comfortable at new jobs and places before I open up. And in general it takes me a little bit to feel new people out before I feel comfortable. Anyway I just started to feel comfortable as I enter my 3rd week (twice a week) in this office. I said hi to an older male patient and he goes “Oh you speak” I wanted to tell him it’s rude to say that but I don’t have the place being an intern and all. Then he proceeds to go over to a female patient and tell her the same conversation he had with me and they started laughing together. Is it right for me to be upset?

702,"Last year, I was under a lot of stress in school because I wasn't working and therefore money was tight. While I was complaining about this on Twitch, one of my regular viewers suggested I sell my used underwear online. I thought he was kidding at first, but he was pretty persistent and I ended up selling him a pair for $20.

That ended up escalating and I was selling more and more pairs a week. I thought it was gross at first but eventually got used to it and was kind of excited about my new business. (If you could even call it that lol.) I was selling pairs I had on for multiple days, period panties, and ones with other....bodily fluids. I would mail them in cute little packaging with handwritten notes and polaroids of me wearing the pair I was sending. I was making a good amount of money and having fun doing it!

I stopped because I got into a relationship, (although I bet there would be a market for post-sex underwear... there are some interesting people out there! xD)

I posted this on r/offmychest and people seemed to be accepting of it, so my question is this:

Should I do it again? I don't think I would tell my current boyfriend. Is it cheating? I'm not sure.

703,"My mom and I have had an off and on relationship over the years and it's only gotten worse. After trying to help mend things I realized she has manipulative and narcissistic tendencies. 

I'm trying to make this short. She abused and choked me in my childhood. I ran away to my dad's house and a couple years later she lost her house and had no where to go. So now she's living with us because my dad is a huge push over and I guess ""loves her"". Their relationship is toxic. Now she's taken over the house as if it was her own. I'm 22 now, I went through depression and can't decide on a degree. Now I'm living at my dad's home with my boyfriend while we save money and I figure out something. My dad has expressed several times he doesn't mind us living with him. But my mom CANNOT stand this and has done everything to make me want to leave.

The situation is we got into an argument that she started about me and my boyfriend doing nothing being two grown adults. ( I've had several jobs and he's working rn) ( we have asked for NOTHING other than the roof over our heads) ( she has done nothing to pick her life up and mooches off my dad) I wish I could explain more, but she just threatened me after I accidentally got in her way. ""Don't you dare fuck with me, I've got nothing to lose."" I just went to my room and I want to get out of here. My dad doesn't try to intervene. He tries to avoid all of our arguments as ""just get along"". I need to call someone. I don't know what to do. I have no where to go.

According to FedEx, the driver knocked on the door to deliver the package. As the driver was about to get into his truck, a man came out and the package was delivered to the man. This neighbor has taken every single package that was delivered to the wrong house (aka his). Even my sister’s college textbooks.

710,"background: I’m a college freshman. Over this past summer, my dad got a job in the same state as my university, so the two of us have been living here together since July. My mom is currently on the other side of the country living in our house while we wait for it to sell. 

Basically, my parents have always fought. They’re very different people and I’ve often wondered why they decided to get married in the first place. They piss each other off and have terrible communication, and have been that way for as long as I can remember.  Over the last five or so years, my mom has often mentioned that if it weren’t for me and my sister, she and my dad would have split up long ago. That’s been a really disconcerting thing to hear from my own mother but i always brushed it off as temporary anger/menopause/symptoms of her depression speaking. 

However, since my dad and I have been living out here, it’s only gotten worse between them. I won’t go into detail for length’s sake, but they’ve finally seemed to just give it up. We recently received and then accepted an offer on the house, so my mom will be coming out here in a few months. She called me the other day to tell me that she would be “moving to [city a few hours south of where my dad and i currently live] when the time comes.” I was a bit confused at the implications in the moment, as their issues hadn’t seemed any more serious than they always had been — so why would she live and work separately from my dad? 

This statement from her kind of solidified the fact that they’re splitting up, and whether that means they get a divorce or just take time apart, i don’t know. I cant say i never saw it coming, but i didn’t really ever think it would come this far..

i haven’t talked to anyone about this except my mom and my sister a bit (sister lives overseas atm, hard to line up our schedules to talk), and I really need to talk to someone but have been unable to make myself open up to my friends. I feel like if i say it to anyone outside my immediate family, it’ll become real and I’ll actually have to deal with it.

This semester has been killing me inside. i’m not sure if it’s my classes, this, the fact i’m cutting myself off from my closest friends to avoid talking about this, or all of the above, but i’m just feeling incredibly detached from my family, friends, and life in general. I feel like the days are whizzing past and i don’t have any control over what’s happening. 

TLDR; my parents are unofficially breaking up, i feel like i can’t talk to anyone about it, I’m feeling out of control in life and i don’t know what to do about it.

with all that said, if anyone has advice on how to deal with this and get through my semester without losing my shit, i’d rlly appreciate it.

Afterwards I said, ""wow this is great"" she said ""I was a little nervous people wouldn't like it"" i replied ""yeah you seemed a little stressed when I saw you earlier"". 

She caught me off guard when she replied back with ""why would you say that?"" then I explained when I saw her earlier she just looking like she was stressed out. I wasn't trying to be offensive, I don't know what to do.

The next morning she walked passed me and just kept saying ""are you stressed?! you look stressed! you seem really stressed out"". Without me saying a single word to her. Then as she leaves she says ""you don't know how annoying that is"" and I had a pit in my stomach. I didn't know I upset her so much and I don't understand. I ever texted her later and apologized and told her again how amazing she did with her showcase but she didn't respond.

She went on vacation for a few days and today was her first day back. I said good morning to her but she just turned her head away and ignored me. I work in a lobby and today she's taking a different route to avoid interaction with me.

725,"Hello everyone, I’ve been freaking out for a while now. 

In October of 2019, I enlisted in the Army as an E-3 in the National Guard as a helicopter repairer. For those who aren’t aware, one weekend every month, you’re required to go to a drill in order to get paid. 

That part didn’t phase me, what bothered me was the fact that I wasn’t getting paid. I just got paid TODAY for the great sum of $600 and some change. They took $400+ away in taxes which to me seems very ridiculous. I’ve put my last half a year on hold to prepare my relationship, and myself for when I leave for basic training. I haven’t worked since enlisting for that very reason. 

I have bills to pay and my money is getting low. I’m not going to leave my home for 6 months of training if I can’t rely on them to help me. Everytime I’ve brought it up to a higher ups attention, they shrugged it off and told me I’d be paid soon. Every drill, they would treat their recruits like shit. I get that it’s the army now and it’s not supposed to be all smiles but when you’re getting insulted and not even getting paid for it, it’s pretty demeaning. 

I’ve had my fair share of problems recently such as a childhood friend who took his life, struggling to maintain my payments due to my own negligence, and other goofy stuff like this, so I feel as though I am nearing my breaking point with everything. I am feeling mentally exhausted and extremely stressed out over what to do. If I back out now, my dad will get mad and I’ll also get mad at myself because it feels like I’m giving up. Honestly, I’m not scared of training or being away, I’ve gotten comfortable at the fact. I’m just disgusted at how I’ve been treated since joining and due to life events, I’m not at 100%. 

I was going to go to college for an engineering degree once I got back from training but since my money is running low, I’m thinking of backing out and going to the north slope or something else for work. What do you guys think I should do? I’m honestly lost and scared to talk to my family about this for now...",12Feb2020,1
726,"So I am a freshman in college currently in my second semester. Last semester I had a writing professor that for the sake of simplicity I’ll just call M. M and I butted heads all last semester on a range of things and I swore up and down that I would not take another class with them. 

This semester I ended up with M again but decided not to drop the class in order to just get the course out of the way and because I thought I knew what they would want from me in my work. 

So we have started the work that will ultimately lead to our final papers for the class. Our final paper is a research paper that we work on throughout the semester. One of our first assignments is a proposal paper that basically presents what we want to research and why it is important. So for a proposal paper you would need a.) your topic you want to research, b.) a few academic sources about that topic, and c.) the actual written paper. 

M originally said that we could write our research papers on ANYTHING we wanted. People even asked M if they could run their topics past them so they could see if it would be a good topic before writing the proposal paper. M told everyone who asked this that anything they chose would probably be fine. I originally chose invasive species as a topic cause I find wildlife very interesting and it’s a topic not many people are educated on. 

M shot down my idea telling me that I would be too much of a scientific topic and not one that relates to the humanities enough. On top of shooting down my idea she gave me a zero on the paper (paper is worth 100 points). The reason she gave me a zero was because she didn’t like the topic and actually had nothing to do with my writing. In fact she said my writing was great (I believe that in a writing class we should be graded on our skill, not the topic but oh well). She did give me an extension to find a new topic, new sources and rewrite the paper. She never said how long the extension would be but considering the work load and the fact I’m in other classes I assumed about a week. 

I feel that I should add that at this point I had a few friends tell me that I should complain to the dean or someone higher in command about this since she told the class one thing and then did something totally different when grading it. I did consider it but thought it wouldn’t be worth it since she was giving me and extension to make up my grade. 

It was Monday (2-10-2020) that she gave me the extension and told me she didn’t like my topic. Today is Wednesday (2-12-2020) and she for my new proposal in class today. 

M gave me a ONE DAY extension to find a new topic, find new sources, and rewrite a whole new paper. Keep in mind I am a college student. I have other classes as well as this one that I also have work I need to get done for. 

I am wondering if this is a good reason to complain to someone higher up in command. The fact that she gave me such a short amount of time to redo an entire assignment that when originally done the had been given a week to do. 

This isn’t the first time I wanted to complain about this professor. Last semester she would yell at me (in class) for things that ranged from having a different opinion than her to things going wrong that were more often that not out of my control. She would often discuss very uncomfortable and controversial topics in class, on one such occasion it was a very dark topic that was very personal to me which resulted in me having an anxiety attack in the middle of class because I was afraid that if I tried to leave I would be yelled at. She then in the next class joked about me having an anxiety attack which only made me feel immensely worse about what happened and the rest of the class visibly uncomfortable. The only reasons I never complained about these things to anyone was because I though they would be seen as more of a personal problem and not as a valid complaint. 

So final thoughts, should I take it up with a dean or someone else and file a complaint about this professor?",12Feb2020,1

She took it more seriously than U thought she would and in the end I dropped a ton of hints I'm lesbian

I have only spoken to him about this new addiction in passing. Avoiding the word ""addiction"" at all costs. Over the past few months, his parents have been reaching out to me asking about their son, as they aren't able to keep in touch with him.

They are high school sweethearts, the dad hadn’t ever been with another woman so they started swinging sometime after their daughter was born, I suppose for his benefit since mom was never crazy about the idea. He would often go for blondes with big boobs when they swung so the mom ended up dying her hair and getting her boobs done too. It seems like she pandered a lot to him. They also partied a lot, shows, music festivals, etc. and all of what those events imply. Mom seemed a bit like the instigator for the party side of things. They had really struggled to get pregnant so I don’t know why once they had their kid why they didn’t put the partying aside and I was always hoping they would.

He had mentioned divorce several times and said he wanted to be a power couple and he didn’t feel like she pulled her weight. He was pretty dumb with money tho, and pretty much ran the finances and she was oblivious. They were always getting new cars and stuff but wouldn’t ever save up to get out of renting apartments. Later he blamed her for that never happening because he had hoped he would have got a house.

Anyways they dated a couple and got broken up with. He was infatuated with the other woman and she had bonded with the man so it was hard on them. She decided their lifestyle was too much and that she needed professional help to overcome her problems and get her head right. He took that opportunity to get a protection order and begin a divorce which it was obvious he had been preparing for some time. I thought this was a turning point for her.

They separate and the divorce/custody is ongoing. She struggled to make enough money. She ended up on a sugar daddy site and that is now her only income. One of the men was inappropriate with her daughter and so now that’s a whole other legal battle and another protection order is brought on her and pending. She can't claim this income in the custody battle or taxes.

Dad doesn’t know about her income. She shows no signs of stopping and she is already planning her next out of state music festival while complaining she can’t afford her attorney fees. I worry that her judgment has already placed her daughter in harm’s way and I thought it would be a wake-up call but apparently not. My dilemma is whether to arm dad with incriminating messages in order to help him gain custody where I believe daughter is safest. Granted I don’t have updates on his current lifestyle only that he has a steady girlfriend and has managed to pay his attorney. I only care about the child’s safety at this point and that is the only reason I entertain the idea of involving myself. What should I do?",12Feb2020,1

I had just gotten back a rubber chicken back from our band director because i was doing a harmless inside joke with them. So i then go to my 2nd class of the day and obviously the teacher could see so she said the following ""if i hear that thing than im writing you up"" ^(ok boomer) So i say ok and while i taught it was a bit extreme but i can understand. So 1 class later we are walking in and a old friend of mine grabbed the chicken and squeezed. I told the dude to hand it back but he wouldn't. Then the teacher from earlier  walks in and tells me to hand her the chicken. So i grab it from him and hand it over and she then says this. ""Im writing you up and calling home"". So i think to myself that this is gonna be a weird talk when i get home. I then get a email from the office saying that i will be getting a day of In School Suspension and 3 days of d hall because i ""Disrupted a active lecture"".

PLS HELP give me an honest opinion on whether this seems like a juvenile joke. 

On the right hand side of our bus you can see a true wonder of the biggest desert on earth. First appeared here right after the notorious Producto Designo Degreeo, this oasis of creativity is populated with some of the wildest creatures we’ve ever seen.

For example this quadruped giant right in front of the pond is called Strategic Design, two small apes roaming around, playing with a big piece of creative problem solving that chipped from the S shaped rock are Creative direction and Project management . The pile of dirt that is covered with ant holes is the collaborators hill. Different insects live there, united by a single goal and empathy they’re building on top of each others homes to create the neatest collaborator hill ever. The “S” shaped rock I referred to earlier is a showpiece of it’s own, being here ever since the beginning of the oasis, it is now covered with an array of hard minerals, though most of the surface is taken up by 3D modelling, Rendering and low - volume manufacturing, if you look closer you can see developing ones, such as object oriented programming with C# and algorithmic modelling.

While most of the inhabitants, came here after the 4 year long journey through Industrial and Interior design lands, some of them naturally occur here due to the very high degree of curiosity and self - learning in the soil. This time of the year we’re witnessing a rare event of transition that is driven by existing inhabitants being eager to make new friends and make the space even more diverse.",12Feb2020,1

745,"My boyfriend and I have been together nearly a year, at the beginning of our relationships he had a drug problem and was lying to me about it. This created many more lies. I was always suspicious of his roommate (she lived with him and his mom) but he always told me they weren't friends and he never saw her that way. But she acted very friendly with him so it was alway odd to me. Little things of hers (bobby pin, tweezers, nail clippers) were in his room that he would actually use lol. Anyway I start getting really suspicious, he's making up bullshit stories, she ends up moving out and he moves into my place and I try my best to pretend nothing was strange about the whole thing.

Cut to a couple of days ago... I've been seeing SO many angel numbers the past couple of months and that morning as well, I'm not even sure if I believe that shit. But I'm like, tf universe?? What is it that you've been trying to tell me? Just please tell me so I can figure this shit out. That day I go to check the mail, and I find a newsletter that was sent to my boyfriend's old roommate but at MY address. There is NO WAY IN HELL this girl should know my address or where I live. The letter was from a gun shop in my city, where my boyfriend actually had an interview around August before he got his current job. I called the gun store and they said the only way that could really happen is if someone goes to their shooting range and fills out a waiver using that address. And if a group of people use the same address, they may just send a newsletter to a single person from the group. I asked them to look up my bf to see if he was also on file, and nothing came up (to be fair, his name is easily misspelled and they dont confirm with ID). She had MY address on file, and the address they lived together at.

His mom got involved and asked the roommate, she claims she only went once with a family member years ago. And my boyfriend will not admit it, is begging and crying and seems to not be lying to me. But in my head this cannot be a coincidence, and I'm pretty sure they're both just lying to me and his mom.

I'll fill up all the bottles and then he fucking jugs them down like a gorilla and then doesn't fill them back up. I know it sounds petty but there are 1000 things more I can add. 

Now yesterday he was studying while I have a conversation with my mom. We were sitting on the bed. Out of nowhere in the middle of the conversation, he starts screaming like a fucking pig how he's not able to study and orders me to get off the bed. So ofcourse my mother tells me to let the prince study and get off the bed. When I refuse, he again starts screaming.

I first noticed the warning signs when she kept trying to make me only talk to her, as I said I love meeting new people, especially if I'm in a new setting. Other signs include when she continuously tried to make me follow her again I hate being controlled so I refused, which made her angry and throw meanless words at me. However, I didn't say anything. After all, I didn't want to waste my energy and also because, I kinda noticed that she had mental issues, which is fine because I was diagnosed in the past with severe depression which I thankfully recovered from, and understand where she may be coming from. However, that doesn't justify the way she's treating me.   
These days I keep hating the mere thought of school when I remember that I have to socialize with her, and that is NOT ok because I love school and learning ( jeesh I sound like a nerd).

But I made some mistakes in the friendship (which she forgave me for and knew it wasn’t intentional). But February 2019 we just started talking less and less. So the month before, I asked her if she wanted to go to our school’s winter formal dance as friends. She said yes that she’d be fine with that. Later I suggested we could go grab dinner (not a date, I don’t like her in that way) before and she said she wouldn’t have time because she had to do her nails and hair and shit. So later she said she was going by herself because she had no one to go with (which was a lie, we were supposed to be going together as friends). But later I’d mentioned formal to ask about the plans and she said she was going with female friends of hers. I asked if I could tag along since I now had no one to go with. She said they were doing a girls thing and going to get dinner before (but she claimed to me that she “wouldn’t have time” to do that). I was kinda hurt since I’d essentially been lied to. After that, we started talking and talking less and less. I’d sit with her and her little group at lunch and she would flat out ghost me. I’d wait for her to speak to me and at least say “hey!” or “hi!” or something, but she wouldn’t. I basically stopped talking to her because she apparently seemed to show less interest in being my friend. I mean I’d text her here and there since then but I never talked to her as much as I used to. So January 2020 I apologized for everything and we started talking again.

756,"I have a 9-5 but that pay isn’t the best so I work part time at a bar. While I look for a new full time job. The bar has a high turnover rate and we recently got a new manager. 

We have a crappy backdoor and when the manager was talking to everyone in the front of the bar the door slammed when I came out of it. So he told me not to slam the door. I made a confused face at him and told him that I didn’t slam it, that’s how the door is. He then proceeded to tell me that if I want to have an attitude I can be replaced. I again told him I was just telling u what the door did. Honestly he was talking to me very rudely so I responded in a similar manner. 

Fast forward to a week later. I am no longer on the schedule only 2 days. And I’ve messaged him asking about it and no response. BUT he’s sent out group texts to everyone we work with AND he’s gone in my schedule approving days I can’t work that I’ve had since I’ve started there. 

So obviously he’s avoiding me. 

Side notes: 
- all my coworkers know he doesn’t like me and he even proceeded to tell them all so 
-after the door incident one girl went to the manager and even told him that’s how the door was and that I didn’t do anything 
-I have dates and lists of things that happened to make my case to HR. For instance a guy had touched me inappropriately and my manager kept asking me if I was sure if it happened instead of immediately handling the guy. Something similar happened again on a different day when women complained about a man bothering them and he told me “we have to be careful cause they could be lying. Or they flirted with him and are now trying to run away”

So long story short should I even bother with messaging him again or go to our HR? I really like my side job but I find this new manager to be making my life hard for no reason. I frankly don’t want to be a suck up either.

758,So my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years broke up with me 2 weeks ago (the day Kobe passed) and since then it’s been weird between us. She lives with me since she has no place to stay (3rd time she’s lived with me in the past 2 1/2 years). Their will be days she’s out the house for days on end and then she’ll come back as if nothing happened. She said she still wanted to be friends after the break up but last Friday I guess was the last straw for her. I invited her to an event to go to that day and she never gave a clear answer not only that she had been gone from the house most of the day. She’s at work or her friends house. So I didn’t ask her about it cause I’m thinking she has plans probably. So I tell her to take an Uber to the house since I have plans with friends. So I end up going to the event and then I see her best friend and her boyfriend (who I’ve spent holidays with and have upmost respect for). She ends up texting my ex and tells her I’m there and my ex gets pissed because I didn’t ask her and said she wanted to go and her not so clear answer (she said we’ll see) was a yes pending. Moments later her friend ends up getting her an Uber to the event and I only stay for a few more minutes. She doesn’t come home that night and blocks me on social media. The next day after I get off work I see her in my room and I try to talk with her and she gets really pissed. Saying I didn’t ask and I assumed that she wasn’t gonna go and that’s why we aren’t in a relationship. So since Sunday she has been gone from my house. No communication at all. all of her stuff is still here. I don’t know where she is. A part of me wants to give her the option of making peace and letting her stay till she has the money saved up to move into her own place (which would take 4 months according to her) or just telling her to pack her stuff and go since she’s been gone out the house for days and most likely has a place to stay.,12Feb2020,1

hes always sided with my abusive parents since the beginning of our relationship. hes been with me through a lot of the abuse. At first i would tell him everything. Id vent to him and actually thought hed support me and back me up


i learned real quick that isnt the case. hed side with them through everything. Hed act like their friend. I get it, he wants to make a good impression. But him siding with them, telling them it was the right choice, and hes happy they spoke up about it (and screamed at me) just aint it. 

for the past few months the abuse is getting worse. Today was awful.  He told me to just move on and stop giving her what she wants, a reaction. he wasnt even there when it happened and he acts like i was feeding into her.

We would talk normally when I texted but it seemed like he would rarely text me and I didn't know wether I should still text him or not. I didn't text him for a week and he didn't either but 5 days ago I texted him again and we talked but it was just me asking something and him responding to me and nothing else. Then today when I texted him again he replied but this time he started texting me about another topic and we talked just like we used to, without ending the conversation with 2-3 messages. I don't know wether I should keep texting him sometimes or wether I should just stop texting him and stop bothering him, and I don't feel like I could just ask him wether I am annoying him or not. I don't think I've done or said anything that could have made him act cold towards me either.",12Feb2020,1

765,"CONTEXT: Hey, so my school life is completely messed up. The parent that was supposed to be homeschooling me my entire life gave up around the 8th grade (I’d argue way before) and now I’m a junior, stuck, still doing freshman grade testing. I’m behind so much in my home work and I feel helpless. I’ve realized now that I want to go to my states university, do Greek life, make friends, go to games, do stuff I was never able to do (or was very limited). I want to know if anyone has tips, this parent won’t let me get my license and has access to all my money, so I need to find at home ways to really buckle down and hopefully cram two years before senior year so I can take the ACT, get my transcript, and get the hell out of that home and get a degree. The parent blames this all on me, and I will say that I have been a little lazy, but this is not on me, others in my life agree. I feel like I’m drowning, and if there are any teachers, councilors, ANYONE who could help I’d really appreciate it. I’m desperate.",12Feb2020,1
766,"My friend, I'll refer to her as 'M', has been taking 5-6 painkillers, at least twice every week, maybe even every day, since a month. She has a history with self-harm, she used to cut herself, but thankfully, she's stopped, and did battle through depression. For context, M is 15 (me being in the same age group) and is also closeted in a conservative family - she's gone through a whole ton of shit. I really love her and I want to help her but I don't know know how. She told me about her addiction yesterday, and all I could muster up was telling her I will always be there for her, support her, listen to her. And that is what I will do. But I want to get her out of this addiction, I just don't know how.

We talked for at least an hour after she told me, coming to the conclusion that this addiction was a coping mechanism. I would recommend her other ways to cope with her demons and whatnot but I am also trying to avoid to seem too controlling - not to mention that I have no clue what to recommend. She's been experienced something known as 'derealization' and refused to see a therapist - and I do not want to force anything on her. She experiences physical withdrawal symptoms (at least that's what my research shows) if she doesn't have extra painkillers and has overdosed. This addiction has gone from bad to beyond terrible.

I'm afraid if I try to help her, she might think of me as some authority trying to control her. Or panic about telling me - as I'm only one of two people she has told. I want to help her, get her to stop but I don't want to be the reason she goes back to cutting herself, or punching walls. Telling an adult is out of question because I believe that will trigger her to return to her old habits. She doesn't do well with being counselled by therapists, et cetera. 

Can someone please offer me some advice to help my friend? Thank you - in advance.",12Feb2020,1

771,"I was on medication from 13-19 years old. &amp; not light stuff either. (antipsychotics, anti anxiety, antidepressants, &amp; a lot of ahdh meds), I was also a very heavy drug addict (tho nothing like meth, heroin, pcp, etc., but stuff like coke, adderall, even coricidin HPB). So anyways the reason I got on medication is because I was wrongly diagnosed with borderline personality disorder at 13 years old, &amp; then was moved onto bipolar towards 17.

I stopped doing drugs in Oct of 2018, &amp; I stopped taking all medication in September of 2019. My medication withdrawals lasted 3 months which I have successfully gone through. But I do now realize that I do not have any of those personality disorders because I never went into a manic state again. even now, &amp; I dont feel the same way I did when I felt like I was bipolar (medication abuse, along with drug abuse, triggers bipolar like symptoms, tho does not induce full on bipolar). idk if any of that makes sense, but being 13 years old &amp; diagnosed with that disorder, is very typically wrong &amp; never ends up being the case.

I have suffered so much damage to my mind &amp; to my body, but not just with the forced medication, but with my self esteem too. I spent years torturing myself &amp; beating myself up cause I thought I was born to be ""fucked up for the rest of my life""

Now that I'm off these medications, I have started to realize all the stuff that I shrugged off that actually caused a lot of pain.

That being said, I'm going to try to be fairly descriptive of my situation in hopes that someone(s) can offer me some actionable advice.  Here goes...

&amp;#x200B;

**Please forgive my formatting.**  


A little more than a year ago, my (then) fiancee and I were laid-off when our company was bought-out.  We'd been staying with my grandmother and living well beneath our means for a year in order to save money for our wedding and put a down payment on our first home.  We managed to save almost $20k during that year.  Fiancee went on unemployment and casually pursued work for a few months;  I did not file for unemployment.  Obviously, I've made bad decisions in my life that have put me in my grandma's house at age 33 - but opting against filing for benefits is what I consider the first big fail in the sequence of fails you're now reading about.  I would try to rationalize that for you but it boils down to ""I was on unemployment once when I was younger, and it made me complacent and didn't want to risk that again.""  Plus, I was confident I could quickly find work.  


I started aggressively pursuing work in new and interesting fields.  I was tired of working IT and I saw this as my opportunity to move in a new direction.  My fiancee wholeheartedly supported this and went so far as spending a few entire days helping me look for jobs to apply for.  After a couple months of applying and getting nothing more than a few phone interviews, I landed an interview for an absolute dream job and flew on my own dime to TX (from KY) only to have the hiring manager email me to reschedule on the morning of the interview (she had to go out of town for an emergency situation and would not return for a week or more).  Dejected, I flew back home.  


Shortly after I returned, fiancee got a job working at a nearby factory. It wasn't what she wanted, but it paid okay and had good benefits. I started to look for more realistic jobs.  I got depressed.  Fiancee was spending most of her free time planning our wedding, and I was spending most of my free time reading and listening to podcasts; trying to get inspired or motivated. I landed a temp job at a local call center, but I couldn't make myself go to work. I got pretty pathetic there for a bit, to be honest.  


**Things will get interesting now.**

The wedding snuck-up on us. We decided to postpone our honeymoon for a year or more, until we'd stabilized. We decided to rent a nice, new apartment that was opening a month after the wedding, and a cousin + his family made my grandma an offer on her house that she couldn't refuse, so fiancee and I decided to rent a hotel room for a month while we waited for the apartment.  


July '19 was the longest month of my life. Newly wed and our savings nearly depleted, we spent the bulk of what was left on our apartment deposit and hotel rent. I had started to do some freelance work online (via Reddit and a couple of other sites) and was convinced that it would lead to something worthwhile. Meanwhile, the wife was becoming increasingly unhappy with my lack of contribution and her job.  She started drinking for the first time in her life, going to a bar with her co-workers after their (3rd) shift.  I asked her to reign it in; I practically begged her to come home to me, but I didn't feel like I deserved her anymore. I lost her.     


She returned to the hotel one morning with an obvious hickey on her neck and a half-assed explanation for it.  The next week was a torrent; I yelled and cried more than all of my previous weeks combined.   


**Yeah...**

The weeks that followed were full of paperwork and abject depression.  My bank account bottomed-out numerous times.  I slept in my car some nights, cheap hotels when I could afford to.  My aim was to save as much of my earnings as possible, but I never managed to accumulate more than a couple hundred dollars during this time.  Freelance work was abundant in November, especially.   


I spent the second half of the month and the first half of December enjoying the fruits of my labor by staying in half-decent hotels.  I rotated between in order to not feel like I'd moved into one of them and spent a night in my car occasionally just to stay humble.  I was working 12+ hours most days until mid-December. Work dried up quickly and didn't start to pick back up for almost a month. I spent the week of Christmas sleeping in my car and working in a corner of my local Starbucks so that I could stay in a decent hotel on Christmas Eve and show up to my family gatherings clean and shaved.   


Mom knew I was technically homeless but not that I had been sleeping in my car.   I tried to keep her from asking questions, but when she asked I told her the truth. She insisted that I come stay with her (\~100 miles away) for a couple of months.  I took her up on the offer, but only stayed for 10 days.  Her husband - a good guy, honestly - started to grumble that I wasn't doing anything to improve my situation and didn't understand how I could be making money on my laptop in their guest bedroom.  I offered to show him some of the work I was doing and even my bank account, but he insisted that I go apply for welfare programs and get a factory job.  I left the next morning before they woke up.  


Back in my hometown in the middle of January, it was too cold to sleep in my car most nights.  Thankfully, work picked up a bit and I spent the next few weeks rotating hotels and my car. Whereas I'd been depressed and lost for a few months, I was beginning to feel hopeless. Anxiety took over and I stopped feeling like a guy who was trying to find his way, recovering from a fall. I was becoming a failure.  I was trapped in a cycle that had no potential to go anywhere.    


**Things get kinda dark.**

Around this time, I learned that the ex was now pregnant with hickey guy's kid and they were living together.  Also, I must inform you that his name is Chad.  I got Chadded by a Chad.  A rat skank of a Chad, but a Chad nonetheless.  


I needed to get a stable income, benefits, meet people, network. Date. I tried dating apps for the first time in years. I'm a decent-looking guy, but I had lost my confidence and it showed in my posture and in my eyes.  I didn't want to feign happiness, so I didn't. I put myself out there as-is.  The results were, of course, depressing.  I deleted and remade accounts for weeks, never leaving one open for more than a day. I went on a few casual dates but refused to lower my standards of expect the same of someone else so... Nothing worthwhile came of that.  I had to make something of myself before I could be with someone again.  


One night, I was trying to sleep in my car and I had a wonderful idea. I decided to make a video suicide note. Mind you, I wasn't suicidal.  I felt like I would be in the near future though, and I wanted to so this now while I was still (arguably) lucid.   


I spent 40 minutes passionately apologizing to my family and friends, insisting that they were not allowed to take one iota of responsibility for my actions.  That they were the only reasons I lasted so long.  I professed to my ex that I had forgiven her, and this wasn't her doing, either. She was the brightest of lights and I didn't deserve to see her shine as long as I did.  I told her I would have cheated too, if I were her.    


I forgot to hit ""record"", didn't I.  Oh well. This may have been worthwhile anyway.  I decided to re-pursue and old project - streaming on YouTube. I enjoy newsreading-esque content and I had a few ideas with which to spin that into something different.  In this process, I got in touch with an old friend who'd moved to Wisconsin for work a few years ago.    


**This could maybe go somewhere?**

He'd recently separated with his longtime girlfriend and needed a roommate to help with bills and to keep him from being alone and depressed at home.  Plus, he wanted to build a YouTube channel of his own and pledged to build a studio in his house and buy all the equipment we'd need if I'd move in with him and pay a modest rent.  


I chewed on this for a few days and we conversed regularly. I had a lot of concerns. When he was younger, he was a reckless and destructive person. I don't mean to throw him under the bus - he was a good friend to me and here he is offering to open his home to me - but he had been a black-out drinker in the past, smoked heavily... Things I'm not going to subject myself to. He assure me that he didn't smoke anymore and that he didn't drink heavily.  


My car was not fit for such a drive, and he had an extra that I could use as needed, so I spent a couple of weeks selling my car and preparing for my trip. We committed to a 3-month trial, and the end of which I'd either commit to a few more months or he'd pay for my flight home.  I knew he wanted to help me, and I knew he needed my help. I bought a one-way ticket to Wisconsin and bummed a ride to SDF.    


**Remember:  regret is a useless emotion.**

I landed in Wisconsin at around 9pm Central last night.  He said he'd be there at 830, but he lives almost an hour away from the airport so I don't think much of it. He arrives 15 minutes later. I toss everything I own in his back seat (one suitcase, one backpack) and sit in the passenger seat. He looks shocked and smells strongly of booze. ""You didn't expect me to actually come, did you"".  He didn't. After all the planning, all the ideas, discussing which airport I should fly into and what time I should aim to be there... I screenshotted the receipt when I bought the ticket. Still, he didn't believe I was actually in his car. Because he was absolutely wasted, and had been every time I'd spoken to him for the last couple of weeks. He was beyond functional, but he was living on a parallel plane.    


He started to drive and when I implied that he needed to give me the wheel, he got agitated.  There was virtually no traffic and he was surprisingly alert, so I tried to relax. A few minutes later, I was a nervous wreck and I told him I knew he was drunk. He thanked me for calling him out, pulled over and traded seats.  He drove from the passenger seat - telling me I'm going 4 mph over or under, calling me out for looking at his GPS instead of just listening to it,  insisting that I use his high beams while driving through a small town - he wanted to get under my skin.  He chain-smoked,and sipped rum.  I told him that I needed to go to Walmart or somewhere similar to get some snacks and toiletries. He got very angry, but calmed a bit when I explained that I couldn't fly with that stuff. We made a detour.  


He followed me around Walmart, asking me why I was buying the things I was buying.  I wanted to leave, but I was stuck with him. I committed to this. I'm going to help this fucker sober-up. The rest of the drive home was nerve-wracking. Deer were in the road, and as such he started to think every mailbox might be a deer, and he kept screaming for me to stop the car.   


We arrived at his house at around 11.  As a homeless man, I am not going to judge someone for having a run-down house.  I *will* judge my friend for lying to me. The house smelled of cheap cigarettes.  There were multiple ashtrays in every room. There was a cat (I like cats, but I'm allergic sometimes and he knew this and he told me he had no pets) and he told me that she didn't like to use her litter box. The futon I was to sleep on was stained head to foot and the room smelled of cat piss.  


**Me: 0  Life:  (insert infinity symbol here)**

I hugged my friend, and told him I was sorry. I had to leave. He told me he was going to bed and that I should too. Sleep on it, and if I still want to go home he'll take me to the airport after work tomorrow. No.  


I installed Uber - $105 for a trip to the airport, but no cars available. I start to panic. He calls a girl he knows and asks her to give me a ride, but she's drunk. He tells me to take his ex's car and just park it and leave the keys in the glove box; he'll have that girl bring him to get it tomorrow.  I take him up on this. He insists I take $100 cash for my trouble... I feel very wrong for taking it, but my net worth is now \~$1,000 and I'm about to spend $300 on a plane ticket.  I hug him again and we apologize to each other.   


I stopped at a gas station to gather my bearings and plan my flight. First one home leaves at 550am.  I arrive at the small airport and most of the lights are off, no one is working but the doors are open and the wifi is on. I stumble upon a homeless girl who was trying to sleep in the baggage claim area.  She was very apprehensive of me until she realized I wasn't trying to get close to her.  I sat about 10 feet away and we had good conversation.  She was only 20, and she had an emotional support cat in her bag - a gorgeous Maine Coon.  I ask where the cat does it's business, and she assures me that the cat won't need to for at least 24 hours.  


She tells me she's autistic, and that she's been a ""vagabond"" for 3 years. She says she came to WI to visit her girlfriend and that she's headed back ""home"" to Seattle. She's hungry and can't sleep because she's afraid someone will rob her stuff, so I give her most of the snacks I bought at Walmart and pledge to keep watch over her stuff while she naps.    


I get out my laptop. I have 4 hours to kill - no TO FIGURE OUT WHY I'M FLYING BACK TO KY?!?! I DON'T HAVE A CAR THERE AND IT'S ALSO COLD AND I CAN'T FACE MY FAMILY AND THEY COULDN'T HELP EVEN IF I DID AND I WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO ANYWAY.  


**This is the part where I start thinking about you.**

I go to Reddit and I start typing this... Whatever it is. Friend is texting me apologies. My contacts are hurting my eyes. I need to sleep but I'm uncomfortable in every sense of the word.  


A small group of female travelers arrive at the airport at 415, and I trust them to watch over my sleeping friend until her alarm goes off at 500. I go through TSA as soon as they open at 430 and head to the little airport's sole terminal. I sleep for a few minutes then board the little plane. The guy sitting beside me is one of my new favorite people - a biologist of sorts who works with potatoes.  We talk about natural selection, gene editing, Psalms, his airbnbs and his beautiful family.  I admire him. I'm proud of him. I envy him. No. No. Not useful. No envy.  


A short layover, then I'm leaving ORD and bound for Louisville. I still don't know why. Why did I buy this ticket?  I fall asleep listening to Joe Rogan talk to an astronaut about things I wanted to do as a kid but never pursued.  Any hint of jealousy is quickly drowned by self-loathing is drowned by reason YOU HAVE SO FEW RESOURCES LEFT DO NOT WASTE THEM ON THINGS YOU CAN'T CHANGE.  CHANGE.   


I arrive at SDF and wait for my suitcase to come round on the carousel. I grab it and sit down. I've been awake for almost 27 hours.  I haven't had something akin to a meal in \~20.  I have $800 to my name. Of course, the smart thing to do is drop $5 on a caramel macchiato and finish my Reddit post.   


Almost 12 hours since I started, I'm going to wrap this up. And I'm going to ask you for some advice.  


**I'm mildly delirious.**

Tell me - what would you do if you were me? By that I mean - homeless, car-less, almost broke, family and friends are out of the equation for various reasons that I've not had time to elucidate.  


I can make some money online so long as I have a quiet place with good wifi, but it's not reliable. Some weeks I clear $800 easily. Some weeks I barely make anything. I would guess I'm averaging $300 per week, which is just barely enough to live the hotel+car lifestyle I described. I need to get an actual job with benefits and whatnot but I've been unemployed for a long time now and my resume wasn't great to begin with.  I applied at some places where ""anyone"" can get hired recently to no avail (fast food, even).  I have so many qualifiers and so many branching questions and I just... I've got to get my shit together and I have to start making some marked progress immediately.  


I want to go somewhere warm-ish and start over. I want to be productive and I want to start a family and I want to ACTUATE and I want want want...  


Maybe I sound insane; I'm not. I'm probably a bit off and I'm definitely rambling now. I'm going to wander around this airport for a while and try to relax.

775,"For a little background knowledge, I'm currently a freshman in high school. The girl I'm talking about, let's call her Sarah, has lived across from me for 13 years. We used to be friends up until she started middle school while I was still in 5th grade. Ever since then she's just...ignored me. I skipped 8th grade and now we are in the same grade and have Computer Science together, but no other classes and different lunches. Her parents are still friends with mine (just not as close as they used to be) and we see them every so often and chat. But Sarah still ignores me. 

So, I've started school and would say I have next to no friends. I have people I talk to in class, I definitely wouldnt say I'm quiet except in Computer Science. I attend church, go to dances and am very outspoken in my classes. But everyone, including Sarah, just flocks together with their middle school friends and everyone is groups together with people they already know. I just don't know what to do. 

Sarah and I have spoken, but only when we're paired up in class by the teacher to work on coding. She never refers to me by name. I've never done anything against her. I've never been rude to her, in fact we, or at least I, have some memories of her and I being quite close. 

I really want to be friends with her, but I'm just very reserved when I'm around her, which is weird because with everyone else in the world I'm quite chatty and friendly. 

Part of me wonders if its a popularity thing. I mean, I wouldn't classify her as very popular, but she has a very popular older sister who was a cheerleader all four years who now attends Vanderbilt and she talks about her in class every now and then. I'm a nobody at my school. I'm very, very school and college focused and I wonder if my academic seriousness gets in the way of me making friends. 

I would really, appreciate some help. I don't think she hates me or necessarily avoids me, but when we have spoken she seems nice enough, just not interested. I don't know but I'm dying socially and I know we have stuff in common, I just don't know how to communicate with her.",12Feb2020,1
776,"I'll start at the beginning I guess, a few months back my mom asked if I wanted to go on a missions trip. I'm a senior in highschool. I told her it's not really something I'm interested in for a lot of reasons. 

She kept pushing and I kept telling her no, eventually one of her friends donated money for me to go. I said that was generous but it didn't change my mind that I really didn't want to go. 

She eventually got another one of my friends moms to talk to me about it and push me to go, I felt really uncomfortable saying no so I agreed but then told my mom I still didn't want to. She made me go sign up for it anyway when the day came to do it and said I had to and I had committed to it. 

She kept making me go to meetings and stuff and I kept telling her I really didn't want to. 

I feel very uncomfortable going on the trip for a lot of reasons, one of them being I'm not a Christian. I know that doesn't necessarily mean I shouldn't go but I just feel out of place among everybody who also thinks I'm a Christian and asks me a lot of very personal questions. 

Another being I have pretty bad anxiety, I don't know anyone on the trip and I'll be alone the whole time. I just started anxiety meds but they won't start working for a few weeks and in the meantime might actually make it worse. 

Third being this is the last break I have before senior year is over, and I'd really prefer to spend that time with my friends who I don't have a lot of time left with. Even just thinking about them leaving makes me really emotional and I really would like to prioritize making memories with them while I can. 

Lastly I got really sick this week and I feel it could get worse when I fly to another part of the country, my immune system is really weak and I'm worried it could just get really bad. 

I'm very nonconfrontational and nervous about this type of thing and I don't know how to talk to my mom about this now. The missions trip is next week and I have no idea what to do or if the money is refundable.

I have barely any friends still around here and nothing to do but sit in my room and study or distract myself. There‘s nobody to go out or have fun with. All my friends are studying/working far away from here. It’s so ironic, because this place used to be the center of my life but now it’s really killing me on the inside.

780,"I recently accepted a job in a new city that begins in about 3.5 weeks. Upon giving my two weeks, my last job told me that they no longer needed me and would ""allow me to leave early"" if I wanted. I insisted that I would like to work my last 2 weeks to keep busy and train my replacement, but they said it wasn't necessary and took me off all my shifts.

I now have nearly a month to kill and am already bored out of my mind. I am slowly packing up my apartment and organizing in order to move, but I can only do so much while still living here. I guess I'm asking what people do to kill time that doesn't involve sitting at home, watching TV, playing video games, and scrolling through social media. I like being active, but it's winter so outdoorsy activities are hard to come by. I have looked into climbing gyms/rec sports leagues, but that only takes care of a few hours a day and they're kind of pricey.

I regularly fidget with a pen or other random thing and focus on that instead of the lesson. I have a problem with learning as well.

783,"Hello all,
Let me preface this by saying, humans are the most complex species ever. Here’s the thing: I know what to do but not how to do it

I don’t know where to start so this might sound jumbled. I’ve been in a relationship that was building under unfortunate circumstances for almost two years now (let’s just say he’s significantly older than me—I’m 22F he’s 40M), and we met at school.

He moved with my to start grad school. I’ve kept our relationship hidden from everyone as I’ve been doing. I opened up to my parents about it a few months ago but they totally disapproved. I ended up breaking up with him and was starting my life fresh in a new state, but he was already moved up here because that’s what was planned. I thought all was well and that I was finally being strong, but then I kept overthinking and somehow found my way back to him. We’ve been back together, on and off, for a few months now. 

I just want to know, why is it so hard for me to just break up and leave it? I wonder if it’s because I’m out on my own and I’m looking for that parental figure (weird I know, but I thought about it). Anyways, in my head it’s ruining my life because I’m living a double life in a way, which definitely causes some psychological troubles. I don’t openly talk about this relationship with anyways.

Also in parallel, I do have feelings but these are starting to fade in comparison to the psychological troubles. And that makes me very sad. He loves me very much and we’ve shared so many enjoyable moments together.

Part of the reason I had gotten back after the move was I wondered if I was just living a life my parents wanted for me. And that made me feel some type of way and I initiated contact again. Anyways, I’m afraid that if I break up I won’t be able to be strong and I’ll go back. Like, I don’t trust myself anymore. It’s so frustrating because I have a vision of what I want my life to be and I just can’t seem to get there. I do want to be with someone my family will be welcoming of, who is also fairly young who I can raise a family with while we’re both young.

This is a very condensed version but I’m just sitting thinking, stuck in my head and need an outlet. Greatly appreciative of any advice 

Tl;dr I’m at a crossroads. Feel like my life is stuck. Been with a guy for almost two year and living a double life while a graduate student",12Feb2020,1

The only thing I know about them is their name and age. They keep calling me dear. I know this can be normal but I barely know them. They always say that they want to learn more about me and be my friend, knowing the age gap. They also asked me to use my number to shut down an account that they have, I refused, stating the fact that we met two days ago, but they sent the code anyway. They said I was good looking too.

790,"So I'm a pretty lonely guy but I've learned to deal with it. I currently don't have a girlfriend but I have a really awesome friend group. I'm very shy and not that talkative tbh. 

But what I noticed the last few weeks that I fall in love with so many people or classmates even though I'm fine with being single.

Just a few examples:

I was visiting a relative in a hospital. And apparently some classmate did so too and saw me. So the next day she came up to me and asked if I was at the hospital yesterday. I obviously said yes and we got into a nice conversation in which we told each other who we were visiting and why and so on. Was a really nice conversation and we hadn't talked that much up to that point. But then when I went to drive home I really thought a lot about this incident. I was like ""shes so nice to me it's, the conversation was amazing"" and ""maybe shes the one"" or ""maybe there's a possibility that I can ask her out"".
Remember. We just talked for 5minutes and my mind instantly jumped to thoughts of dating. Not to mention the crush I have on her since then even though we don't talk that much.

Example two:

Our class does a field trip next week and because we are old enough we all drive ourselfes by car. There is this one girl in my class that I also hadn't talked to that much who came up to me and asked if I was down for a Road trip to the destination of the trip. We got into a conversation and she told me that she didn't wanna drive alone and of course I said yes and that I'll come pick her up next week. And again I got the same thoughts as in the previous example and a mild crush.

I am aware that that's a problem. I always fall in love with people who just treat me like a normal human being resulting in my heart getting broken because OBVIOUSLY they probably don't like me back. In the end they just talked to me for a few minutes.

Does anyone of you have Ideas what the source of this problem could be and what I can do about it. Tips will be gladly appreciated. :)",12Feb2020,1

795,"Hi everyone this is a long post and though I would love it if you could read it here’s a TL;DR: I ended a friendship with someone who hurt me and I’m angry at him and myself for letting myself enter this situation and it may affect our friend group.

Basically I (21M) asked for help on how to move on from breaking off a friendship. Basically I was friends with this guy (21) and while we started off the friendship well a lot of stuff happened. Basically he was unreliable, always bailed on appointments, he didn’t help me when I needed his help with some stuff that was going on in my life, and made someone leave our friend group because said person got her heart broken by him (led her on and then slept with another girl). My part in the friendship (and he never contested this) was exactly the opposite: I was there for him and helped him whenever he needed help, even when that meant putting off doing stuff I wanted or needed to do. That’s what friends are supposed to do right? 

In December he started being a jerk to me and I called him out on it and we had a fight. Everyone here told me to end the friendship and not let him back, that he would try to and if I did let him in again he would only hurt me. Well he came to me and apologized and stupid me decided to give him a chance. Shortly after that I had a health scare and I was feeling pretty bad. I let him know: I almost had to make him being supportive. He was dismissive to the seriousness of the problem at hand and how it made feel. Fortunately my health scare turned out not be nothing serious and things ended up working out for the best. But I called him out on his antics, we got into a bad fight and basically I ended the friendship. It’s been about two months since we last talked and I have zero intentions on letting him back into my life.

Here’s my problem: I’m still not over the anger that I feel. I feel angry that he didn’t acknowledge that his actions were hurtful and that he didn’t apologize. That he just replies that I’m being too sensitive all the time and that he didn’t really do anything wrong. That he had the nerve to get mad at me for calling him out on it. Basically I’m angry because he can’t see the anger that he caused. He hurt me bad because I considered him my best friend and did everything for him and he never did it for me. I sometimes imagine him coming to me to apologize and me saying no just to hurt him back. Because I just don’t see it as fair. He’s a jerk and hurts those around him and his actions have no consequences. He gets to sit in front of others and they see him as this cool guy when he isn’t. This is what I feel. I admit it isn’t pretty or the best to feel but it is what it is. Logically I know that this is wrong. I know that I’m wasting my time, that even though I’m hurt and thinking about this he has moved on and doesn’t care about me.

Part of my problem I guess is that I’m also mad at myself: why did I let it come to this? I saw the red flags. Why did I rationalize them? Why did I think that if he could be a jerk to others he couldn’t be a jerk to me?

And now the worst part is that this may affect others. I have a friend group and we are both on it. It’s the end of exam season and college is starting again. People don’t know I have ended the friendship because the group hasn’t really been meeting up because we are all at home cramming. Only another friend knows and I told him not to tell others or to pick sides. This isn’t their fight and I’m not letting this break off the group. However one of my friends told me he and some others have all been hanging at my former friends house. This doesn’t offend me because they’re all friends and during exam season I go back to my home town to stay home so I can focus and commute to college to take the exams. I’m worried that my former friend may invite the whole group to his house and actively exclude me. And I’m not going to where I’m not invited. I’m sure that my other friends would notice and they would ask me about it. Should I tell them what happened? I hate the idea of dragging others to this mess and I don’t want to make things awkward. If they know what happened they would object to hanging out at his house and would rather we all meet somewhere else (which is really what I would prefer).

I guess it all comes down to this:
1 - how do I get over my own feelings about this situation?
2 - how do I handle this situation with my friend group?",12Feb2020,1
797,So today my parents woke my sister and I up and told us we arent going to school cuase we have something to tell us that we are going to need time to process. So basically what they told us about our families financial situation. My dad is a doctor at a  hospital in Honolulu hawaii where we live and my mom is a pharmacist here in Hawaii. So I thought we were well off and everything but we are more then well off. Today our parents told us that we are literal millionaires. Due to the investments my parents have in companies and things like that. My parents said they didnt want to tell us till we were teens because they didnt want us to be complete spoiled brats. For some reason I feel disgusted with myself I always thought of people with that much money as awful people just to figure out my parents are those people. I dont know what to do.

802,"I'm already friends with this guy, I mean I guess not best friends or anything but a bit. One of our mutual friends told me I should tell him how I feel especially if he likes me back. I however disagree as I want to move away plus I really don't see him and me being an item. He's still a little bit immature and hasn't formed his personality fully imo. While I do like some sides of him, he snaps out of his good side sometimes and thinks it's cool to say shit like 'ugh women... They should just get married and stay at home' or 'ugh why do women want to always annoy us by joining our guy stuff' when talking about sports.

I personally found that to be a little edgy. I think he thinks it makes him seem cool or something, but it just sounds pretty weird to me. He also hangs out with a ton of certain groups of girls and it makes me insecure, as I look nothing like them, act nothing like them and don't have much in common with them. I'm not sure if he likes me. I think he talks to me because he's somewhat nice/polite and maybe because he might be using me because I get high grades(that sounds weird but where I come from if you get good scores at uni, people will be looking to use you left right and center).

Should I bother approaching this guy? I've never been in a relationship before and I want to try but I don't want it to be a negative experience. I think if he changed some of his edgy behavior I could see him more as a long term partner. I am not interested in a fling and don't want to just ignore any red flags. At the same time my friends are pressuring me to do it. And I kinda just want to move on and move away and start a new life in a different country(I'm moving away from a more conservative country. Not that relevant but yeah).

Also perhaps I've misunderstood this guy? I don't want to judge him but sometimes he rebels and thinks it makes him seem manly or something. And the sexist remarks are a bit not so funny sometimes when he says them in a very serious tone. I can't tell if he says it to get a rise out of me in a funny way or if he is actually serious. I don't really get angry at it as I don't know how to react to that lol.",12Feb2020,1

This semester I'm writing a thesis, and I've already picked a field: 3d rendering engines. Now I need to write a one pager to find a mentor for the thesis, but I'm just lost and don't know where to start.

I have been with my gf for almost 6 months now and about 2 months of that was off and on. Shes somewhat attractive but I got with her because of her personality. I have struggled deciding on how to end it but the reason I want to is because shes clean and all but there are some minor things that really bother me about her.  she showers but still doesn't think she has to use deodorant and often times smells a little bad which wouldn't be awful but her parents smoke so mixed with the horrid stench of clothes that have been in a household of ciggs makes it worse. She doesn't care to get the crust out of her eyes and often times has shit in her nose and it really gets to me. Like those are all things that I take care of before i go out anywhere, even if i don't go out i still do that. and lastly and kinda the worse, she doesn't take good care of her hygiene in a certain area. I know for a fact now that she either 1. cant smell it herself, or 2. doesn't care that she smells like fish. Sometimes its worse than others, but here's the real issue. I want to drop her, but she will think its because i want to be with someone else. She caught me ""cheating on her"" and now thinks anytime i want to break up with her that its because i am being unfaithful. I don't classify talking to other girls as cheating but i guess she does. I just don't know how to go about it. I have tried getting rid of her in the recent past, but she wont fuck off.

I am majoring in Piano in university.  This means that every week I have a piano lesson.

The problem comes with the guys past... experience with women. His longest relationship lasted 3 months, by his words he ""didn´t have anything to do with"" another girl after a week and so on.

823,"Hi guys,

Life smacked me in the face over the last weekend and it's caused some realizations that I am spreading myself thin and not stopping to consider self care. Between car troubles, girl troubles, etc, I've found that I can't cope with my problems and push through everything at the same time.

I am a full time student taking 17 credits in sophomore year of my ECE degree. I am at school M-F and each day I am on campus for at least 6 straight hours.

Then, I have a part time gig at a store where they schedule me for what feels like every moment I am not in class. Monday nights and Thursday nights I get done at 3:00PM, so they schedule me to close each and every M/Th. They also have me work 8 hour shifts every weekend day.

I am considering just not showing up to work anymore but for one specific reason: I have only been there for a month. I am still a trainee. 

People have suggested asking for a more lenient schedule, but I don't want to make demands when I haven't actually built a reputation yet. Additionally, they explained that 24hrs a week is a threshold for part timers. 

I feel like I am never at home and its killing me to be doing work from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. Im losing willpower to do homework in the gaps and I just feel awful all the time.

Im not asking whether or not I should continue working, I think I have established that its not what I want to do, but I really might just lay low and go AWOL. Its not like I need their reference, I can pop them off my linkedin, like it never even happened. I left another job to take this one thinking it'd be easier but I just think I've made things worse for myself. This job requires me to drive all over the place (up to 1hr away when I am out of training) and its just... eh.

Despite going to the principal and administration about this, nothing happened to this teacher, and I know they talked to him about it. They didn’t even have him apologize to me. I felt like I should stay quiet about it because my school tries to keep their ‘clean’ reputation. I was talking to another teacher of mine today, and he said I technically could sue or go to a news station about this. So now I don’t know what I should do?",12Feb2020,1
825,"I was suffering from depression since i can remember being like this. I was first ashamed to go to a psychologist. But I still went, because I want my life back. After six months therapy time, it hasn't changed that much. My mental state went worse. Even with antidepressants. I couldn't get up from my bed and couldn't go my daily routine. After that I didn't visit therapy anymore and didn't take the pills. My psychologists told me to go to a psychatry clinic. I wasn't sure, if I should go there. 

Any advice please?",12Feb2020,1

She has to be put down in the next week and I cannot believe that its happening. Every moment Im not with or near her I feel guilty because Im not close to her and doing something else. 

What do I do to not feel that guilt? What if I will continue feeling guilty about it for a long time of my life? Its too painful to think that she'll be gone soon but I dont want to constantly be next to her without doing anything else and that makes me feel guilty.

What do I do to not feel guilty?",12Feb2020,1
828,"Ok so this needs a bit of a backstory and I will include a TLDR at the bottom. I(24M) have been playing golf since I was 4. I love this game and don’t ever want to stop playing it. I really got a passion for the sport in middle school when I picked up the clubs for the first time in years and barely made the team. In playing for school team I started to get better and better and became the best on the team. I would always stay at the top all the way through high school golf as well. My scores would hover around the upper to mid 70s and only shot in the low 80s once throughout my senior year. 

After high school though I got a little burnt out on practicing everyday and didn’t have that much motivation to play in college, especially since I was going to A&amp;M for engineering and wouldn’t have been able to get scholarships to play golf there on the team. 

From then on out I continued to play a few rounds every now and then throughout all of college and a few years after as well. I never really lost my touch and would still shoot in the mid to upper 80s with only playing once every few months and no practice.

Forward to now and I have found a group of friends from work that love the game too and we have been playing every weekend for a few months now. With playing more often I have found my scores lowering and staying at around the mid to upper 70s with my best shooting a 1 over 73. 

With this consistent playing I can’t help but want to get even better and even play in tournaments, become an amateur, or even going pro way down the line. I really want to start playing even more and getting a few practice sessions in through the week. 

So the biggest question I have is what next steps do I need to take to get to the next level? I have tried to look into leagues around the local courses and looking up how to get an official handicap going but still am not sure where to start. If anyone has any ideas I would love to hear them or hear about any experiences you know of that might help guide me to taking that next step. 

TLDR: I have been playing golf a long time and was always fairly good but now that I am playing much more often I am shooting in the mid 70s every time and want to take the next step up in my golf game.",12Feb2020,1
829,"Title says it. I’m on a co-op term working under a project engineer (I’m studying biomedical engineering) and I feel like I suck at this job. I just don’t feel like I belong.

I’m trying so hard to do well but I feel like I don’t even know what I don’t know. I don’t feel like I like what I’m doing very much, and I can’t tell if it’s because I’m bad at it or if that’s just because this career isn’t for me.

She's been there for me through a lot of hardship and is incredibly emotionally supportive but also knows how to give both of us space to avoid being overwhelmed, as we have a very reciprocal friendship. She's adorable, nerdy, funny, pretty and I've caught feelings for her pretty hard. I was thinking about telling her how I feel some time in the near future, as I tentatively thought she may have felt the same. 
I found out, though that she went on a date like a week and a half ago and didn't tell me (possibly to spare my feelings if she suspects I'm into her, though I can't be sure.) I initially felt stabbed through the heart as it goes and tried my best to be supportive and happy for her. 

I haven't brought it up and on one hand, I feel like I need space to try to get over these feelings, but I'm afraid she may think she's done something wrong, or realize that I have feelings and our friendship would suffer (I've been through a similar situation before and it was hell for both parties).

Next Saturday, we are double-dating at a karaoke bar in the city and the three of them are planning on drinking. My boyfriend, knowing I don’t drink, thankfully told me ahead of time and hoped I wouldn’t feel pressured. I told him not to worry about it, especially since they’re not going to be drinking too much. 

The problem is that I HATE being around people when they drink, even if it’s not to excess. I hate everything about alcohol—the culture, the effects it has on people, etc. And I admit I do get judgemental about people who drink (though never out loud). But I really want to go out and have a good time with them. Karaoke sounds super fun!

I’m worried they’ll sense my discomfort and things will get awkward. I don’t want to stop anyone from drinking just because of my hang-ups; it’s not my place to do so.

She's lost alot of weight and makes sure to bring it up in conversation often (she was NOT fat before). But she also ocassionaly mentions how she still needs to lose more weight and shes not happy with her body yet. She said that she was going to get back down to what she was in highschool (which was quite thin). My family is relatively curvy even at my most fit (I did wrestling and soccer in highschool) I was still quite curvy and my mom is built the same but her shes losing alot of those curves. I was talking to my sister the other day and she said my mom and aunt had been competing in college for who could lose the most weight and they would go days without eating which was ...concerning to say the least. Anytime we make food she passes but we just chalk it up to her 'diet'.  And now today when I was cleaning the vacuum I realized most of it was her hair. But the hardest part for me is my mom is very defensive and if I bring it up to her I feel very confident that she'd kick me out. I only have 2 months until I move out so I can try to bring it up once I move out but if it is a problem then I dont want it to get too out of hand.

835,"TW: Suicide and self-harm.

So my sister is 19 y/o going to be 20 in October. She’s diagnosed with depression and anxiety. With that being said she’s supposed to take her meds to get better. So far she’s done nothing but wreck herself and drag everyone along with her. She’s skipped class for a month, hasn’t eaten and skipped meds for a month too. She doesn’t even try to better herself even after therapy and thousands of dollars spent on a good rehab center. She’s been with 3 different boyfriends under the last 3 months and blames her need of someone to fill her loneliness despite the fact that she has a dog. I get why they break up with her though. She’s selfish, she’s made them do all her chores, needs (buy food, walk her dog, clean her room), etc. whilst all she does is take FaceTuned photos for her sugar daddies to buy her clothes she wants. Then she’ll complain and threaten self-harm if we get mad at her for making her boyfriends do everything because us getting mad at her is one of her “triggers”. Us being my family, who’s been demonized by her and told her friends we are abusive despite us trying to make her better. Two weeks ago she left the house after texting me a picture of her wrists slit deep because my step-dad kicked her out for calling him manipulative simply for being mad since she didn’t clean the room or take her very active dog out for a walk in 3 days. Now she lives with her friend and makes her boyfriend and all her boyfriend’s friends take care of the dog. You can tell how stress he’s been, he’s had to skip work and class because she’s threatened to kill herself for being alone. I just have lost all ways in trying to get her to realize she’s being real selfish and harming everyone around her too. Anytime I’ve brought it up she’d get mad and threaten suicide on me.

What I’m most worried about is her dog, it’s clear she can’t take of the dog yet my parents refuse to take care of it and I’m already juggling work and school. I really don’t want to give the dog away, she’s already so attached to my family and would probably depressed moving into a new environment, but I can barely take care of the dog. I don’t know what should I do?

It’s obviously not Rachel’s fault that she looks the way she does and that men find her attractive. We’ve had a small discussion about it in the past when a mutual friend expressed to Rachel that it’s hard to go out with her because she gets all of the male attention, which Rachel was upset about because, again, it’s not her fault that she looks the way she does and doesn’t mean for that to happen. 

It’s not as big of a deal for me because I’m in a relationship so not looking for a potential male companion, but I have had “your friend is hot” said to me so many times that I want to print out a card to give to these guys that has a queue number on it or something. 

When we go out together I just end up getting bored and annoyed while she’s being entertained by all these men. It’s to the point where I don’t want to go out with her because I don’t have any fun. 

The first 100 times I was approached by men telling me she was hot I was like “haha I know right” but I’m so sick of hearing that. And it’s getting to the point where it’s hurting my own self esteem hearing over and over again that essentially I’m less attractive.

847,"I have a coworker who thinks it's funny to annoy other people. To set the scene, I work at a dealership on the sales floor. He sits three desks down from me. 

He is one of these people that likes to start shit and intentionally say stuff to annoy other people or piss them off. Now, he's not a bad person. He's just rough around the edges. But this habit is extremely obnoxious and gets super irritating. 

Sometimes he gets stuck on saying one thing - like people's names. No he doesn't have a disability. For example, he says my coworker's name ""Peter"" every time he goes by his desk or it's quiet or whatever. He goes ""Peter Peter"" about 50 times a day. 

For the last few weeks, he says my name EVERY DAY in this annoying yell-y voice. So about 40 times an hour, while I'm minding my own business, I hear him yell my name and sometimes it's across the dealership. And then another guy near my desk started doing it and it's annoying as hell. But I know the moment I blow up, they'll start making fun of me and laughing at me. They do it to everyone. 

I'm starting to get extremely irritated by it but I worry about being that ""stick in the mud"" type girl who gets mad about teasing - which ""teasing and making fun of"" is a big thing in the culture on the sales floor. Sometimes I just want to scream at him to shut the fuck up - especially today because I'm stressed about having to get my wisdom teeth extracted soon and some other things as well.

But I really didnt mean anything by it.

Next thing you know he starts calling me a weirder and a pervert and I got kind of confused and mad and started calling him the same thing.

And he hung the phone in my face. I texted him asking what was going on after. I was so angry he did that.

And he said I was being a weird and pervert because according to him I told him to swing his private part in front of his little siblings.

But I was so angry and confused I told him goodbye. Then he texted me saying sorry it's just he didn't agree with what I said but before I responded to that he texted again saying he not sorry and has no reason to apologize.

So I texted ""bye"" again and we have not talked since.

But now im confused but im missing him. There must be some misunderstanding as I didnt tell him to do that perverted thing. But he reacted so quick and hung up on me it made me so mad and I didn't want to talk to him anymore. 

But now that I've calmed down I realized it was just a misunderstanding. But I hate how he reacts so quick to anger but I'm missing him a lot now too. What do I do?

At 16, I developed agoraphobia. I couldn’t leave my house for 2 years except maybe once or twice a year and not without huge consequences to my mental health. Panic would set in and even going on my porch was too overwhelming for longer than a few minutes. 
At 18, through help with therapists I was able to go to college for (not even) a year. I dropped out of each semester only a few months in. If that. 
It’s hard to explain anxiety on the internet when everyone claims to have it, or considers it just as feeling uneasy. 
My anxiety has limited my entire life. I’ve had over 7 therapists and have been on all kinds of medicine. 
It took years of hard work to even be able to go to the store without being filled with terror. There were moments I would rather die than leave my house. Literally die and that’s so hard for people to understand because it’s easy for them just to say, “tough up.” And go do it anyway. In my disordered head it isn’t a possibility. Not for everything. 
I’m 24 now, and it’s taken years to feel halfway okay. But I want to have a purpose in life now. I spent so much time surviving that I didn’t live, and now I want to live, but have no idea what I want to do with my life, or what I could do with my anxiety. 
Still, after all the work I put in, when I go out to do something I fail. Anxiety takes over and I can’t follow through.

I pride myself on making an effort to be social but the combination of sports I play, life experiences, age, heritage, difficulty with classes is making me feel homesick, lonely and frustrated that I’m not fitting in as well as I would like.

Husband deployed a few years ago and herniated his back doing a med lift on a helicopter. The guys loading the litter/stretcher must have been a little nervous and dropped it before it was secure, meaning my husband's choice was to drop an already injured soldier on his head or muscle through and yeet him into the helicopter. God bless his soul and back he chose the latter. He's been struggling since he got home and has gotten progressively worse to where we are now where walking is difficult and he's in constant pain and we are looking at a open spinal discectamy at the beginning of March. Insurance/the army is covering everything medical and we are insanely thankful for that but.... He's gonna be on bed rest for roughly 30 days. 

So I started looking for adjustable beds and recliners. Turns out none of that is covered as medical equipment. Cool I thought, they can't be that expensive.... I was wrong. I'm even considering doing like rent-a-center and just know I'm going to be returning it in a month. I have seen some reviews that people get push back returning the lift chairs they have available. Seems like they find a lot of reasons not to accept them.

My friends have been wanting to start boxing as well so we decided a few times every week we would go to a park near our school after school to train and do boxing drills to sharpen our skills.

Some kids who go to our school, I have no clue what grade they are, probably younger or the same age, were at the same park yesterday for our first session, and started by walking up and asking if we wanted to box them. We declined, because we were just training and didn’t want trouble with people we didn’t know.

They walked away and we thought that was the end of it. They began to say “Hey Black” at my black friend trying to get his attention which was like the stupidest insult i’ve ever heard. Today at school I walked past one of the very short kids and i didn’t recognize him but he clearly knew who I was and he was telling me to stay out of his park or something... which sounds so corny. I don’t want to fight any of these guys because I don’t want to get involved in drama or if the police get involved and i get charged with something. I also don’t want to have people wanting to jump me or something. Many boxing trainers have also told me to just never start fights with people on the street.

I just want to be able to train with my friends because there isn’t many other places we can do it, me and my friends don’t even box each other, we use punch mitts and do drills, so I am not sure why these people are mad we didn’t want to box them.

We’re both 21 and have been the best of friends since middle school. We had been on and off twice in a romantic relationship in our younger teens, but absolutely nothing serious. We just didn’t feel a connection. But we’ve always been confused about what we are to each other. Knowing we’re more than friends, but also not wanting to ruin our friendship and not being anymore than best friends. He does get on my nerves every once and a while and we don’t want to hurt each other again. The last breakup we went through was bad, it was about him not being in love with me any, and it more bad for me since it was the first time I was broken up with and it being over text. Somehow I got over my boiling anger about it, although it’s always a thought of getting hurt, and he’s got my feelings confused once again on what we are. There’s always these subtle things like him putting his head on my shoulder and saying “love you,” which has happened twice without me knowing what he means. It seems kinda genuine He’s even wrapped his arms around  me and pulled me into a very meaningful hug from behind. Then there are times when it seems like he thinks of us more as friends. So, every Valentines Day, we’ve always gotten each other gifts, even as friends. For this Valentines Day, I got him a couple of things, but I also wrote a very heartfelt note in a card, but I don’t know how I truly feel and how he feels, and I’m so nervous for him to read it as I meant it. I think we’re both really confused about where we are, but I’m nervous to talk about it and get rejected or get hurt again, especially since we still have to stay in close proximity to each other for the next few months. I really feel like he’s just one of the only people with which I’ve really had history, and I would have to start completely over. And I get a bit jealous with other girls thinking he likes them, but if I could just know he doesn’t like me and likes another girl, I could get closure and just move on. I just don’t know if I should give him the note in the card and see where it goes or if I should just let things stay where they are in confusion and weirdness.",12Feb2020,1
865,"My friend(18F) is in a situation where she needs money. I(19M) offered her some money and she refused to take it unless she could pay me back some how. She made it to a point where she says she will show me her body for x amount, let me feel it for 2x and let me have sex with her for 3x. I am totally fine with doing it, I won’t really be affected by the amount of money and I know it won’t affect our relationship other than both of us benefitting. Does anyone see any downsides to this?",12Feb2020,1
866,"

i’m gonna first clarify that i know him through the internet. it’ll probably change your outlook on this situation which is understandable. i’m 18 btw. i know it may seem childish to some but i have no control over my feelings.

i’ve known him for about a year now and we clicked almost immediately. he really makes me happy because he’s one of my best friends but my problem is thinking about the future. it’s inevitable for things to change once he gets a gf. and if i don’t have a s/o before him, i don’t know if i could mentally handle being friends with him anymore. even when he mentions wanting a gf, wanting to be with certain girls, and commenting on girls’ bodies it hurts, but when it’s a reality of him being with someone, what will i do? it just all makes me confused about now. i’ll sit down and think about this once in a while but never sure what to do. i haven’t confessed but i’m 98% sure he doesn’t like me like that. based on the things he’s said to our friends, if he did like me that way he’d probably confess by now. then again, he has social anxiety but i know that for some people it doesn’t apply through the internet. he’s also mentioned that he’s very clueless as to people liking him but goddamn i don’t think i’m THAT subtle. we message daily, call constantly, and send send eachother gifts/letters ocassionally. once he even told me that the way we talk to eachother is the type of conversations he’s been looking to have with someone forever. he loves me, but nothing more than platonically apparently— leaving me in a tight space for what i can do. 

so basically... haha... what DO i do? we’re really close so i don’t think i can cut him off just like that. but sometimes i think it might be a good option. should i distance myself so we’re not as close? leave him on read ocassionally, don’t spend time talking to him? i’m at a loss. i need to get over him",12Feb2020,1
868,"Long story short, I've loved this band ever since I was a child and I was a huge fan of them, but from 2017 until now I've been listening to them obsessively, to the point where I didn't listen to anything else. Nowadays I feel indifferent towards the band, probably because I've overplayed it like an idiot. I don't know if such severe burnout can ever be healed. 

Is there I can do to reverse the hardcore burnout I've inflicted on myself? I know that I need to take a long break but I don't know if this is enough. Advice? I know there are lots of bands and genres out there for me to listen to, but for some reason this band has always been special to me, maybe because it's been a constant presence in my life ever since I was a kid. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for ruining their music.",12Feb2020,1

870,"So, this is about Valentines Day coming up, and I have my best friend that I have been sharing apartment with for a couple of years for college. We’re both 21 and have been the best of friends since middle school. We had been on and off twice in a romantic relationship in our younger teens, but absolutely nothing serious. We just didn’t feel a connection. But we’ve always been confused about what we are to each other. Knowing we’re more than friends, but also not wanting to ruin our friendship and not being anymore than best friends. He does get on my nerves every once and a while and we don’t want to hurt each other again. The last breakup we went through was bad, it was about him not being in love with me any, and it more bad for me since it was the first time I was broken up with and it being over text. Somehow I got over my boiling anger about it, although it’s always a thought of getting hurt, and he’s got my feelings confused once again on what we are. There’s always these subtle things like him putting his head on my shoulder and saying “love you,” which has happened twice without me knowing what he means. It seems kinda genuine He’s even wrapped his arms around  me and pulled me into a very meaningful hug from behind. Then there are times when it seems like he thinks of us more as friends. So, every Valentines Day, we’ve always gotten each other gifts, even as friends. For this Valentines Day, I got him a couple of things, but I also wrote a very heartfelt note in a card, but I don’t know how I truly feel and how he feels, and I’m so nervous for him to read it as I meant it.

878,"I'm a very depressed 19 year old male from the United States. I'm afraid to tell anyone about my feelings, and I don't wanna go to therapy because I'll be laughed at or called a Racist just for feeling this way. I feel like I am never gonna get any help.

So I started watching porn when I was really young[11 years old]. I wish I didn’t. I got introduced to “Black on white” porn and I have watched it regularly ever since. Even to this day I feel the urge to watch it, although I've quit porn.

I mostly watched porn everyday, and Interracial gangbangs were my go-to. Interracial porn and this whole “New World Order” of white girls with black guys always hurt me....but I guess I was busy with school and friends etc. so I didn’t think about it a lot.

So about 7 months ago I watched a porn video about how Europe &amp; America is invaded by black and Muslim people and stuff, and the video was a lot of homemade white girls with black or Arabic guys. 

I watched it and I snapped. I felt sick, like I wanted to throw up. I went to go eat dinner and I could barely eat. I started shaking it upset me so much. I thought Of suicide.

I went online to ask questions about it and people kept saying “yeah it’s true white girls love black guys”. And I just fell lower and lower. 

Then, I was gonna go to Europe with my family, to go visit France. I said to myself “when I get there I’m gonna see if there is many interracial couples as here in America, maybe this is all in my head”. 

But then I went to France and there was plenty of white girls with black men. It was even more common than here in America, where I see about three or four of these couples per day, well in France I saw maybe 10 or more per day. I then made a plan to kill my self. 

So yeah, I’ve been suffering from this for years but it’s gotten unbearable in the last few months. It upsets me so much....and interracial dating is only becoming more popular. White girls with black guys is common....and so I feel like the only way out...the only way to make it stop is that to kill myself.

And now people say that Jews are doing it, making the porn and pushing the agenda. This just adds to it. I’ve self harmed. I’ve bought pills so I could overdose. I’m a totally fucked up person. I come on here to vent because I bottle all this shit up. 

And this “topic” is only one of the things that has RUINED MY LIFE. There is not a day that has gone by in the last few months that I haven’t thought about black etc. guys with white Girls. A day hasn’t gone by when I haven’t thought of suicide.

I am asking for help. I can't take it anymore. Maybe I am just a horrible Racist, or something else is wrong with me. But I don't wanna live like this anymore. I don't wanna be having a good day, and then I see an interracial couple and I wanna die, I go home and self harm. I guess I am a disgusting racist and maybe I deserve this, I wish I wasn't racist though, and I don't know why other white guys aren't affected by this, but I assume this is all on me. 

Please help me. What is wrong with me? Is it possible to fix myself and not have these thoughts? I'm also a white dude and I am a virgin who has a hard time with girls as a whole.",12Feb2020,1
879,"So I have been at my current job for a year and a half. It is an office job where I do stuff related to billing of clients. I love the people. The work is easy. Overall, I really like this job. 

When I first came on board, everything was a mess and a lot of my time was spent organizing and fixing the mess I inherited. Now everything is streamlined and runs smooth. 

The problem is, after I got everything into a routine, I find I do not have enough work to fill my day. I have between 2-4 hours of work a day usually, with One week a month being very busy. I have asked my boss several times for more tasks and we have talked it through a few times, but she seems reluctant to shift any other work from her to me. I get my work done now and spend a lot of time on Reddit the rest of the time because I have my own private office. 

In the near future, I will be moving out of my office and most likely moving into a shared space with my boss. Now I am full of anxiety that I will get into trouble when she sees how much free time I have. On one hand I feel I have done my duty to let her know I can take on more work, but on the other hand I feel very guilty for not making a bigger deal about needing more to do.

880,"Hi Reddit.

I (18F) have an older brother (20M) who has a very important exam in a week. The problem is that he's not working for them. At all. This isn't unheard of for him at all but like this is getting very worrying now and nothing that my parents, my other siblings (22F, 24M) or I can do to make any difference.

He did his GCSE's 4 years ago and got relatively good grades but he just procrastinated and we think he just got lucky. He took his A-Levels 2 years ago and basically failed them. He has spent the last 2 years as part of a small marketing firm but now wants to follow his passion for music. 

He is extremely talented at music and I really think he would be amazing at a music college but he doesn't work! At all! I love him to bits but I'm really drained of having to deal with him being sad because he failed an exam that he did not work for.

I have suspicions that he might be slightly depressed as we are very close and he confides in me a lot but it's only getting worse with him constantly failing shit. He is pretty low atm due to skin problems and all of his friends are living their best lives at uni. I hopefully will be going to uni in September which will only make it worse as he will be the only one living at home and he's a pretty proud person so he will hate it that his younger sister has gone to uni before him.

I am at a loss. I just want him to be happy but I'm so fed up of him complaining about failing and then not doing anything about it. He just sits in his room on his phone half the time and won't listen to us when we try to give him revision tips. I'm terrified that he'll never leave the town we all grew up in - something that all of us siblings have all said we'd hate.

To me, I see getting a dog in her circumstances as selfish, especially since she's never been to a therapist to treat her depression. She currently never leaves her apartment unless she's going to school, but says that a dog will change that. Even then, knowing she doesn't clean her litterbox as often as she should, and seeing how untidy her apartment is in general, I don't think her living conditions are suitable for a dog.

I've tried to talk her out of it, but she's dead set on getting a dog. I'm scared she won't be able to take care of it properly, and I'm worried that she believes taking care of a dog is easy.

885,"Hi all, I'm a fresh graduate who just embarked on their first job. And I love the work, love the environment, and the people seem really chill. But here's the thing -- it's on the night shift.

I was aware of this during the entire application process. I was desperate for a ""first job"", because I've been doing nothing but small side projects for a month and I crave that everyday routine. When asked if I was amenable to work on a night shift, all I said was ""Sure, yeah."" I've now realized my mistake.

Turns out I'm horrible at it. I'm tired at nights and I can't get a proper sleep at mornings. I get headaches at the middle of shifts -- the kind of headache I get whenever I pull all-nighters. I feel a gash to my chest when I Ieave late at night and see my entire family at home, their day done. The last one really hits me.

I've opened it up to my family and they advised me to talk to my supervisor about it. So I did. I was aware that there is a day shift for people in my position, so I was hoping to get transferred there. But it turns out the day shift had limited slots, and even worse, after my training, they're transferring me to an even later shift. They asked me if I was okay about that, I only gave them an ""I'm not sure"".

I'm aware that this is my fault. I thought I could handle it, but I overestimated myself. My mother is telling me to not force myself when I genuinely can't handle it, while my dad is telling me to power through it since I enjoy the work.

They've also told me that maybe I'm just adjusting and I'll get used to it, but honestly after hearing that they'll be transferring me to a later shift, I *know* I'll hate it. I don't want to spend a lot of time ""feeling it out"", since I'm still on the training phase. I don't want to quit when they've already invested a lot of time on training me. I feel like it would be better to cut it off as early as possible.

I've looked through my employment contract and nothing is preventing me from quitting. I feel like I want to quit. Of all the things I'm struggling with on my first job, it's the *time*. It sounds so trivial, but I feel like shit whenever I leave.

What would you do?",12Feb2020,1
888,"Just as a heads up, this is going to be a lengthy one. Please bear with me, as I have a lot of family history to explain for context, and I could really use the advice.

I (F21) have a VERY dysfunctional family. I’m going to be using fake names for the sake of anonymity.

I have two sisters; Julia (26) and Monica (28). I also have a half-brother who I share a mother with, named Micah (33).

Julia HATES Monica. She’s always been very jealous of Monica because she always felt like my parents (mid 50’s), put her on a pedestal. She made it her life-long goal to hit every milestone before Monica, even at her own emotional and mental expense. She moved to another continent, where she met Jayme (M25); a homeless alcoholic who began crashing on her couch. They said “I love you” the same day that they met, and he continued to spend every penny she earned until she went broke and had had to move back to the US. But Jayme took the opportunity to propose right before she moved back home, even though they had only met two months prior, so he unfortunately came home with her. 

She had already one-upped Monica once, in her mind, so she took it one step further and immediately got pregnant. They had no money, no jobs, and their marriage basically began to fall apart within a week of moving to the United States. Jayme did NOT want a baby, and he began cheating on her with every woman or man that would be willing to sleep with him. Julia was, and is still, well aware of this. They lived with my parents until their first child was over a year old. They did not pay rent, and my parents paid for most of their house. 

Now they have a second child, and are so broke that they couldn’t afford food if my parents didn’t help. They paid off Julia and Jayme’s debt, which is about $60,000 total, and have bought them a total of three cars since they moved here. Whenever my parents are selling one of their appliances (plow, dishwasher, etc.), they let Julia sell it on Facebook marketplace and give her all the money. Julia posts to social media every week about all the new things she’s buying for her house with my parents’ money.

Monica is my best friend. She has a happy life, with her husband and her toddler. She feels no jealousy towards Julia and the rivalry has always been completely one-sided on Julia’s part. She’s a zero-drama type of gal, so she stays out of Julia’s way. However, they struggle monetarily as well. My parents haven’t given her a penny. If we’re all spending time together as a family, my parents will give Julia’s children all of their attention, feed them, offer to change their diapers, etc., but they never offer the same to Monica. They show no interest in Monica’s child, to the point where her child is afraid of my parents. Not long ago, Monica found out she was pregnant again, but her doctor wouldn’t schedule an appointment to check on the baby because she owed them $400. When she told my parents this, they said “wow, that sucks. You should really keep up with those bills”. That really rubbed her the wrong way.

Not much to say about Micah’s relationship with my parents. The day he turned 18, my father (his step-father) decided he was done parenting him, and he and my mother approached him and said “well, if you need anything, feel free to ask your biological father. We have three daughters to take care of”. They would even make him sit on the floor when we would hang out in the living room. Needless to say, he doesn’t like them.

I’ve had depression and anxiety from a very young age, and my parents just never knew how to handle it. They wouldn’t talk to me unless I was failing a class, and then they would scream at me until I had panic attacks. We never really had a relationship outside of fighting, except for the week-long vacation we used to take once a year, where they would be ridiculously nice. When I was 16, I got into a fight with one of my friends (M). He was going to come over to my house to talk in person. My anxiety spiked and began to cry. My father went downstairs, grabbed his gun, loaded it, and said, “if he walks through the door, I’ll blow his head off”. I sobbed and begged him not to, but he refused. Luckily, I was able to convince my friend not to come.

The next day, I was having a session with my therapist, and I told her. The police and DHHS got involved. They came to my school to ask me questions. In the middle of answering, my father showed up and said he was picking me up. When I got into his car, he told me that I ruined his life. He said that he was never really going to shoot my friend, and that he would never forgive me if he lost his job. He has a high position in a government job, and makes 6 figures. He and my mother are wealthy, and he never lost his job.

When I was 19, I entered a relationship with Don, who was 27 at the time. I met him through Monica, and I didn’t know him well, but my parents were suddenly really nice to me whenever his name came up, so I decided to give him a try. About a month into our relationship, Don began to sexually abuse me. He threatened to kill himself if I told, so I was TERRIFIED. I stayed with him for another few months out of fear. When I finally broke it off, he had caused so much damage from the abuse that I had to go to physical therapy for a year and a half to repair what had been done to my cervix. My parents did not, and continue not to believe me.

Couple months after that, I started dating Bruno (M20). We were childhood friends and he was my first real crush when I was little. We hadn’t talked in a few years, but we reconnected and we both fell hard. He lives one road up from my parents, so it’s about a 5-minute drive. It was amazing getting to wake up in the morning and just walk to his house. A month into our relationship, my parents kicked me out once and for all. They decided that Bruno could take care of me. He lives with his single mother, and brother (16), but I didn’t know them very well and vice versa. It was an EXTREMELY big thing to ask of them, but Bruno begged his mother to let me move in and she accepted. I’ve lived them for almost two years now.

In those two years, even though my parents are nearby, I haven’t talked to them much. I see them on holidays and special occasions, but other than that, I am not invited over. Julia, of course, is invited for dinner every Wednesday with her family. Micah and Monica don’t get invited over either.

Bruno and I applied to a school in Europe, and we were accepted for fall of this year. We are very excited to move. My parents, on the other hand, are not excited. They treated Julia like shit when she moved too far away for them to monitor her, and now they’re doing the same to me.

Last week, my mother and I got into a BIG fight. I felt that it was unfair that Julia has gotten about $100,000 from them in the last year, whereas my other siblings and I have gotten nothing. Monica at least got a little something when she had her baby, but they haven’t offered me anything in years. I am well aware that they aren’t required to give us money. However, they’ve given Julia EVERYTHING, and she’s using it to her advantage. Julia and Jayme are now trying for a third baby, just so that they can get their money. They aren’t very subtle about it.

I told my mother that I always felt like I wasn’t treated well. I’m a grown adult who needs money and adult things, but they’ve given me nothing but Harry Potter memorabilia and bobble heads for gifts for years. I haven’t been into Harry Potter since middle school, but they don’t know that because they haven’t tried to get to know me since then. Believe me, I spent years trying to talk to them. They also refuse to have any adult conversations with me. When Jayme began cheating on Julia, she expressed that she was struggling with depression and I was really scared for her and her kid. I approached my parents, but they acted the fool and said, “Julia has a perfect marriage and she’s very happy. I don’t know what you’re talking about”. Julia confirmed for me a few days later that my parents knew everything.

My mom said that my feelings were BS. I had no right to say that I was being treated unfairly in her opinion. She called me out for not texting or coming over enough. I basically said the same to her; that she and my father were not contacting me either, and that I didn’t want to have to invite myself over every time I wanted to see them. She told me that I was welcome to come on Wednesday nights with Julia and her family, but that I was ONLY welcome on Wednesday nights. That really hurt. That means, if wanted to talk to them, I would have to compete with Jayme, Julia (who is VERY talkative), a baby, and a toddler who has been spoiled to the point of screaming at the top of her lungs if she isn’t the center of attention and doesn’t know how to play on her own. She offered me no explanation as to why I was only welcome then. 

I said that I didn’t like that idea and felt that I wouldn’t have much of an opportunity to talk to them, but she didn’t care. She told me that it was 100% my responsibility to maintain my relationship with them, which I don’t agree with. I told her that the ball was in her court now. I was the one that started the conversation, I told her how I felt, and that if she wanted to see me, I wanted a one-on-one hangout with her and my father. She responded by saying, “I’m done with this conversation”. She hasn’t talked to me since, but she keeps ""loving"" my facebook posts and commenting on them. My father texts me like nothing happened. 

I’ll probably be moving at the beginning of summer, and I fully anticipate them never inviting me over before then, but giving me shit for not trying to plan to see them before I leave. The family has basically been split into two groups now; Julia and my parents, and then Micah, Monica, and myself. My parents are oblivious to our pain, and deny our feelings if we express them. I feel like I shouldn’t hurt this much, but now I have no urge to see my parents at all. Am I a bad kid if I wait for them to reach out and separate myself?",12Feb2020,1

I'm almost done with college and I'm at that age for finding internships and learning software development for enterprise.

I know machine learning but I'm so unintelligent compared to the him to think of making such an application. If I watch this person I'm affirming the belief that I cant make applications on my own.""

My mother, god bless her heart, lend her $1,000 a little before Christmas to pay overdue bills and rent but has yet to see any improvement or encouragement on Beth's side. Now with this new little baby in the picture, it is hard to turn away from her. I also have reason to believe she had this baby for sympathy. (The baby's father helps out every now and then, but we haven't met him. We believe he is a married man.) 

Having her in my life has been stressful and i've grown resentment towards her. Our mother is always on edge and the last straw was her lending Beth money. What should I do? What should we all do? I don't mind legal enforcement advice and etc.",12Feb2020,1

Basically, I live a country where I have never seen a black human being in my life. I am about to move into the US. I have no clue about US culture at all. So when I imagine a black person, I have no basis to go off of except for TV. Most shows I watch involve gangs and other crime related topics and most of the people in these “gangs” are predominantly black. This sometimes causes me anxiety. I know that is the most stereotypical thing ever but I just never had any experience. I know that these thoughts are completely wrong and horrible but I just can’t help myself. I just want to know if me thinking this makes me a bas person. I’m sorry if I’ve offended or disappointed anyone. Am I racist?",12Feb2020,1

I had my co-worker check our schedule and it wasn't written down. The only reason i realised i missed a shift was because i told my co-worker id be there last week and she sent me a message that evening. She asked me where i was and i i was supposed to be there.

They had put in a 1 week notice and trained me a little for 2 days, then took a PTO day and and HR told them to not come back since they didn’t want to be there anymore. For the past few months, I have been working the position I was hired to do and the person’s who quit position. My manager had put in the HR papers for a new title that they explained is the next level up and to take over the person who quit position a couple of weeks ago. Today, HR had called and said that the new position is a lateral move with the title change and they said they could only raise my salary from $43K to $45K. Should I be worried? I thought that I could get $62K as my manager told me that I deserved a position and that it was next level up. I’ve seen that the person who worked the position that I was hired to do made $80K and just guessing that the person who recently quit that was here for 10 years made $80K too.

900,"I'm a high school student in Spanish 4 this year. I've always done well in Spanish, and I really enjoy it. Course selection for next year is this week. The deadline is Friday. I had always previously planned on taking AP Spanish. I've heard from teachers that it's very rigorous, and it is overall a very difficult class. My Spanish teacher said she wanted anyone in her class who was considering taking AP next year to talk to her to make sure they were making the right choice. I talked to her and she said I would do fine in AP Spanish.

I knew there was an IB Spanish class, but I had never previously considered taking it because I thought you could only take it if you were in the IB program, and I'm not in the IB program. Today I learned that you don't need to be in the IB Program to take an IB class. The IB Spanish class is two years long, while the AP Spanish class is only one year long. If I took IB Spanish, I would be taking Spanish for the rest of my time in high school (I'm a sophomore this year). I had always wanted to take Spanish all throughout high school, and now there's finally a way for me to do that.

My school only offers IB Spanish SL (Standard Level) but doesn't offer IB Spanish HL (Higher Level). HL classes give college credit, while SL classes don't. I don't care that much about whether I get college credit, though. In IB Spanish SL, there are people who have only taken Spanish for two years, up to people such as myself who have taken Spanish for four years. I'm worried IB Spanish might be a little too easy since they'll be teaching a lot of grammar and vocab that I already know. AP Spanish would be more difficult, and I want to challenge myself in Spanish. But while AP Spanish focuses heavily on reading and writing, IB Spanish focuses heavily on verbal and listening ability. 

In IB Spanish, students practice a lot of speaking and even have debates in Spanish. You learn to speak Spanish well. I want to focus on being able to speak and understand Spanish. My goal is to eventually be conversationally fluent in Spanish, and I think IB Spanish would be a better fit for that. But I'm worried it won't be challenging enough. I talked to my Spanish teacher about which class I should take next year, and she said I would do well in either class, but she thinks AP would be a better fit for me and would loom better on college applications. She said that AP Spanish also focuses on a good amount of speaking, but not as much as IB. 

I tried to talk to the IB Spanish teacher today. The IB Spanish teacher was my Spanish 3 teacher last year, so I already have an idea of how he teaches. He's a good teacher, and I would be happy to have him as a teacher for the next two years. He didn't have any free time today, but he told me to talk to him during lunch tomorrow. But before I left he said, ""Long story short, I would recommend taking IB over AP."" But of course he would say that since he's the IB Spanish teacher.

I tried seeing if I could talk to the AP Spanish teacher, but she was in the middle of teaching a class. I sent her an email, and hopefully we can have a meeting tomorrow. I want to talk to both teachers and get a better glimpse of what each class is like before I make my choice. But the deadline is in two days, so I need to make a choice soon.

If I could take both classes at once, I would. I'm pretty sure the school doesn't allow that, but I'll have to check. If I took both at the same time, I'm not sure I would have room in my schedule to get all my credits necessary for graduation. So taking both is most likely not an option. If I take IB Spanish and decide I don't like it, I'm not sure if I can get out of it. I might have to take it for the whole two years even if I don't want to be in it. But I have to make sure. It would sure be nice if I could have talked to the Spanish teachers to figure this stuff out.

Does anyone here have any advice?",12Feb2020,1
901,"I am not sure where to start, this is the first time I am really talking about this. 

My younger brother is 20, He is a skinny, good looking kid. Has a good job for his age. And has a caring and loving girlfriend. Our parents seem to favorite him I guess that is almost a given since hes the youngest. 

On the other hand I am 22, play a game for a living which is why this is a throwaway account. I do not want anyone knowing who I am. I am almost the opposite to him. Fat, loner type I guess you'd call it? Was never to social. He on the other hand is very good with social situations and knows how to talk to people. Point I am trying to make is my brother is a seemingly perfect guy but I think he has deep rooted issues that he needs to talk about. I don't hate him I just want him to talk to someone and stop letting his anger strain our relationship. 

He is very good at making fun of me but anytime I say something mean to him in retaliation its like he switches and get almost ballistic and starts either hitting me, playing with my fat, making my chin talk. Like its a second mouth. Funny I guess. He does this in front of some friends I have over sometimes. Its extremely infuriating and causes me a lot of embarrassment. I tell him to knock it off that it hurts my feelings and that I don't like it. That is met with more mean remarks and me being called a ""pussy"" because I am not sticking up for myself and I am supposed to be a man. The worst is when he is trying to impress people (Women, friends of mine, new people he has over) at these events I am treated like a punching bag for insults. I sit there watching my friends or girls he has over laugh at him because its funny. Sometimes I try and stick up for myself and fight back this results in him over powering me and either slapping my ass or dry humping me just to add the humiliation while everyone just sits and laughs. The only time I feel remotely safe in my house is when I am at work or in my room which is locked so he cant get in and start making me feel like shit. 

This has been going on for years. It started when he lost weight and got ""popular"" It is like he became a different person. The kid I grew up with isn't the man I know today. 

I have tried so many times to explain to him that he needs some help. I can not take the emotional and physical abuse anymore. Again, I am called a ""pussy"" ""faggot"" ""crybaby"" or his most used line ""Its only a joke dont be a bitch"" My parents are no help at this point. They just make empty promises and tell me he doesn't mean it that of course its just a fucking joke.  

I am considering leaving and just being by myself. I do not want to be here anymore. I can't handle it.

So i 27M had a break up about 2 months ago. We were in the relationship for 6 years. And towards the end she got emotionally detached from me for some other guy. I don’t know what they both had. But our relationship broke because of the long distance that we had. 
Now i have moved on and am already dating another girl. She also had a recent breakup of a 2 year live in relationship. 
The new girl that I am with constantly tells me that i am 95% like her ex. She has explicitly asked me to not talk with my ex while she still talks with hers. Be it for rational reasons like getting her stuff from him. 
Lately she has become very secretive about her conversations with her ex which has put me into this worry, that have i been taking things too fast?
Do i still stick on to it?
Do i still do everything normally?
I just fear that i might end up being a rebound and she leaves me. Honestly i am getting a little attached to her.

937,"I (27M) currently stuck in a crossroad between getting a job in Sherman Tx or getting a masters degree in San Antonio. 

Some background information about myself: I am a Petroleum Engineer from Texas A&amp;M University. I worked for 2 years as a Frac Field Engineer for a well renowned oil and gas service company on a 14 days on 5 days off schedule and got burnt out. 

I am currently in the interviewing process with a drilling and mining company for a Sales Support Engineering position. The location is in Sherman TX where most of the employees commute from Frisco (roughly ~1 hour commute one way). The position seems interesting and with a lot of potential to grow and advance professionally; however, it is far away from home and any people I know. Seems like a very lonely job and the endgame is to become a Sales Manager.

My other option is to get a Master of Science in Data Analytics degree from University of Texas at San Antonio since this has always interested me and gives me a good chance to end up working in my dream city which is San Antonio and is closer to home and I have family living there as well.

When I was a baby obviously my parents would have to wash me in the bath/shower because I was incapable. But when I was about 7 I could do it all by myself so I didn't really need my parents around. My mum felt she could trust me but my dad would stick around. Instead of letting me learn, he would wash my hair and wash my body too. But only my intimate parts. Thing is this carried on until I was 12, and it really hurt. I couldn't tell him to stop and it made me feel sick. I didn't understand what sexual assault was back then, but by the time I was 13 it got worse. My dad's now wife used to walk in on me and stare at me, stark naked in the shower. It was really uncomfortable for me and she wouldn't leave. She would ask if I needed help, when I said no, she would say ""sure?"" And tell me what I was doing wrong. When I was 14, I was able to move out of my dad's house and live with my mum permanently.  I learned about consent and violating at 13 but looking back I feel as if 13 was too late an age to learn about all this. He would also walk around naked at home too, as well as his girlfriend which made me feel sick too. There was also an incident when he whipped my behind with a horse whip for no reason either. And also, I had been brought up with him smacking my butt and wolf whistling my whole life, and didn't even realise it was a whole sexist thing until I was 13 and learned about it all. I really need your advice because I just don't know how to feel about it and don't know if I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but it felt wrong.",12Feb2020,1

So here's the thing.
I've been dating this girl for only a few weeks now, and everything's perfect so far. She openly says she likes me, and we're going on a date this Friday (February 14, of course hehe). However, I need some advice regarding my confidence. I've had terrible experiences with girls who have played with or manipulated me. Too many times I've lost count. To be honest, those experiences have detrimented my self-confidence. I'm always expecting the worst. I get very anxious if she doesn't reply my texts right away, and whenever I don't see her, I'm always worrying about a possible cheating scenario (she can hang out with other guys, of course, she's not my girlfriend. But you know what I mean). I can be very clingy sometimes, and that sucks. Fortunately, we're in the same class so I see her every day and it's great. She hugs me a lot, and we're together all the time. But when we're not, I spend most of my time asking myself the same question over and over; does she really like me? 
I really like her, and I want this to be perfect. My heart's been broken for a long time, and meeting her has made me forget about my previous issues. I haven't had a proper girlfriend in years. That's probably why I'm feeling this way. Anyways, I hope you guys can encourage me to stop overthinking. I'm feeling extremely happy right now and I want it to last. Thank you very much.

946,"So long story short (you can read the full version I posted in a revenge subreddit, I was super angry a little bit ago)... dude used to have a legitimate clothing company years ago, my boyfriend loved the brand, I went to buy something for Xmas from company, dude took my money- order never showed. I have contacted him multiple times, only twice have I gotten a half- assed “sorry were backed up they’ll be here soon” response with no real info of when it’ll arrive, over the past three months out of who knows how many emails and Instagram messages I’ve sent. Dude posts on Instagram every half hour, still opens and reads all my DMs, won’t respond. It’s been 3 months, clearly I got scammed..

My question is, what can I do about this? I’m pretty pissed off, I guess on Facebook there are tons of reviews of this dude recently taking people’s money and never sending out orders (I don’t use fbook so I didn’t realize this until I did some digging later, and honestly my boyfriend has tons of clothes from this company from years ago so I didn’t think anything of it when I ordered something from them). Can I like report him to the government somehow for fraud? 

I am planning on contacting my bank for my money back... but I want this dudes illegitimate business taken DOWN. He’s a jerk, and I don’t want to see him scamming other people and then posting all these shitty pics “flexing” his money and success and women.

952,"Throwaway to maintain privacy. 
I live with my ex whom I consider my friend still (amicable breakup). 
About a month ago when we were still together, we decided to take some old items and donate them. We used my car because it has significantly more space and his car is newer than mine.

He wanted to get rid of a larger piece of furniture.  We both thought it would be finr (we had fit it in my vehicle before, but it was not with any boxes or bags that time). When we pulled up to the donation spot he pulled everything out. I'm convinced removing his large furniture did some kind of damage to my sunshade. I remember him yanking at it when it was stuck rather than being gentle. I even asked him to be careful because my sunshade was closed to protect the glass. Everything else was small items that weren't wedged against the ceiling of my car. 

We didn't realize how extensive the damage was until a week later. I went to open the sunshade and the fabric tore due to the unit being slightly off track. It is now stuck half-open. Because my car's roof is panoramic, the sunshade was pretty much the entire ceiling inside my car. The panoramic roof is rare for my model so the sunshade has to be specially ordered. Quotes from auto body shops are more than I can spend since I'm also trying to get my own place. 

I've subtly brought up the issue to him but he has not offered to help financially or by doing the repair. He recommended a few more body shops I could go to. I even mentioned that I was hesitant to go through my insurance because they would likely ask for his information. He just recommended more body shops. 

I don't want to fight with him as we are still friends and we still live together. But I feel that he should offer to help since his furniture did the damage. I know I offered my vehicle as a way to transport it but at the same time I feel he damaged my car so he should take some responsibility.

959,"3,5 years ago i (now 23M) met her (now 24F). She was great, we were in love. 3 years ago, we got into the relationship 'officially'. a bit under 2.5 years ago i more or less moved in with her in her appartment that we could easily pay rent for together.

Imagine her like this (back then); smart, funny, low self esteem, laughed at my dumb jokes, dependant, similar interests, but there were some mental problems (and some other stuff but not relevant to the story)

imagine me (back then); working nights at a bar, very social, big future plans, every week a different great idea that would make me succesfull, dropped out of college (dutch variant) 4 times at that time, good sense of humor (i think), like to be caring for others (its well known that im nice to talk to).

&amp;#x200B;

So heres what happened. all was good and well for a long time, we both had our issues but nothing we couldt overcome. I was in treatment for depression for a while, and she often had physical issues, luckily i liked to care for her so were good on that, no problem.

But then it happened. I knew she wanted to have a better self esteem, find some friends because although she loved me, being together close to 24/7 was a bit much. This went on for a while. In the meantime i got the treatment for depression. This resulted in me having days, weeks or even months being obsessed with achieving stuff in life. In this time i quit my bullshit bartending/partying job, got somewhat more focussed on school, and in this process i lost all friends i hadnt already lost before that. i became serious...

And so the caring got more serious, i more or less pushed her into mental health. After some bad luck in there she finally found someone that actually understood here and she was growing fast all of a sudden. This was a few months back from now. Her growing meant that she was able to get a new job, one she was happy in. At that job she made friends, and then in happened. She decided to go get a drink with collague (F) at some point, and damn was i happy for her that she had made a friend, this sounds childish but i really was happy for her. After that another collague (M) got into the picture, and more and more. she started going to parties, meeting up after work etc etc. But there was a problem here, she grew, and i hated it. And i started asking questions; where are you going? who are you going with? why would you do that? Why cant you go with me?

I was trying to keep her in the house, and why? becuase i was alone. she wasnt there, i had no friends, i had not enough to do to keep myself busy and it was horrible. At this point my intervening got worse, and i started blaming her for locking me out, that she was finding excuses of not wanting to be at home, which was true. She was finding excuses. I constantly made it look like i was trying to talk it out, but all i did was pretending i did nothing wrong and blamed her. even to the point that i said i needed the time to think as this whole thing was hurting me over and over. And so i did, i packed my bag and went to my mother and talked things over with her and her partner.

at this point in time i didnt realize that i was in the wrong all the time. so my story looked like this: gf is trying to lock me out, finds excuses to not spent time with me, and it is all her fault, and not mine. and when you put it like that of course mum would tell me: why wont you end things, this is making you horrible.

Now fast forward 4 days and i just realized i made the biggest mistake in my life by blaming her for my ...well jealousy i think.

We havent broken up officialy and i really dont want to either. when i went to pack my bags i told her it might be a good idea to live apart, but be together (aparently thats a thing - LAT). now i regret that because it feels like i lost her completely. we should be meeting up this weekend. and i dont know what to tell her. I have left a letter for her in which i have written what i wrote above as well. I dont knwo what to do, please give me some advice on what to do.

My school canteen functions in a way that if you want lunch, you have to order the morning of from a website. On our way to school (mum driving), I asked if I could order. Despite driving she tried to do it by herself, I managed to convince her to give it to me as I could do it myself, also it wasn't safe to be doing that while driving. Just when I was opening up the site, she receives a text. The name is male and I've never heard it before. It reads ""Good morning sunshine."" with a variation of heart emojis.

My mum has an apple watch so notifications go through on her watch too.

For a very long time now I've been struggling with my ability to speak to women but mainly deal with my stress related to not being able to perform or do anything in bed.

Back in September, I was speaking to a nice woman but unfortunately, whenever she tried to please me I would struggle to maintain an erection until I stayed with her for a couple of months and got to know her. I eventually got fed up with my lack of ability and saw a doctor, in which they prescribed me Cialis and gave me the all-clear for any internal health issues. 

However, even after being given meds I would still struggle. It does take me a while to become comfortable around women anyway but I have so much desire to do one-night stands and mess around a bit ya know? It's so frustrating because I'm 20 and at university, I have so much time!

Whenever It comes to sleeping with someone I can never stay 'in the mood' if you catch my drift, it always seems stop-start, Like my sexual desire fluctuates and so on.

979,"Within the last 2-3 years, my sister has been diagnosed with manic depressive disorder, borderline personality disorder, and social anxiety disorder. She is also very high-functioning autistic, which my parents apparently knew about since we were very young but never bothered to tell me because they thought I wouldn’t understand. As I’m sure you can imagine, she is very difficult to deal with sometimes.
She also has the typical insecurities that come along with being the youngest child. She has always done her best to be the complete opposite of me (for example, my favorite color is pink, so she refuses to own anything pink). She is also very jealous of any success that I have, even though I am very supportive of all her successes.
We have not always had the best relationship, but things have definitely taken a downward spiral since I moved away for college, and even more so when things started getting really serious with my fiancé, probably because she has difficulty forming connections with other people and having long-term relationships. She’s very critical of him and how I act with him. This lately came to a head when I was having a bad day and she was nitpicking him for no reason. She started comparing him to some guy she was talking to and I snapped, “Oh, is that the guy of the week?” Believe me, I regretted it immediately after and I was going to apologize, but then my mom got in the middle of it (she could have her own post some days tbh) and demanded that I apologize. This royally pissed me off, because my sister is always saying nasty things to me about my body (usually along the lines of being fat and hairy), but she never tells her to apologize. Also, I’m an adult! I don’t need my mother to break up fights with my sister anymore.
That was a few months ago and my sister has been even more cold and distant since then. Also didn’t help that when I got engaged I didn’t ask her to be a bridesmaid, mainly because a bridesmaid should be supportive and helpful, which, as we’ve established, my sister is not.

So basically, I was a victim of sexual abuse. I ended up telling my parents, and my dad went to the police about it. They filed a report and then eventually I went in for my report on what happened, it was recorded, whatever. 

The officer assigned to this was talking with my mom and I about everything that can happen now that they have this, the amount of charges that’ll be filed against him, etc. He also mentioned that there is no statue of limitation, so i could still come back 20 yrs later and go through all of this and bring him to trial then rather then do it now, it’s all up to me.

He also mentioned that there will most likely be a trial, and that can go on for like 2 yrs. At that point, I noticed my mom shift, so she was obviously thinking about something. I had made my decision right then in my head to do it now bcuz why would I want to wait. Also, regardless of whether or not my parents want to do it later, it’s all still up to me. 

I didn’t talk about it with my mom until today, like 15 mins ago. I asked her what she wants to do, and she said that she’d prefer that we postpone it for when I’m a bit older. I didn’t say anything and walked away up to my room. 

She came in like 10 mins later and explained that her reasoning for wanting to postpone it is bcuz it’ll be a lot of stress emotionally, mentally, and physically put onto me, and it’s something that’ll take a while, not just a minute. She also said that she is just starting to get back to where she used to be before she found out she had cancer and depression, and she thinks that a trial will put her right back to her depressive state. 

I still don’t like the idea of him just walking free while i’m here, not seeing any justice, and living with the consent thought in my head, so of course I wanna do it now. I want to see his life absolutely ruined, to the point where he can’t even get a job. 

The only upside that I see when it comes postponing it is that I can wait until his life finally gets back to normal and he’s not in debt, and then boom, he ends up having to go to trial and having his career ruined forever.

996,"I’m adopted internationally. I was adopted into a white family and never had any connection or opportunity to see anyone that looked like me growing up. I believed I was mostly like the other kids and although I experienced racism, I didn’t know any other kids from my background, so I didn’t have any frame of reference to know that my upbringing was unusual. 

Fast forward to now, I finally met others from the same background as me; and I realise how they look with their parents, they look the same; they have a shared history and shared culture and learned all of this growing up. I suddenly started thinking about my other family, I realised I have another entire family out there that are probably mourning my loss. There’s a good chunk of reason to believe that I was human trafficked and not abandoned, so knowing that made me feel more sad, because I realised they didn’t want to give me up and over the past 2 years I’ve suddenly gotten to the point where I think about it everyday? I keep thinking about my mom and how heartbroken she must be to have lost her child. I  think about how poor they must be and what hard times they have; and how it’s so different from the life I’ve enjoyed living in a 1st world country. 

I keep thinking about my family and how I lost my entire family and culture in one sort of split second. Since I didn’t have any information though, it’s very very difficult to find my birth parents because I have no records and wasn’t a documented birth- so that’s not really the solution here. 

I don’t really know what to do with these feelings, all I feel is insane amount of loss and pain just suddenly sometimes and I think about it. I think it’s hard to explain to my friends because they don’t understand how I could “ miss” them, since I never knew them, but I remind them that everyday I look in the mirror I see them, because no one else here looks like me. Little things keep reminding me of them, and yeh my adoptive parents aren’t much help and pretty much get offended that I think that my birth parents are “ better or something”.

School 1: An international top 20 school with significant name recognition and prestige (especially in math/research quality overall). Offer is for a four year bachelors degree. The program is said to be a ""GPA killer"" and makes getting into grad school hard, but does open a lot of doors because there is lots of opportunity to get involved in both research and co-op/work placements throughout undergrad years and build a resume. As far as course material goes this program also aligns the most with what my interests are. 

School 2: A well ranked and decently regarded school (mid 100s on international rankings) that is definitely smaller than school #1 but still very respectable. Offer is for a somewhat selective Math+Stats program that has very strong financial/actuarial co-op and job opportunities both during the degree and after graduation. Graduates from this school make the most on average after just a bachelors between the schools mentioned here from what I can gather. Unfortunately the content of the program is really not the kind of math I am interested in, but my parents really want me to go here. 

School 3: Ranked lower than the other two schools (mid 600s internationally), but certainly on the climb and generally well respected domestically. The most notable thing here is that the offer I have been given is a ""fast track"" bachelor and masters degree combo- The bachelors degree is done in 3 years and if at that point you meet a certain GPA threshold (varies year to year but about 3.5 from what I gather) you are guaranteed a place in the masters program which you complete in 1 year. So 4 years for both degrees.

Costs are generally the same across all three schools so that is not a large factor.

Hailey told me that Julian k*lls animals and I was like excuse me? Because I didn't believe it. Not because it was Julian but because it was just odd to be informed of a person I ""kind of"" know to be doing something so horrible.


I know Julian's dangerous. He stalked Hailey once when she was walking to a nearby Popeye's. He self-h*rms and posts it on instagram. He pressured Hailey to stay with him by sending his arm with cuts saying that he'll k*ll himself if she did (she did eventually leave and he's not dead). He k*lled animals and takes pictures of them.


I want this to stop. But Hailey is scared and I can see why she doesn't want to report it because of Julian's actions and what he might do to her. But I also want to stop this before he escalates and k*lls a human being. This is a tough situation and I'm not sure what to do without scaring Hailey and Julian being suspicious.

[I put my one of dogs down on Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/eyzppb/help_putting_dog_down_friday_i_hope_this_is_the/), so this has turned into the roughest week of my life.

My girlfriend, Sunny, comes from a very religious and traditional asian family, and her parents are immigrants. I have been through so much with her over the last several years. If any of you were on [r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/) a few months back, you might have seen my post where [her father wouldn't turn over her Social Security Card, Passport, or Birth Certificate](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/daxohu/us_utah_girlfriends_father_wont_turn_over_her/) when she decided to move in with me. I'll get to that, but know that while I would have broken up with any other girl because of the drama, I am so deeply in love with Sunny that I was willing put up with anything - until now.

**My background:**

In my early 20s I was married to my high school sweetheart. I was the a model husband and I did everything for her, but after an extremely tumultuous, decade-long, one-sided relationship, I couldn't take it anymore and filed for divorce. My once sweet and loving wife had evolved into one of the most selfish and awful people I had ever met in my life. She hurt me so badly on so many occasions that I felt like I had no other choice.

I was so damaged after this relationship that I became a womanizing cynic. I didn't like romantic dinners anymore. I couldn't stand Valentine's Day. I didn't want to get married again or even have a serious girlfriend. I didn't want anyone in a serious relationship to feel good. All I wanted to do was find women to fuck and keep them at arm's length. I put on a façade that I did not care about women anymore, but the truth was I couldn't bear to go through pain like that again.

A few years after my divorce I started dating a girl named Amy. After several months of thoughtfulness, consideration, and love, she managed to get under my skin and slowly broke down my barriers. We started getting serious. We talked about moving in together and maybe getting married someday. For the first time in years I actually felt happy and complete. I cared about her and tried my best to be a great boyfriend. When I was with her I really felt like I was becoming the good person I was always meant to be.

Then, out of nowhere, I got an STD. Despite my past I have never cheated on a girl, and certainly did not cheat on Amy. The STD had an incubation period of only a few weeks, and it appeared at the base of my penis. When it started to spread I went to the doctor who ran some tests and confirmed my suspicions.

The STD was curable, but I was absolutely fucking devastated. Given the nature of the disease, the only way she could have received and spread it to me was through sex. I packed up all of her things in my apartment, drove to her place, dropped her things on the ground, asked for her key to my place, left, blocked her number and email, and drove home.

I didn't cry, but just meditated in a state of complete disbelief. I immediately went back to my old ways, and I vowed I would never let another woman get close to me again. Fool me once? Shame on you. Fool me twice? Shame on me.

**Our Story:**

All of this started to change with Sunny.

Sunny and I met several years ago at work. I worked full time in the IT department and Sunny worked part time in customer service while finishing school. We became quick friends, and after getting to knowing her for a few months I asked her out. I'm about 8 years older than her. At the time, I developed a reputation for dating girls in that department that had started to catch up with me. I was next in line for a promotion that would happen in the next year or so when my boss retired. Thinking about my career, I actually cancelled our date at the last minute and told her we should remain friends. I felt bad, and she was disappointed and awkward for a bit, but everything went back to normal after a few weeks and we stated work friends.

Fast forward a year later. She was going to a concert that I was interested in. None of my friends wanted to go to this one, and she invited me to join her and her friends. I was a bit hesitant at first, but I met some of her friends and we ended up having a blast. We started attending more and more concerts together, started hanging out a lot more, and gradually met more of each other's friends.

Fast forward a few months / concerts after that. After an amazing concert, she sent me a text that we should have hung out afterwards to spend more time together. I invited her over to my place the next morning. Sunny showed up, and when I opened the door she just looked at me and smiled. We kissed for the first time, and then we had sex.

Two things were immediately clear: Sunny wanted a relationship, and she wasn't experienced in bed. She didn't know how to kiss, let alone fornicate. I didn't want a relationship, but I found the idea of teaching her kind of fun. I really liked Sunny a lot from the start, but I was seeing a few other girls at the time with no intention of having a girlfriend - let alone settling down. We had sex a few more times that day, got dinner, and worked out together. She tried to hold my hand and kiss me in public several times that day, but I instinctively just pushed her back, told her we weren't bf/gf, and needed to take it slow. I could tell this hurt her a bit because she thought we were close already, but she agreed and we started to see each other casually.

We did not tell anyone at work. One of my creepy colleagues had actually gone on a date with her a few months prior, which did not end well for him. He was still obsessed with her, and we both felt like he would flip out if he found out we had hooked up. In addition, one of the other girls from customer service that I stopped hooking up with because I didn't want a relationship was still not over me and made several vocalizations about this on a weekly basis. If word got out, these two people would create a lot of drama for us, so we decided to play it cool when we ran into each other at work, and this helped me keep things casual.

Over the course of several months, though, this changed.

Sunny went out of her way to do all sorts of sweet and thoughtful things for me (and others). She was such a genuine and lovely person that I couldn't believe it. She showed up at my place to make me soup when I was sick, made me dinner when I was extremely busy at work, dropped me off / picked me up from the airport every time I traveled, and just slowly wore all of my walls down. All of our dates were amazing and she loved to go places and try new things with me. I eventually stopped seeing other girls because I wanted to spend my free time with Sunny.

After about six months of this, we were about to go to a party together. This party was hosted by one of my close friends from work. Sunny asked the question: ""What will we tell people at the party?"" I asked her if she still wanted to be my girlfriend, and she smiled and forcefully shouted ""YES!!"" Since then we have been inseparable.

After we became exclusive and more serious Sunny introduced me to some of her closest friends. Her friends all thought I was trying to take advantage of her and hated me from the start. Earlier in our relationship they would have been right.

Two of her friends were very polite and patient, but one of them, Molly, was insane and extremely vindictive. I had actually seen this friend several times at my gym over the last year. I knew Molly was a friend of Sunny's, and she flirted with me all the time when I was working out and even propositioned me once before Sunny and I started dating. I stayed the hell away from her because she seemed a bit crazy and I didn't want to hurt Sunny's feelings by having sex with one of her friends. When I started dating Sunny, though, Molly got pretty upset.

Molly tried all sorts of things to hurt our relationship and break us up, and in every case I just ignored her and acted like I didn't take her seriously, which pissed her off more. She lied to Sunny and told her that I tried to proposition *her* at the gym, told her I said mean things about women, and so on. Sunny didn't really take this seriously, but things changed when Sunny and I hosted a party at my place and both Molly and her boyfriend were invited.

After the party, Molly texted Sunny saying ""I am so sorry, are you ok?!"" Sunny was confused, and Molly said that I had made fun of Sunny and called her a bitch and other terrible things when she wasn't paying attention, and that she probably didn't hear or remember it because she drank too much.

Gaslight, much? This was obviously bullshit, but for some reason Sunny believed her. She came over to my place crying and we had a fight over her friend. I told Sunny everything from my perspective and explained that I never told her that her friend liked me first because I didn't want to ruin their friendship and thought that she'd be more adult about my rejection. Sunny was extremely upset and actually left. We didn't speak or even text for several days, and it really hurt.

We decided to meet at a park where we'd walk my dogs together sometimes. We quietly found a secluded area and sat down. I thought that we were going to break up, so I just stared at her silently and allowed her to speak. Instead, Sunny just broke down, hugged me, started crying, and apologized for doubting me. She loved her friend Molly but knew that she lied a lot, and her other friends at the party actually sided with me. We kissed, talked for several hours, and were closer than ever. This became our ""spot"", and we have gone back there several times to talk or just enjoy each other's company.

A few weeks later, one of Sunny's colleagues found out that we were dating and started telling people at work. Unfortunately, my boss ended up announcing his retirement right before the rumor mill started churning. I had worked my ass off for several years and was literally a shoe-in to replace him, but as soon as my awkward colleague (that Sunny rejected) and the girl from customer service (that I dumped) got wind of our relationship, all bets were off. Both of them started to spread terrible lies about me and how I targeted and abused younger girls at work and wasn't good at my job. I told my boss about everything and he told me not to worry, as most of my other colleagues vouched for both me and Sunny and knew most of what everyone was saying was baseless.

I was stressed out, but I felt assured that I would get the promotion in the end. Unfortunately, some of the rumors got to my boss's boss, a real man-hating neo-feminist type. My boss retired, and when his job officially opened up my application was immediately rejected. I didn't even get a fucking interview. This woman then gave the job to one of my younger female colleagues that she hung out with outside of work.

I wasn't that upset that what should have been my job went to a someone else, but I was livid that the girl they hired was gossipy, sycophantic, and incompetent. They picked her not just over me, but literally dozens of more qualified candidates with extensive experience and professional accolades because she was a woman. My boss' boss joked about doing that all the time, and literally every single person she hired while she was there was a woman. I was so pissed off that I immediately put in my two weeks notice.

Sunny felt responsible and apologized profusely. In her mind, if we hadn't ever started dating then I probably would have got the job. She cooked and did several nice and thoughtful things for me over the next few days. One day she kissed me softly, then leaned back in and and told me that no matter what happened she was still happy that we found each other. I realized at that moment that I was in love with her, and that as long as I was with her everything else didn't really matter. I would find another job, but I didn't want to find another Sunny.

A few weeks later I decided to do something nice for her. I told her to free up a day and we went on a beautiful drive, a beautiful hike, had a spa day, went home to freshen up, and then went out to the best restaurant in town.

We had an amazing day together, and the dinner turned out to be one of the best meals I have ever had in my life. As the night was coming to an end, I turned her around, grabbed both of her hands, and told her that I loved her. She reciprocated, we kissed, and life went on.

Things were going better every day, until about six months ago we were out getting drinks and talking about the prospect of moving in together. Sunny suddenly broke down crying. She told me that she was extremely happy with me but that she had lots of baggage and was scared we wouldn't last because of it. I made her elaborate and she filled me in on both her family and her past.

Her family is extremely religious and would never approve of her being with (let alone marrying) someone outside of her faith. She explained that, despite being in her 20s, she was not allowed to move out until she was either married and/or finished with her *graduate* degree and enrolled in law school. Her father beat her mother constantly, and her brothers followed suit and even hit her a few times. Her family has explicitly said that if she does not fall in line they will disown her, and her extended family has already done this before with several of her cousins who married who they wanted. One of the husbands that married into the family died of mysterious circumstances, and both she and her cousin that married him are 100% convinced that his death was an honor killing and that her father was involved. She was terrified that something would happen to her or me if she chose me over her family.

She also told me about her first (and only other) boyfriend - a friend of her family when she was 18. Her parents were friends with his parents and they approved of the relationship and arranged for them to be married. She fell in (what she thought was) love with him and was with him for a couple of years, but her boyfriend became extremely controlling and abusive. He cheated on her incessantly and told her to deal with it. He couldn't have sex with *her* before marriage, but he pressured her into taking her clothes off and doing things to herself for his amusement - including things that hurt her. He took advantage of and humiliated her. Then he started hitting her. After he did this a few times, she finally got the courage to go to her parents. Much to Sunny's relief, they actually called off the marriage.

If that wasn't enough heartache, this guy married another woman less than three months later, taunted Sunny that she was ""ruined"" and unmarried, and then dropped dead from an undiagnosed heart defect about a month after his wedding. This completely shocked her and her family, and it was an extremely dark time in her life.

I was shocked. I knew her family was religious and wouldn't like me, but I did not realize the extent of it. I knew she had an ex-boyfriend, but I didn't know that she was arranged to marry him, that he had abused her, or that he was dead. Despite all of this, I told her that I loved her, that I would always protect her, and that she could always be open and honest with me.

Over the coming weeks she started to examine how insane her family was. She wanted to be with me, and [thanks to some of y](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/daxohu/us_utah_girlfriends_father_wont_turn_over_her/)[our comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/daxohu/us_utah_girlfriends_father_wont_turn_over_her/) we formulated a plan for her to move out. Her father kept all of her important documents (passport, social security card, birth certificate) locked in a safe that only he could open, so we started by ordering her birth certificate in case he refused to turn the rest of her documents over when he got the news. Sunny started moving smaller things out little by little so her parents wouldn't notice. We changed her address, opened new bank accounts in her name, changed her direct deposit information, got her a new cell phone, and figured out the car situation. She was finally ready to go.

She drove home, and I followed her and waited in my car. Her family did not take the news well. I could hear her parents screaming at her inside the house from my car parked on the sidewalk. After several minutes of this she ran outside crying, so I unlocked the door and let her in. Her father chased after her and screamed that this wasn't over, she was never welcome home again, and that he would kill me.

Sunny cried the entire way home and that entire night. She didn't eat anything for a few days. Several of her friends came over to console her, but I don't think they understood what she had just done: she gained her freedom, but the price was losing her family forever. Despite everything, there was still love and memories that she would cherish forever.

After a couple of months she was herself again and vocally happy that she did the right thing. She had the support and approval of a few of her cousins who went through something similar, and talked with them on FaceTime quite a bit to get through everything. She looked better than ever, like a huge burden had just been lifted off of her.

Fast forward a few months (about 6 weeks ago). It absolutely melted my heart to see her happy again. I made a reservation at our favorite restaurant and took her out for an amazing evening.

I have loved Sunny for years now. She brought me out of one of my darkest places, and as you have all read by now, we have been through a lot together.

At the end of the evening we walked through our favorite park and found ""our"" spot. We sat down, held hands, and I slipped a ring onto her finger. She looked at me, started tearing up, and just nodded yes before kissing me and hugging me tighter than she ever had before. She spent the next few hours mostly looking down at her ring and giggling.

We immediately started to plan the wedding. We picked a date and started to look at venues. We thought everything was great, but word got back to her family.

I came home one day to Sunny sitting at the dining room table, expressionless. I sat down next to her and asked her what was wrong. She said that her father found out where we lived and came by. I was angry, but I sat next to her and let her finish.

It turns out Sunny's ex-bf was the only child (and son) in his family, and his family was extremely influential in her parents' country. Despite abusing Sunny, and despite marrying someone else and dying, the family felt that Sunny's family owed them a debt because her father called off the marriage and because they now did not have any grandchildren.

They were using their influence to create serious problems (police harassment, beatings, etc.) for Sunny's father's extended family back home, but said that all of these problems would go away if Sunny had his child. It turns out Sunny's ex-bf had some of his sperm preserved. According to some of his close friends, he got a vasectomy so he could fuck women (and cheat on Sunny) without getting any of them pregnant, and preserved some sperm in case there was a problem reversing the vasectomy.

Sunny's father said that if she has her ex-bf's child he would forgive her, approve of our marriage, and their family's debt (really his own) to the ex-bf's family would be paid.

Sunny coldly said that she would do this to save her family and get them back, and that her (our?) first child would be from her ex-bf via In Vitro Fertilization (IVF).

I don't have to tell you why this is already insane, but IVF doesn't always work, and sometimes you end up having a LOT more kids than you expect. Remember Octomom? Yeah, let that sink in.

**Not only would Sunny be having an abusive ex-bf's child, but this could take months and cost tens of thousands of dollars. In addition, if she had triplets, quadruplets, or more children than that from one IVF procedure, we wouldn't be able to afford future children of our own - let alone those children.**

I was sick to my stomach and couldn't believe what I was hearing. We argued back and forth until I exploded: ""WHAT THE FUCK, SUNNY?! YOU AREN'T SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THIS, ARE YOU?! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?!""

She started crying and said that this was the only way to marry me *and* get her family back.

I was fucking livid. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, but to humor her (and hopefully bring her back to reality) I asked: ""How much do you need for the first IVF procedure?"" She replied, ""I need about tree fiddy...""

It was about that time I noticed my girlfriend was about 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era. I said, ""Damnit, monster! GET OUTTA MY KITCHEN! I AIN'T GIVIN' YOU NO DAMN TREE FIDDY!""

I've been a mess ever since. Help.",12Feb2020,1
1014,"My nephew does sports and has after school practice. His mom (my sister) works late and can't pick him up so I am the one to go and fetch him. The school is about 7-10 minutes from home with about 5 minutes at a traffic light.

So, this all started around fall of 2019. I would pick him up in an SUV with him in the front passenger seat. We would talk about how practice is going, the weather, or just random chit chat. At one point, I noticed some suspicious movements in my peripheral vision. I glanced to see what was happening and quickly glanced away after noticing he was trying to covertly masturbate.

This continued on and off when  pick him up. He doesn't do it every time, but more often then anyone would be comfortable pretending isn't happening.

Does he think he is sneaky or that I'm not bright enough to realize what is happening? This week, I drove him 30 minutes to and from a haircut. This was the first time the was an audible sound. I started to hum to the radio and try really hard to keep that a blind spot. Not sure he heard it as he had earbuds in. Thought he was done, then a continuation on the way back.

How do I get him to stop without directly confronting him. I tried making conversation and turning my head often so that he thinks it isn't safe to do, but that doesn't work. I don't want to embarrass or mortify him. He is at a tender age and has hormones going crazy. Asked his mom if he does it in her car and he doesn't. He doesn't do it when his uncle (my brother) picks him up either. Help!",12Feb2020,1
1015,"So, I can talk to someone and I just, forget they have a life, memories or an existence and conscious thoughts of their own. To me they're just some entity that I interact with to gain information or work with. This sometimes passes, but I often live in this mindset without realising it. 

What is this? Sociopathy? Mental illness? Disassociation? 

It's kinda making life distant and weird, thinking and feeling no one exists apart from me and that they're all just, meat sacks that talk and help/hinder me.

Obviously I am aware they're real, or wouldn't ask this question. Yet I still don't have this real awareness of it, it only lingers on my mind, I still subconsciously see them as unreal beings. I have to consciously focus to remind myself, this person has their own existence and isn't just here to give my life flavour.",12Feb2020,1

The people that work in the Coop office are amazing, especially the program coordinator. She goes above and beyond for every student in the program in a way that's nothing short of remarkable. This includes reviewing resumes, cover letters, doing mock-interviews, and one-on-one meetings with *every single student* in the program. There are easily dozens of us. 

The rest of the office does a lot of work, too. They're constantly finding jobs for us to apply to, serving as a contact point between us and potential employers, and doing site-visits to check in on students who are currently on work terms. The whole program is run by only three people, and they're amazing. 

Anyways, I just got the job offer for my final work term, and I'd like to stop by the office later this week to give them a thank-you card and a Starbucks gift card. I'll be graduating this year with a super competitive resume, and I owe a large part of my success to them. They work hard, they deserve some coffee.

Last Friday I was invited to a party, I talked to my mom and convinced her to let me go. Seeing as this was my first high school party, I got Shit faced and threw up for at least two hours. My 18 yr old brother had to pick me up because I couldn't sleepover at my friend's house like that. It was pretty embarrassing. Of course, I got in trouble wich is reasonable, but it makes my life so much harder. I struggle to keep up with my friends and I have a hard time fitting in because Im a lesbian and a little bit of a stoner. I NEVER get in trouble though and my home situation is awkward, my mom hasn't talked to me directly for three days straight. I haven't had my phone for four days. I snuck my phone last night and saw a text from one of my friends who took me to the party (we don't see each other in school bc track ended) She thought I had been ignoring because I was mad, I tried to explain myself, but I'm worried that without my phone I can't do ""damage control"" I go to a small school and I don't want the wrong people talking about me. I'm the good kid in the family, my other siblings have done some pretty serious bad things and I'm just nervous without my phone. I understand the situation I put myself in was dumb. I also know it sounds like I just want my phone back, but I also want to fix my relationship with both my parents. My childhood wasn't terrible I wasn't horribly abused, but it definetly wasn't perfect. Last year around this time, my twin sister also got in trouble for drinking, since then it has been revealed she is a depressed opioid-addicted alcoholic. I don't want them thinking I will turn out like her. please help.

1029,"I (38F) work as a nanny for a super rich family, and have nannied for the past 15 years. 

Most of my work have revolved around being matched with one percenters via an agency, and I've turned a blind eye to a lot of stuff like drugs, abuse, shady transactions, cheating, horribly spoiled kids.

But something about this one is different, or maybe I'm just done accepting bad behavior in exchange for a six figure salary watching kids.

The family I work for has a daughter(19F) that's very angry and sullen. She's spat in my face for trying to get her to a hair appointment to get rid of her purple hair dye ( on her parent's orders) and does drugs and plays Elliot Smith all day, and is called piggy by her parents.

Her parents have gotten into screaming matches with family members over somebody walking in front of somebody else when they were out together. They've also thrown a maid out into the street for breaking her ankle while trying to protect the dog from a contraption. The wife threw a fork in my face when she decided she didn't care for the sushi served. 

This isn't all that uncommon with the families that I work for, but about three months ago they made me prepare a room for a girl who they said is 20 and a friend of their daughter who is staying there until further notice. The girl is very strange. She doesn't make eye contact with anyone and not only do I think she's not close to the daughter, but I don't think she even KNOWS the daughter. 

She carries around a blanket all the time and a stuffed animal that looks very old. When I picked the stuffed animal up to move it to the side, she started crying and hitting me. It is winter here and she doesn't seem to have a coat, but is scantily clad in designer bodysuits or sheer tank tops and barely there shorts all the time. 

The parents seem to treat her much better than their own kid, saying she's their "" friend and guest."" But she spends all her time with them, and once in the car the wife just started tickling the girl until she was begged to stop. But she doesn't seem to do much all day, and doesn't go to the college that the daughter leaves for. Their driver is my friend and he said they take her to buy clothes a lot.

I was told to keep tabs on both the daughter and the friend. The parents said that the friend wasn't allowed to use anybody's Apple Device because she had her own computer and she could not leave the house without their permission. She also got her phone taken away because they said she has anxiety from content that you'd find on a typical iPhone. One day I caught her on an iPad of one of the housekeepers and she started crying and begging me not to tell. But I would have been fired if they found out via security cameras ( which are around the staff's areas) caught her and I didn't tell so I did.

The parents ended up confronting her and later they told me she had to stay in her room for the rest of the week and just laid in bed. I keep thinking there's something very wrong but I signed an NDA that says I can't repeat anything that happens inside their house with anybody. What should I do? Should I just leave it be? Is it possible that this girl just has anxiety?",12Feb2020,1
1030,"Ok, here goes:  In freshman year I started working with a college counselor. Over time, this man, call him M, grew his company, from 2 people to 40, and as this happened he became a close friend of mine, or so I thought. After I finished my college applications and all that (this year) we decided to organize an event with my school and have a university sponsor and give out a small scholarship as the prize for the winners of the event. I was having a meeting with the activities director in my school to organize everything, but when they saw the company I was planning this with (M's company) they said: ""they are either out of the equation or the event is canceled"". I did not want this to happen because to me they didn't seem like bad people or a bad company. I asked her why it had to be like that and she told me ""I just came from a meeting with (principal and school director) and they said because they do a whole bunch of unethical stuff."" Obviously, a smart and normal person would not tell anyone about this and try to resolve it another way. But, since I am not smart or normal, I decided to TELL M WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT HIS COMPANY AND THE PERSON WHO SAID IT AND YET FORGOT TO MENTION WHO TOLD HER(i want to die). I thought we were friends and I trusted him so I thought he also wouldn't tell anyone and not throw me under the bus because that's what friends do. However, this is exactly what he did. He emailed the school director complaining about ""false claims"" that employees said about his company. The school director sent him an email saying ""these claims will be dealt with, something like this should never happen, employees should not share their opinions on a service. I will set up a meeting for you and the high school principal "". While I got the screenshot of this email, I was in a meeting with another Admin person, M told me we couldn't use my poster because ""he wants exposure for his company and his logo needs to be on it"". This started to sound fishy to me. I showed the admin person I was with the email that the school director sent M. She read the email and asked me who told me that they were unethical and who told them someone said they were unethical. My thick head decided to cover my own ass instead of telling the truth, so instead of telling her the school director told the activities director, I said it was the activities director that told me. She told me she had a meeting with the school director after this meeting and that it would probably be brought up. Since I told M what they said about his company, he can sue for defamation.   


M betrayed my trust and made me throw one of my favorite teachers under the bus. I don't think he'll due but there's always that possibility.

New to this thread and wanted to give it a shot. At the moment, I am staying at my family's place and going to my local university. I previously was a collegiate soccer player, but I was not too fond of it, and I was extremely depressed at the time. I am a lot better now since I am home and have a great support system around me.

Going back to my past university, I was also apart of the esports team. I am a pretty well-known player in the video game Counter-Strike Global Offensive. I play it very often (Ranks: ESEA-A; Faceit- Level 10, around 1500 US, about 2000 world; MM- Global). With the rapidly growing field of esports, I have an opportunity to represent another university.

Unfortunately, this university is not close to home, and I have many pros and cons of the situation.

Pros: Once in a lifetime experience, potential career, new experiences

Cons: Hate the thought of moving again, thinking I'll fall into that depression, currently hating the state of the game at the moment

I am capable of living on my own and of getting back into falling love with the game. I fear the thought of being sad again from my previous experience, but I would love a fresh start. Very unsure of what to do and would appreciate everyone's advice.",12Feb2020,1
1033,"So my boyfriends friend is living on our couch and has been for the past 7 months!!! And that not including the times he stayed with us on and off at our old place! Which back than was fine he’d sleep, eat dinner with us and be gone by morning. And it wasn’t an every day thing!!! 

Anyways he’s been living with us I was fine with it for the first 4 months, now I’m over it and have been completely. One the couch he sleeps(which is tan) our only couch is smelly and stained, I tried using baking soda on it scrubbing it. He keeps his dirty and clean clothes on the side of the couch with his blanket and pillow shoved in the pile. He smells and I understand he’s dirty and works (finally) he’s a welder but I just can’t. He was jobless for the longest period of time. He’s had multiple jobs and lost them in the time of staying with us, and hopefully he keeps this good welding job.  He gave us $400 for Christmas which was nice and appreciated, but thats it.. he uses are water, eats our food, using our toilet paper laundry detergent and I’m sounding like a bitch rn but that stuff adds up!! We have my bfs daughter to take care of rent to pay utilities to pay and we have a baby on the way. I went from a low paying job where my bf was  taking care of most of the bills and Id help as much as possible and I hated the fact he would not ask his friend to help out. His friend dose change the garbage and so the dishes sometimes. But hasn’t been helping much at all. I make dinner almost every night and always make enough for him to eat and he eats a lot.  If we go get fast food or take out we always get him something. Idk about you but it feels like We’re both taking care of a child who’s older than us. I’m 21 btw he’s only 23 but still. He had a welding degree, I understand he went through addiction and my bf wanted to him the friend he is but enough is enough. He’s been living where we live for 1 year and a half and had not had his own place he’s been hopping around friends couches and finally settled on our couch here. I want my privacy back I want to be able to hangout in the living room and stop feeling weird I only go in there when my bfs home or I’ll hide in my room. I want to not feel weird having sex in my own home. I want privacy. We have tell June tell our lease is up and we move to a bigger place and he’s not coming with. But I want him out sooner, he’s to comfortable I don’t like him using my stuff because he thinks he can or taking change out of our change jar that  we’re saving up for moving. It’s the most littlest things that annoy me the most. My boyfriend he is finally starting to get annoyed after me complaining about him and getting into fights with my bf about it for the past 3 months.  He finally see that he taking advantage of the help he’s giving along with myself. He had not showed any improvement. And I want him gone. My boyfriend said he was gonna talk to him last week and hasn’t, idk if he’s scared but he’s avoiding it. I want him gone ASAP Am I wrong for this???

1035,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/f1x1ub/i_think_my_friend_is_cutting_himself/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share &lt;- original post on my main account. My friend is cutting himself and making jokes about it. He also asked me what I would think if he killed himself. He has depression and he is 12m . I am 13m and I want him to stop. I saw his arm today at lunch and and I freaked out. I put on my serious face and told him not to do that anymore and call me on discord if he needs anything. He doesn't want me to tell anybody but I need to break that promise on reddit for his well being. He is taking anti depressants and I believe he is suicidal. He also asked me what I would think if he killed himself but purely hypothetically. If he is all of a sudden really happy I will know to keep him in my sight as long as possible.,12Feb2020,1
1036,"Hi, I could really use some opinions and or advice, so please help. Thank you.


The letter says ""Hi. I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now. I just can't seem to get the words out though. I'm too shy, so this is the best I can do. I think you're really cool, and I seriously appreciate how kind and helpful you are. I was wondering if we could maybe talk more, and get to know each other. If you're not interested in that, then I'm sorry for being so awkward and please just ignore this. Anyways, thank you for reading this, and I hope to hear from you."". I also put my phone number below it.


So, does this sound stupid? or weird? Should I change anything? Would you want to recieve something like this?

Thank you :)",12Feb2020,1

1040,"There is this guy I really really like. We have been talking a lot. I would not consider us an official 
couple but there been flirty moments and we have a date planned for this Saturday. However, if things keep progressing the way 
they are after the date, I was thinking of confessing to him while using the lyrics to Hannah Montana’s, ”One in Million”

Like I was thinking I could hit him up with a, “hey. How are you?” and when he says, “good and you?” I would respond with, “Oh nothing, it’s just.... I Thought the chances to meet somebody like you were a million to one. I cannot believe it!” And piecemeal lyrics the lyrics around his responses.

Of course, I won’t use ALL the lyrics either. Like I think it’s too soon to say he’s the one and he hasn’t done anything to make me mad yet.",12Feb2020,1
1041,"Hi,

I recently got adobe stock to use the free 10 images and got a standard license for an image of a snake I want to use.

I have edited the image from the original and am wondering if this is OK to put on a t shirt I intend to sell on my website.

Thanks.",12Feb2020,1
1042,Facebook is asking for my phone number but i don’t have a line. Is this a bit to intrusive? Why do they need my phone number when all i want to do is make a facebook account?,12Feb2020,1
1043,"I was hitting the gym and flirting with some girl for a while, and we got pretty close. Started teasing, sending dirty pics, etc.

Last night she said she didn’t have any Valentine’s Day plans and I told her we should go to the city and hit some bars. She asked if I wanted to get a hotel and I agreed. I bought it for the night ($245), and we talked all last night about all the things we wanted to do to each other.

Well, today rolls around and she asks if I want to hit the gym later on at night. I agree, and we confirm. Two hours later, she says that she doesn’t want to get the hotel anymore and sending the dirty pics and everything was a mistake and that she wants her personal life to be separate from people at the gym.

I was pretty pissed off and just said “should’ve thought about it before I bought the hotel.” She just brushed it off and said that I could always take some other girl.

Valentine’s Day is in two f***ing days and I have a booked hotel room with absolutely no one to go with. The whole thing took a huge shot at my self esteem and I don’t know what to do. I could just go by myself but I feel as if that would be so boring and lame.

Any advice?",12Feb2020,1
