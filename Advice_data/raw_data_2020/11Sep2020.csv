0,This girl’s friends are staring at me and I don’t know why. This girl is my ex but over the summer(2019) not sure what happened but she started liking me again and haven’t seen her since the beginning of quarantine and this beginning of the school year her friends stare at me and idk why and some of her other friends who I’m closer with are bringing her up. Does she still like me? What happened? Why do they stare at me?,11Sep2020,1
1,"I’m noticing some disordered eating behavior in a good friend, she talks a lot about “forgetting to eat” for days at a time or how an apple with peanut butter will fill her up all day. She says little comments like this to my friend group a lot (this has been going on for months now) and whenever we express concern, she laughs and brushes it off. Another friend in the group dealt with an eating disorder in the past and so I also feel that this is probably all really triggering for her. So I think it’s important to intervene somehow, but I want to do and say the right things without making my other friend feel attacked/called out. Any advice?",11Sep2020,1
2,"I live in a place where people don't take the c-virus very seriously. My friend had had it for a while a the time. I woke up early one day to a message from my girlfriend of 4 years it was sent at 3 AM and basically said that she was tired of being with me and that she wanted to split up. She never said a reason or anything. 

I spent all day trying to figure out what I did wrong and it ate me up so bad, worst feeling I have ever felt. Later that day I got a dm from a smash discord that me and my friend were both active in saying they saw he had passed away on the news. I checked and they were right. He died at 17. 


At this point this was probably the worst day of my entire life. I lost 2 people extremely close to me and I couldn't handle it. I grieved my friend as I always grieved deaths and I came to accept it really quickly. But there is one big problem. Whenever I hear about the virus I am reminded that I lost a friend and my girlfriend in the same day.

I get hit with grief and then just a deep feeling of sorrow and self-doubt, been losing way too much sleep over this (literally) and I would love if anyone has any advice on how to sort out my feelings. Thanks.",11Sep2020,1
3,"Post says it all, my roommate is trashing my house &amp; idk how to approach her about it. She’s flat out denied not leaving her literal shit in the toilet to which I had to clean. Getting idk what al over my white kitchen cabinets, not helping with taking the communal trash out, being loud as fuck at night at all hours knowing I have work early in the morning (up at 6, in at 0730), not cleaning up when she’s done cooking, leaving her dishes in the sink. I’ve casually mentioned it a few times and it’s driving me fucking crazy.",11Sep2020,1
4,"I hate myself, my life, I have no friends because I feel unworthy and I isolated myself. Nobody ever told me I did a good job despite my efforts and starting from elementary school I have horrible memories of school and university. Failure is a constant in my life. I tried everything, but I always fail and nobody is proud of me. I am ashamed of myself and I just want to hide. I don't know what I have been doing wrong. I just know it's all my fault for sure. And it won't change.

I have no money for professional help and honestly what the hell am I supposed to do? I just feel a lost cause to throw away. I am not strong enough to talk about what happened from the beginning to a stranger. It hurts to remember. Also, I'd feel bad being listened by a psychologist only because I gave them money and not because they are actually interested. They are strangers with my money, why should I open up? They will tell me everything I want for money, I fear I won't believe them. Not for me, even if I could afford it.

I don't know where to seek for help.
Have a good day.",11Sep2020,1

6,"Hello everyone, I'm so nervous to finally work up the courage to be able to ask for advice about this.
I'm (26f) currently dating a guy (28) and we have been on and off for the last 5 years, at first I was head over heals for him and we had a great time and was genuinely happy then we started arguing a lot and I know this happens in every relationship and he is a great guy but there was this day where we started arguing and he started yelling at me and was driving so he was speeding and I'm very anxious so that scene was stuck in my head so everytime we would start discussing something and he gets stubborn I get very scared and stop talking just so he wouldn't get angry, and that kind of what started it for me like that's how I started losing feelings I guess but after therapy I worked up the courage and I talked to him about it and he apologized and never did it again but I never felt the same about him but he was trying so hard I felt bad for losing feelings but it just kept on getting worse as time went by, because as I said earlier we were on and off for 5 years and it was because I broke up with him 3 times and every time I'd tell him I'm sorry I no longer am in love with you and I can't be with you I tried my best but I can't seem to love you, but every time he would contact me again and we would ask how we are doing but it goes back to us talking daily and we get back together cause he says he still loves me and wants me back and I feel bad for him.
But a few weeks ago he was talking about marriage and how he was thinking its about time we got engaged and when I said it's not the right time for me he got mad at me and said that he was disappointed in my reaction.
But I was freaking out and had an anxiety attack afterwards cause I don't think I love him at at least I don't love him as much as he does and I don't want to break his heart but I don't want to get married either
I'm very sorry it's long

7,"I want to be with this person because I love the idea of a life with them.. we work very well together and we have a wonderful community together. When I say we work well, I mean that we can build things with wood together, we’ve been restoring furniture and reselling... it’s great.. 
but sometimes everything seems very surface level. I am a very emotional person and need to share &amp; dig deep emotionally with someone. It fills my heart &amp; I definitely need it. It has caused me to be nervous about bringing up deep conversation. Sometimes it’s easier and sometimes it’s really difficult to handle. I feel like I’m not getting any emotion sometimes. Times that it feels most difficult is when they are just very busy and stressed. How do I become okay with this??
I wish I could care less about needing this sort of intimate communication with them. We do have it sometimes but very rarely. 
TL:DR - Life would be very enjoyable and easy with this person, but emotionally I’m not getting what I need.

8,"I (22f) have been struggling for years with comparing myself to other women around my age or a little younger. Under 18 and over 40 I see them as either little sisters I need to protect or guiding figures that I can learn and aspire to be like. Anything in between is fair game to my self esteem, making me feel like shit any chance it can get. Any woman walking down the street who gas better legs than me, thinner than me, beautiful eyes, adorable voice etc. Literally anything. Celebrities, models, and influencers take a toll on me on a daily basis. 

Recently I haven't been the most ""sexually confident"" so my finacé (22m) tried in unconventional ways to make me feel better. Bless his soul because I understood the intention but the aftermath has ruined me for the time being.  

He showed me some subreddits he uses for a ""quick nut"" (his words not mine) and pointed out all of the things and other women that ""reminded him of me"" but obviously that didn't go as intended. I understand why he did that, to show that ""hey I find all types of women attractive and you are just as attractive as them"". It worked for like a day, then the shit show that is my brain began to take control of the sweet narrative my fiancé had attempted to create.  

Now that I know the subreddits I scroll through them obsessively, planning sad and excessive ""what-if"" surgeries I could get to look like her or have her boobs/face/body. Spiraling to a point where my past ednos behavior may rear its ugly head and consume everything.  I cannot stop and I am ashamed. 

I am so weak and afraid. I don't understand the concept of being confident and loving yourself when so many people are better than you. I want to actually like myself and not cry when I look in the mirror. I want to be the best wife I could be but all of my self doubt makes me want to curl up and die.",11Sep2020,1
9,"I went into my local Bellco credit Union last week. I had an appointment to put money in my Roth IRA. To make a long story short. He never gave me my Driver’s License back. We were having a decent conversation so I guess that’s how I walked out without it. It wasn’t until I got home that it popped into my head that he didn’t do the usual banker thing and say “hey here’s your license back” and hand me my license. It was past their closing time by that time. Customer service couldn’t get me in contact with a real person. I work so I thought I’d go in on my next off day. A week from that day. Today is my off day. I went in made a deposit at the atm and then spoke with the teller about what had happened. She went to the back to check. She came back empty handed. I felt like ripping her head off in that moment. Only because I am 100% certain that I didn’t get my license back the last time I was in there. She asked if he had called me. He had not. She said they are only allowed to hold them for so long. Could he have turned it in and then they threw it away? I mean, I’d be relieved knowing that. I searched online it said call the police and file a report with them. It also said call the dmv. I’ve been trying to call the dmv as I write this but, they have me wait 10 minutes, pick up the line and then hang up. Should I put a freeze on my credit. I have the feeling I should try to call him personally and tell him that I’ve lost it and if he’s seen it. Then when he says “no I haven’t sorry.” tell him “it’s ok don’t worry, I’m going to file a police report and that might spook him into not doing anything with it.” One last thing. He was in the bank today at the front kiosk. He was helping a customer so I was unable to walk up and talk with him. Per bank rules due to COVID. I thought it was odd he wouldn’t look at me or say hi. We are not strangers and have had a good relationship in the past. I tried waiting for him to be done but he was taking soooo long with this guy. While I waited the teller walked all the way from around her desk and came directly up to me and asked me what I needed. I told her he never gave me my license back. That’s the moment she went to the back to check. Weird right? Help me please! I’m only 19 and scared he might do something shady like open accounts in my name. Or ruin my credit that I just started a month ago! All support helps! Thanks guys.",11Sep2020,1

On a number of occasions I've almost -almost- said ""Hey"" but my fears always get the best of me. I don't have you're atypical social anxiety, for the most part I'm rather outgoing. In this particular instance though I've convinced myself shes too young or I'm completely misinterpreting signals.

14,"Just seeing peopel talk about how you get ‘life tired’ at the age of ~30 seems depressing to me, currently, I live a very unhealthy  life by barely sleeping and sometimes even skipping it.

I can easily only sleep for 3/4 hours and function fully, for like, ever.

And I love this perk about me, sometimes I do get tired but my motivation is overflooding the tiredness keeping me awake.

This also happens with games, I am not a typical gamer and almost never play a ‘normal’ game,  but a survival game, I can spend alot of time in not because i’m addicted but because it’s basically ‘necessary’
It’s practically second life, so if I play that I also sometimes doesn’t sleep so I can just play that and then when time comes do other stuff.

I will ONLY get very sleepy if I (no matter what situation) put my body in rest position, but as long as i’m outside I can be very well be productive and even go to the end of day 2 with no sleep!

All of this aside tho, I am kinda sad (I wanna say depressed but i’m not, just very very negative mindset) for the ‘life’ later, like the tegular 9-5 jobs just makes me wanna not live for that time period, that’ why I try stuff now, I try to work on my own game, perhaps go into 3d modeling to freelance or whatever, i’m willing to do EVERYTHING i can to ensure that I get paid by value, not time.

But one thing that slightly tingles my head is this ‘tired’ thing, will it come to me also? If I grow old, will I not he able to skip a day of sleep and function the next day with lack of sleep?

Because honestly this is the only reason that I keep on going, because One day I was abnormally excited to add a feature to my day and I couldn’t sleep, I literally couldn’t I waated 20-40 minutes in bed just thinking about that one feature and then i stood up and did it, It may sound weird but I like this and i’m very scared that this will become impossible in the near future, will it?",11Sep2020,1

But internally and the care that we need to give ourselves I don’t have and I literally hate it so much. I will look at pictures of myself sometimes and think (without coming off conceited) “Look at me, I’m beautiful. I have a kind soul, I have such a good heart. Why do I not nurture myself?

I’m not the easiest person but I try to do good for him. He just doesn’t see it. I’ve been through sexual, emotional, and physical abuse. He knows this.

He didn’t. I found out because she called him the next day. He got mad at me for getting upset about it. Told me I’m crazy and jealous. Anything that he knows hurts me he uses it against me in an argument. He never tried to fix what’s hurting. He’d always blame me. He even made me start believing I am that bad. I’m heartbroken that he broke up with me and he doesn’t care. Before we broke up he started doing online school with his child. Which is completely understandable.

27,"I work for a very small staffing office in CA (employed Jan 2019). I am the newest employee and everyone else (4 others) has been there a minimum of 13 years. Since March we have been working remotely with no talk of returning to the office soon. I became pregnant in July and am currently 11 weeks. I haven’t let my boss know yet that I’m
pregnant. I have a lot of concerns around this and really need advice on how to best approach the following:

1. I’m not totally aware of our leave policy. I don’t have an HR guide; our company is so small that everything is directly discussed with my boss. I know for certain my employer does not provide maternity leave. I have no idea what the disability policy looks like. 
2. I also need to inquire about insurance for baby. My employer provides 100% health insurance for me, but will not cover spouses. I have a colleague who has been at the company for over a decade with two daughters (12 and 14); one of them was having health issues last year and my boss added her daughter as a dependent to the policy. Because her daughter wasn’t added before / a long time ago, it makes me question whether she would add my baby to the policy. 
3. As I mentioned, I am in CA and the air quality has been so bad where I am that I haven’t left the inside of my house in the past 3+ weeks, with the exception of two doctor’s appointments and one or two days when it was moderate enough to take a short walk. I’m extremely worried and concerned about the long term effects on baby (risk of premature birth being major, but also learning disabilities) and am seriously considering flying to the East cost for a few weeks to stay with my mom and dad. I really believe that it will be better for my overall health and baby’s well being. I understand the risks around flying and Covid, but honestly cannot believe that constant exposure to wildfire smoke is less risky. Even with a HEPA air purifier my throat has been raspy and I’ve been getting frequent headaches because of the air quality here. I realize the time difference complicates things but I’m confident I could make it work. My husband and I are also toying with the idea of moving back East eventually and I feel this could be a way to prove I can do it.

I really need advice on how to bring all of this (announcing pregnancy, inquiring about leave and insurance, and potentially asking to work in a different time zone) up to my employer. I have a lot of anxiety around even scheduling a call - she has been MIA a lot due to her own personal family issues. We never talk over the phone, just exchange emails. If we are face to face it’s on a video call with my coworkers. I’m worried about broaching these subjects and how to do so without overwhelming her. I’m also worried that because our company is so small that she and my coworkers will see this as a negative because of the workload they’ll take on while I’m out. 

Please, I’d love to hear thoughts on this. I have no one to talk to really because my husband and I haven’t told anyone yet about our pregnancy.",11Sep2020,1

His parents and youngest brother (M15) have always been super welcoming and polite towards me- making nice meals, buying the wine I like, buying me birthday/Christmas presents etc. However my BF's mom is ""jealous"" of me for taking up so much of my BF's time.  My BF works late, his mom works early, when he comes home she's often in bed, when she leaves in the morning he's still in bed. My BF works 5 days a week, so he will visit me or I'll visit him (long distance at the minute) on his 2 days off. This is usually the weekend when she is also free. She complains to him that he prioritises me. She complained last summer that we were too flirty during dinner/while watching TV with them (we would never kiss or cuddle but she hated how we would look into each others eyes). A few months later she got concerned that we weren't affectionate *enough* when she noticed we didn't always hold hands like a  20 year couple should (??). I feel judged. 

She treats my BF like the scapegoat because he's the oldest and his 17 year old brother has Aspergers and is horrible to his family.

They were on a trip and asked the youngest brother *to text if we were in there* and the kid did and his dad texted my BF to tell us to go downstairs?!

 I had tried making friends with an introverted girl before and lemme tell ya it was HARD I tried giving conversation prompting questions like 'If you could make a company, what kind would it be?' but her answers were honestly basic and I didn't know how to continue on the conversation. So, I tried bringing her into my friend group but she was very quiet and even though i did try to include her it basically didn't work.

There's a guy in my school that tbh is overweight and doesn't really have friends but I am getting a nice vibe from him. He seems like a very good friend but he is, like her, an introvert.

Introverts, how do I make friends with people like you?",11Sep2020,1

for the past couple of years my stepdad has been by far the biggest piece of shit i know. i want my mom to throw him out so bad but will not listen to me. he verbally and mentally abuses both me and my mom. she sees nothing wrong with this.

just now we got in an argument because i plugged my Ethernet cable into the router. yesterday my school had a snow day because well we had close to 6'' of snow on the ground. guess what i did all day? nothing because i literally couldn't go out and do anything. this pissed my step dad off a lot and said that im real ungrateful and lazy. i am 14, have a job where i work every day i get off and maintain good grades in school. he literally sits around all day and goes to his friends house wich he calls work. il give him the benefit of the doubt that he may actually do some work but still.

hes a 50 something year old man and does not pay rent or do anything around the house. im the only one who will do any cleaning here. not to mention that my mom is struggling with money right now, shes getting paid way less than whats shes used to and she only has enough money to pay rent and get groceries. my step dad does not help out at all with this. he has the gaul to call me lazy but hes a grown ass man who cant even be botherd to help with the household. they're not even married, just boyfriend and girlfriend.

i few years ago i wanted to kill myself and when my step dad found out about it he said that people who are suicidal hurry up and get done with it, and they cut on top of their veins and not anywhere else. this entire time he told my mom that i was just full of bs.

im done putting up with his bullshit. i asked him what i did wrong to him and he literally said ""nothing"" hes treating me like shit and he himself said he doesn't have a reason in the first place. when he yells at me now i stand my ground and when i do my mom then chimes in saying to not cop an attitude. he keeps going on and on about how im just a child and need to respect and listen to him. first of all im not respecting you just because your older. respect goes both ways and he has not given me a single reason in the past 5 or so years on why i should do that. and just because im a child doesn't mean i do not have any say in anything. im not just some slave or a robot who you command, im a fucking human.

i think that the only thing that might get across to my mom is if he hit me. i want to maybe provoke him to hit me just so my mom may tell him to fuck off. this would defenetly be wrong of me but i am so done at this point. im tired of the way he treats me and my mom especially.

i want him out but my mom will not listen to me. i want to do this myself now because i want my mom and myself to be happy. i really am worried for her, shes visibly unhappy and miserable and i dont even think she realizes it. i dont see why she puts up with his shit, i want this to end what do i do?",11Sep2020,1
35,"TL;DR: I need to cancel plans for an apartment night this weekend but if I don't go, the price will increase drastically for everyone else. What should I do?

I need to cancel plans and would love some helpful input. I agreed to go out tonight for someone's birthday, and these plans were made a while ago. A couple of days ago I was asked to go out Saturday as well and contribute funds for an apartment in the city for that night. 

Now I am severely regretting my decision as I am behind on university work and desperately need this weekend to catch up. Plus I'm really not keen on drinking two nights in a row.

My issue is the apartment is already booked and I have not paid yet. If I pull out now the price will go up drastically and I will be a focal point of hatred for the group. I feel as if my only option here is to say sorry that I'm not coming and pay the $50 as compensation. However, I really am not in a financial position to just 'throw away' $50 like that, but I don't see a way around it.

Side note: One of my friends dropped out of the plan earlier as well, making the price go up once already. I feel slightly scammed if I have to pay to not go while he doesn't have to spend any money at all and gets off scot-free. Idk.

I would greatly appreciate any suggestions, thank you.",11Sep2020,1
36,"I'm 22. I've seen therapists and counselors of different types for more than half my life. the mental health stuff got ""serious"" (i.e. overtly self-destructive) when I was 14, and has taken many different forms over the years. these are my experiences chronologically, starting when I was a child: 

1. diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive) with signs &amp; symptoms of autism but no diagnosis. 
2. major depressive episode (acute, not chronic) involving self-harm. 
3. hospitalization with anorexia nervosa. 
4. panic disorder, generalized anxiety, social anxiety. 
5. an intense relapse with anorexia. 
6. PTSD. 
7. restrictive bulimia, following ""recovery"" #2. 
8. binge eating disorder, return of panic attacks.

I won't go into the thoughts I've been having because it might trigger people, but it's getting dark in there. I feel like I'm simultaneously imploding and jumping out of my skin. 

I'm currently sitting at home, can't really breathe, I'm shaking and in the middle of a panic attack which is kinda coming in waves. I have to leave for work in like five minutes which seems impossible, or else call in, which also seems impossible. it's the second time this has happened with just this one job, which I've only had for a few months. I can't go on like this. it's ruining my life. 

should I just admit myself now? do I call 911? am I less likely to lose my job if there's proof that this is the emergency that it is? do I just need to suck it up and go to work, does everyone feel this way? am I just another Gen Z snowflake with too many diagnoses?

37,"I 20f) have been with my boyfriend (20m)for about 4 years. About a year ago, I noticed we lost the best friend emoji on Snapchat (meaning you are each other’s best friend). I jokingly asked him about it and he acted a little strange and defensive. After a big argument, he finally admitted he was Snapchatting a girl at our university who was flirting with him before. He says the only snap chatted about class and about a mutual friend once or twice. I didn’t really believe that because it takes constant snapping to become a number one friend but I got over it. A week ago, I noticed that the same girl from before had the emoji meaning you have a mutual number one best friend. I asked it about it, and he had a similar excuse. This time he said a friend snapped her on his phone. This seemed like a lie. I asked to see his phone, he refused. He called me toxic and controlling and he was proving a point by not showing me. He was very mad at me for “accusing him”. We made up, and he keeps insisting that he only loves me and only wants me, but the paranoia keeps lingering. I don’t know if I should move on and trust him, or if my suspicions were correct. I don’t want to be that girlfriend who’s constantly jealous and controlling, but the worries are really getting to me. Do you think my suspicions are correct and what should I do ?",11Sep2020,1

39,"My only &amp; best friend in NYC was also my roommate, so as you can imagine she has been through a lot with me and my bipolar disorder. My last manic episode, I said a lot of terrible things to her. She decided to move out but said she wants to continue our friendship. I came to California to be with my family while I’m getting stable and figuring out my next steps. 

When I first left, we talked the same amount. Texting all day everyday. It felt normal, but throughout the month since, things feel awkward for me. Super different and dry. We don’t laugh or tell jokes. We don’t talk about everything. It’s honestly not fun for me. She was supposed to come and visit me in California 2 weeks from now, but cancelled her trip due to work. I don’t really believe it honestly. She has so many trips coming up, but this is the only one that has to be canceled? I replied to the text saying I was super disappointed. She asked me to call her and I didn’t. I did not reply and still haven’t. 

I don’t have the right to be hurt but I am. I’m so
Done who’s like...why even continue being friends if it’s going to feel forced and uncomfortable. I was prepared to have to rebuild but it doesn’t seem like that’s gonna happen, especially since she canceled her trip. 

Should I just give up on being friends? Is that the best thing for her? Can people actually still love you after a manic episode where you shit all over them? I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to fix this or if I can. We were like sisters, and now it’s like..I feel like a new friend she wishes to shake off. I don’t know what to do. 

Do I let our friendship go? Do I try to discuss things? Do I tell her why I didn’t reply ? I don’t know what to do.

40,"I’m slightly freaking out. So I had my dad here tonight and we were watching a film. We’re in the UK which feels relevant. At 11pm there’s a knock on the door. I’m a young woman so I’d usually ignore this as it’s so late, but my dad checks it out and sees it’s a police officer. He says there’s been a serious assault outside our house and wondered if we saw anything. I asked what kind of assault and he said a stabbing. I told him we were watching a noisy film so didn’t hear anything, at which point my dad turns to me and says “well, I did hear some shouting about half an hour ago, but I didn’t think anything of it”. He asked for his name and wrote it down and said thank you, “even that is helpful because the stories aren’t adding up.” At this point I look across the street and I see the police are surrounding and questioning a young male who’s staring straight at us. Suddenly I realise this could be the suspect, so I immediately starting shaking my head and loudly saying “no sorry we didn’t see anything”. The officer thanked us and we closed the door and came back inside. 

I live in a city where gang crime and knife crime are pretty rife, and I know that the kind of people involved with this stuff hate nothing more than a snitch. And even though we didn’t, the fact we weren’t even stood there talking to this officer for a minute and he wrote stuff down could have been perceived that way by someone watching. As the night goes on my dad peers out of the curtains few times which may or may not have been seen by the “suspect” who is sat on the wall opposite our house for about 2 hours. He wasn’t handcuffed but was sat there with a police man and after the initial questioning and some paper work he was completely ignored by them for about an hour and a half but clearly wasn’t free to leave yet. He was sat there facing our house the whole time. Eventually I heard an officer say the crime scene was closed into their radio, and I saw this guy be let free to walk away. I honestly don’t know if he was a witness or suspect but the way he was being treated seemed more like a suspect, he wasn’t sitting there texting or looking at his phone or anything, no one was talking to him, and he just said there looking bored and unhappy but he wasn’t handcuffed and was let free in the end. Now I can’t help but worry that if this person did stab someone, basically attempting murder/being ok with the fact that’s they could’ve killed them (no idea if they did), then they’re not the kind of person I want thinking I might’ve snitched or curtain twitched at them in any way. I’m pretty worried about it and I wondered if anyone here who knows more about these kinds of cases might be able to tell me if it sounds like he was the bad guy (but maybe no evidence?), or whether it’s likely I’m in any kind of danger now.

(Not sure if trigger warnings are a thing on Reddit)

Hi, I never really thought my family would end up in a situation like this, but I really need advice on how to deal with it.

ALSO: I'm so sorry for this long block of text, thank you for reading it if you do.

My sister just turned 18 this year and started smoking weed when she was around 14. We've always known she's smoked and I knew that she sometimes did shrooms and we got used to that. I never liked it, obviously, but my mom was never fully able to convince her to stop even when she was a minor. Now that she's an adult she's changed a lot. She met a guy (he's 25 by the way) and they seemed happy. I never liked their age difference but there wasn't anything I could do. After dating for a month she started staying at his house and for the last few months she hasn't slept at home and only came home every few days for like 5 minutes to grab clothes and stuff. 

Anyways, today one of my neighbors, let's call her Riley, knocked on the door and looked like she was about to cry. Riley has been best friends with my sister for years and is in my sister's friend group. She came over to tell us that my sister had overdosed on Xanax and molly about two weeks ago and that she couldn't hide it from us anymore. She told us that when my sister has been showing up to work, Riley and my sister work at the same place, she would be hungover or worse and would really worry Riley. Riley has been to rehab on her own when she was in high school so she knows that what my sister is doing is scarily unhealthy.

Riley also told us that my sister's boyfriend had sexually assaulted her (Riley) and that even though my sister knew, she still continued to date him. Apparently my sister slapped her boyfriend and yelled at him for a bit and thought that was enough for literally assaulting her best friend.

I don't know what to do. My sister has always been the aggressive type when being confronted and would probably never go into rehab on her own. I really don't know how to approach this since she's a legal adult now.",11Sep2020,1

I want to tell her how  I feel but at the same time I know that even if things do work out for me the Logistics of the relationship would be pretty complicated. Currently we live in the same state (Only temperately however as im in the military and only here for a year for training purposes) and she lives roughly two hours away, and due to Covid I can rarely go up that far to see her to begin with due to restrictions on how far im allowed to go. But lets say that I get leave approved to go see her (It has happend before, but I only have 30 days of leave a year) she works every weekend and I work every weekday. Then maybe face time? That might work out but due to her classes and how much she has to do every day I would hate for her to be distracted talking to be rather than focusing on whats on hand. And then lets say that I still go for it but things go sour, I love our relationship as it is now and to even think about ruining anything between us is a hard pill to swallow. I really Like this girl, and I would do anything to keep her in my life but every aspect of dating her just seems like a terrible Idea. Yet even with all those reasons, I still have romantic feelings for her and I hate it. I truly tried to move on yet every time I talk to her it feels euphoric.

60,"Do you believe it is worth committing to a relationship if there are parts of your partner’s past actions which misalign with your core values?

Core values can be lots of things. Value in Religion, value on mental health, value on sex, values which matter to people.

Everything can be going so well yet this piece of who you are, who you think you are, is so out of alignment with how your partner behaved. 

Is it rational to let one area of someone’s value system dictate your relationship as you move forward, growing together and intertwining your core values?

As a secondary question.... what makes you decide to move on from your relationships?

     TL;DR: My question is not so much about what my partner did but whether you kind people have advice or anecdotes about people you’ve met with similar values, dreams, and interests that had one major value system out of tune. Was that disastrous or manageable?

61,"So I’ve (16F) liked jeremy (16M) for a while now- since about January of this year. I go to church with him &amp; would see him around 2x a week before COVID. I liked him &amp; my sister knew this. Now she likes a guy named Ian - who likes her back. They talk a lot and it came up that jeremy likes me. Not exactly saying it but it was heavily implied. Ex: when asked who he liked he said me, that he likes being in my presence. (Keep in mind I’ve been in the same church with jeremy for about 3 years, and we’re good as far as church friends go, sometimes going on walks/ bike rides in the same group)

Anyways we both turned 16 in July (that being the age at which we can start dating) and he asked me on a date a week ago. I was ecstatic of course, but also very nervous as it was my first date. We went bowling and it was a double date with Gavin (Ian’s older brother whom jeremy and I were both friends with) and his date. It was a bit awkward but overall it went well. I got no vibes from him that said he didn’t like it so I thought it went well. 

Now, I was told a day or two later by my sister (anytime I’m told something by her it means she heard it from Ian who heard it from jeremy) told me that jeremy was also nervous about the date. This made me happy, because to me it meant he wanted to go as well/ was another indication he liked me. 

Here’s the big part. It’s now a week later and I was talking with me sister when she brought something up. She told me she didn’t want to tell me but she ended up spilling it. Apparently I was “plan B” as jeremy originally wanted to ask a friend but she said no/ couldn’t. Not gonna lie it kinda hurts me to know I wasn’t a first choice. My sister upon hearing this asked if jeremy still liked me, Ian said yes that he did. I’m kinda confused? 

If you need more info please ask and I’ll try to explain the best I can. Does this mean he doesn’t like me/ he likes his friend? Or am I overthinking things? Should I stop liking him if he does like his friend? Thank you in advance. (Please tell me if this is the wrong place to post, as I am fairly new to reddit)",11Sep2020,1

64,"I’m a very hard-working employee at every job I’ve ever worked at. I’m 26. I started working at a grocery store when I was 15 and worked my way up to manager by the time I was eighteen. I worked there until 21. I found out specifically 2 of my co workers got raises and promotions because they had children to take care of while I was there. People who were fairly reliable, but  pretty mediocre. They started after me and got paid more than me. They personally told me they thought they got raises because they had kids. Everyone else saw it as a kind gesture from the boss. I didn’t mention the fact that I literally had the same job as them, worked there longer and they made $5/hr more than me. 

And when I say I’m a hard and reliable worker, I mean like, when I worked there I did shit like show up ON TIME in my little Pontiac (once, having to be pulled) through 2 fucking blizzards on separate occasions over the years. One of the only people to do so. But because I didn’t have children, stuff like that was almost expected of me rather than rewarded or noticed. 

Same thing when I was a server. Other people could call in all the time with the excuse of their children being sick, but I could literally be dying and they would not allow a call-in. 

I finally decided to go back to school for nursing. I work at a hospital as a tech rn. Same thing. I know people who get out of shut all the time because of excuses involving their children, but for instance, I’m technically balancing 4 calendars rn: regular school calendar, work calendar, clinical calendar, personal calendar. I fucked up on my work schedule and theyre like “sorry, tough luck. Find someone to cover you.” But I know someone who did the same, but said they had extracurricular things to take their children to, and Voila. They’re scot-free. 

This just accompanies all the weird looks I get anyways when I tell people I have no children. 

I’ve chosen not to have children thus far because I wanted to wait until I was in a decent place in life. A better me, a better financial situation. But I feel like, it doesn’t matter because of you don’t have kids, society expects you to work more often, harder, and for less money. Is this a real thing or am I overreacting?",11Sep2020,1
65,"I'm currently living with a relative and working at their small business. I get paid every two weeks and by my calculations, I was only getting paid around $10.50/hour. Where I live, that is a couple dollars short of minimum wage. I want to bring this up, but I'm afraid that they will fire me or even kick me out of the house. They have expressed their disinterest in me asking when is payday and anything to do with money. It's making me really paranoid.

66,"So alittle background I dont come from a great family so I've never really had parents growing up. This older gentlemen let's say his name is Gary. Gary took me under his wing and helps me out we have a apartment together. Anyway so Gary was going to a birthday get together with one of his friends. Gary has always been on time he said he would be about an hour and he will be home for dinner. So I start making dinner it's about 10min before he will get back home. One hour turns into 2 then 2 then 3 then 4. I'm starting to get a little worried, he hasn't called and hes NEVER been late. I am a female and his friends think really strangely about me which I guess is understandable but nothing I can do about it. I found out he left his phone at home so my thought was I'd call his friend let's say his name is Ron. Of which he was spending time with. So I call Ron. He just got done dropping his mom off at her house and he said he would call to see if  was still at their house. Well I didnt recieve a call back from Ron. I wait another 45min. Gary finally comes home and the first thing he said to me was you know what chain reaction you set off. You must feel pretty bad about calling.

67,"sorry for typos and the lack of capital letters, i’m in mobile :)

i (21f) have married parents. my whole life i expected them to split and i hoped for it but it never happened.
Bottom line- if my dad was not my dad i would hate him and do my best to never interact with him. Not only is he emotionally absent from my whole life but almost physically as well. he was always at work or fishing or golfing ect. he always had a reason to not be at the house or there with us. he never has shown any emotion or and more than basic pleasantries with me my whole life. he never disciplined me, never took me anywhere, never took care of me when i was sick. 
if he ever didn’t like something i was doing hot wearing, he would privately tell my mom and have her bring it up to me.
this is not even diving into the fact that he is super uneducated, ignorant, and stubborn. he has extremely limited vocabulary and hardly ever uses proper grammar. he lacks basic social skills, even my mother gets embarrassed by his manners. 
when i was in 7th grade i started snooping. he had a match.com account where he listed himself as widowed. I also found many emails and search histories of porn. the idea of my dad watching porn wound not bother me if it wasn’t all hardcore teen/old guy/first time/cherry popping stuff. that just really creeps me out. 
i never told my mom or anyone about this stuff, i felt far removed from a lot of my family for most of my life- but really connected with my mom and sister once i moved out. never my dad though. 
in middle school/high school my moms drinking got bad. me and my sister talked to our dad about it and he said she was fine. took her to bars and restaurants. would let her get drunk at family parties. never even wanting to bring it up to her because he just wanted to “keep the peace”. i could go into details on why he did it but bottom line he enabled my mom and the abuse that ensued from her drinking. i got the worst of her abuse. 
at that time (senior year of hs) i showed my sister the screenshots of my dads match.com account. she didn’t beleive me, she said it could be for work”? he supervises people who work on gas lines. 
anyway now i’m an adult. i’m an out lesbian and in a very prestigious program to study chemistry of medical marijuana. Neither of these big things about my life has he ever discussed with me. Never acknowledged me being gay, or what i’m studying/that he’s proud of me. 
whenever i’m home visiting i have a hard time faking it. i can’t help but be cold as he acts like he’s the perfect dad and i’m just his regular happy daughter. he emotionally effected me in ways i can’t fix, ill literally always be impacted by his choices. i’ll never have a normal dad and a normal relationship with him. 
my mom gets so mad though. if i am too blunt she will always pull me aside and tell me what a wonderful person he is and how i am so lucky to have a father that loves me. he loves me?????!!!! when has he shown that. i feel like i have a dad from a sitcom. emotionally empty. 
i can’t tell her everything. we are closer now and i love my mom but i couldn’t confess that i knew that for 9 years and never spoke of it. i don’t know what to do or what to tell my mom. if i tell her only part of the reason it doesn’t make sense why i just don’t like him as a person. please help. what do i say to her.",11Sep2020,1

71,"I (22F) met this guy (23M) at my last job a while ago and knew we were instantly attracted to each other. I'd been single for around 9 months after ending a 4 year relationship with my ex after he cheated on me. When I met this guy at work, I was horny and finally felt ready to move on. So I instigated and we did it. I went to his place, we had dinner, and then we had sex. The next day I asked him if he could keep things just between us as I didn't want my coworkers to find out and give me any hassle for it. I don't like work gossip. He agreed, which made me happy and also made me want to sleep with him more because the sex was really good. So naturally, we entered a FWB situation. He was happy to keep things on the low whilst also returning my need for no strings attached sex, which worked for me. I eventually met his family and we became good friends that would go out for meals and drinks together and I started hanging out at his house to play video games or watch football together. His parents started asking about us and after a while he popped the question to me of ""so... what are we?"". I reminded him of our FWB scheme and at some point he started to ask for more. He told me that the time we were spending together made him want to ""try out something more committed"". He'd never been in any relationship before or interested in monogamy (which is why I was so happy with him in the first place) and so to hear that felt like a massive blow to any plans I had made for him. After a few months of us sleeping together, he mentioned things were starting to change for him and I countered with me not being prepared to enter another relationship after having just come out of a heavy breakup less than a year ago. We both understood we wanted different things so we mutually agreed to end things. He started seeing a girl in his masters more seriously that was always interested in him, and I downloaded tinder. A couple weeks later the girl on his course became his gf and we stopped talking and hanging out by then. Then a couple months went by and he messaged me out of the blue to ask me about my new job and how I was doing. It felt nice to receive a sweet message like that and I replied politely. After a couple more messages between each other, he stopped replying back. He started doing this every couple of months. Reaching out, asking generic questions about my work and how I was, and then ignoring my response, killing the conversation. The conversations would die every time on his accord and yet he was always the one initiating them. Sometimes even trying to make plans for us to meet for a drink and to catch up but he would cancel or plans would fall through. This week it's happened again for the 6th or 7th time now, honestly I've lost count and I'm really confused. Every time he would reach out I would think it's because he wanted us to be friends again but now I'm not so sure. I've always prided myself on being decent at reading people's intentions however, with him I'm just really puzzled. He's been dating this girl from his masters for nearly a year now (since we stopped FWB arrangement) and has made no real effort whatsoever to keep me around as a friend either (which I'm pretty ok with, I get it given our history and the fact he now has a gf I guess?) and yet keeps reaching out to me like this a whole year after we last saw each other. Things also seem pretty good between him and his gf as we follow each other on ig and he posted a photo of them together like a week ago. I'm seriously confused with what his angle is. Why is he behaving like this? What are his intentions? Should I just stop responding to his messages? I kind of just want to be straight with him and ask him what he really wants but I also don't want to be insensitive if I'm just overthinking it too much? Sorry for the essay. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.",11Sep2020,1
72,"My wife is at a really hard point in her life. She went to college for the wrong major, and spent five or six years trying to find herself. She worked mainly minimum wage jobs, never managed to find anything in her field. 

A few years ago, we had our first child, and then second one last year. Ever since we became parents, time and motivation has been really hard to come by. Recently we talked about having her go back to school to get a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts degree and just take a couple studio classes a semester as to not take too much time, which is what she wish she did 10 years ago.

Ultimately, despite me pushing for it, she concluded that it’s just not the right time, especially with our boys at such a young age. She’d told me she’d rather build her own portfolio and attempt grad school when the kids are older. 

The problem we have is that she really likes classroom settings, mainly because of the self accountability—there’s actual consequence for not finishing or doing your work and that’s just a good motivator. So that’s kinda the issue we have. 

She feels so stuck and doesn’t know what to do, and I feel like pursuing art is the direction to go but without some form of structure and accountability, the discipline just isn’t there.

80,"This is a trivial situation, but nevertheless one that's conflicting to me. 

I have a friend whom I have known for a year now, but we get on very well. One of the only things about them that make me uncomfortable is that they would tell me to do something like crossing a bridge that's not built. (don't know if that's the right expression)

One example is 'bringing something and someone to my house next time' when I have, clearly, never extended an invitation to my friend. I did so once out of obligation because they invited me to their house once before. However, in that instance, they asked me what time I am coming to their house when I didn't even say I was coming or not. 

Some of you might say that I don't remember, but I clearly do, and this behaviour of theirs has been communicated to me in confidence by a mutual friend. My friend is always presuming, and it is lightly getting on my nerves. I'm not sure how to go about this because they are a very sensitive person, and don't want to lose them over something trivial. 

I have a hobby of collecting a certain accessory (won't mention it just in case they identify me on Reddit) that I wear every time I go out, and I wear a *lot* of it. My friend said they would give an accessory like the ones I wear, and basically told me to wear it. However, when I saw the picture of it, it is FAR from my style and not something I would wear in a million years. I take pride when I find something to add to my collection, but I'm disappointed to say not this time. My friend didn't ask me if I liked or wanted it, they just went straight to the conclusion that I would take it and wear it automatically. 

***I do appreciate their intentions and their support as a friend***, but frankly, I'm not sure what to do in this situation and need second opinions. I don't want to offend them, but I also don't want to wear the thing. Also, how do I deflect their presumptions?",11Sep2020,1

Their father had a ""lady friend"" on the side before his wife passed (he cheated) and my friend and him had a falling out.  After a few years they became close again but the will was changed so that his friend is in charge of the will.  Fast forward to now and they are stressing out because they think that the friend was left everything instead of them.  The will still isn't probated and it is going on almost 2 weeks since their father had passed.  I told them to get a free consultation with a lawyer, but they don't have a lot of money to afford that.  The woman allegedly has been left a lot of money from previous family members so they are worried they are going to get into a bigger fight than  necessary.

I work in HR and next week work is having its first bigger in person office meeting. We live in a low covid area. We typically work from home. This meeting will bring 30 employees into the office. For me this would be the largest gathering I have been a part of by  a lot since covid started. I just found out that a manager is flying in from a hot covid zone. I brought my concerns to my manager and she was very dismissive saying he has to come and when I said I thought we should inform the staff just making sure everyone knows someone is coming from out of state she said no we shouldn’t make a big deal out of it. 

It made me so upset I was considering leaving. I am going to bring up my concerns yet again tomorrow and see how it goes.

I am extra emotional about this because although I am young(F24) 2 years ago I was dying of a tumor. After the tumor was removed I had to be on steroids to not die.

I'm 34F, married, have a mortgage and a car payment. I'm also temporarily employed by the Census Bureau, so I do have some money coming in for a bit and our savings is decent, though we do want to buy another car in the next year. But what do I do now? I've never figured out what I want to do with my life, and we're in the middle of a global pandemic. How the hell does anyone figure out what they want to do? 

For a little more detail, I walked away from a state pension and eight weeks of sick leave, all of which I get to keep if I get another public job (school, library, etc). There's a hiring freeze at the library, but I know there's an open position I am confident I could get hired for if they ever open hiring back up I worked at a different branch for a year with a horrible manager and don't know if I want to go back to the system. I don't want to bounce back to a different version of miserable.

107,"3 weeks ago i moved into an apartment complex, quite small and very quiet. a few days in i heard a woman scream, presumably at a child/children, “If I have to come in there and do it myself i’m going to be pissed!” it was like 10pm so I thought it was a kid gaming/watching tv too late and shrugged it off. 

yesterday, I hear the mom start to yell, cursing at this kid. He is sobbing, and cries “I’m just so hungry!” and she says “you don’t need to eat every fucking five minutes!” and then he screams out loudly. she yells something else i couldn’t quite comprehend and then it went silent. I heard hear walking under my window later, talking to this kid like he was her ex husband. I can’t remember verbatim but along the lines of “Do you know how fucking stupid that sounds? why would I do that? so that blah blah can happen? fuck no.”

I randomly hear her start screaming but that was the only time I’ve heard the kid say anything back, that he was just hungry. I’m worried about that kid. should i be? I don’t even know what unit they live in, it’s just so loud that it echoes around the complex.

I Can't even talk without stuttering and being just weird. No one ever understands shit of what I say. I can't think ahead or use logic. My family always tells me ""How can you even think x thing? Its commom sense that Y"" and all that. It's a damn miracle I haven't been fired for being idiotic.

109,"Hello i am a 19 year old kid who decided not to go to college after high school because i did not know what I wanted to do in life. In high school i was super awkward and did not feel like I was being authentic and my real self. Due to this i feel like i missed out on a lot of social opportunities. Well after high school I was 17 about to be 18 and i had a good job, a decent savings account for a 17 year old (i don't really want to brag and ""flex"" because money isn't shit and it means nothing but it'll make sense later) and just an old truck to run around in. When i turned 18 I got fired from my job and was lost in life. I decided to take a year off of work and other social events and isolate to think about life and find the real me (i went out every once in a while by myself). Well it was a rough year and i hardly remember a single day of that year but I found my own style, found out what i want to do in life, found inner happiness, and came to terms that i can't change the way I sound when i talk so i decided to own it and love it (my biggest insecurity my whole life it kept me from wanting to talk). I also stopped worrying about my so called ""friends"" as they stopped talking to me and i came to realization that I have to move on. I'm now trying to start my life over again. Everything from a new job, new friends, and a new outlook on life. I'm also about to sell my truck this weekend as it has to many memories of the old me and ngl my savings is starting to hurt. I've been using my savings for the last year to pay my bills and it's kinda getting stressful now. I'm gonna daily my dad's old truck for now then I should have enough money in December to buy a new truck if i get a job by the end of the month. 

So the advice i need is how to start all over again. Where can I meet people, how do I make friends, how do i succeed in life again.

114,"Background: I’ve been working part time at a restaurant and since I’ve gotten here they’ve had an extremely hard time retaining staff, I’m close with the owners so when I got offered a full time position I still offered to come in when I got off to help them out instead of leaving them with less staff. Today I got into work and my coworker was less friendly than usual, once things slowed down a bit I asked her what was up and she said she had been to the emergency room earlier where they informed her she had a ruptured ovarian cyst, I personally have had this so I know it’s dreadful and I look her dead in the eyes and say “oh my god why are you here” she said “oh I’m fine I’m just ready to go home when I can” the other girl that works here decided that she wanted to leave early because she worked a double today (mind you both me and the other girl come in after full time jobs EVERYDAY) so she tells me she’s going to leave early when she’s supposed to close out the night, so now I have to do it, which is fine, I understand why she would want to go home and I fully understand it’s not fair that I would get to come in later than her and get out earlier than her so I’m not too upset that she’s having me close even if it’s the second night in a row, but after she left I found out that when my coworker was at the hospital in the ER she contacted this girl and told her what was going on and was nice enough to ask if she still needed to come in and she had the AUDACITY to say YES!!! I get my coworker was being a push over and should’ve asked for what she needed or even just said “hey I’m not coming in I’m sorry” but I’m absolutely livid that she did this to her and I want to tell the owners daughter about it because she works the same job and is basically our manager but I know the girl I’m “tattling” on is psycho and will straight up come for me if she finds out, so I don’t want to cause drama and I don’t want them to feel like they need to fire this girl, but I want to make sure the situation is known and doesn’t happen again.

115,"Hey. I’ve had a rough night, and I don’t really know what to do.

I have an eight month old puppy. She’s getting better every day, but her current favorite chew toy is glasses. She ate a $300 pair, and two pairs of cheaters, but tonight... she ate an $800 pair. They belonged to my dad.

My mom told me when she found them, and I took them from her and said I’d tell him. She’s my dog, after all. She warned me he was going to be very, very mad.

And he was. Swearing, yelling, slamming doors— he snatched the glasses out of my hands and the frames almost cut me. “Fuckin’ dog! Fuckin’ dog!” Over and over again.

I was upset that he’d been so rough grabbing the glasses instead of just asking for them, but... things got worse.

My dad went to bed, slamming the bedroom door, and I went to console my cowering dog. I sat with her for a while and zoned out until I felt good enough to go grab a book and read, but my mom was waiting for me. She started talking to me about what she should do about the new puppy she’s getting, how she should have never married a man who hates dogs, ect...

Long story short, I was her therapist for half an hour. She looked at me and asked me how I would feel if they got divorced! I said I didn’t want to answer, and it sucked. It SUCKED. She told me to be honest with her (she thinks she’s put all the effort in, and she has put a lot of effort in regarding my dad’s issues) so I was honest and... she cried. 

My dad, like me I think, is on the spectrum. It’s hard for him to process emotions well. This isn’t an excuse for how he behaved, but my mom doesn’t seem to understand this or how the way she speaks to him ends up killing open conversation. 
I.e.
Mom: “I think we should paint the wall blue.”
Dad; “Eh, I don’t think so. What about green?”
(Repeat for a while until:)
Mom: “FINE. Whatever you want.”
Dad: “No, I mean—“
Mom: “no, you don’t like anything I like, so YOU pick.”

I told her this, and it upset her. She asked me how she could be better and at that point the conversation was too much for me and I was trying not to cry. My dad was angry, my mom was crying, and I just wanted to go to sleep.

I don’t really know what to do. I don’t know if what I said was right. I’ve been crying in my room for a while now because it’s so overwhelming.

- my parents won’t see a therapist. I’ve been trying for five years.
- i know this story makes me seem 12, but I’m 23. I felt twelve during this whole thing, though. They’re my parents, you know?

and it just said the words “Drama Queen” 
now according to my nurse friends we’re fairly certain language like that does not belong in an official medical document, let alone a referral to another practice.

My parents barely have any money and I'm the first in my family to continue school after 15 so obviously failing this school is a big no no.
With all this information plus the knowledge that I'm incredibly shy and easily breakable under pressure, it left me overwhelmed. The long schedule (from early morning to 6:30pm) mixed with 11 subjects to study doesn't help either since I feel like I'll barely be able to breathe. My life will basically be nothing but school and home and I wouldn't mind that much if at some point I didnt have to get a job. as I've mentioned, my parents aren't financially stable and I'll need to get one but I fear that with everything regarding school, I won't be able to.
I just really need advice on how to deal with all this pressure and how to not have an anxiety attack every day for the next 3 years. No previous school of mine has ever demanded so incredibly much of me. 
Before I was scared my biggest worry was going to be not having friends and people making fun of the way I dress poorly but *now* mu biggest worry is not having a future and making my parents pay money they dont have. Just need advice.

123,"1. I put every written word /account as police information and lodged an FIR in India and a FIR in the country I am in, after I started losing faith bit in the previous process cause all they asked me to do is to represent me in court and I can't do that right now. This targets everyone, everyone who ever wrote anything against me, and the persistent ones I lodged for stalking too. I also included defamation in a job written context just to end the loop. I gave the same information to both parties. 

2. I kind of talked about all sources about people these people thought no one will ever know, including their not photoshopped pictures but this gave me no joy, cause they are already losers. You don't get any joy by telling a hooker they are hookers or a fat person fat. It's not slander. It's just journalism and I felt very icky on it, cause though I was honest, they are just so bad it felt like kicking a dog when they are down. I also got major information out about any people they are related to but it's not satisfying. 

3. About persistent harassment, I don't want to. I like easy quick cut situations, and I am not having such low self esteem that this is the only holy crusade of my life. Also, it didn't affect me much, or at all, made no difference in my life, contrary I got new friends. The people who I am attacking have such delusional walls to their ego, cause I guess they are already suicidal and it makes sense to keep that up to protect themselves. I think I gave them more PTSD than they hoped to give me. 

They also got nothing out of this endeavor. No new contacts. No new relationships. I got all the attention. Their exes and crushed adore me. 

5. Obviously, cause they have no value, and their family also doesn't, they are the first ones in their family to get through high school and stop raping their brothers, I got rid of them from my life. 

6. They keep bringing up I am anxious and depressed but I really am not, I am really happy. Also, I report every comment I get to police, just cause. 

Do I need to do anything else or this is enough? 

I think I have annihilated their life? I'm not interested in establishing a host and parasitic relationship. I know this is how they build their self esteem, but in my opinion I destroyed them for perpetuity.",11Sep2020,1

So if I try to just shrug it off or say “ok” to his arguments he’ll retaliate by saying things like “oh that’s what you always say when you know your wrong.” He starts his arguments by calling me headass or retard and it just boils my blood. Because I straight up can’t win I’m not as mean or dominant as him so even if it’s that one rare time that I have a good rebuttal he’ll just say really sarcastic things like “ok uh huh I believe you” if I were to say that I would just get the “THATS WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAY WHEN YOUR WRONG YOU KNOW YOUR WRONG I WIN” so I guess he’s also a hypocrite. Anyways I got sick of it and cut ties and I don’t think he cares because when I told him I wasn’t going to speak with him for a while he just responded with “Oke doki artichoki” I thought of him as a really good friend but I can’t stand the way he treats me like shit. What should I do against someone like this? Never talk to him again? Try to talk to him about how I feel? I just don’t fucking know anymore.,11Sep2020,1

134,"Blood cancer is a difficult diagnosis for anyone affected by it, but becoming a donor is extremely easy! All you have to do is go online, fill out a short health questionnaire, and a swab kit will be sent to you. The entire process takes less than 15 minutes altogether. If you are in the US you can swab here: [***Gift of Life***](https://www.giftoflife.org/dc/LakshmiM)

Giving Bone Marrow isn’t like what you see on Grey’s Anatomy. There are a lot of myths about bone marrow donation. 80% of donors are asked to give peripheral blood stem cells, which is very similar to that of a platelet donation or blood drawing process. The remaining 20% give bone marrow cells which are taken straight from the donor’s hip, but this is done under sedation and is relatively painless except for some soreness/achiness that may last for a little while. This procedure is mostly asked for younger patients/children.

Why you should care:

\-Every 3 minutes a child or adult is diagnosed with blood cancer. It can affect anyone, from children, to healthy adults, to grandparents. A bone marrow or stem cell transplant is the only hope for survival for many of those diagnosed, and can be a CURE for some.

\-Over 70% of those in need do not have a match within their family and need to find a donor on the registry.

\-Recipients that are part of a minority group have the hardest time finding a donor on the registry. Only 25% of black or multi-racial patients will have a donor on the registry, 40% of Asian-American, and 45% of Hispanic/Latinx. Their best chance is finding someone with a similar ethnic background. We need more diversity on these registries!

\-There is a 1 in 200 chance that you will need a bone marrow or stem cell transplant in your life time.

\-Stem Cell/Bone Marrow Transplants can be used to treat/cure many blood cancers as well as immune and blood disorders.

\-There is a 1 in 200 chance you will be called as a potential match and 1 in 5 potential matches will be asked to become a donor.

Becoming a bone marrow donor can lead you to saving someone else's life, who is going through unbelievably tough times and will save their family/friends as well.",11Sep2020,1

We like to poke fun at each other, but it feels like they genuinely hate me. They won't respond to any of my messages, and only about 3 people genuinely cared after I spoke out about it, and one of those people had their phone taken away (I believe). I am legitimately considering ending it all, but I know they'll probably make fun of me for that too.

140,"Basically the title- I’ll provide my reasoning, though.

My sister is very Christian and prides herself on how religious she is. Like, imagine the stereotypical southern Christian girl and you’ve got her on the nose.

We’ve never had the best relationship (shocker, I know) and I do not have similar beliefs to her at all as I am Agnostic (as well as very tolerant to sexualities and such). 

About an hour ago, we were talking in my room about our one shared class and somehow got onto the topic of how two of the basketball players asked my sister if I was a lesbian. I don’t know why they didn’t ask me, but I tend to miss social cues so idk.

I came out to her as pansexual, it felt really good to talk to someone I love and trust about something so personal! But when she realized that meant I was open to loving girls, she stopped me from talking further.

She looked me in the eye and said I was going to hell. Stone faced- no emotion whatsoever and no remorse. It hurt like a motherfucker, and I asked her to leave my room.

For this, and other reasons I don’t really have the time to get into, I want to cut ties totally when I get to college in two years.

I understand her faith is hers to identify with and stuff, but I know I cannot stand her and her toxic ways for long. It has literally been one of the factors that led me to attempting suicide (not willing to discuss).

I don’t know what to do in this situation, and can’t see my therapist until early October, so I’ve turned to y’all.

143,"1. I put every written word /account as police information and lodged an FIR in India and a FIR in the country I am in, after I started losing faith bit in the previous process cause all they asked me to do is to represent me in court and I can't do that right now. This targets everyone, everyone who ever wrote anything against me, and the persistent ones I lodged for stalking too. I also included defamation in a job written context just to end the loop. I gave the same information to both parties. I have added even people for slander who didn't write anything online but reported by words to third parties. Just general, everyone, even if you talked in an ear of someone else. 

2. I kind of talked about all sources about people these people thought no one will ever know, including their not photoshopped pictures but this gave me no joy, cause they are already losers. You don't get any joy by telling a hooker they are hookers or a fat person fat. It's not slander. It's just journalism and I felt very icky on it, cause though I was honest, they are just so bad it felt like kicking a dog when they are down. I also got major information out about any people they are related to but it's not satisfying. 

3. About persistent harassment, I don't want to. I like easy quick cut situations, and I am not having such low self esteem that this is the only holy crusade of my life. Also, it didn't affect me much, or at all, made no difference in my life, contrary I got new friends. The people who I am attacking have such delusional walls to their ego, cause I guess they are already suicidal and it makes sense to keep that up to protect themselves. I think I gave them more PTSD than they hoped to give me. I think even if I hadn't given them PTSD they already had PTSD, based on their life circumstances. 

They also got nothing out of this endeavor. No new contacts. No new relationships. I got all the attention. Their exes and crushed adore me. Their hopes killed off in March 2019. More debt and canceled loan options, credit card debt, I am not sure what but that. 

5. Obviously, cause they have no value, and their family also doesn't, they are the first ones in their family to get through high school and stop raping their brothers, I got rid of them from my life. I blocked them all, restricted the non slander but not done enough team, basically on value as a person, zero value. They were child predators in their teens and adulthood, which explains the delusional thought process. 

6. They keep bringing up I am anxious and depressed but I really am not, I am really happy. They just are hoping this made an impact to me and all it did is it exaggerated my trust issues, but these people and me never had a relationship or were even acquainted. Out of 4000 people I know I got batshit conspiracy theories from 2-3 people so it wasn't difficult to get rid of them. Also, I report every comment I get to police, just cause. 

Do I need to do anything else or this is enough? 

I think I have annihilated their life? I'm not interested in establishing a host and parasitic relationship. I know this is how they build their self esteem, but in my opinion I destroyed them for perpetuity.

My main anger about this is not what they did, my main anger is how did I end up dealing with this.

I recently found out that people who are rich like me, and tend to have more going for them, prolific and pretty tend to attract these kind of people, like a host to parasite relationship. So, had I had no value, they wouldn't be following me around persistently for years. The idea that I have value makes me a target. As long as I am rich, prolific and competent, this will be a problem for the rest of my life, if it won't be them, it would be someone else.

Should I hire a cyber security/team for physical  safety? I'm not elite but I am VIP enough to be 5-10%. I think I need one at this juncture, cause the number of people I have stalking me are officially in 100s.",11Sep2020,1

He really is a great kid; very excited to be welding, and over the moon when he does something good. He always tells me how much he likes to build things and thats why he wants to ""fucking weld"" (me too, buddy). We're retrofitting his booth to accommodate him as he spends time in it.

Here's the thing: He is clearly used to being catered to, he is quite sensitive, and I dont have time for that. I teach a welding class of 20 students. It's an industry known for placing a value on self-reliance, so I try to establish that in my students. He won't be looking for a career when he graduates, but I dont feel like I should be treating him any differently, regardless. 

I understand that the kid needs extra help on certain things, but I also see what he is capable of. It's not to say that I have stopped my other students from helping him (or forsaken him myself), but I have instructed them to start telling him to do the things I have trained him to do himself, or for him to come find me and not just scream ""Mr Rosenbaum"" until I come running.

He's mad about it, and says that I'm mad at him for being disabled... I most certainly am not. Ill be hearing from the boss tomorrow, I'm sure.

She’s making a lot less at a non engineering job that is well below her and she isn’t full time - She’s a contractor. She’s also likely to be laid off in February when her contract ends and she never got a engineering opening or even a full time job out of it. 

She’s really insecure and angry about it. She said she’s restricted because I got a job first and now she can’t even look for anything too far from where we currently live, which is my parents house. Her anger has been climbing since. She also hates living with my family. We had a plan to save up money for the next year and buy a house nearby so we can have our own house but ultimately we decided we wanted to move to Colorado and we weren’t going to buy a house until we were officially moving there but that wouldn’t be for another two years after I get more experience at my current job. Or at least that’s what I thought.

She’s now saying that she can’t live here another two years and wants to move out within the year. Shocked, I said, “within the year, I’ve only been at this job for 4 months and it’s my first job and I’ll still be in training at that time.” Shes mad saying she’s just going to leave then and she’s mad at me because I’m picking my job over her when I can just get another one.

The red flags started with the pure amount of drama that was somehow acceptable within the workplace, and a manager who is super manipulative and is the exact same as the other individuals there and refuses to change anything. She has been verbally abusive to her employees including myself, however when she was reported to her manager she was promoted with no backlash.

I never signed anything, I have tried to schedule times to meet with her to review my employee profile but she never seems to have time for me. 

She proceeds to text me after hours about work things and has promised me so much without giving what’s promised. (Many raises, keys, etc.)

I called they were very terse and said they were experts and were “very” familiar with my vehicle.  That all changed when I went in.  30’minutes into my wait the manager blamed me not telling them my vehicle was a particular variant, I did.  They made me wait another hour before I had to call them out for whispering something(I was the only customer)and they said they didn’t have any of the parts and would have to have a courier bring them. They ended up charging me 189.00 for an oil change and tire roar around on a VW GTI. I’ve always paid 85.00 at the dealership, a fair price. I found out after the fact that they put the wrong oil in it as well.  I called up the manager and asked them if they would fix it and consider adjusting the cost because of the mistake and the 3hrs I had to wait.  He said nothing.  I proceeded to dispute the charge on my card and wrote a scathing review where I said some not very nice things because I don’t like being taken advantage of.  The owner responded to my review, but I already tried to resolve it, and wasn’t going to waste more time with such as asshat. I shouldn’t have had to write a review to get their attention. 

A month later I bought a lamp off of eBay and had to fight with the seller because they didn’t like the price I won it for.  He eventually shipped it and it arrived broken.  I was able to get it fixed and asked for a price adjustment for the cost of the repair. He kept delaying and delaying so, I filed a dispute with eBay for 4 times the cost of the repair because he refused to rectify the issue and had tried to fraudulently not sell me an item.  

Two weeks ago I tried to buy two pairs of shoes. I placed the order and received a receipt from
PayPal.  The company never sent me anything. I send 25 email requesting a status. I didn’t care if it was delayed, just that I didn’t drop $300 on thin air.  I waited a week and a half, sent three email requesting they cancel my order, then disputed the charge again. Despite my requests to cancel the order, they shipped the items and charged me an expedited shipping fee.

They finally agreed to let me return the shoes shipped 4 weeks late without paying a $20 restocking fee.

I would like to start out by saying I truly think I have BPD. A symptom of that is taking small things extremely personally. Maybe this is an example of that. 

I dated someone for almost 2 years. We had a very very special and deep bond before that for years before we decided to date. 

The month we decided to date, he picked up a video game. It's an MMO, so he would play with his friends all the time. 

Near our one month, he had stopped talking to me almost all day, and didn't even talk to me on our one month anniversary. This was the very beginning of it all. It started off on a bad step. It only got worse. 

He would play constantly all day. He would have really bad, short, conversations with me. We got into arguments over this on multiple occasions. He had no job or license, and was sitting around gaming all day when he was 18. He would always say he was going to get his license or a job, but it took him years to do so. This started to crack my trust in him. 

He played the game for 1.5 years, racking up over 2.5k hours on it. During this time, I was extremely busy with work, school, and MANY MANY other activities, but I still made time for him. I'd stay up all night for him just so we could talk. Then he started asking for more time to play. I said I wasn't comfortable with it, so he didn't. It was small things like that constantly. It was building up.  I would ask for him to get off when I got off work so we could have quality time together. There would be days where I was busy and when I finally got a chance to talk, he still wouldn't get off. He had nothing better to do all day but still, when it was supposed to be our time, I was left behind. 

Things like that continue to happen over and over again. We argue about things like that multiple times. I became miserable, I felt like I had to fight for his favoritism over a video game. 

Eventually, after all of that, I caught him lying to me about when he was gaming. He'd lie and tell me he was off when he wasn't. It caused a HUGE explosion. Everything had built up. I felt so betrayed. We had began talking during a time where I was living in a terrible, abusive household. He was the only person i had ever truly trusted, and to learn that even he was capable of lying to me like that broke me. 

I still didn't drop him though. I got over it. He kept playing his video games. Until it happened again. This is what I think truly broke me. The pain I felt the first time was so unbearable i thought there was absolutely no way it could get any worse. But it did. It was so unbelievably unbearable. I absolutely cannot describe how I felt. It was the worst heartbreak I've ever felt, out of everythings that's happened to me, that tops it (which is crazy to me because I was severely abused for 18 years).

After that, he decided to stop playing. We had broken up by this point. He took a 6 month break. I would ask him every now and then if he ever had any thoughts of going back so I had time to prepare myself. He always said no. Except for a few weeks ago. He told me out of the blue he was going to start playing it again... 5 hours before he got back on it. This was very shortly after my dad had kicked me out (and that fucked me up BADLY) Not even his return to it was smooth. However, he agreed to only play while I was at work for 1-2 hours. 

I still freaked the fuck out. I tried so so so hard to be supportive, and I still do. I havent been the same since my dad kicked me out. My dad chose his girlfriend over me. So that, ontop of all the feelings of having to fight for the #1 spot over a video game, ruined me. I would constantly be mad at him. I would constantly cry and think about everything he did and how it was just going to happen again. I'm terrified of it happening again. It has caused me such stress, my heart has started beating inconsistently, I've been having heart palpitations. I've had nightmares over him lying to me then finally being able to get rid of me. I've had to go to the doctor and get a heart monitor put on me. 

I have tried so, so hard to get over it. I want him to be happy. I want him to play games and have fun. In fact, he does! He plays plenty of other video games and I have absolutely no problem with it. It's just this one specific game. Even though I broke up with him, i love him. I will always love him. I have tried so hard to ensure his happiness and success, but now I feel like I'm the one holding him back because he cant enjoy his favorite video game. I feel bothersome. How could he continue to play knowing what it did to me? 

Its ruined my relationship with video games. I use to play video games too, but I dont think I'd be able to anymore. I havent in a while. I dont think I'll ever date someone who plays video games again. I dont think I'll want to date another man. I don't think I could ever trust anyone again, or ever feel comfortable in a relationship again. 


He is a wonderful person. He has helped me financially, emotionally, and I'm every possible way he can. I want to make that clear. He is absolutely a good person. But I just cant get over this. I want to be able to get over it so he can be happy and play when he wants, and I can still have him in my life. 

Please help. Help me. I need advice. I need help. How can I fix this? What can I do? I need anything. Because if i dont get over this, i will ultimately have to shove him out of my life. And that's terrifying. 

TLDR ; Ex-boyfriend played video games and kinda treated me poorly. Its left me with intense, health threatening stress. And I cant get over it no matter how hard I try.",11Sep2020,1
165,"Hey everyone, today my parents had to put down one of our dogs. I haven't lived at home in 4 years and live 2k miles away so I didn't get a proper goodbye. Right now I feel so much sadness and a little guilt.

168,"Throwaway account for the sake of anonymity, and for a bit of background, I live with five people who I was close with in college. We are all beautiful examples of how imperfect people can be, but we've learned to resolve our differences internally and with haste. (Since living with social turmoil isnt great and all that.)

This situation however, has me in a bit of a pickle. 

To summarize because this doesnt need to be an eight page lecture, recently my one roommate asked for advice on how to handle a certain predicament. Since I was, and have been, a trusted confidant I gave the best advice, with the information I was given. Said circumstance did not go well. 

I was informed as to how it played out some time later in the day. And I could feel something amiss. Even still I had not been made privy to the full scope, and would catch hell for that later.

As I wound down for the evening my other roommate, we'll call him john, came to talk to me about said situation. To say he came at me with an aggressive fervor would be an understatement. He accused me of just about everything one could be accused of, including being a horrible friend, even though I was under the distinct impression I gave sound advice. Even still, for about two hours I was berated when all I did was try to help.

When emotions died down, and cooler heads discussed the situation, everyone shifted the blame to another roommate that also gave the same advice. I then had to continue to console my roommate for the next day to keep her from fighting the other over the advice for being ""toxic and manipulative."" Once the others all talked it out, it wpund up being the roommate that asked me for advice had lied, and skewed facts, and we were the one that caught hell for it. 

I stayed up the whole night crying and thinking about the situation and what I could have done differently, and even started to feel like I was missing part of the picture. Once it came to light that she had lied to me to get the advice, and then lied to the other roommates about the advice that was given I felt extremely betrayed.

She then somehow talked it out with John, who figured out ""the underlying cause"" of her behavior which had to do with her past, but had not been brought up previously and is now the reason she is the victim.

I feel like absolute shit about the whole thing and the fact that I never gave my other roommate a chance and allowed them to be put in the same situation as me, and cant directly confront the roommate that asked me for advice, because other demons are currently taking up the spotlight and I dont want to add onto it. And everyone else is coddling the person that lied and had me suffer for it. 

So quite simply, I'm asking how to go about talking it through, because its bugging me and I've no idea what to do.

Thanks for reading",11Sep2020,1
169,"I don’t know how to get all the information out but I (22M) date a girl for 4 years and don’t know how to move on (maybe). We met when I was 16 online and chatted for awhile she told me she was 16 ended up being 12 and I found out a little over a year later. By this point “the deed” was done so I continued to date her cause she was mature mental and certainly passed physically. We’ve had a number of issues but out respect for her I try not to talk about it. Things I feel are not my business to say would include her cheating on me a unknown number of time, her going through depression, her being a rape victim ( don’t know details just know she got triggered by it sometimes bothered me especially when she rather cry through sex than stop and do anything else). We tried to work through it and it didn’t work out. It’s been two years and I’m comfortable talking about her just don’t know what I can say our problems are besides trust issues. I only ask this cause my good friend from high school who has some mental struggles keeps bringing her up. He knows we broke up and he means nothing by it but I don’t have the heart to tell him what she did to me. He met her when went to the river over summer and he remembers her being pretty and nice. I’ve got my part in our relationship to of course which I told him but I don’t know if this is me being hung up on her or just trying to be respectful of her. 

I try hinting to my friend that me and her are over and even said I don’t wanna talk about her? He means nothing by it but due to lack of conversation and me and her being inseparable it’s kinda how he remembers me back then",11Sep2020,1
170,"So, recently I have been bullied alot over having any ancestors that have might have been being Hindu, and they keep pointing out Abrahamic faiths are more believable and Buddhism is so much more sane and more philosophies than Hinduism . I tried to point out some good aspects in Hinduism mainly cause I am the person/people who probably are more associated with the Vedas, and talked about some monotheistic forms of Hinduism, but they couldn't get over people worshipping cows.

Then I spend time trying to explain to people why the Holy cows phase is an enlightened phase, though at this point I was just doing it cause I like intellectual depth in everything I do but it was tongue in cheek cause I don't think cows are holy either.

I just brought up its nature worship and God's build for a former agrarian society and I got laughed at.

I told them the religion is old, they said no there are older religions than it, it's just more organized.

I told them that all God's are basically brothers and sisters and there is one major God, ie - Brahman but they started making fun of the stories they heard and also shared people worshipping cows videos.

These people are open minded and not bigoted but I found it hard to explain them the positives. They also brought up, if your people have a million gods, where do you have space for anything else?

I don't know how to answer it.

I actually don't care about this, but I need a good argument against this for intellectual clarity on both positions. I'm like knowing both sides of the coin. Advice?",11Sep2020,1
171,"In high school, I experienced something that seemingly traumatized me. It triggered me into entering this extremely dark period that last about 5+ years. Sorry if this is long.

So, when I was 15 I was a pretty innocent girl and didn't have much dating experience. I was really shy, but I was still outgoing enough that I had tons of friends. I always dressed nicely and I was pretty confident in myself and my appearance... until something happened that absolutely shattered all of it.

So one day this guy in the grade above me snap chatted me and basically did the whole courtship thing. He said he thought I was really pretty and wanted to get to know me. So we started casually texting and then that lead to hanging out. This guy was actually very popular and well liked. He was genuinely a nice guy (at least I think) and I sound like a middle schooler saying this but he seemed like one of the most popular guys in his grade. He was good-looking, intelligent, one of the best football players, etc. Whatever. All good. Until I guess word got around that we liked each other, and people started talking about it... and people were really mean. I think word got around about it because a ton of girls in my grade would crush on him from across the room. There was this one girl who REALLY really liked him and she was talking to my friend about it, and my friend obviously told her that we talk, hangout, and admitted we liked each other. 

All of a sudden, a bunch of her friends started talking badly about me to him. She was really popular and he was really popular, so their friends were friends and anytime they would be at the same place at the same time, her and her friends would say, ""why do you like her? she's so weird."" 

I only know this because he would tell me, and he would be genuinely confused about it and he'd say, ""oh \_\_\_\_ said this about you.... I don't think she likes you. Did something happen between you guys?"" and I'd be confused and sad because I had never talked to her before. Looking back, maybe she just wanted to put me down... but for some reason I genuinely believed they viewed me as some sort of freak. My friends would also overhear people saying things, which was both hurtful and embarrassing. Even though I was somewhat confident, it was hard hearing that all these people had such negative opinions about me. 

And that's when I started developing BDD and an eating disorder. Because for some reason, in my head I assumed that because everyone had negative opinions about me without knowing me, it MUST be because of my appearance. And it made sense! Because really all they knew of me was my name and my appearance. And I had thought it was jealousy, but guys talked badly about me too. Why would a straight guy talk badly about me?

Anyway, I think I started to despise the boy because everyone in the school would praise him. All the girls had crushes on him and all the guys were his friend. I wasn't necessarily jealous, but it made me feel like a piece of crap compared to him. 

So, I decided to get with someone who I thought was more on my level. And I dumped him and started dating this really abusive guy. And out of nowhere, obviously the other ""popular"" guy started dating the girl that would talk badly about me. It just made me think, ""wow, she's so pretty. And has so many friends. and is so well liked. He probably liked her the entire time and only talked to me because he didn't realize she liked him.""

Looking back, I think it was a self fulfilling prophecy because I ended up breaking it off with popular guy way before I met the abusive guy. After a few days, the popular guy texted me asking why. I told him, ""because you act like you only want to hook up with me,"" which wasn't true, but I was trying to figure out why he liked me (an apparent weirdo). I thought he must be trying to use me for my body. He got upset and wanted to get back together so we did. But then people continued saying negative things about me so I just broke up with him again. And that's when I started dating the abusive guy. And I dated the abusive guy for 3 years. It was terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

But honestly, anytime I think about that time, I get depressed. I mean, basically my entire grade was comparing me to that other girl. They would say, ""why do you like her? She's weird."" ""She isn't good enough for you."" ""You're out of her league"" (the last one hurt the most). Then he started dating the girl. Idk :(",11Sep2020,1
172,Since I was a little kid I’ve been extremely career driven. I’ve been obsessed over what I would do and although I did have some things that I wanted to do my family was not very supportive and I didn’t go through with it. I tried college but I’ve always struggled academically although most of my teachers and friends say I’m pretty bright. I’ve been in construction for almost two years now and I’m absolutely miserable. I hate it with all my being. I worked at a wood shop with an abusive guy for a full year until I left recently. I got offered more money to go to the field and I’m currently on a trial period. He said he wanted to try me out for five days and we can decide if it’s for me. The company is run very well plus cool coworkers but I’m really unhappy already. I’m considering jumping into an entry level administrative assistant role at a real estate company through a temp agency to get some office experience. I’m planning to continue school in the afternoon while working my way up and possibly entering the real estate field. The thing is that my family is really against it saying that I always quit everything and that I’m too old. I’m not denying that I’ve changed my ideas on career paths a ton but it was because I was looking for something specific and never found it. Is it too late to start? Even if finishing school is my ultimate ticket into something better I’d rather come home after sitting in an office to study than covered in glue and possibly injury. What would you do? I feel like I’m behind in life but not unmotivated. While I’m a bit old to be costarring over I feel as if I’m too young to be resigning away my life to a career I hate. Thank you,11Sep2020,1

177,"I haven’t been taking very good care of my teeth the past 2 years. It’s gotten to the point where I’m extremely scared of what could happen to them. They look yellow and there’s a black spot on 4 of my back teeth (I assume this is cavities if not worse). I want to get them fixed before it’s too late. My issue is that I am terrified of going to the dentist and having them judge me, scold me, etc. What makes it even worse is that the dentist is a family friend that has checked my teeth and known me my whole life so I know they will be even more judging of how downhill my oral health has gone. I am also scared of my dentist telling all of the people I know about how horrible my teeth are. I do so much to hide my teeth from everyone because of how gross they look and it would be so humiliating if my dentist just told everyone about one of my biggest insecurities. I know people might tell me that i’m being irrational, to just get it over with and go, but the fear is overwhelming. Each time i visit the dentist I get filled with so much shame and guilt that I have to do everything to stop myself from crying there. The feelings just get worse every time and it makes me feel so depressed.

I’m not sure what to do because I don’t want my teeth to get any worse but I don’t wan’t to deal with the humiliation and fear of going to the dentist.

181,"So this is going to be a long one and it spans over many years so please buckle up and try to enjoy the ride. Well, maybe not enjoy but.. you know. 

I guess I should start from the beginning of the timelime or as far back as I can remember. This friend of mine has been in my life for 16/17 years. Her first “miscarriage” was when we were 14. The only reason I remember this really was because at the time, her boyfriend made a horrendously sick comment. He said “pregnant pu**y is the best pu**sy” and as a joke I asked him how he knew. He then told me it was because him and my best friend had conceived, but they had a miscarriage. 

Eventually she told me that not only had she had a miscarriage, but she had a “back door abortion” at another time as well and just didn’t tell me about it even though we told each other everything in our lives. 

Fast forward to sometime in March of 2018. She leaves our home state to go to her grandmas in another state because her and the gross comment boyfriend broke up and she was pretty much just getting out of a bad situation. I guess she was pregnant at this time and then had a miscarriage in another state. She never went to the doctor or really proved the fetus existed but I didn’t think she had to, especially since she would have to figure out a lot of stuff to be able to go to the doctor there. So I supported her and let it go. 

The next one was in January of 2019, her and the bad ex boyfriend got back together and she basically told me she got pregnant after having sex with him one time. She showed me a positive pregnancy test so I believed her. I never thought of reverse image searching it or anything like that but.. whatever. Long story short on this one, she said she was pregnant with twins, one a boy and one a girl and yeah... Never showed me any ultrasounds or anything to exactly clarify the genders or that they were real at all. Then I guess she had a miscarriage in April, which she told me on the year anniversary of my grandma passing away. 

This grandma raised me and was my favorite person, so it was a really hard day considering it was the very first year anniversary and I woke up to text messages about her saying she had lost the twins. I was distraught because I wanted to believe her but was also really upset with my own stuff going on. I told her to go to the hospital but she refused, claiming she didn’t have insurance so there was no way she could. I basically just blew her off and got mad. We reconciled later and it was whatever but at this point I was starting to notice a pattern so I was very angry that she did that on one of the worst days of my life. But.. I beat myself up about it because she needed me to be there for her. I was being a bad friend. 

The next pregnancy was somewhere between April and June. I eventually came to her house (this was after her telling me she was pregnant again) around June and she expressed to me that she wasn’t sure she could go through with this again. She wanted an abortion. Me being me, I started to question her about a lot of it. Why didn’t the last babies have an ultrasound? How did she know she was pregnant last time? Etc etc. Basically she explained to me that the boyfriend prompted her to lie to everyone and tell them she knew the genders and stuff because he said that’s what they should do. I told her before we went to an abortion clinic we needed to make sure she was really pregnant first this time. I told her to order a box of pregnancy tests off of Amazon and use her next day delivery. She did, she took all three at separate times of the day and they all came out the same: Negative. 

I basically was like.. okay, cool, you dodged a bullet. Great. I’m glad you’re not pregnant since you don’t want to be.. but it just continued to not make sense to me. Because before we discussed if she was really pregnant, I told her she needed to talk to her man about the abortion. That they just needed to talk about this together, they’re the ones who are affected by this. When she told him she wanted the abortion in front of me, all he said was “Okay, whatever you want baby.” Which this was extremely odd to me considering he was the one who was most excited... telling everyone, spending all this money on baby stuff, only to be told there was going to be no kids. 

Moving along.. late July I came to her house. I was under the influence and we got into an argument and under the assumption we were the only two in the house, I accused her of lying about all this. That she was faking it, I didn’t know why but it was sick. I can’t really remember a lot of it, but I also knew she had cheated on her boyfriend with another guy while he was in the mental hospital so I was kind of just word vomiting while extremely messed up. Turns out, the boyfriend had just gotten back and heard all of this and I basically felt like total shit. They argued and fought, our friendship was over and I left. 

An entire year goes by until I talk to her again, so pretty much May of this year, and we reconcile and become friends again. Now I find out she had a chemical pregnancy.. (Which I’m not very sure what that is) with her new boyfriend in February of this year. I hold my tongue, say nothing.. we continue on. June comes around, she tells me she’s pregnant again. I’m in shock, because honestly I can’t believe this is happening again, and she takes a picture of.. what I assume to be a fetus on a piece of toilet paper in the bathroom of her work. 

She then puts positive pregnancy tests, the fetus, ovulation strips, other stuff in a box and tapes it up and her and the new boyfriend write their sad goodbyes to the baby on it. She takes pictures of her new boyfriend while he’s sobbing and writing on the box, then sends them to me. I’m just distraught. I’m thinking... okay.. there’s no way this will happen again. 

Until it does. A few weeks after that, she’s pregnant again. Shows me a positive pregnancy test. Goes through the bleeding and what she considers to be a miscarriage again, then goes to the hospital. They tell her that it’s probably just left over from the last miscarriage and she shouldn’t worry. That makes sense to me, but not to her. 

Then the craziest thing happens. More crazy than the rest of this story. A guy she dated in between the March 2018 pregnancy and the January 2019 pregnancy gets ahold of her and is looking for closure on their breakup even though it wasn’t really a serious thing and she was gonna get back with the shit ex anyways, but regardless, he just wants answers. She basically goes off on him (I typed the message out for her to make it clear she doesn’t want to speak to him, and respectfully declines any future messages from him just to not lead him on, idk, maybe i suck too but anyways) Then he drops a bigger bomb and accuses her of lying about... take your guess.. A PREGNANCY! 

Great. Well, I don’t even feel like drawing this one out but Monday she sends me a pic of a positive pregnancy test again and today tells me she had a miscarriage. So basically that’s ten pregnancies I can account for.

I guess what my question is.. how can I fix this? Is this a diagnosable mental illness? Is there any way I can tell her she needs help? I’ve told her to get on birth control many times, told her to use protection; that it’s not worth getting pregnant over and over again to just keep losing them and putting herself through mental torture... but at this point, no matter how many pictures she sends me of proof, I just can’t seem to bring myself to believe her. Any advice? Is there any thing I can do to help? Thank y’all for taking the time to read this. Any comments are appreciated.",11Sep2020,1

190,"I'm 18F and my mom is 50s
She made me feel worthless to the point of suicide, I cannot go into exact detail on what she said because I still am holding onto remnants of my dignity.
On Wednesday, we got into an argument over a bed frame and she escalated to calling me a whore and saying that I was worthless and that I couldn't leave because no one else on this Earth would tolerate how I am, and then she slapped me.

I ended up leaving to a friend's house after the argument ended, and spent the night. I did not have a phone, only a laptop.
In the morning on Thursday I woke up to a slew of messages on Instagram from my boyfriend saying my mom was calling his mom up and calling him disgusting and trying to get me to their house to get me pregnant and ruin my life, she went through my text messages with him so I quickly changed my Instagram password to keep messaging him.

At this point I only had an email and an Instagram to communicate.

It was humiliating and I suddenly remembered my father making sexual comments towards me when I was 12, and how often my mother had called me a whore, I've never had sex but in that moment I just felt absolutely worthless and disgusting.
I have never been suicidal before yesterday but the only reason I am not dead now is because I thought it would be rude to kill myself at my friend's house as I had the sleeping pills in my mouth.

I spend the entire day talking to my friend to regain some of my self worth and I tell her about the pills when I realized I no longer wanted to die. 

Cut to my mom emailing me that it's going to be late and I shouldn't burden my friends family
""I hope you don't miss me or wish to see me one more time. I hope you don't regret killing your own mother."" Was her final email. I wasn't  quite yet mentally stable enough to call my mom, so I called the nonemergency to do a wellness check and they put her in a psych hold for 24hrs. 

I didn't know what else to do because I emailed my sister but she didn't respond and I knew every minute mattered.
Just now my brother texted me saying that I need help, but not because I was suicidal, but "" you SERIOUSLY need mental help if you believe calling the cops on your own mom is a better answer than contacting any of your siblings, she's literally being taken away by the paramedics right now.

I didn't know what else to do and again, he texted me this. I had no other options. I explain this to him but it's obvious through his texts he's already coined me to be the villain.

""Dude I'm done arguing with you. Not because you're right, but because you're ridiculously stubborn. You haven't matured to the point of performing self-reflection, and so you're right (in your mind). No matter what. The ONLY way to show you the impact of what you did, would be to call a wellness check on you myself, so you could see for yourself. But I'm not gonna do that, because I'd be a hypocrite, so congrats, you can bury your head in the sand a little longer.""

Did I do something wrong for doing a wellness check? Why is my brother being so hostile to me?",11Sep2020,1

197,"So at the start of March I had my very first online lecture where you can choose and change usernames at will . To save distractions I didn’t have the chat on the screen, and carried on like everything was normal. I then got messaged by someone who said look at the chat and it was just a mess with people saying homophobic and racist shit, I ignored it all and I joined a scribble.io link then 2 mins later I go back to the lecture like nothing happened. After the lecture I was getting messages about stuff that I had said in the chat which was stuff like “I burn black kids hair on fire”  now as I read that I knew I never wrote it but it says that I did and I was devastated. Since it was after the fact that I noticed that someone was pretending to be me saying stuff like that and I emailed my course adviser straight away telling him what happened and how I have no proof. 

Then lockdown hit and I found out other people’s names were used in false identitys but they were ok since they had proof . I heard nothing back from my email and I assumed it was all good until I just received an email today saying they are taking the issue further and that I am going to be attending a zoom call with members of the student conduct about my so called misbehavior on the 24th of September.

Now I am really worried as I have no proof that I didn’t say anything and it’s really just my word and that’s making me think that I am going to get in trouble for something I didn’t do.

199,"Hello Reddit, I am an A-levels student (18f). A year ago, I accepted a full scholarship. 

My entire life was to prove something, to prove that I could be independent, that I was a daughter worth having. My parents aren't abusive, nor are they the over-protective type, my mum is strict no doubt, but she just wants me to succeed. My dad is always supportive, the times when he's serious, I know I fucked up. I've always looked to him, my dad was my pillar. Whenever my mum was being over the top, my dad would intervene and save the day, I wouldn't trade him for the world.

My mum being a tiger mum, pushes me to get good grades, forces me to learn the piano, and take up public speaking. I've always rode where the waves took me. I did my best, made my parents proud most of the times, and sometimes I disappoint them. 

Being an impulsive person, I cannot hold on to an interest for long, which gave me the advantage of being a Jack of All trades but a Master of None. I would pick up something learn the basics and just stop once I kind of got the hang of things. 

Now I am overseas, alone and I have to stand on my own two feet. 

When the pandemic hit, I became existential, people I knew had people close to them die, I felt that life was insignificant, that I was just a speck in this vast empty world. After I die, I'll be just a fallen leave by the sidewalk, forgotten. I desperately struggled to find a hobby, an interest that would become my reason to live, that would become something I can work towards and have people remember me by. 

It was at this time I realised, I love to create stories. My head is a wonderland, and since young I would create fantastical world that I would escape to whenever I felt down. It was my palace, my safe haven. To pair with that, I loved art, I could sit still for hours drawing, though at that point it was replicating a piece I saw. I never pursued it professionally or learned it seriously as the people around me told me there was no future in art, it was but seen as a pipe dream. So it was a hobby, buried, but once in a while, I would dig it up and draw a little.

I drew, I watched art videos and drew, I went for online courses and drew. I endured all the misaligned facial features, the horrendous body proportions but I persevered. It was something I knew I wanted to do for the rest of my life. 

However this came at the cost of my studies, my grades tanked. Teachers got worried as they didn't want me to lose my scholarship. My parents eventually were informed and my mum let loose on me, scolding me for being immature and impulsive. My dad didn't say much, but the look of disappointment on his face said it all. I then dropped the bombshell that I wanted to pursue arts as a career. Me the science student, one of the few with the highest grades in my city, on a whim decided art could be my career. They were fuming and I shut them out for a while.

Now, I am facing my finals which would determine my advancement to the second year and would determine if my scholarship would be revoked or not is in 3 weeks. Once revoked, my parents would have to pay liquidity damages, and since we are not made of money, it would set us back. I don't want to be a burden, but I don't want to live a life I don't want to live. I want to make them proud in my own way. But if I don't have the scholarship anymore, not only would money be an issue... where would I study then? The shame of facing my friends, my relatives... 

Now, they are doing all they can to help me, be it tuition or tutoring, they know I am carrying an extreme amount of pressure, and they try to be supportive. 

I want to put aside these feelings, these questions like ""Was choosing art now a mistake?"", ""Is my love for art even real?"", ""Am I a disappointment?"", ""Was I too immature?"", ""Am I ready to be an adult?"" Because I want to make it past my finals and focus, but I can't. It's haunting me, whenever I feel that I can relax, it gnaws at my bones. 

I am studying harder than ever, but whenever I see a pencil and my sketchbook, I have a strong urge to draw. To escape, I turn to Youtube and that is another addiction I have. I am not productive at all, and at this rate, I'm doomed to fail. 

I need help. I hope someone can enlighten me or slap me awake.",11Sep2020,1

I do watch porn myself every once in a while, and I told him in the beginning that I was okay that he watched it, but I found myself feeling really gross whenever he did. He’s kinda “finish” shy (it took us over a month of being sexually active together for him to be able to actually do it without any help) and sometimes he would pleasure himself while I would sleep, and finish on me. I always got that “gross” feeling after that too. I actually love the idea of him waking me up with sex, and actually request it from him sometimes, but when he finishes without me like... being present.. it makes me feel horrible. I was (lightly) sexually abused by my father as a kid, and it was very hard for me to cope with the realization that what happened with my father was affecting me now.

206,"So for anonymity's sake I'll (17M at time, 18M now) use letters to refer to each person,

Dead best friend: J (19M)

Dead best friend's ex/""crush"": C (20F)

Other friend: S (15M at beginning and 16m at the end)

So back in December after I lost my job I got invited to start hanging out with J and C (they weren't dating at the time and had broken up a while ago, but remained good friends.)  I brought S along as well since they knew him as well and we hung out a little bit.  Well, it turned into C, S, and I since J had to work a lot.  Over that time I started developing feelings for C and she did for me as well.  I asked J if he was OK with it and he more than gave me his blessing, he apparently knew she had feelings for me and was trying to set us up.  Well about a week later I was taking her home from a church event and she asked me if I liked her.  We talked a little bit and ended up doing a date that upcoming Friday.  Now, this was the second date I ever went on, the first being a year ago with the girls whole family so it wasn't really a date, so I was pretty new to it.  She had a couple of relationships before so I was definitely less experienced.  I made a couple of mistakes with a lack of confidence on the date that I recognize now looking back that I didn't realize at the time, and two days later she told me that she thought we would be better off as friends.  Well, that was devastating especially considering I had prayed about asking her out and it definitely seemed like the right thing to do, so I was confused and upset.  Then crap hit the fan when four days later J passed away in a car accident.  That was a lot at once, but I have healed from his death a lot since then.  I miss you J.   But anyway, after that me, C, and S stopped hanging out as a group because I was too distraught over both the death and her breaking things off, as it didn't make sense to me (looking back on it I think it was my brain trying to go back to how things were when he was still alive and I was happy.)  However, C and S started hanging out a lot since C was really close to J and needed someone to hang around so she wouldn't be lonely, and he lives 3 houses down (I live about 15 mins away.)  I didn't think much about it at the time, but I did ask S if there was something between them but he assured me that it was purely platonic and I believed him, as they described themselves to be like brother and sister.  Well after the death in January of this year, I was in an extreme funk trying to process why all that happened at once, still obsessing over her while also coping with j's death with her.  I confessed I was still in love with her in March, but she said we should stay friends, for now.  So it went on like that for a while while I slowly got over her, to a point where I wasn't hoping she would like me back, but I wouldn't have been opposed to it.  She and I had gone to see J's dad that week and she mentioned that she lost a steering wheel cover a while ago and wanted that same one again, so I ordered it for her, just because.  But then that Friday, S, who I told just about everything regarding C to, how I was still in love with her that whole time just about, texted me and asked if he and I could meet up.  We did and he confessed that himself and C had secretly been dating for at least a couple of the months from Feb-July behind my back without telling me, which came out of nowhere to me, and that they had a falling out and that they wouldn't be friends with each other anymore.  He was in tears telling me as he felt so bad for doing that to me, and to be honest, I was pretty pissed at both of them, but I was civil about it with him.  He and I had lunch that next week and talked about it for a while, and he does look up to me since I am older and he and I are in a praise band together.  So a lot of it was me telling him what he did wasn't ok and that if it wasn't me he did it to, I would have actually yelled at him.  I didn't talk to C though, she went on a lake trip that next week and I didn't text her at all as we would usually do, didn't send her memes all the time either, no communication from me to her.  It went like that the next week as well until the next Saturday night, about two weeks after.  She texted me a huge apology out of nowhere, and I was honest with her telling her that I didn't expect her to do that, since I just expected the worst from her at that point.  Later that week she and I talked as well, and everything got cleared up, and I felt closer to her as a result but did my best not to let feelings come through.  However I felt them coming still, and I felt her becoming more friendly and flirty with me as well.  It's a little over a month later now and she and I have hung out multiple times getting lunch and stuff, which we would never do before.  I have strong feelings for her now but don't know whether to pursue them.  If I did, I would go to S and let him know that I was considering this and ask for his blessing, but might do it even if he doesn't.  Should I pursue said feelings, wait it out, or ignore them and move on as best as possible.

This man has no idea what goes on in the actual company or how things even are performed within our business, and I was unable to do a job properly for the time being until I was able to get in touch with our partnering company. 

I provided him with my “only possible suggestion in the meantime” work and it didn’t fit his standards even though the standards could not physically be met at that time and was out of my control. This man is the type to demand i print out a cupcake from google.

I was in an abusive relationship for 7 years and I don’t really reminisce about that much, but I immediately felt taken back and shocked after he said it. I wanted to cry. I was so confused. Regardless if he’s mad about the work or not I felt so uncomfortable from a grown man saying he was going to smack me over a petty task that’s impossible to complete at the moment.

211,"Background: I’m an unmatched medical school graduate who has been trying to get into the top medical specialty for the past three years. My other friends who also went unmatched decided to do research in the field to make our CVs stronger. We each did around 3-years.

This past cycle my two friends were able to successfully match into a program and are currently first year residents. Unfortunately, I didn’t match. One of the programs decided to take me into their program to do research, BUT still want me to do two more fucking years of research. 

One of my friends and I still continue to talk and hang out. However, I’ve found myself becoming extremely resentful about them getting into a program when they had no where near the amount of publications which I had and got in because of political reasons. What really pisses me off is how they don’t even understand basic principles of this medical specialty whereas I do. I’ve found that I’ve helped so many people to increase their research output, &amp; I still have to wait 2 more years to get into a residency. 

I have no desire to help anybody going forward and want to look out only for myself. I absolutely despise that I’ve become this way. I’ve had people reach out to me on wanting to collaborate on projects and ideas. I just want to say no to them. My only priority is to matriculate into a program.

213,"This is a throwaway account and I'm on mobile, so apologies for any formatting issues. Also, sorry for any vagueness. 

A few months ago, around June I believe, I joined a social media platform and started using it as a creative outlet for one of my hobbies. I mainly posted content for a game that has a relatively large fanbase on that platform. Almost immediately, I gained a decent amount of popularity and started to meet other creators who also made content for that fandom. After awhile, I started to notice someone consistently commenting on my posts, I wasn't as popular as I am now so it was nice to see someone enjoying my stuff so much! They seemed really sweet, so I decided to follow them back. 
We'll call this person ""Daisy"". Daisy turned out to be a really well liked person in the community, a lot of the other popular creators were also friends with her and they'd often comment on eachothers posts. She was like the mom of the community and I was so happy to be friends with her aswell! Daisy was lesser known by the larger community, but us creators almost all knew her. 

At first everything was fine, things felt like they were moving a little fast in our friendship, but I thought she might just be a very outgoing person. She called me her friend in our first real conversation, but I was just happy to feel accepted by someone. She'd send me videos titled stuff like ""send this to the nicest person you know"", and I always felt so flattered. I've always been a pretty lonely and vulnerable person, so making a new friend always felt amazing. We'd joke about her being the mom of the fandom we were in and I'd even jokingly call her mom. She was just like a friend who was my age. 

But recently, she's started to make me feel... really uncomfortable. I feel awful for saying that because she's so nice, but everything just feels so weird and I don't know why.... 
Daisy started talking about her problems to me. Someone at work being unreasonably rude to her, suffering a heatstroke while wearing a mask outside, one of her other friends accidentally being rude, etc. Of course, I comforted her. She was a friend, and I needed to cheer her up. I listened to her issues and offered her my support. I tried my best, after all I do this for my other friends as well. However I kinda felt powerless whenever I would try to comfort Daisy, nothing I said would really make her feel better. It felt like she wasn't coming to me to be comforted, but coming to me to vent. 
Whenever I would like a comment or video of hers, she would almost always message me because she knew I was online. It's gotten to the point where I'm scarred to interact with anything she posts. I feel trapped when that happens, like I have to talk to her even if I don't want to because she'll think I'm ignoring her if I don't respond. 
She's 26, and her messaging me like ""I'm bored"" or ""I had a bad day"" makes me feel so anxious and I don't know why...

Daisy's really nice and doesn't mean any harm, but I get so stressed when she messages me and I'm so uncomfortable when talking to her. It's not like I can block her, she'll know I did it and get sad and blame herself. All our mutual friends would find out and I'd be ostracized and outcasted for being mean to someone who did nothing wrong. I don't want to start some unnecessary drama because I'm being irrational. 
It's gotten to the point where I kinda want to leave without a word. Clear my account, delete the app, and never return. However, at the same time, I don't want to leave everything I've created behind.


Is this normal? I don't know what's wrong, am I being irrational?
Apologies for the long post or any typos, but please help me, I'm so confused and I don't why.
Thank you.",11Sep2020,1
214,So basically my mom can escalate a basic situation if she’s in a bad mood and turn it on me. Today my dog was sitting in a chair and she has allergies she told me to get the dog out the chair when I go up for bed. I proceed to continue with my home work and my mom comes back down and starts yelling saying I don’t give a fuck about her and that if I can’t keep my dog in line she’ll keep her in her room all day and take my car keys away .... they don’t correlate in anyway as to why she was angry and she constantly does stuff like  this in an argument atp my mental stability isn’t the best and it really hurts when she yells at me and tells me to shut the fuck up .... Is their a way I can’t tell her to stop yelling at me politely or would it be rude if I just walked away when I told her to stop yelling and she didn’t.,11Sep2020,1

I matched with this really cute and interesting girl on tinder last week and we were having a great conversation and everything seemed to be going super well.

222,"I apologize in advance for how all over the place this post will be, it’s an example of my problem.
My ability to focus has gotten worse than ever in the past few years, especially the past year. It’s never been great but as I’ve gotten older I start to wonder if I have ADD/ADHD or something along those lines. I can hardly talk to someone and stay on topic, I’ll stop mid sentence and forget what I’m talking about completely without a trace. Or I’ll topic jump and never finish my original story. I also get on people’s nerves because I come off as very hyper/enthusiastic about everything I talk about. The list goes on and on. But here’s where one of my main issues starts,

I’ve been in college for 5 years, I’m in my fall semester of my sixth (and final) year now. I started off getting great grades, but as time has gone on, my grades have gotten worse and worse. After getting a C- in both my summer courses I’m really worried.

As I’m entering my third week of school I’ve started really getting worried about my inability to focus on any assignments or lectures. I can’t afford to fail any of my classes as it will prevent me from graduating in the spring. I’m not sure what I can do to help myself focus as I’m not sure if it’s something simple, or if there’s something deeper that’s wrong with me.
If anyone could give me advice or even direct me to another sub that could help me, I would appreciate it greatly! I’m losing a lot of sleep over this just trying to figure out what to do.

TL;DR: I physically can’t focus on anything and I’m afraid it’s going to cause me to fail college.",11Sep2020,1

I feel like i’m in love with my ex but she told me to move on. Fast forward a couple weeks me and this new girl are talking and we’re doing stuff together but not really dating. So am i leading this girl on because i don’t wanna hurt her but also i’m still in love with my ex.,11Sep2020,1
224,"Okay so I have a *small* ""crush"" on this girl that I used to go to school with. We graduated this past June. During the school year when I would walk into my homeroom class every morning, a lot of times I would notice she'd look at me as I would walk in and go to my seat. She would sit up front next to the door and I would sit a good three or four seats behind her. There was ONE morning where she sat right behind me for some reason even though her seat up front was empty and not being used. Anyways, because of the hallways being way to crowded after homeroom would end, I was never able to try and talk to her. I didn't (and still don't) know her (expect for her name and what she looks like), and I shared NO classes with her (even lunch). 

Now with that all being said, I made an Instagram account about two or so weeks ago so I could post a few pictures I took when I was on small family trip the month prior. I did also make this account to see if I could find her instagram as well. After about two minutes of simple searching around, I found her account. At that time when I found her account, it was public. I hesitated on following her.  After waiting a few days I finally decided to follow her. When I did, her account became private so I decided to wait a few more days to see if she ever sets it back to public. After like two days or so, she set it back to public. So with little hesitation, I followed her.

Now it's been about about a week and a half to two weeks ago when I followed her. I have not gotten a follow back. She hasn't had me unfollow her via that button in your followers list, so I guess that's good? Over this period of time that I've been following her, she's only posted about five stories total spaced out across the week and half to two weeks time. The third story I looked at, she then looked back at mine about two minutes after at one in the morning. Ever since then, she hasn't looked at any of my stories.

She doesn't seem to be that active on Instagram, as she doesn't seem to post stories that often, and her last regular post she made was back in the middle of August. Almost a month ago. I made a post on Reddit talking about this asking if I should like one of her posts in hopes to open the door in conversating with her, but people didn't seem to think that was a good idea, and told me I should just wait until she makes another post and like that one. Problem is, I don't know when she'll make another one, and I don't want to just sit around and wait until she does. Others were saying that I should just send her a direct message telling her I like her and basically ask her out. I personally don't think this is a good idea, being the fact that I really don't know her and she doesn't know me. (I don't even have pictures of myself on my account expect for my profile picture which is a picture of me wearing a hat with my hood over it with a COVID-19 mask on. I know, I know, I'll take a regular photo of myself at some point and use that as my profile picture.) I would rather conversate with her for a bit of time, get to know her, then maybe ask her out.

I have this friend who just like me, goes deep into a depression phase. Both of us have chronic depression/ similar backgrounds which is why it stings so much. 

Ok well, we’re both in e marine corps. This shit ain’t for Idfk. The marine corps requires a very specific personality. Ever since the beginning he had told me, “I don’t want to be here” I was like aight, I’ll help you out. I know the medical separation system because I am currently in it for legit medical reasons. 

About 3 days into this depressive phase he finally goes for it. I’m surprised he did but ok. I helped him, I waked him to gunny and he’s like “I’m suicidal” etc. 

The same week, on Thursday nights he cuts me off 100% I’m there SO FUCKING WORRIED about the fucking guy. Dude literally I stood by him DAY AND NIGHT I wish I were fucking joking but I’m not. I sat there, fed him, watched him so he wouldn’t do anything stupid, I literately took care of him bullshit dude while fighting off his people from burning his fucking ass. “Oh please understand him, he’s depressed, anything could tip him over to the other side” because he really was depressed. 

One day i tell my friend to come pick something up at his room(I was pretty much living in their room for reasons already stated) he comes in, I go to open the door and he rushes to open it. I let him go because he often orders pizza. But he opens the door and it’s my friend... I see the depressed guy walking away and out of the corner of my eye I think I see him slightly smiling.. 

Fast forward a few days and today I see him full on laughing when I came unannounced to his room. I go back to my room to cool off and come back a few minutes later. I clap and I say, “not going to lie, that really did hurt” I keep clapping while walking away. 

I drop every single computer component off at their room (we had been planning to build him a gaming pc)  I drop it off and I go to my room. I send him the cashapp request and he sends it. In one of the notes he writes, “I’ll send the rest next paycheck” 

Dude finally talked to me... it’s literally the admission of guilt.. I was right. Dude I had seen it for days prior but I literally didn’t wanna say anything because “no he’s not that type of person” 

So now I’m drunk/kinda. Where the hell am I supposed to go from here now? I don’t even know if I want to try to salvage what’s left of this relationship.",11Sep2020,1
227,"(Sorry for the wall of text, I’m on mobile) 

For context, she lives in a small town in Oregon and she said she was having issues with her WiFi AND her data (which would kinda make sense cause like I mentioned, she lives in a super small town). Basically she told me she had no service, so I had to sit tight for a bit. However, all of my messages on my end said “delivered” and since we both have iPhones, the dots didn’t connect there. I looked it up and turns out if there’s no service, messages shouldn’t say delivered. It’s supposed to say delivered if the notification pops up on the screen, so I messaged her about it basically saying I felt skeptical and the dots didn’t connect. Later in the night she sees my message (around midnight) and totally blows up on me because I was skeptical of her not having wifi access and no data, and that she’s extremely stressed out because she’s been trying to fix her connection to message me more consistently, despite the fact she messaged me a few times that day. In addition to that, the fires near her area are freaking her out. She was extremely upset at me and said that we shouldn’t be pursuing anything if I can’t trust her and last night she told me we should just be friends, despite the fact I pleaded with her to reconsider. Anyways, we both to go to sleep and after thinking it over, I honestly think it would be the best for both of us if we just stayed as friends. We’re both attracted to each other 100%, but we’re fundamentally different people personality wise. At around 11AM today she messaged me saying that she was sorry for being rash, and she won’t end things. She said I’m “not quite out of the doghouse” and that “I’m giving you another chance, although I don’t think I should”, which really rubbed be the wrong way. She shouldn’t be giving me another chance out of obligation, it should be because she wants to continue this as much as I do. 

Anyways, what do y’all think? I’ve never had an online/long distance relationship but I honestly don’t think she should’ve gotten that upset at me, but from what she said, she sounded really stressed out, so I’m super conflicted. I don’t wanna let her go but there have been times in the past where I’ve had issues with my phone and she just didn’t believe me, but somehow in this circumstance it’s okay for her to blow up like that and nearly break up with me?

231,"I know I just posted to this sub an hour ago- sorry about that- but a new event arose and I need advice again.

Pretty much the title- I don’t know if I should go through with sending the playlist or not essentially. 

My bf has recently gone through some shit (his grades aren’t the best as of right now, to put it nicely), and got his guitars taken away. 

This sounds kinda silly at first, but those guitars are emotional crutches for him, as learning and playing guitar helped him out of one of his very bad suicidal moments a few months ago. He plays those gorgeous girls everyday when they’re in reach- and the look on his face when he plays songs is hella funny ( and also sweet tbh) bc he has an awful case of guitar face.

His parents don’t understand that (and bf can’t tell them without them discounting his emotions) and they are overall incredibly apathetic to how he is feeling and his overall mental health. His dad is the definition of toxic masculinity, and his mom sits back and lets it happen. Bf guards his emotions and doesn’t let them out very often in fear of punishment.

I want to help him feel better, and bc this is a long distance relationship, I can’t do very much. Enter the playlist.

I made it a few days ago, before shit hit the proverbial fan, and it’s pretty much just songs that explain/ say/ relate to how I feel about him and our relationship. It’s a very personal thing and I really want to share it with him.

I just don’t know if this is the time to share. On one hand, it could make him feel better about himself and how at least one person views him. On the other, he may take it as me not taking his mental health seriously.

I’m likely overthinking this and should just send him the dam thing, but I want to be 100% sure before I send him something very personal. I don’t want to lose him.

Song and music is very much important to the both of us, for an FYI.

Meanwhile, I am planning to move to a different town where I attend college in less than a week. I am busy packing and getting ready for the move. I am really stressed out by the entire fire situation, combined with the imminent move. 

I overhear my parents talking about how I’m not participating in local volunteer/support events for the victims of the fires. My dad is bringing up how He and my mother are dealing with business so they cannot participate, and saying something along the lines of “just because we aren’t doing it doesn’t mean he (me) doesn’t have to”.

Last week, I was coming in from my lunch and he was like maybe 30’ ahead of me and he was opening the expo door, I asked him to hold it for me since they were locking it that day and I asked him politely. He literally slammed it in my face and when I got inside he said “well, you told me to hold it, didn’t you?” With this fuckin smirk on his face. Another time, I was sitting on the grass next to the building next to us after my shift smoking a cigarette and he comes and shines this flashlight right in my face (I have sensory issues) and screams “WHAT THE FUCK? EMPLOYEES CANT FUCKIN SMOKE ON THE PREMISES”.

This individual and I dated for a short while about 15-16 years ago. The last time I spoke with this person was in 2004/2005, it was a friendly in person conversation. I wanted to say hi and see what this person is up to, but when I googled this person to find a social media account to reach out on, I found an obituary from 2017 instead. It really threw me off because this person was 2 years younger to me, and died at a pretty early age (imo) at 28. 

This individual was mildly important to me for various reasons, but apparently not important enough for me to reach out from time to time over the course of the decade or so that we didn’t speak. I also don’t really know anyone in this person’s family, it was really just a “me and this other person knew each other” type of thing.

Growing up, I was taught that if I find out someone has passed, I should offer condolences to the family. I suppose this is 1) to acknowledge that the person has passed and 2) also a reminder to the family that their loved one is not forgotten. But in those situations, I’ve generally known other people within the family and it wasn’t a person that I had a romantic relationship with, regardless of duration of said relationship.

248,"People have pointed out, and I may agree on that part, I have no self confidence or unconditional love for myself. I can only love me if I fit some objective metrics. The thing is by these metrics I'm doing really well. 

When I compare with people I usually do to find people who are better or worse than me at some aspects (I do this maybe once a year, if i do) and usually I'm happy with where I am. The people who are more prolific than me are people I've met and have goodwill for and they are the kind I don't mind saying are smarter than me cause they have brains and idealism to show for it. They will do great anywhere they are. 

However I am kind of in the top 20% of people I know in 4000, for sure, and maybe 1-5% on some aspects (not net worth. However, everything else.) The people below me, and bottom tier of the network, from the network I don't know, tend to try to compete cause this is their way of showing they are ambitious. I almost sound narcissistic, but let's call some people losers if they are. 

They keep bringing up I'm shy, but I have won awards for extroverted activities, worked in the fields and I think what they think is aspie is just a brain that is very rational for a woman. They don't get much emotional depth from me cause it's hard to convey my emotions online, I'm very expressive tbh. I'm a neurotypical and I tend to get concepts much faster than them, and I find they lack critical thinking, so I usually just explain them things which if anyone did to me I would find insulting, but they just go ahhh and then follow me around. 

I'm not saying I'm the best person in the planet, but when I compare what I have achieved to all of them I'm top percentile or 10% of people they don't know and know. 

I know where I stand, why are they trying to level up? There isn't anything to level up on.",11Sep2020,1

250,"Advice on how to proceed with my dog after he bit me due to a bad sex incident with another dog.

It’s a long story... There’s a 25 year “Joe” old kid who walks his dog down the alley, I see him almost daily walking around the neighborhood. He’s a good kid, mows lawns, cleans, etc . He seen me moving a table out the garage door opposite the ally and asked if I needed a hand... I said sure then opened the gate To let him in.  Our dogs are familar so they were excited.  While helping me move the table  my dog “Champ” started humping his dog. By the time we seen Champ was locked in. Joe dove on the dogs and tried to pull Champ out of the other dog. Champ was in extreme pain. Him and the other dog was locked in while facing opposite directions. Champ took a big bite joes hand due to joe having a handful of champs family jewels. I grabbed Champ’s head as he bit me pretty deep on the arm. I’ve had champ since he was 8 weeks old.  He is almost 4. The sweetest dog ever.  Me and the children wrestle champ, he’s never so much as broke skin on anyone.  He listens and is trained well.",11Sep2020,1

256,"Ok, so bear with me if this gets too long. 

I (27F) met J (25M) recently while on a job out in the field. He and I ended up traveling with one another for a month straight through the duration of this job, and after we finished our field work. 

He has been dating someone since April and I hear a bit about their relationship, but not too much. She doesn’t share the interests that he and I do, but he is trying to get her into them (sorry, I’m keeping this vague). She’s expressed discomfort with our friendship to him, admittedly out of jealousy.

We have similar passions and have become very intuitive with one another because of all of the time we have spent together one on one. I don’t think I’ve ever developed feelings of this caliber for someone who quickly and it is blindsiding me. It’s easy being around him. We’ve had tremendous bonding moments where we problem solve together, exercise communication skills, and just laugh. I feel drunk sometimes just because of how much fun we have together. 

All of this being said, I think he and I have incredible chemistry and could build a really meaningful relationship. I’ll be moving thousands of miles away for a job and I want to ask him to come with me. He is looking for work and has expressed interest in moving where I’m moving next year anyways. 

I’m fearful of missing out on an opportunity but I want to be respectful of his relationship. I don’t want to wonder “what if” I don’t do it, but I’m concerned about compromising our friendship. Odds are I would just mention that I have developed feelings for him and leave it at that, unless it is met positively, in which case I would float it by him.

Either way, I’ll be moving by the end of the year.

Once at a party, we started arguing and I was going to leave. He came and said he was going to hit me if I don’t stay. I would usually argue back and challenge him to think about what he has said but it wasn’t my house so I didn’t want to make a scene and obliged. Because I backed down I felt like he thinks he is the dominate one. He then on went to say how never in his life has he ever wanted to hit a girl so badly until now and how annoying I was. 
I did talk to him about it when we were both sober. His reasoning is that he does that with his guys whenever they are going to do something stupid; like drive home drunk. So it came from a good place right? 
I did have a serious talk with him about that night. I explained to him that I wanted to leave because he was annoying me and I just wanted to go sit in my car until I was good to drive. He said he feels bad about it &amp; that he thinks I’m just one of the guys so he thought it okay. He also said he will try to not do it again but no promises. 

Just the other day I proved him wrong on something stupid &amp; lightly nudged his head a bit. He said if I do that again he was going to knock me out. I thought he was just messing around so I did it again. He stopped walking and looked me dead in the face and told me to never do that again. That’s when I realized he wasn’t playing around. Although he has never laid a hand on me I know he is capable and it worries me sometimes. What if one day I don’t back down? It like he is trying to be an alpha male. 

In our friend group, it’s just the three of us: my guy friend, our other girl friend, &amp; I. 
Our other girl friend treats him a bit more rougher. She once bit and dug her nails into his arms while intoxicated (because he kept bothering) and he was totally cool with it. From time to time (not often) she playfully hits his head really hard and he laughs it off. He has never ever gotten mad at her. Not even a bit!

How come when I do something minor he gets easily mad or irritated at me? 

I just don’t understand him. Sometimes I just can’t read him. I do care about him a lot. I don’t know how to be a friend to him. He thinks I care too much and am too considerate towards him. So I decided to pull back from the friendship but he also gets mad and annoyed.

261,"I made the huge mistake during my high school years of getting involved in the ""Brony"" fandom. I was already pre-exposed to this stuff due to a bit of furry exploration during freshman year, so it kinda just clicked with me. I loved the art and wanted more.

Unfortunately this lead me to getting deep into ""clop"", or My Little Pony porn. There was just so much of it, and all my favorite artists from both furry and now pony were drawing it. I started off hating that they were doing it, then started appreciating the art, then started appreciating the ponies themselves, and before I knew it I was obsessed. I had ~15gb of the stuffed saved. This was basically exclusively all I was into for almost 5 years. Hell, I didn't even really like the show. I just loved the pony body type and combining cute with lewd essentially.

Around a year ago after my GF found out, I agreed that I had a problem. We deleted the clop collection together, and I focused on her. I didn't realize how damaged I was though not having that outlet. Eventually we broke up for other reasons, but I kept up the avoiding clop art. Stuck to bland dating app flings and much less enjoyable regular porn. Like way less enjoyable. Kinda ""I'm watching this but thinking of clop instead"". Honestly sometimes I just can't get into it at all. And it's only getting worse. The human form is becoming more and more unappealing to me as I crave what I deleted. Like I have a massive pile of regret and just want to go rebuild my collection and be happy again.

I feel like I may have damaged by brain during those sexual development years. Like I have this stupid fetish or hell, even orientation toward a body type that doesn't exist in humanity and only exists in virtual art.

Myself (m26) and my girlfriend (f25) mutually agreed that for her birthday last week it might be fun to try a threesome. 
Before I get into that I just want to point out super quickly that we’ve been together for a bit over 2 years. Since we started dating I’ve always had problems “finishing”. I always make sure she finishes and is satisfied but I’ve only “came” about 4 or 5 times from sexual activity’s with her.

271,"I’m going to start off with a few facts. I live in a kind of rural/suburban area where public transport is not an option. I’m at the top of my class in school, take very difficult classes, have a lot of extracurricular salons with a part time job.
I have tried to talk to my parents about getting a third car many times. They basically refuse to hear me out. I have been saving up money from my job, but the only way I could afford a car that they approve of (they won’t let me buy a used car that they think is too old or “dangerous” to drive) is if they help me out with the money. But they refuse to. 
I am trying to balance 3 very time consuming extracurricular activities (2 sports and 1 after school activity) along with working 20 hours a week. Most days, I have to drive between multiple places. On some days, I literally will be driving from my after school sport, to my other sport, then to work and then home. I don’t have my own car and my parents yelled at me and told me I’m so selfish because I’m wasting their time since they either have to give up their car or they have to drive me around and wait for me (the places are not close to each other so they have no option but to drive me and wait). Yet I can’t drive myself because then I’m taking their car away from them. 
I told them that getting a 3rd car would make their lives so much easier, but they screamed at me saying I’m threatening them, and told me to pay for it myself. But I only have $2000 to spend on a car right now, and every car I’ve wanted to buy, they won’t let me. I don’t know what to do because I’m sick of waiting forever for them to pick me up, and then having them hold it over my head saying they sacrificed so much time to drive me there. My mom has a habit of losing/not answering her phone, and multiple times last year I waited anywhere from 1-6 hours for her to finally show up. 
The only reason I got my job was so I could save up for a car. But my parents hate that I have this job. They ridicule me for working a “low level” job, and say I’m just wasting my time because I should be focusing on school. When I tried to quit one of my extracurriculars, they yelled at me. 
When they told me they’d have to drive me to and from school, I asked if they would be able to keep track of when I end school and remember to pick me up. They said “we can try but we can’t promise anything.” 
Here’s a specific example: On Friday I have to go to my sport practice right after school, I get out of school at 2, it’s a half hour away and I have to be there at 2:30. My dad said he would come to my school (after work for him) at 2, then I would have to drive the car home, drop him off, then go to practice. I told him I’d be late if I did that, since they’re in 2 opposite directions. The only way I’d be on time is if he drives me there and back, but he would have to wait an hour and a half since it’s a waste of time for him to drive all the way home and back (half hour both ways). He told me I was being selfish and wasting his time. I can’t change the time I have practice. The only way I could get there is if I drove to school and then straight there after school, but obviously I don’t have a car to do that. 
Someone please tell me what I can do, because the whole situation is stressing me out so much and I’m sick of my parents yelling at me for needing to drive/be driven places. I literally feel like the only way they would be happy is if I stayed home and did nothing, yet I still feel like I’m in the wrong because they keep calling me selfish. 
If anyone’s wondering what we used to do, last year I didn’t have a job and I only had 2 main extracurriculars: one was after school, and I had one sport but I only got to go if they could drive me, which meant only once or twice a week. This whole summer I’ve been doing all the things I love and I just don’t want to have to give it all up because of school and my parents.",11Sep2020,1

So last year when I was 15, I met this grown man and we became friends. Over the months it slowly turned into a very unstable, and obviously unequal relationship. There was a huge age gap and he used my lack of experience and my immaturity to manipulate me and he emotionally hurt me a lot.

I had no idea of what a healthy relationship should look like, and he took advantage of that. I'm not sure how to get into the details because I still haven't been able to even fully grasp what happened. But a lot of manipulation was involved on his part, and constantly blaming me for how he behaved and making me feel guilty and abusive when he was the one playing with mt feelings. I was crying myself to sleep every night and it hurt a lot.

He also used to sext me a lot, despite how objectified and unloved it made me feel. No matter how many times I told him that it made me uncomfortable, he'd apologize but start it again in a few days. It was constant and used to make me cry every night too. I felt used, like a piece of meat, because I loved him deeply and wanted to feel loved in return too, but he never made me feel that way. He'd just make me feel like I don't matter beyond my body to him.

But that's not the point, the point is that I was a 15-year-old minor and the more time passes, the more I start to realise how wrong it was.

For those who, at this point, are going to tell me that it was my fault, please just don't. I don't know if it was my fault but I don't need that, I can't stop crying.

Anyway, I felt very used and lonely throughout the relationship and not a single day would pass when I didn't cry. It felt terrible. Then in late February, he abruptly ended things, pinned the blame on me, and ghosted me. 

Now he has a girlfriend, I just found out a couple of days ago. It's not that I'm jealous. I'm not seeking revenge.

279,"This is my first post on reddit and I just hope this gets some attention. It’s not as flashy as some other posts but I’d really like some help. 


This feels so dumb as I write it but I really need help. I’m a senior in high school and don’t know what I want to do with my life. I live in a good neighborhood, go to a good school, and get good grades but I feel like I don’t matter. I’ve got it easy here while some brilliant kid is being abused in some other country that wants to have a life. Why do I get to wallow in my sadness while I contribute nothing to society? Should I even go to college? Will I be successful? At times I feel urges to make a difference but what can I really do? I’m a nobody with social issues that can’t please his parents or friends. I have a lot of girl friends but have never had a girlfriend. The girls like to tease me about it (in good nature) and ask me why, but the truth is just embarrassing. I am a heterosexual male but my problem is the relationship itself. I feel as if once I’m in a relationship and it goes south I’ll lose this person forever and I hate that. I am known for being friends with everyone and I don’t want to throw it all away. So I guess you can add this to the list to. Honestly I’m just sick of being useless, but I have little passion for anything anymore. I believe that life is the most precious gift you can get but mine just seems wasted on me. 

Anyway I know this post was a mess but don’t hate me too much I guess. Any advice or answers would be very helpful. Even broad answers to why we are here on this planet would be nice. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",11Sep2020,1

284,"So long story short I met this girl and we talked for a while. I caught feelings and we dated for a while but she told me she needed space. I tried giving her the space but she kept inviting me to go do shit and even invited me on a mini vacation thing with her. During this trip she was being all touchy with me and told me she had feelings but about halfway through she started talking about needing space again.

At this point I was starting to feel weird about everything and question if she even liked me at all. I asked and she said yes which didn’t really help at. After the trip I saw she posted a quote from twitter that read, “They want me but I want you” which was a massive red flag to me. I asked her who it was about and she told me she was “just posting shit”. 

I stopped talking to her for a few days and eventually found out she still has feelings for her ex. It’s clear to me now that she put me through all of that and lead me on just so she could make me out to be some man whore she didn’t want. In reality she confessed her “feelings” to me multiple times and invited me on multiple dates. 

I was used to make her look better to her ex. I feel like she never had feelings to begin with and it makes me sad and pissed off. This whole thing really fucked with my self esteem. It feels like she thought I would be easy prey and it wouldn’t be hard to fuck with me and lead me on like she did. This along with the fact that I had REAL feelings... it sucks, this whole thing sucked ass.

We absolutely love the AirBnB. It’s a room in a quaint apartment in the city we love, just walking distance from all our favorite destinations. We’ve even talked about extending our stay for a few months longer.
Our host is nowhere to be seen, but we know someone is staying in the apartment too because we keep finding coffee filters in the trash. Feels like we’re living with a ghost, but not much to complain about because that allows us to have the whole place to ourselves practically. 
But tonight while I was walking down into the lobby, I saw a newly posted sign stating that the building strongly prohibits AirBnB guests and violates tenants’ lease agreements and is potentially against the law in the area we are staying in. We haven’t interacted with anyone in the building or made any kind of ruckus for any residents to know that we were only guests.
Kinda stuck here and having a bit of a moral dilemma tbh. We love the place and it’s in our price range and don’t really have anywhere else to stay.

the problem is i’m also cutting myself off as in socially isolating myself by doing this so i got snap and insta again after like a month. i still can’t handle the apps lol, one i’ll get lost scrolling and scrolling mindlessly and the other i get super anxious when people don’t respond and i’m really needy over snap cuz i get hella lonely and the only friend i had i had to cut ties with her cuz i liked her and i had to move on but now i don’t really have anyone to talk too and i’m trying to focus on my passions instead of losing myself and using snap or insta but it’s so hard. 

idk what to do cuz it’s better for my mental health if i don’t use snap insta etc. but at the same time it feels terrible cuz i’m socially isolated and i can’t talk to anyone. for some reason people don’t like text/over the phone and i guess it’s just not the same/they feel less comfortable. i also can’t meet new people just thru text etc. i also have a big validation/low self esteem problem which is kinda amplified by snap but i manage it. i used to have an app called Yubo (tinder for teens basically ik it’s fucked) and i loved talking to new people every day but it was super unhealthy and i wouldn’t sleep or eat or do anything except that app. idk what to do so does any one words of wisdom? appreciate it if you made it this far.",11Sep2020,1

296,"Throw away account here. 

I (21F) am with my SO (21M) of almost 5 years. Our relationship as a whole is fine. I love him and truly only want to be with him for the rest of my life. Hes very respectful, always makes me laugh and is easy to live with. I guess the catch is that I'm a bit bored. He doesn't like to show much intimacy and love aside from sex or just goofing off. We dont have sex very often because I'm overweight and have body image issues which fucks up my sex drive. I've also been on birth control pills for over 4 years and that fucks up my sex drive. Hes completely understanding and never tries to force sex if I'm not in the mood BUT hes constantly and randomly like ""hey I want sex"". It honestly only just makes me feel pressured even though it's not his intention. I've communicated this to him and he said he understood. He just feels unwanted because I dont initiate sex often. I told him I understand that and have been trying to be better at it. 

He still continues to do the ""I want sex"" consistently. I've communicated to him I swear a hundred times over the years that I feel like he's not as romantic and intimate as he used to be. I don't feel desirable aside from sex and that's just not enough for me. 

I also have some confusing feelings about marriage. As of a year ago, I was pretty against the idea but recently I've been really in love with the idea of him being my husband. I havent really navigated those feelings completely. Maybe I really just want some sort of thoughtful gesture from him or opportunity to actually communicate hes serious about me??? 

I guess what I'm worried and sad about is that we're just going to sizzle out as a couple and just be friends with benefits, that we're never going to get married and hes never going to appreciate me as more than just a sex partner and best friend.

301,"So my boyfriend and I receive counseling from different people. We talk to them via video chats at home. Lately I feel that his counselor doesn't like me and is making light of everything going on. My boyfriend (ill say john) emotionally cheated on me with his friend of 5 years and for us to be together, I said all contact must be severed. He did so. Now his counselor seems to be painting me as a paranoid person amd controlling for having me get rid of her. Even though they had sexual skype chats and it was negatively affecting our relationship. He says that you must be forgiving in a relationship and not hold it over someone if they cheated. He goes on to say that if I had a few affairs over the years then it would still be good to just forgive. Like wtf? 

He calls me controlling when I request my boyfriend spend more time with me than his friends. I talked to my own counselor about it who even encouraged a compromise about it so we would both be fulfilled but apparently to johns counselor, im controlling. We generally only have 1 day off at the same time together on Sundays so I just wanted that to be our day 2 times a month. I feel like compared to my counselor who actually helps me in communication and not to ever sound accusatory toward my boyfriend...johns counselor seems more focused on trying to paint me as toxic and controlling.

Growing up most things came naturally to me: art, sports, school, making friends, talking to adults, etc. and my brother wasn’t really interested so he didn’t really try to do anything like that so my parents always compared him to me. My dad kinda doted on me when he was home but otherwise my Mom favored him so i don’t think it was from lack of attention. Anyway in the past few years after my parents divorced he and my dad (our custodial parent) fought a lot and that took its toll on everyone. He was doing bad in school, never left the house, picked fights, it was getting bad. But 2 years ago he ran away from my dads and finished high school with our mother. Then our grandfather died (he basically raised us) and he broke his arm while doing training for firefighting and then everything went down hill...again. He started smoking cigarettes, cigars, dipping, drinking. All that stuff, we didn’t really know, we knew he tried it but we didn’t know how big of a problem it was. And then last week he got drunk and quit his new job and ran away again. I talked to him for the first time in a week tonight and he said that he’s an alcoholic and he’s addicted to nicotine because he turned to it Bc our dad was so harsh on him. I can’t help but feel that indirectly it’s my own fault because even through our teen years he was compared to me all the time Bc I’m “better at school, more friendly, artsy, funny, etc” but I’m really not? I’m kind of a mediocre person so I feel like if the people in our lives didn’t think that I weals like that then maybe he wouldn’t be an addict? I don’t know if this makes sense or not.

305,"My roommate and I moved in together last summer for college but we've been friends since high school. 

Everything had been going quite well until the COVID lockdown happened and then classes had been done online from home. Not a big deal, we're both adults and are able to coexist quite well. His parents however were a bit worried about the whole COVID thing so they wanted him home for a while to be someplace safer than an hour and a half away from our hometown. A fair request, all in all, however that left me alone in our apartment away from home taking care of his fish while he was gone. It's not a big deal, just feeding them (he came back every so often for a weekend to clean and maintain the tanks). 

I figured if I was dealing with his 4 fishtanks for an undetermined amount of time that there shouldn't be a problem if I got a cat for therapeutic reasons (I suffer from anxiety and depression and have always had a cat around so living without one isn't something I'm used to) since I'd be alone for a while.

Anyway, I got the kitten and he is quite chaotic but very lovable so he keeps me on my toes and keeps me busy. However, during the times where neither of us are home and we're visiting family I bring my cat with me to my parents' place. My parents however have an outdoor cat which led my cat to have fleas.

My roommate and I have tried a few methods for getting rid of the fleas while I'm out of town so the solution has time to work on the fabrics of the furniture. My cat has had flea treatments done and a good combing every so often but none of these have worked. 

My roommate is quite irritated by the lack of success that he's started looking for a new apartment. I don't want there to be a schism between my roommate and I but I genuinely don't know what course of action I should take. I understand that he has as much of a say in how things go around the apartment as I do so I'm more than willing to compromise.

308,"i (m16) dont know if i should text my ex friend (f16) again to repair things between us

sorry if this is messy i’ve never made a reddit post before.

trigger warning: suicide, self harm, and possible manipulation

i (m16) miss my ex friend and idk whether to text her and try to repair things or at least apologize for my shitty behavior. we started hanging out and being friends when we were about 14 or 15. after a while we started dating and i actually saw a future with her. then my friends left because they didnt like the way she treated me or them (she is the type of person to make fun of someone as a joke and im not the type of person to communicate if something hurt my feelings). then we broke up because she had fell out of love with me and it turns out she was a lesbian and im ftm transgender and she originally thought of me when we first started dating as a woman. she didnt tell me this at the time and said she wanted to break up because she wanted to wait to be in a relationship until senior year so we could mature and be more serious. after we broke up my friends and i reconciled and i apologized for picking her over them. eventually she did start calling me by my proper name and pronouns and it was probably because at the time she was dealing with her own gender issues. after we had broken up i was heart broken even though i knew the relationship wasnt the best because i genuinely believe she was my first actual love. she would get pissed off with me for no reason and make fun of me and other things i’ve repressed. 
after a good amount of healing time without her, she reached out wanting to be friends again and i agreed because i like to be on good terms with people. after talking for a while and i had gotten into another relationship by then, she told me everything i did wrong in our relationship and told me that if i lost weight she would be more willing to get back together with me sooner. i was still not entirely over her and i was a bit of an asshole for getting into a relationship before being ready but i still maintained my relationship after that, just with worse self esteem. (that relationship didnt work out btw.)
we still were friends after that and things carried on as usual. then in my sophomore year (16) right before covid happened i broke down and told her i didnt want to be friends anymore because i couldnt stand to be hurt anymore and i couldn’t heal from her. she got pissed and we argued like we were doing for a month before anyway and eventually i just stopped talking to her and blocked her so i wouldn’t be tempted to talk to her again.
about last april we had started talking again (in a friendly way because she had a girlfriend by then) and we reconciled and my friends didn’t approve but they accepted it. then i had got a girlfriend and then we all were talking as friends and my then current gf got pissed at my ex because she didnt want to block a specific person and my ex encouraged her to bc that ex was toxic. my ex had a point but i did side with my gf because ultimately it was her life and her decision and me and my ex were not talking as much. then my gf at the time broke up with me. she lied about it originally but it was because she only saw me as a friend. i was hurt again but not as bad as before. 
i got over her and then about june or july we were talking normally and i was feeling shitty we were arguing and i did accidentally manipulate her once during the conversation but i apologized and then continued talking and arguing. we were arguing about how i felt like some of my other friends didnt care about me or listen to me and she was disagreeing and i told her i wanted to stop arguing bc it always put me in a bad place and she wouldnt stop and i shouldve stopped responding but i didnt. (tw) eventually i got to a point where i was talking about wanting to kill myself and she then said i was trapping her in the friendship bc she was afraid i would kms if she left and i told her she wasn’t responsible for me and it was unlikely i would do anything and that she could leave and so she did. i previously had talked to her about my issues with suicidal thoughts and self harm and she had always tried to help so i assumed i could this time. 

i dont know how to summarize this for those wanting to avoid all the text honestly. i dont know if i should get back in contact because i miss her greatly as a friend because she was nice and we had fun together and she usually was super supportive. please help i dont know what to do.

My boyfriend hates when I straighten my hair. My hair is naturally curly, &amp; I hate it. I’m 18. From the ages of like 14 ish I have straightened my hair every single day. Like literally. FRIED HAIR 😂😂. (No, it really isn’t isn’t fried, but my curls are very undefined and loose.) anyways, he loves my curly hair. We’ve “compromised” and I typically only straighten my hair twice a month. My boyfriend knows how I hate my appearance with my curly hair. I’ve explained to him how much confidence I get when I straighten my hair.. but nine times outta ten he still refuses to let me straighten it.

I’ve been off work for a month due to Covid. I kept getting positive tests and wasn’t able to leave the house, interact with coworkers/friends, go to work, etc.. &amp; FINALLYYYYYYY I get the call, I can go back to work !!!!!! I wanted to make myself feel good &amp; straighten my hair. 

We was having a good night and I was like, “I’m gonna straighten my hair” &amp; he didn’t like that. He said something rude and I just replied with a smart comment. He said something else &amp; so did I... and then he goes,

“I think you’re ugly with your hair straightened“ “I didn’t want to tell you but it’s true”

I froze. Tears instantly fell. I walked out of the room and I sat alone and cried silently. I got up to get my phone and he seen me crying. He stopped me from walking out the door and I kept whispering, “I just want you to leave me alone” “please leave me alone” “you don’t understand how bad I need you to leave me alone right now”. He just held me &amp; kept telling me he wasn’t leaving me alone. I was shaking and it was getting harder to breathe, I kept begging. &amp; then I fell to the floor and I cried. I could add the dramatic details, but it seems like too much. Basically, I screamed, wailed, sobbed, cried and bawled in a ball on the floor.

My heart broke because he took something that he KNEW made ME feel beautiful and smashed it in less than 5 seconds. In one sentence. With two words. 

I just don’t know what I should do. My heart hurts and my body aches. It hurts when I breathe. Idk if I’m being over dramatic, but I just feel so broken inside.",11Sep2020,1
315,"A few days ago I asked a question on the askreddit subreddit 

 ""Why doesn’t summer feel like summer anymore? It used to be bright yellow and it's just like white now, why?""

and A person replied this-

""There is a Portuguese comic book series entitled ""The worst world's band"" (A  prior banda do Mundo), composed by tiny stories, most one page, but rather deep and philosophical in ti's themes.

One of those snippets shows 2 men watching children play, I think on the beach, and they comment that summers, these days, are not as warm as they used to be when they were children.

In a box, the invisible commentator remarks that what they don't understand is that it was not the summers that were warmer, it was their blood.

So, there's your answer.""

It was pretty accurate(that's what I think).

I want to feel the summer again, It's maybe in my head but I can't help it, I want to experience the summer just once again.

How can I do it? I don't know.",11Sep2020,1

317,"Hi there everyone. I don't usually post onto subreddits, because I'm really hard on myself when it comes to making sure everything looks \*perfect\* or that it will surely make sense to other people. That definitely hinders me when it comes to matters like these. However, I'm just going to give this a shot and I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read or respond.

Lately, I've been feeling so disconnected or just plain lost in life. I'm a 21 year old M who has gone through a lot of sudden loss and changes in my life recently. On top of everything that's happening externally in the world, I guess I just feel so powerless and am struggling to regain that feeling. I lost my mom in a really public fashion a year ago, my dad is about to be serving time in prison, my GF of 4 years broke up with me a couple months ago, and my college education hasn't really been what I'd hoped it would be. I have been going to therapy over the last year or so and it has really helped me get back onto my feet, yet I still feel like I have so much work to do to get to the place I want to be. I'm in the last year of my bachelor's program and I still feel like I don't quite know what I want to do once I get to graduation day and get on with my life.

I suppose that me making this post is more of a cry for feedback or similar experiences from others that can relate in some way or another. I don't reach out enough when I need help (a definite defense mechanism of mine) and my friend group (who I feel very fortunate to have) doesn't always satiate that need for deep, personal talks and emotional connection. I would love to make more friends in person that help fill this need, but this is obviously a difficult time to do so. I want to feel that I can see that light at the end of the tunnel, but I don't know if I can at this moment.

So, here I am tonight. A little drunk, listening to Elliot Smith, and looking for some sort of interaction...

Wishing the best for you all &lt;3",11Sep2020,1
318,My grandfather recently swore me to secrecy and told me that he was giving me his entire inheritance. I am part of a very small family and he is keeping out his own two children and one other grandchild (my sibling). I will be getting whatever money he leaves me as well as his house. I am in my early 20’s and my sibling is in his thirties. We both live with my grandfather but my sibling has never left home before. My family entirely expects to receive inheritance and I even hear them talking about what they will do with the house when my grandfather dies. When I receive the inheritance I do not want to share any of the money and I definitely don’t want any one of them living with me (which probably means kicking out my brother) this is all very stressful and I need advice on how I should go about dealing with this situation.,11Sep2020,1
319,"My ex girlfriend is a friend of mine. We broke up a long time ago, it’s been a couple years. I want to rape her and choke her to death. I have so much latent anger, not just at her. She’s the main person I fantasize about though.

I don’t know how to stop that. These thoughts are sort of intrusive as in I can’t make them go away. They don’t make me uncomfortable though, because I like thinking about it. She should be afraid for her safety.

I’ve told therapists about this but I never mentioned having plans. If it were to come to it, I would know exactly what to do. My self control is immense. I’m nice, friendly, and funny but I fucking hate everyone around me. Therapists are completely worthless just like everyone else.

I’m always looking for something to spend money on. I often before I’m paid say “I’m gonna put aside this much” but I always end up using that as well. I once saved over 500 dollars for about a week before temptation gave in and I touched it. I’ve never held over 5000 dollars in my bank account, and I want to move out of my moms house next year but I’m preventing myself from moving forward... where can I put money where I can’t touch it?

Now — there is nothing wrong with needing medication to help ; it’s not that. 
But I feel discouraged because I wanted to be able to get through it without pills. 

I keep having those what if questions pop into my head like ‘What if the meds make me worse?’

324,"So we're dating for about 7 months now and I'm very happy to be with her. She had trouble with her past experiences of other guys and I'm very new to her because I'm not like the other boys that she hasn't met. I understood that I just kept being me. As time goes by, she said she's possessive and anxious about me and I said its alright since I won't leave her for anyone else and I asked her to put faith in me.

So yesterday, I chatted an old friend who is a girl (F16) and I was just checking up her if she was doing well. She said she was behind classes because of how she studies. We have a self pace online learning so we can learn on our own pace. I'm almost done with a few subjects left while she was doing it slowly but well. I told her that I can help her so that she can catch up and finish quickly and she agreed.

I told my girlfriend that I was up late last night because I was helping my friend with her studies and work. She got jealous and I thought we can brush this off because she's just a friend. She then keep telling me that she's scared of losing me and that my friend might take me away from her which is clearly false. I told her to not worry about it because I'm just helping her with her academics (I also try my best to help her even if she's young). This happens a few times now that I'm used to it. But she just keeps making excuses and blaming her past experience as to why she acts this way. She keeps saying she'll just go and let me be. Its just repetitive at this point and its very tiring. I keep changing and adapting to her liking but I just can't kick my friend out, its just plain rude.

I told her a lot of times to change and she said that its hard for her. I understood that but this happens a few times in the past month that I'm very surprised nothing has changed. I'm just getting tired at this point. She keeps saying she'll just leave and let me be and that her mind and heart are conflicting because of what I did. I really do love her, don't get me wrong, I just can't keep doing this over and over and not expect anything from her. She keeps apologizing and blaming herself, I just wanna do what I want and help people from my school. 

This also happened when I just chatted with my new classmate who was a girl. We just discussed a few things because of our group work and this happened when I talked about it. She just can't brush these things off when its minor. She makes a big deal about it and I understand she thinks this way because of her past experiences. I just need help with her, this is making me tired

Girlfriend gets jealous and made a big deal about me helping my friend and I want her to change and not overreact",11Sep2020,1
325,"Yesterday a friendship that meant a lot to me ended, and I have to say it hurt. Basically, the person was really passive about everything we (me and another friend) were saying, and kept just texting “Ok”. We were super angry at the time, and kept trying to get them to converse with us, but they really wouldn’t. It got to the point where we both eventually said that we couldn’t handle the mental drain that friendship with them was causing. They said “Ok”. 

We went on to ask if they even cared, which something we’ve expressed as a concern in the past because of how they’ve reacted when other friends they “cared about” walked away, and they said they already thought about our friendship ending and “accepted it”.

Basically, they were ready for it to end before the conversation even started. 

It hurt a lot knowing that someone I care about so much had already accepted that our friendship was over before it actually even was. And it hurt more that they didn’t even seem to care either.

We got even angrier because we had literally expressed our concerns about this before, and in the midst of it they went “I have school in ten minutes.” To which I responded “We ALL have school in ten minutes!!!” Which didn’t really change much. One thing led to another, and after some angry messages on our side they went “Ok. Goodbye.” And I felt my heart shatter. I just really thought they would have even an OUNCE of care for our friendship, but they really just let it go.

A couple minutes later, we decide to make sure they don’t post any lies of Facebook about the encounter (something they have a habit of doing) and we find out that WE both got un-friended. We weren’t planning on reaching out or anything, but it really was just salt to the wounds at that point. There’s a lot more from the past few months that make this all really complicated, but that would make this post way too long.

Tldr: A friend that I cared a lot for was completely okay with our friendship ending, and it hurts.",11Sep2020,1

334,"19 year old male here. I took my grandma to burger king the other day and I saw a cute girl at the drive through window. She was about my age as far as I could tell. A few days later I went back to get more food, but really I just wanted to ""ask her out"". I got my food and I said I was tipping her 5$ because she's there all the time and she's always so nice. The 5$ actually had a piece of paper with my IG info in it because that's my go to. She was like ""Oh thank you haha"" with a smile and a laugh, which leads me to believe I'm not being creepy. That was like at noon, but all day she didn't add me. Side note: I'm not a bad looking dude. I'm fairly muscular and my skin is clear, so I'm pretty sure appearance isn't a worry. It is very possible she didn't see the note. I mean it was small and I only folded the 5$ once so it could've fallen out. Anyways the next day, my grandma wants to go to Burger King but I'm not complaining lol she was like ""can you pick up food"" and I was like ""YES..I mean yeah sure uh hum."" So I go, of course the girl is there again, and she hands me the bag of food. It's a drive through so even though there's almost always no one in line, I always keep the small talk to 20 seconds or so. I work up the courage to end it with ""hey I know you're always working, but if you ever want to hang out after just lmk."" She smiled, nodded, and said ok. I drive off and I'm thinking well if she doesn't have my info how could she do that? If she does, what is she waiting for. If she is taken, why not just say it. It's possible she's being polite and doesn't want to embarrass me, but she also seems really shy so I doubt she talks to many guys. I also am starting to feel creepy lol what if she hates our interactions and she just hides it, or worse I don't pick up on it. I'm not good at talking to girls and I'm a really shy guy. If I can't escape the convo, like driving away from the drive through, chances are I wouldn't be able to talk to them. I swear to god she smiles every time though. Right before I asked her to lmk if she wants to hang out, she paused and it looked like she was waiting for me to say something. Idk I'm pretty confused. To make matters worse, they gave me the wrong bag, so I had to go back to BK like 10 minutes later. I pulled up to her window and I was like ""I think I got the wrong bag"" and she was like ""uh yeah you did hah. park and we will bring it out to you."" It wasn't her who brought it out, so that sucks. I feel like when we talk she likes me, but if we keep it to the usual ""you had the number 1 whopper bla bla chicken fries bla bla bla ok have a good day"" then I get confused.

339,"I have been living away from my mum for a year, and during that time she has occasionally been bringing me food, whether it’s home-cooked meals or store bought groceries. The problem is that she brings very large amounts of food, and now way too often. 

It’s just me and my brother living together, and we cannot finish the food, which leads to it becoming accumulated in the fridge and cabinets to an unbearable amount. The food eventually becomes spoiled and our freezer is filled to the brim. It has become unmanageable, and it’s a never ending cycle of hoarding that is progressively getting worse. 

I’m a student and my brother is out for majority of the day due to work, so neither of us can or is willing to clean out the fridge frequently. Even if we do manage to clean it out (which was possible in the early stages), that’s just a sign for my mum to bring even more food to stock up. 90% of the cooked food ends up becoming spoiled, and the packaged foods are really random so no one eats it but it feels too much of a waste to throw out. 

Both my brother and I constantly request our mum to stop bringing food, but she always dismisses it with the excuse that we can’t provide for ourselves and it’s to save money. When in actual fact it’s a waste of money, time, effort, and just stress for us. I’ve explained to her several times the situation, but she’s too stubborn and sometimes even gets mad and hurt at how the cooked food gets to an inedible state and we have to throw it out. Throwing out anything is an absolute no-no for her because she has a hoarder’s mentality. She ends up taking the spoiled food with her and only god knows what she does with it.

The hoard is already stressful enough, but it restricts me from having a healthy diet because I feel obligated to eat the food she brings me and I don’t want to add onto the load with my own groceries. I also feel terribly guilty having to throw out the food, when it can be avoided in the first place. 

All we be good if she just stopped bringing us food because it saves us the stress and saves her the effort. I don’t know how to deal with this situation or bring change to her stubborn mindset. Any advice would be appreciated.",11Sep2020,1

First off, Ill get into relationships trying to make them last forever, I think its pointless to date somebody for the fucks of it. But when I get moments to think, Ill think about everyone Ive dated in the past, people that I “loved”. People I told that they were actually my first love after all. Ill compare the differences between both the people and try to determine which one was actually there for me, or actually cared about me and felt the way they said they felt about me and only me.

Now saying this, I sound very depressed. But I assure you Im not, every now and then when I catch that moment to think, maybe Ill be looking at the stars or arguing with my current girlfriend.

Finally met someone who i couldnt let go, but now im so scared im about to mess things up. I find it a bit hard to read emotions and cant express mine very well because of certain things from when i was little, so social things with people i dont know stress me out cause i dont want to say or do anything wrong.

Anyway, today i asked him if he wanted to stay over while i was home alone. So he knows im free. Then he asked me if i wanted to hang out and watch the game and meet all his friends at someones house, then we can go back to mine.

Last time he asked me to meet up to meet his friends i said i was really busy, but i was just way too nervous..i felt so bad cause he was excited for me to meet them..
Plus because he is my first bf, im really out of my depth in the way that i dont know if im going to fast or too slow. Is meeting the friends a big step? Cause it feels huge to me.

Now, I couldnt say no to tonight, he knows im free, and Im not going to back out. But im so worried I cant stop shaking. I dont think I'll fit in and I'll just make everything weird and awkward.

Im so nervous. I just dont know how to not feel like this. I want to get along with them but i know im really different.
Has anyone been in a situation like this? I dont really know what else to ask specifically, my mind is all over the place, any advice would help really.
Thank you everyone ♡",11Sep2020,1
349,"I have been wanting to adopt a cat for a while. So last Tuesday I did. 

She is nice and sweet. I love her. I immediately fell in love with her right when I saw her without even being able to pet at petsmart adoption center due to covid. 

She felt comfortable right away at my place. 

Yet I did not know that cats stay up at night and good sleep is really crucial for me. Her first night with me, I let her sleep in my room with me but she woke me up and jumped around me while I was sleeping so I had to kick her out of my room. The next thing I know she is making a mess at the kitchen and wont stop meowing. I got up and told her to stop. After 45 mins to an hour maybe I woke up again to very loud noise at the kitchen because she is playing with the cabinet doors. 

I tried following tricks I read online to make her make less noises at night but she still would. 

I haven’t had quality sleep for days and I have school and work. 

I also have to go home soon and help out my parents back home and I don’t have anyone who I can leave her with. 

Now I know I should surrender her back. But I feel like I am already attached to her and I feel really bad having to surrender her again. But then again, I know I should. 

I am literally tearing up. 

Do you all know if shelters are currently accepting animals/cats during covid? 

Thank you!",11Sep2020,1

351,"I have a serious anxiety disorder that I'm currently in therapy for. 

I've recently been doing exposure therapy. I started off light and it's been very successful. My therapist asked me to pick another situation and expose myself to it.  

I mentioned that the next level of issues that I have are related to social situation such as walking around places with lots of people or taking to people at shops. I was then advised to go and speak to people as this will of course expose me to that fear. 

I'm almost in my mid 20s and I've never approached or spoken to a woman that I've liked in my whole life. 

I hope I don't sound arrogant when I say this, but I've been told that I'm a really good looking guy. I get looks from a lot of women all time. The issue is that I just can't build up the courage to speak to them. I just look away and carry on walking or I would just try to avoid them as much as possible.

353,"First off, I would like to say that I have never posted anything like this anywhere before so I’m really nervous (also sorry for the length).

So I (f) am on my early twenties and I’m currently in the middle of my college studies, I’m sort of shy and it takes me time to get comfortable to others but I’ve never had a hard time getting friends. The friend in question is a really extroverted and outgoing girl a few years younger than me, we quickly became friends in our first semester of college through shared interests but the more I know her the more she shows me her true colors.

To start off we both used to get along really well with everyone in our class but as time has gone by she has gotten into fights with the rest of my class and stopped talking to them almost all together, and even though I don’t have any problems with my classmates I’ve lost touch with them since me and her are always together and nobody really wants to be around her. I’ve even stopped talking with close friends of mine because she has beef with them and the times I’ve tried talking to them shell ask me “what where you talking about? Did you have fun with them? Even though you know how I feel about them?” she has also in numerous occasions taken my phone to check if I was talking to them or to see if I had her blocked on social media (I’ve never done that).

She is also the type of person to say things like “I’m such a good friend” when I have always believed that someone who is genuinely good does not feel the need to mention it. Recently I started showing interest in a guy friend of her and after setting us up told me “you know if I wanted to I would have made out with him after I realized you liked him but I didn’t because I’m a good friend” which left me really confused because we weren’t even talking about anything like that also who ever thinks that about their best friend’s crush???

I have also talked to her about my depression and how I’ve dealt with suicidal thoughts for a long time and she will still text me and say “answer me or ill kill myself” which she claims to say jokingly but still make me worry about her mental health and these sort of texts have made me lose sleep because I’ll keep thinking what if she actually does it?? I have tried telling her not to say such things since not only it bothers me but it can damage her mental health but she either ignores me when I say this or she just rolls her eyes at me.

We both are bisexual and she has on repeated occasions have made inappropriate comments to me such as asking me several times to be my “first girl on girl kiss” and I keep answering that I would never do anything sexual with her, this coupled with how she has even touched me in ways that have made me uncomfortable and through which I’ve told her to stop. These things have made me get genuinely angry at her (I would like to say that I rarely ever get angry and the only person to ever get me this upset is her). The times I’ve gotten genuinely angry at her she'll apologize by saying “I was just not feeling well that day” “I was trying to make other people like me” (this one regarding a day in class where she kept making fun of me in front of everyone which made me really sad), and her most common apologize “I’m sorry it’s because my mom left me when I was young I have a lot of problems” when my own dad left me when I was a kid and I’ve never used that to excuse my behavior.

Also I try my best to keep my scholarship and since me and her get really good grades whenever we have to make a team proyect we work together and even though working with her assures me that I'll get a good grade she becomes very controlling and very difficult to work with but and even so I'm afraid that if I stop talking to her even my grades will suffer. 

The reason I’m not sure if I should cut her off of my life is because I still care about her, I’ve shared a lot with her and when she is on her good days she is really fun and sweet and thanks to her I’ve had a lot of fun and I still sometimes think of how I don’t want to lose her.

Even as I type this out I still feel like I’m somehow overreacting but the damage she has done to me has become unbearable and the longer I stay away because of quarantine the more I realize how much better my life is without  her.

Thank you for reading this far I am looking forward to any advice I can get.",11Sep2020,1

For the past few years this thing has been happening usually when I’m alone and doing a mundane task. Suddenly every sound I hear sounds like it’s getting increasingly loud and angry, almost like everything is yelling at me. It makes me feel like my head is buzzing and it makes me start to panic a bit. It can usually go away if I start talking to myself in a calm voice but sometimes that doesn’t even work and even my calm voice sounds like i’m yelling and angry.

359,"THIS IS ALL HYPOTHETICAL AND NOT ABOUT ME.

Let's say you were sexually assaulted by a coworker on a work trip. At a dinner they made many sexual comments to you (even when you explained you were not interested and had a partner). They are gay and said they wanted to be the 'bottom' that night. Also, they asked you to lift your shirt up and show you your 'six pack'. Then later, at a bar, they grabbed your butt (firmly). This is clear sexual harassment right?

 When you try to leave by Uber, this person convinces you to stay by saying 'lets sit down and chat'. So you sit down and chat. HOWEVER, you get into an argument with this person. This argument is trivial, and is just about which bar you wanted to go to.

In the midst of the argument, this person throws you to the ground and puts their hand around your throat. You immediately call 911. However, due to your emotion and intoxication at this time, you do not file a police report. The person goes to his/her hotel unharmed. You are emotionally exhausted at this time and want to go home, so you go to your hotel.

You text family and friends about your sexual and physical assault. Your friends suggest you get taken off the work trip, so you call your company. The company takes you off your trip.

NOW, let's say you were drinking at a time you were not supposed to be drinking because you had to work tomorrow, Does this make your decision to report your sexual and physical assault to your company a good decision? It may or may NOT be proved you were drinking at the wrong time.

SO, your company may be angry at you for being drunk when you were not supposed to be drunk, AT THE SAME TIME, this persona harassed you, grabbed your butt on an official work trip, and threw you to the ground and grabbed your throat.Also, your company has a union..

Do you report it, yes or no?",11Sep2020,1

361,"I’m so angry about everything. Classes started recently and I’m so upset that I’m missing out in a year of my freedom. I’m going into my third year of university. I finally felt like I was in a good headspace and was able to manage my classes. I felt ready to improve my grades and finally felt confident enough to try making more friends. Then a pandemic happens and ruins everything. 

On top of that, my home life sucks. There’s a lot of fighting that goes on. My parents argue a lot. My sister fights with my parents etc. And my parents are pretty overprotective of us as well which makes it hard to go out whenever I want. I’m just overall super depressed about the situation and feel like I have nothing to look forward to. 

My grades have been shit the past two years because I was too shy to make friends and mostly stuck to myself. I feel like I need balance in my life. A bad social life is a major reason that my grades have struggled so much. This year I joined a club and I feel like I’m finally gaining confidence to become a more social person. But it’s so hard with everything online. I feel so alone. 

Recently I’ve been having a lot of bad thoughts. I have a history of cutting myself and although I haven’t done it in 10 months, the urges are becoming really strong again and hard to resist. I find myself constantly laying in bed and listening to angry music. I also can’t stand to be around other people anymore and find everyone so fake.

She started dating my brother, she kissed him around me, talked about him to me, and no matter how much he told her to stop talking to me, she didn’t stop. She said she thought I hated her once. She came over to sit by me in lunch with a bunch of her friends for a period of time. I’m not sure if she hated me or liked me. Can you help?

367,"I made an account just for this. I'm (21M) a freshman in university in Singapore. It's currently week 5 of my semester 1 and I gotta say, I don't think I'm doing very well. I feel so far behind my peers, I'm struggling to meet every dateline, and most importantly, I have no interest in what I'm doing (civil engineering). 

Well I knew that before I signed up. After my secondary school, I went to junior college even though I had no interest in math and science. I went because it felt like the right thing to do. My passion was gaming at the time, but I didn't want to enter a polytechnic because I felt like I didn't want to develop games my entire life. And the two years I spent in junior college was hell. I couldn't keep up with the class, had absolutely no interest in physics and maths (my worst subjects), and got a pretty mediocre score at the end of my A Levels. 

And now, I recognise the pattern I'm making here. I only went into civil engineering because I wanted to be accepted by a recognized university, in my case it's NUS, or the National University of Singapore. And now I'm really suffering for that. But because of my poor grades, I just wanted to enter a decent school and get a degree so I could have some sort of financial stability. Now though... well, I can see the mistake I made in that judgement. The entire course was based on physics with math and design thrown in. I've been keeping up with graded assignments, but by the skin of my teeth. 

I'm just, I guess, lost? I've been having thoughts of dropping out for quite a few days now. Because I'm told by a senior that my freshmen year was supposedly the most relaxed I would be, because it would get worse later on - just that by that time I would have adapted to it. But I couldn't bring myself to tell him that I wasn't handling it even now. 

Well so that's the dilemma now. I'm so afraid of dropping out because I have pretty... terrible alternatives. I went to Junior College so my job opportunities are really not good. I can't choose another course anyhow cause of my bad grades in Junior College. I thought of maybe finding a counselor but... just thought I'd post it here and see what I can find out first. Currently all I feel is a sense of tiredness. A few days I got so stressed that I legit just dropped everything and rested for a while, only to be overwhelmed the next day. I haven't flunked any assignment yet because I grinded really hard for those. But I'm honestly at my peak here and I don't want to be doing civil engineering anymore, or the rest of my future.",11Sep2020,1
368,"so i rlly want to join this academic co ed frat and i already rushed last sem but i didnt get in and i was rlly upset bc i honestly didnt expect to get rejected. i thought i hit it off rlly well with all of the brothers but maybe it’s bc my gpa was too low and i didnt have enough work experience. but my family friend was the vp of the frat so i thought she could put in a good word for me even tho shes not chair of recruitment. i also put it off on the fact that maybe it was bc i was a freshman. like my friend who’s a senior who transferred to my university rushed her first semester here and she made it to the invite only events but didn’t make it in. 

so I’m trying again this semester. I got an internship over the summer so I put that on my resume and hopefully that will look good. I really tried to make my resume look really professional and add a lot of experience on it this time. I feel like this semester I also hit it off well with the bros even though it was over zoom, but then again that’s what I thought last time and I still didn’t get in. some of the Bros said they had to rush twice and they got in their second time and that rushing twice increases ur chances of getting in, so I’m hoping that since this is my second time it’ll show commitment and that they’ll let me in. A lot of the Bros also recognized me so I feel like that will help at least get me to the invite only events.

but I’m just really stressed about not getting in because I really want to join some sort of Greek life but I don’t wanna join a sorority because I feel like I wouldn’t fit in and a lot of that stuff is really superficial and fake. But with the brothers of this frat the convos r so genuine and they don’t care about superficial stuff like how you look or who you know, they just care about who you are and they want you to be successful in your life. Plus being in this frat will get me really good jobs so I like need to be in it.

I haven’t really found my place at my university yet and I feel like this frat could help me make more friends. like if I don’t get in this semester I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I feel like I won’t ever make friends in college if I don’t join some thing, and honestly I don’t really have any interest in any other organization besides this frat. i just rlly hope i get in :/",11Sep2020,1
369,"My GF (F/20) and me (M/20) have been dating for about 2.5 years and one morning, a few days ago, she snapped me a pic with no context. Then I sent her a pic back, I was smiling. Then she says ""I guess you didn't check your voice mail"". Pretty passive aggressive I think, I go to check it and she left a voicemail at 4am of her sobbing and saying she needed me. She tells me she's been feeling suicidal. I don't know what to say, I'm not a therapist. She didn't text me. Sometimes my phone doesn't get calls, I live in the mountains and even then my phone is on silent at night since I have school and I want my rest. Later in the week I call her one night and she says she has been playing a game with me where she will not contact me and will wait until I contact her. She concluded from her game that I apparently didn't give a shit about her because I didn't text her all day. I am thinking ""If you wanted to talk why didn't you just say so!"". I told her this thought and she tells me she is always the one to call me or text me first. I didn't want to argue anymore so I told her she was right. I've looked back through our texts and calls and its more of a 50/50 ratio of who texts first. This seems like another silly game. Is it manipulation? Is this relationship toxic? She always tells me how depressed she is and I live 2 hours away and I honestly don't feel like driving over there every weekend. I have my own friends and life outside of her but I feel like I am 90% of her life. I feel so scared and trapped, I can't tell if I actually love her or if I am just pitying her. She doesn't have a license so she cant come and drive to me and I wouldn't want her to anyways. She is not a very experienced driver and the route is twisty and turny. 

I don't know what's stopping me from breaking up with her. We have almost broken up before and my heart hurt so bad, I definitely love her in a way. I just don't know if I can romantically. We aren't really that compatible either, she likes this I like that etc....

I think it's because we've said things like, ""I am yours forever"", ""I promise promise promise I will never ever leave you!"", ""We are married!"" (I wear a ring, not officially married.) I would feel like such a terrible person by breaking all these promises. I feel like this relationship has changed who I am, not for better or for worse, just changed. I'm not ""madly in love"" (lusting?) over her anymore. She is my first and only girlfriend. I would be abandoning her, she really doesn't have anyone else in her life.

371,"Ok so this is probably very boring but any tips would be appreciated. 

In 2014 I found a cool magazine while on holidays. I’d never seen it anywhere else so I subscribed. It was a 2 years subscription and it renewed every 2 years automatically. So 2014, 2016 no issues. 2018 rolls around and I stopped receiving the magazine. I contacted the help email address and they said my subscription had expired and I needed to pay again. I had difficulty with their website...  very buggy and the transaction wouldn’t go through. I tried twice and then gave up and low and behold the automatic charge for my subscription goes through, same one since 2014. I email with that receipt, with much back and forth and much explanation from me and an annoyed tone from them, they send me a few more issues of the magazine although I missed some issues and they said they couldn’t provide me with them. Whatever, I think I’m done with them after the rude back and forth and the difficulty of getting something I paid for and never stopped paying for. So from 2018-2020 I only received 3 magazines when I should have received 8. I thought I had cancelled the automatic subscription and then the other day another 2 year amount got taken from my account. Obviously I need to contact them to get a refund  but the thought of having to contact them again and them being rude to me and probably never actually getting what I’ve asked for is stopping me from contacting them.

So the advice I guess I need is how do I contact them and get them to listen to me and treat me like a paying customer or get a refund at least. The polite, evidence based tact didn’t seem to get me very far. 

I would just call them and try to plead my case over the phone but I’m in Australia and the magazine is from the UK.",11Sep2020,1

373,"I was having a zoom meeting and it was art class.

It was a new year and everything was having a fresh new start. I thought I was doing well, for example participating in class a lot since I used to be a shy student. Everything was fine until today.

So it was art class and I joined the zoom meeting for it. 

My teacher wasn't turning on the camera and I wait for a while but he/her didn't. 

I remember how our head teacher told us to always remind each other the rules of zoom for example  reminding teachers to turn on their camera.

So I said (In a joking way and not a serious way)

""Hey Mr/Ms XXXXX, why don't you turn on your camera?""

which I regret saying.

Honestly, I expected him/her to say something like ""Oh yeah, thanks for reminding!"". But I was wrong, very wrong.

""You're not suppose to say that as a student, you should respect teacher's privacy. Us teachers are suppose to ask you. Not the student to ask the teacher. Do you understand?"" Since he/she was a funny teacher, I thought it was a joke. So I played it off with a ""maybe"" and a laugh behind. 

""NO, THERE'S NO MAYBE! DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!"" he/she started to shout. That moment, everything around my body turned hot, especially my face. Even though I'm in a zoom class, I can feel everyone staring at me.

""Yep."" I tried playing it off cool and funny.

Later, my teacher continued with the class and I made sure my camera is only showing my forehead, since I didn't want anyone to look at me anymore.

I felt so guilty that I even wanted to cry and forget about everything. I just want to use some sort of superpower and erase my classmates' memories. What was worse, was because my art teacher is actually a funny teacher, no one have seen him/her so serious before, so it was almost impossible to forget for my classmates. I just wanted to suicide on the spot, or just wish the meeting to quickly end. Now, whenever I look at my art teacher's face, it gives me the worst nerves ever. Sometimes, I just want to punch his/her's face and get out of this situation. 

I didn't pay attention to the rest of the class nor the classes after. I just scroll through articles of ""what to do when your teacher embarrasses you in front of the class"" and other people's similar experiences.  

A lot of the advice and articles were to talk to the teacher after class. In my opinion, I don't think I'll be comfortable to do that, since I don't want to repeat the situation and my art teacher might lecture me more.

After all the classes were done, all of my friends say this was the first time they see me get in trouble since I'm sort of the knowledgeable/good student. That made me felt worse, but what's even worse is how one of my friends actually agree with what my teacher did and it was actually my fault. I felt so bad and guilty that I wish I traveled back in time and stopped what I did. I talked about it with my friends and I tried letting myself to look at my art teacher's perspective. ""Maybe because he/she was a bit embarrassed since a student will ask the teacher to turn on their camera, so maybe it was just to somehow ""fight back"" the embarrassment. Maybe it was because I actually said something inappropriate as a student, we're suppose to respect the teacher and not rule around."" I kept of thinking about the ""maybe""s and told myself I've learnt the lesson and will never do it again. 

I did homework with my friends and try and forget about everything. But as I wrote this post, the same red, hot feeling came back and I wish to die. I finished all my homework (science, math, English e.t.c) but I just can't lay my hands on the only homework left, art. As soon as the art book gets in my eyesight, I kept having flashbacks of the lesson I had today. I absolutely hated it.

I can imagine everyone gossiping about what happened to me today, even from my friends.  I want time to go slowly, since my next art class will approach soon. My art teacher in every lesson won't turn on his/her camera until another 5 minutes or so, which means my classmates will have flash backs of what happened last time. 

I feel like I'm getting a bit of social anxiety due to this, I really hope for advice about this situation. I don't want to even scroll through the entire thing and grammar check everything since I'm going to get the nerve again which I hate. I'm sorry if there's grammar mistakes.

I never knew I would even post this type of post online but I did anyways. Since all of my friends agreed with my art teacher's opinion, a part of me start to even feel that I was wrong and stupid, my art teacher just lectured me since I am probably dumb and do inappropriate things. I even feel like people are probably going to reply as I was wrong and my teacher did the right thing.

Anyways, thanks for reading all of this if you made it here and I really seek for advice.",11Sep2020,1

When people disagree with me there ideas are so simple and I disprove them easily and they can’t even combat my opinions and my thoughts because I word it in a way that convinces them to my point easily. When I think of peoples actions usually they are so predictable and I already know what there gonna do. I’m tired of living and feel like I’m going insane because of how stupid and dumb I feel everyone else is and I don’t know why I feel this way, is this due to some extreme ego issue to I have a mental problem because I don’t brag about myself or say this loudly I think it may just be my thoughts on the inside is there a way to fix this?",11Sep2020,1

381,"First of all, not a native English speaker so apologies for possible typos or mistakes.

I have this friend that I talk to almost daily and she's been of great help for me during the quarantine (it's been like 6 months and I'm living alone, isolated). I met this friend online and we eventually found out that we live just a few blocks from one another (world's pretty small huh?). We've been playing games with other friends of ours and talking a lot, venting, sending memes, stuff in general.

Thing is... she's suffering from depression and even tried to commit suicide almost a year ago. One day she just stopped answering messages for like a month. I was so scared, but I kept sending her messages trying to talk about random stuff or telling her ""I'm here for you"". At some point it felt like talking to myself but I kept going anyways. Eventually, after a month, she answered again, saying she changed medication.

I was soo relieved and so happy. We're talking and playing games again now. And here comes the ""selfish"" part: I like her, a lot. I've told her this and I think the feeling is somewhat mutual. We're planning on doing something together once the quarantine is over (IF it is over someday). I want to get to know more about her problems or just her, trying to help her but... I can't get much from her. She changes topics every time I try to. I wonder if she thinks I only care because I like her? I think she's also a great friend and a great person, so I just KNOW that's not true, I truly care for her and want her to have a happier life.

TL;DR: Anyways, sorry for the long post. It's actually a bit of a vent, but I do wanna know how to reach out to my depressive friend who's going through some heavy stuff without being too pushy or annoying.

382,"Okay so my parents are divorced (shocker in today's day and age) and I live with my mom. We don't say ""I love you"" verbally much except when I'm visiting my dad for like 2 months and we know we aren't going to see each other for a long while. My mom's not a bad person, she's actually very nice and we show our love in other ways like making coffee for each other randomly or when the other looks down we just give a silent hug and continue with our day. I love my mom to pieces and I don't see any issue with the way we express affection and I don't feel any less loved than I would if she told me she loved me regularly. I don't think I even remember my dad saying ""I love you"" to me more than 5 times in my lifetime, but I know he cares a lot.

So recently my boyfriend called me out on not saying ""I love you"" enough. It honestly took me by surprise and I feel really bad, but also a bit angry? He wants me to say it more, but it makes me feel uncomfortable saying it that much, because I feel like I'm going to make the words lose their meaning by saying them like 5 times a day and I have to constantly remind myself to say it so it's become a chore. I honestly feel like actions are more important and doing things for each other like helping with homework or changing the topic of a conversation when the other looks a bit uncomfortable or even just flattening their hair when it 's a bit messy and they can't see it themselves. These are all stupid things, but they mean a lot to me and I don't think he understands that.

Idk if I'm in the wrong here or if I just need to except change the way I express love. Any advice?

385,"Just some background context, my mother used to be physically abusive towards me when I was in primary school. Just some examples, but she would pull me by my hair and throw me out the house only to get angry at me for walking down the street after she kicked me out... like huh? She'd also hit me if I turned the TV on before studying. She's done much more, but isn't what this post is about. I've forgiven my mother for abusing me in the past and although it's been a hell of a journey, I'm at a point where I currently have a decent relationship with her. 
HOWEVERRRR, I came to the realisation that she also has been emotionally abusing me all this time. This realisation hit me when I was talking to my therapist today and I was talking about stress with my grades and how my confidence revolves around how well I do in school. I was also explaining the pressure I felt whenever my parents shame me for playing games to release my stress. I studied for 8 hours yesterday and played 3 hours of games. They ignored the fact that I studied for 8 hours and focused on the ""lol game bad lol 3 hours too much lol"" bit and told me that I should not be playing games that much. Anyways, my mum was there with me when I was talking to my therapist about how my parents weren't looking at the bigger picture and only focused on the part they didn't like. 
She tried to deny all of this but she had already told me not to play games twice in the past 24 hours, and I wasn't going to let her tell blatant lies to save her ""reputation"". 
Anyways, my therapist saw the stress I was under when I was talking about this and how I was hyperventilating while defending my point of view. She asked my mum to leave the room and told me that she observed my behaviour and told me I was close to having a panick attack. I hadn't realised how anxious I was until that point; it's a thing that often happens where I don't realise that I'm about to have a panick attack, but people around me notice and let me know before it gets to that point. 
While talking to her in private without the presence of my mum, I slowly started to realise that throughout all these years, the reason why i was so scared of my mum telling twisted versions of what happened to my therapist was because she would often gaslight me. 
She would often say some pretty mean things to me, and I wouldn't defend myself in that very moment because it would take me a good bit to process what she said was pretty damn toxic. Once I build up the courage to talk to her about it and ask her not to do it again, she tells me I've been imagining things and that  she never said whatever she said. She would often say this to my dad as well over the dinner table, and tell him how often I would make things up on the spot. This led me to believe that maybe what she was saying was true, and that I really had imagined things or had remembered a twisted version of what happened. But since this time, I had the courage to defend myself before a good time had passed, my memory of what really happened was fresh in my mind and whatever she said couldn't obscure it.  When I realised how over the years she had been gaslighting me so fucking often, I felt like crying. I felt like I finally understood my irrational fear of my mum denying what really happened and I felt relieved knowing that i wasn't insane after all.  But from here, I don't know what to do with her. She's nice most of the time, but she's still pretty fucking toxic. It's just a push and pull relationship at this point, witj her being toxic and then being nice again, and then being toxic again bla bla bla... 
I'm still in high school but my dad has offered to pay my uni fees and let me live rent free in my parents house until i graduate from uni. Which is a huge privilege and I'm super grateful. But i don't know if i can deal with my mum for so long, living under this toxic environment. Maybe I'll stay at my parents house until I graduate uni, then cut my mum off but still be in contact with my dad. I don't know. I'm so confused and scared and I feel like crying right now but I'm in the car and she's currently gone to the shops to get groceries while I wait here in the parking lot.

388,"Hey guys, so I went on a trip with my husband and his sister last weekend. On the final day of travel, I was pretty cranky and stressed. The entire trip, I felt like I was surrounded by Debbie-downers and I just wanted to be home.

On the last day, we were in the car and my husband kept asking me if I was okay, but because I don’t really like talking about my feelings in front of other people (especially his family), I kept responding with “I’m fine” and “I’m okay.” 

Apparently I had an attitude with my responses, so my husband proceeds to yell at me in front of his sister. Mind you— my husband and I pretty much NEVER yell at each other or have major miscommunication issues with one another and that was the first time we went through something like that. 

I know I should’ve been more reassuring that I wasn’t mad at him and let him know that I’d talk to him about my feelings later. Sometimes it’s difficult for me to say anything other than “I’m okay.” I really downplay how I feel.

Anyway, after he yelled at me we had a conversation on the side and basically apologized to each other and moved on.

HOWEVER—his sister actively decided to have her back turned to me, aggressively grabbed her stuff and walk to the opposite side of the room, and was just overall being passive aggressive with me. She thought I was talking shit on her when my husband and I were talking things through, but my husband reassured her that I didn’t say anything about her. 

Oh, and to describe his sister, she has a very one-dimensional personality and genuinely lacks common sense. Just imagine your stereotypical California valley girl. She’s also really rude to customer service workers too...just saying. God. She is so vapid that it hurts my head sometimes. Anyway—

After we parted ways from his sister, I sent her a text basically apologizing if I came off rude or if it seemed like I was mad at her or my husband. She basically just ignored it. Then, she texted my husband saying “what your wife did was so wrong. She had no right to treat you like that.” 

Literally all I said was “I’m okay” when I wasn’t. I feel like this happens in EVERY RELATIONSHIP!!! And my husband kept explaining to her that she’s is misunderstanding the situation, but all she can say is that I was treating my husband “poorly.” To add—she also told his parents about this situation and his mom really overdramatizes everything. She definitely thinks I’m evil now.

Anyway, I sent her another text basically saying that what happened doesn’t reflect our relationship and I was pretty much apologizing for how it came off. 

She had the AUDACITY to text me 
“I just hate seeing my brother treated like that when he cares about you so much...” really? 

And then I told her 
“There’s always more than what you see and you really don’t understand what happened. An isolated incident does not reflect our relationship in any shape or form.”

She responded with...ooooo and this SENT me...

”Hopefully.” 

I stood up for myself by saying that it is wrong of her to assume what our relationship is based off of a single incident that has honestly NEVER even happened before and I’m upset that she’d spread a false narrative of our marriage and my personality to family members. She didn’t respond and has been avoiding me ever since.

As for the depression and anxiety, this situation has definitely triggered some inappropriate guilt within myself. I’ve actually been having panic attacks and I’ve been pretty depressed since I’ve been home. I know I don’t have anything to feel guilty for since my husband and my “argument” wasn’t even much of an argument to begin with. But the way my sister-in-law has been speaking about me and spreading this false narrative about what happened on our trip is making me feel really shitty about myself. I do have an issue with what others think of me, especially when it comes to family members. 

Like what does she and his family expect from me? To be happy all the time solely because my husband treats me well? Sorry that I have depth to my personality...and by “depth” I mean major depression and anxiety lol ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

To add— my husband is on my side and agrees that his sister is just a bitch. So I should just get over it, right?

With that being said, should I even bother maintaining a “good” relationship with her?Should I just be nice to her when I see her and ignore her the rest of the time? Do I need to explain myself to his family about what actually happened? Has anyone gone through something similar like this? 

Also, do you ever say you’re “okay” to your S.O. even when you’re not? According to my sister-in-law anyone who does that is “abusive.” She also really lacks relationship experience too so...

About a month ago I started getting random gifts delivered to my place. Flowers, chocolate, expensive wine, etc. I wasn't too worried at first because I live in a pretty decent, safe neighborhood but it was on my mind because I'm only 22 and living alone quite the distance from my immediate family. It was a nuisance to deal with and it made me feel uncomfortable but it wasn't something I'd consider a ""threat"" until last week.  

Namely, out of nowhere, the random gifts escalated to written messages, odd facebook accounts adding me (and I don't use facebook often, I only have people I know added) and the last straw that made me call the police was a photo of me in my yard drinking coffee.  

I immediately called the police and even though they have concerns they can't do anything about it because I literally haven't seen who is doing this to me. They did a deep dive on my profiles (facebook, tinder, fetlife) to see if there's a possible suspect but it's out of their hands as well and I'm dumbfounded as to why and how all of this started.  Thankfully, a few of the cops present were nice enough to give me their personal contacts as well if something escalates so that makes me feel a bit better.

Thankfully, I work freelance from home so I don't really need to go out much but I can't continue changing my routines because of someone that I don't even know nor seen in my life. I've considered going away for a few weeks and stay with my parents but I settled at my current place a few months ago and there are still things I need to take care of (that I can't discuss college/work related) before I can consider taking that step. Honestly, any advice is appreciated.

394,"So, I started uni last year, I'm a pretty introverted and shy guy, and I was never really a fan of girls at my school, it was mostly because they all felt the same personality wise, and I went to somewhat of a rich school typa thing so they were all kinda egotistical, they all felt the same in a way and I didn't care for how attractive they were physically, so during school, dating and girls was never really on mind. 

When I joined uni last year, things were going nicely, everything was nice and chill, I made some friends, but I hung out a lot by myself because I don't always like to be around others, I realized for a while that there was this girl that always seemed to hang out by herself too, didn't care much, it was just something I noticed, and she was also a first year like me in the same major.

After a month or so, a friend of mine told me that apparently she's a big fan of k-pop groups, and that she posts a lot of stuff on her statuses, but he wasnt really talking about it in a nice way, to be blunt in the areas that I'm in, people aren't very accepting, coming from someone who loves video games, anime, English music only (which they refer to as foreign) I knew what It felt like to be alienated for enjoying things that aren't common, and I didn't like that remark.

Fast forward to a couple more months, and she adds me to her contacts and I could see her statuses now, and honestly I was surprised, she posted a lot of statuses about k-pop, their idols, I didn't care much about k-pop, but I really appreciated how dedicated she was to to it, and honestly how brave she was as well to put it out in the public when people would judge her, I on the other hand have a Twitter myself where I talk about games and anime and stuff that I love but obviously no one that I know irl has any clue about it, seeing all those statuses made me feel something, I guess lots of appreciation and finally seeing someone different that was an irl. 

A few months afterwards she was, well advertising her Twitter on a status and I decided to throw her a follow on my account (she didn't know it was me though) , and we started interacting on it, she was really nice and funny, and at some point I realized that I think I might have a crush on her, so I wanted to become friends with her to get to actually know her and confirm whether or not I actually really like her, unfortunately covid came, and all of our classes switched to online, so talking in person was no longer an option.

After a while, I ended up telling her who I was on Twitter, and she was pretty cool about it, we had a long conversation about life in general, uni stuff, uni choices, people we hate irl in uni and in school, just a nice conversation overall, and I felt like we were pretty similar in some ways after it. Although it was a nice conversation I didnt really feel like we became real friends because of it, we don't really talk, it's mostly just random Twitter interactions on posts, and even when I told her who I was, I actually mentioned I'd like to be friends but I don't think the goal was achieved. 

So now finally comes the advice part, honestly im stuck, I think I have a crush on this girl, I really want to get to know her and be friends, but I really don't want to make her feel uncomfortable, I don't like it when people force themselves to talk to me, and I really don't want to make her feel weird about it in case she doesn't want to be friends, or if she's not In the right mindset, or if it's awkward to her, and even if she did want to, im not sure how to approach it even, I don't know what to do. I considered moving on and not doing this whole thing in the first place, but my friends advised me not to, so I really don't know.",11Sep2020,1

Okay guys I can’t sleep and I really need your advice on something. 

My best friend and I have been extremely close for 5 years now. I am currently 19 years old [M]. When I met him in the 8th grade, his appeal came from his charisma and spontaneous “dont give a crap” energy. Everyone liked him on the surface and he was usually the center of attention. 

As time went on, he became increasingly more difficult friendship wise. He began treating our friendship as a relationship, which I interpreted as a normal, loyal thing really close friends do.  Problems REALLY starting arising when I got into my first relationship. He constantly interfered with it, put me down, put my girlfriend down, and was the textbook definition of an ASSHOLE. Manipulative and TERRIBLE energy. Out of fear of being lonely and losing my other friends, I somehow tolerated it. About a year of this toxic energy and us being on not so good terms, he finally seemed to begin maturing...

Not actually though. For the past 2 years we’ve been the closest we’ve ever been. Hangout 1-2 times a week, worked the same job, constantly text. Etc. Although he logically speaks as if he’s a good person and puts effort into maintaining our friendship, giving me stuff, treating me kindly, etc. it seems he also uses this as a way to justify his toxic behaviour. Like he’s REALLY good at doing good things and making me feel guilty for being angry when he does bad things. It’s as if he thinks getting me gifts, surprising me, sending positive paragraphs excuses him from crossing boundaries and disrespecting my values entirely. 

About a month ago, I decided to reach out to my twin sister (my best friends ex who she HATES now) because I felt extremely pessimistic, depressed, and unhappy with my life. After a DEEP talk, I began to realize that a lot of how I think is influenced by his presence. 

I’ll list some things that illustrate this toxicity I feel is being rubbed onto me:

-He constantly talks about how he deserves more than other people for having had to go through “financial problems” and divorce of parents. (He immediately brushes off other people’s problems because he doesn’t understand them and thinks his are way worse)

-He’ll passively aggressively poke fun at my accomplishments (play em off as a joke or criticize them) then boast about his, expecting me to listen and take them seriously 

-He unironically goes on tangents about how “all these kids” are stupid, not gonna have a future, don’t have habits in check... etc literally EVERY time we hang out to the point where it seems like a joke. He CONSTANTLY expresses his anger for people not living in accordance to his values. He ALWAYS has something bad to say about everyone and can’t understand people have different viewpoints and values.  

-He’s late EVERY time we hangout but gets mad the few times I am. EXTREMELY hypocritical but completely oblivious to it. 

-If I EVER disagree with something he  believes, he’ll deny the authenticity of the source supporting my argument. He genuinely believes opinions are only valid if they come from a book or his own personal experience (data from the internet is false). He always finds a way to be right by shifting the argument from his initial point to “all I wanted was for you to see it from my point of view, why do you always need to be right” COMPLETELY disregarding the argument for what it originally was cuz he knows he’s wrong. 

I swear I could write a full length book on all of the mind games and toxicity this friend has put me through, I really wish I could. 

Anyways, I’ve been practicing gratitude, meditation and adopting an optimistic mindset and it seems like I’m finally able to see how messed up and toxic my mindset has been for the past 5 years because of surrounding myself with him every single day. And I have NO idea how to fix this??

I would be just as bad as him if I were to suddenly stop hanging out, texting etc. considering I’ve put up with all this shit for so long and he hasn’t acted any different than he always has lately. If I were to stop talking to him less and less he’d be SUPER confrontational about it and try n solve it by showing up to my work, calling me repeatedly, sending paragraphs and god knows what. I have no idea how to deal with that. But even the thought of texting him lately has been making me cringe it’s like a flip just switched in my brain. I’m sorry if this is really long and unorganized but I’d immensely appreciate any advice you guys have on how I can distance myself from this toxic energy and start living without feeling constantly judged, pressured n powerless.",11Sep2020,1

402,"I found the best way to cope with envy was to tell myself the person I supposedly envied doesn't count as a human being, because the human experience is defined by overcoming adversity and obviously that person doesn't face adversity.

This worked at first , but over time I found myself applying that philosophy more and more liberally.

Now I'm in a state of mind where probably around 40% of people I interact with I've mentally dehumanized. I'm in this weird limbo where a lot of these people are people I WANT to interact with, but I just...can't do so meaningfully because I can't see them as people.

How do you overcome this? I'd imagine it's something most people go through at some point.",11Sep2020,1
403,"Hey guys.

Basically long story short: I met a couple of great people via the Animal Crossing twitter community. They were all real friends to me, and I was even in a very short LDR with one of the people in there. 

One day when we were
playing around, I made the group chat icon a picture of Hitler drawn in hentai. they blew up at me and kicked me from the group chat. After an hour or two one of the guys let me back in and I apologized for offending them. They let me back in.

Apparently it’s actually really messed up to make jokes about Hitler now, something that I didn’t know when It happened. One of the people in there was even Jewish. 

I also made a discord server for these people, I added bots, a cool header, different channels, etc. It was my first ever server, and I wanted to make it the best for my friends. Basically in a Voice Call they started muting me and making fun of me. Saying I was too young to be there, one guy even impersonated me (I have a thing where I say something is racist when it’s any minor inconvenience, not that funny but it gets a good laugh, and he basically kept repeating that phrase). 

One thing that kind of hurt tho was the shots they took at the server. Again, I considered these dudes friends, so when they made mean comments about how crappy my server was I got a little upset. Strange thing to get upset about? Ya, but when you do something for your friends and they immediately start attacking it you don’t feel too good. 

In response to this I started making really crappy, immature NSFW jokes. these jokes were super out of line and made everyone in the server uncomfortable. After this I transferred owner ship to a girl i’ll call R, then left the server. After trying to apologize to R she sent me a message basically saying to never contact her or her friends again. then they sent screen shots of me making the jokes to the guy i was in a LDR with, and he broke up with me and blocked me. All of this made me just deactivate my account and leave twitter and discord for a month. 

I recently came back and they found me. They came after me, sliding in me dms calling me a weirdo and to fuck off, how I should cancel my internet plan, etc. Cyber bullying basically. I deactivated the new account shortly after they found me. All i want to do is apologize to them, But knowing what i’ve done i’m sure they won’t accept it. I just feel so horrible and I don’t know what to do. I genuinely am done playing the victim, and I just want to apologize to them. I don’t want them to let me back in any groupchats, I don’t want them to even accept the damn apology, I just want them to know i’m sorry for what I did. They told really came after me tho, and i’m scared for my health. One of them knows my number, and my insta and snapchat. They don’t seem like the kind to doxx, but it’s also twitter.",11Sep2020,1
404,"She's been on anti psychotic medication for 3 months now. Lately she got hit by depression and her boyfriend who she used to spend all the time with is requesting her to spend more time at home.
At home she can't be on her own, she's afraid of that. She wants someone to constantly talk to her and entertain her else she would feel really bad.
I've tried sending her online courses and some activities to enjoy but she is meh towards everything.
She's always asking me when am I coming home but the truth I hate coming home. I've been living with my bf for 7 months now and I usually visit home during the weekend to just chill with my brother and mom.
Lately when I come home I rarely get the time to chill, I'm sort of babysitting her which I don't mind because she's my sister but it bothers me because I'm have work during weekdays in addition to college and sports practices. I wait for the weekends to just have time for myself but lately this has been taken away from me.

405,"My friend [F 23] and I [M 23] have been pretty good friends since college, though we knew of each other in high school. We’ve had movie nights by ourselves, driven to a concert, gone out to dinner... all just the two of us at different points in time.

I’ve confessed to her last year that I liked her, to which she replied she was appreciative but didn’t have the time to date. Understandable. Then I made it vocal I would be single for a while since I wasn’t interested in anyone else, really. Maybe 2 months later, while I’m driving her to the concert I mentioned, she says she found my dating profile on OkCupid. I tell her I’m not looking for anything serious and mainly looking to just hookup for a while. She’s chill about it, but she says she would prefer something serious in her position. 

A year later, we got into a disagreement that made me ignore her for a while because I was mad, but we made up and went to dinner on me, so all’s right with the world I suppose. 

I’m not interested in her as a potential girlfriend anymore, but I am wondering if her dating preference has changed over the last year? I don’t remember if she’s said anything about it recently. Nonetheless, I can’t help but want to ask her if she’s interested in friends with benefits or maybe a one-night fling (and still be friends). I’ve never asked her about this before, and I’m a little afraid of doing so, and then there’s if I’m in the right to ask at all due to her prior stance on serious relationships a year ago. Sure I’ve changed my own preferences, but with her, I don’t know...

If she doesn’t want this kind of relationship change between us, I would at least be satisfied with an answer and not pursue any further. What do you think I should do? My thoughts are pretty scattered. Usually, when I’ve been nervous about asking a friend for a FWB relationship, it takes a bunch of resolve to ask and then they say “yes”. These circumstances feel different though, and I don’t know what to do.

I thought about it, and here’s what I considered saying to her in person: “What has your dating preference been, as of late? (She says her choice and asks why.) So I consider you to be one of my good friends that I trust, and I wanted to ask you your dating preference because I intended to ask if you were okay with a friends with benefits relationship, particular between you and me. I know this comes as a surprise, and the last thing I want is for you to feel uncomfortable as my friend. If that’s the case I won’t ever bring it up again.” Would that be okay?",11Sep2020,1

413,"Before I start, my family life beyond what happened within my household was good. My childhood was generally pleasant and carefree but there were some deeper issues that ran throughout it that left me a little damaged as a young adult.

I was the first child and my Mother was in her early 20s. I know she loved me and she still does to this day but she’s repeating many if the same mistakes she made when I was younger with my brothers now. 

I grew up with a biological father who is a crack addict and is still in and out of prison to this day, we did not live in the same household after about the ages of 1-2 years old.

My contact with my father was limited, I saw that whole side of the family only very occasionally. My Dad was in prison for many years during my childhood until he reappeared one day. We started to see each other more until one day he got high on marijuana with me in the house and I got high on second hand smoke. I was 6 at the time. I was then told I could only see him with a social worker present. I at 6 didn’t want to have to have another person present when I saw my father but I couldn’t articulate my reasons why so my contact with him stopped. 

Meanwhile my step-father who was a drunk and was abusive to me and my mother lived with me at home. The house was hostile, but not always. 

They married.

There was a lot of screaming and shouting. Some violence. Unexplained events that were confusing as a child, I was often left in tears with no explanation to what was going on or why it was going on, my emotions were dismissed with a bellowing “SHUT UP!” and a slapped wrist or legs. 

My Step-Father used to bully me with his Brothers. Calling me names until I would cry and then repeating it every time I saw them even though I hated it. 

My Mother had another child with this man, my middle brother.

Eventually they divorced. I was inconsolable at the time because it was my Dad after all. He was all I knew, he left and my step-siblings who I adored exited out of my life with him at about the age of 9.

At around 11 my Mum met another man who became her second husband. Much nicer natured but many issues of his own from childhood relating to control issues and repressed emotions. 

They had a third child but recently got divorced. Time with him in our lives although not perfect was much nicer.

I was left with some damage from my childhood, it manifested itself in low self-esteem, social anxiety, general anxiety, depression, poor emotional intelligence and no idea of who I was or what I was supposed be as it had never been modelled to me as a child.

After writing this, I realise my brothers don’t have it too bad but my Mother still neglects their emotions. She doesn’t take how they feel seriously or help them regulate their emotions. They don’t feel like they can speak to her and when I explain this nothing ever gets done. I try to be there for my brothers but I moved out so i’m not there all the time.

I’m trying to get my Mother to step up and be there to support them both emotionally but she never seems to do it. I’m going to keep trying to get her to but I wanted to vent and also get some advice on the situation?

I’ve never been to therapy, I just worked all this stuff out in my own through my own work and research. I’m in a much better place and i’m very self-aware. I’m always trying to do better, be better and learn from my mistakes in a healthy way. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks guys.",11Sep2020,1

415,"I understand I don't know *everything* that has happened in her life but she just acts depressed and says she's depressed and I don't know why! She still has an entire, caring family, good talent, good looks, popular, is a teacher's pet, rich and is able to get anything she wants. Plus, she's never gotten below 90% in any tests at school.

I know most other people (like me and my other friend) have suffered a lot more than her, but I don't think it's a good idea to say it in her face.

I am 13 years old, both my grandparents have died (one from Covid 19), my parents are divorced, my brother smokes and is judgemental and I cannot visit my dad because he cut ties **completely**. I cannot do well in school no matter how much I try and I try a lot harder than others. People have always judged me for my looks (I have a  large jawline, big lips, tiny eyes and a tiny head). My mum and I are also suffering heavy finance issues right now.

My friend on the other hand, has uncaring parents, annoying siblings, finance problems but she is extremely naturally talented (even more than my friend) and does well in school.

437,"I know you’ve heard this one before. Of course I think my situation is special. 

BUT, I’m seriously torn up by this so I genuinely appreciate any honest insight or anyone who has had personal success or failure in this area. 

Long story short - I’ve been comfortable waiting for her to get out of her current relationship before telling her how I feel. I was under the impression the relationship was struggling, but now they just moved in together. I want to keep waiting because I appreciate the hell out of her and don’t want to be disrespectful to her or her relationship - but my recurring nightmare is being at their wedding and her still unaware of how I feel. 

Should I get this off my chest now (just tell her, not asking her out or anything) or take the risk that they might never split and I’ll never be able to do this the right way? 

More detail if you want it -

-we both moved to our current city last year. We work for the same company but lived in different cities and just met in 2019

-her relationship was only about 6 months old when we met, about 1.5 years now.

-she doesn’t talk about it much outside of surface stuff (x is doing this or that today, etc). I see red flags in the relationship but I’m also admittedly biased so I won’t go into detail

-based on what I know about her, she may be afraid to leave her relationship without knowing there’s something else out there (ie she might be afraid of being single. I have a similar trait that Im recognizing in her) also, any tips on actually confirming this?

-we’re both textbook introverts that also suffer from social anxiety. She’s never broken up with a partner before

-our friendship started out as a friendship, not a “I want you but don’t know how to tell you” kind of thing. We’ve always had great chemistry and compatibility but because of her relationship we didn’t even think of that as an option when we first started hanging out. As we were getting closer I’ve constantly pulse checked to make sure i never crossed a line in the amount of time we spend together. My feelings grew within the friendship and me telling her would likely be unexpected. 

-I continue to go on dates and talk to other people online. I tend to see people in her shadow though so I can’t say this isn’t affecting my dating life.

-i know I’m contradicting myself saying I respect her and her relationship, while still existing in her life making unavoidably biased choices. We just don’t have very many people out here. We each have a handful of friends scattered across the country but the virus that shall not be named really took a toll on our ability to make local friends this year. I need to consider the fact that saying something will end what is a really meaningful companionship to both of us

438,"Hey all, I’m using a throwaway because I will be giving out some personal information, and in general I feel more comfortable remaining anonymous. 

Anyway, to start this story, the only real context that you need is that I have been close with this family member my entire life. About 8 months ago, I started dating a girl who is of Mexican and Cuban descent, and he made a few remarks about our mixed babies, that I, at the time took as jokes, albeit pretty insensitive ones. The last piece of context is pretty major though.

I am a young adult (18+) and from about the time I was 11 and I met a kid who was going through the hell that is foster care at a summer camp, I always had extremely strong feelings for wanting to not have my own kids, and instead adopt. I had come to the point where I couldn’t see any logical reason to have my own children when there are tens of millions of children throughout the world who may never experience the love of a parent, which is something that almost everyone who had that growing up takes for granted. We all grow up with the security that no matter what happens, our family will be there for us. For these kids, they do not have that security, and the one thing that can change that is more people willing to choose adoption over having their own kids.

When I started dating my girlfriend, the question of birth control cake up as usual, and she told me that she has always had bad reactions to hormonal birth control, and her friend had a rather gruesome experience with an IUD, and that she was scared of using them, so the obvious choice was condoms. However, about 4 months into our relationship, my best friend’s girlfriend had to get an abortion because of a failed condom, and that scared the shit out of me. After a lot of thinking, I realized that there was absolutely no reason for me to not get a vasectomy being that I never wanted my own kids in the first place, and on top of that I have a few serious genetic conditions that I would never wish my child to have to suffer through. so I got the procedure done and only told a select few family members, (4 to be exact) because I knew that it wasn’t something I as ready to tell the rest of my family considering they’re fairly traditional. 

All was going well until last week, this family member who I have been close with for my entire life, calls me and is infuriated. He asked me what the fuck I was thinking, how I could be so god damned stupid, etc. After a few minutes of me trying to figure out what he was talking about and him just continuing to insult me and yell at me, he finally said “You realize that you’re not gonna find any white kids right? It’s all gonna be *slur for asians*, *slur for Latinos*, and *slur for black people*, and I instantly realized what he was talking about. 

I have no idea if I or one of the family members that I’d told let something slip, or if one of them ratted on me, but either way it doesn’t really matter. My position I’m this problem has been clear since the day I decided to adopt back when I was 11. I don’t give a fuck if the child is male, female, black, white, gay, straight, trans, cos, it doesn’t matter. As Yondu said in Guardians of the galaxy
“He May have been your father boy, but he wasn’t your daddy.” (Side note that scene made me cry like a little girl because I related to it so hard) 

I will love them and treat them as my own regardless of any arbitrary trait, and I’ll be damned if I let anyone try to convince me otherwise. Anyway, eventually I got pretty emotional, so I hang up and blocked him because he didn’t even think to ask what my reasons were, and beyond that, made me feel like I was betraying my family by daring to adopt a child that isn’t white. 

My family is pretty fractured because my parents split up when I was young, so nobody has really found out aside from him, and if they did, they just didn’t think it was a big deal and didn’t say anything to me. It’s probably important that I mention this was neither of my parents, I didn’t tell my mom because she doesn’t really see me as an adult, and my dad was my biggest supporter aside from my girlfriend when I got the procedure, and his only questions were just making sure it was what I wanted. 

So, what would you all advise I do? On one hand, he’s family, and I’d rather build bridges than burn them, on the other hand, he already burnt the bridge we had, and even if I did somehow repair our relationship, I don’t think he will ever be supportive of my decision. As much as it would suck to lose my relationship with this person, I would move on and it wouldn’t cause any major differences to my life. 

*Side note* 
For anyone that wants judge me based on my decision, I have likely heard all of your points in the past, and dont care to hear them, so they will be ignored. If anyone has questions as to how the procedure goes, more insight on my stance on adoption vs having your own kids, or whatever else as long as it isn’t attacking me, I’d be happy to answer, but at the end of the day I’m just looking for advice as to what to do in this situation.",11Sep2020,1

He’s very food driven so we thought he might just be hungry and wanting his breakfast. Nope! We feed him first thing, go back to bed and carries on meowing. He’s fed 3 times a day (normal amount spread over 3 times. We’re not over feeding him).

Originally, he slept in our room at night so we thought he just wanted to leave. Nope. We’d open the door and he’d carry on.

My boyfriend has just recently lost a really good friend of his to suicide. He is absolutely broken over this and I would love any kind of advice on how I can help him feel better. He moved away from that friend so he hasn't seen him for a while and now he's gotten the news that he took his life a couple days ago. 

He drove 7 hours to take a ferry to where his friend is so he could view him in the coffin. I really feel like he needed that closure, just to see him one last time and say goodbye you know. However right as he was about to board the ferry he got news that his friends mother had totally changed her mind on everything and was now only allowing family to view him. It's tough because his mother has lost her son, she's obviously not coping well. But my boyfriend spent so much money and time off work etc driving there and back and he's understandably very upset he doesn't get to see his friend one last time. 

I imagine this is a common situation with covid going on, people not being able to see loved ones and say goodbye properly. What are other ways to get closure? How can I help him heal?

446,"Long story short, me and my friend have known each others for more than 7 years now however recently we started a business together at which I always told him that the most genuine asset we have in this business is not money but the trust we have.

After sometime another friend (his friend) came into the picture, my friend told me that this guy is going to be useful for us in the business, I reminded him that if he is not trustworthy then maybe hiring him as an employee would be better than a partnership cause I can't trust him.

I trusted my friend's judgement of that guy (his friend) and agreed. After a short time I noticed that his friend wants to start bossing around by telling my friend to tell me how to do my part of the business, I was hurt cause my friend should have stopped him right there and then but instead he only carried his water without a thought and told me that.

I stopped talking and cut all cords right away, after a month my friend started contacting me about how he misses me and that guy turned out to be a junkie unprofessional person and he regretted all he has done and to this day he is still apologizing.

 As a friend I am willing to look the other way but in business it is hard for me to trust you.

449,"I always see people praising cutting out toxic people as a way to feel better. But I don't understand how people do it. This will probably be long and a bit too detailed but I don't really have anyone else to talk to about this and this is just years and years of pent up anger. Also, sorry for any grammatical, spelling or simply wrong terms errors, I'm Swedish.

I have a friend, let's call her K, she's 30. We live in a small town where everyone knows everyone and rumours travel fast. She is the rumour-spreading kind.

K and I have been friends for a very long time, but she never quite grew up from her 18 year old self. She's constantly being disrespectful to people, can't take any kind of responsibility for what she does, will do anything to get what she wants and lacks any kind of empathy towards others.

I'm not allowed to do anything without her, she's the kind of person who checks everything, when I was last online of Facebook, where I am on Snapchat or Facebook, whether my laptop is turned on, she even drives past where I live to see if we're home (my street is a dead end, not hard to miss her and her car). She's the kind of person who ""coincidentally"" goes to the same place I am at at the moment, so therefore we need to spend the whole day together. And if I were to turn things showing my location off, I'll hear about it, she's come to my place a few times after turning it off and I'd rather have her tracking me online rather than irl.

She can't keep a relationship and therefore she goes further and further in her attempts to sink her claws in whatever man she's seeing at the moment, as in getting engaged as QUICKLY as possible, I believe she's been engaged 7 times the last 3 years now. Obviously that tactic didn't work, so now she's pregnant instead (and engaged), with a new boyfriend. Now, these things aren't what's really the problem, the problem is that whenever a guy dumps her, she will do ANYTHING to ruin his life. She will spread rumours about cheating, drugging and abuse, while at the same time turning to her new ex and constantly send them threats about suicide. 

She's the kind of person who will make you feel worthless, your problems will be worthless and she doesn't want to be bothered by them. She needs to be the sole focus, and nothing else matters. If you have a problem, she'll just flat out change the subject without even trying to be vague about it.

There's also the fact that she treats her dogs (5 small dogs) badly, which just irks me.

Keep in mind that these are things I've seen over many years, and while she has a lot of acquaintances and shallow friendships, she only has a few close friends, me and another girl who's very sweet but rather dumb (she says this about herself, she knows she has issues when it comes to picking up on stuff). She has had one close friend before this, which almost managed to get away from her, but they're back to being friendly now (at least according to K). I can't reach out to these other two, I don't know where I have them or where they're at in their views of K. 

There's so, so much more to this, and I know that it sounds like she's having some bad mental health issues, but she's been thoroughly examined by doctors for the last 10 years, she's been to therapy, been on loads of medication and trials for various diagnoses, and has been checked up on for a LOT of different mental health issues. The reason for this is that she doesn't want to work, in Sweden we have a security where you can be on sick leave for months (even years) and still get almost full pay. The only thing she was diagnosed with so far was ADHD. 

If I were to diagnose her, despite me not being a professional but being someone who's interested in mental health issues and who finds things like that important, I would diagnose her as a narcissist. 

I'm at a loss as to what to do now, I've been trying to ignore her completely for the last year to make her lose her interest in me and just move on, but she persist. She just does what she always has, the difference is that I never read anything she sends me. She still sends me about 20 messages on various social platforms every day, even if I only read them about once a month. I can't break things off as if it was a relationship, because that would only sabotage for myself. I've seen what she does to ruin her ex's lives, and they've been lucky enough to not live in the same town as her.

I miss being allowed to do whatever I want without feeling like I need to hide it somehow to not have her show up or demand that she needs to join us.

453,"To give some context,

I met this girl over quarantine. Did not feel any attraction the moment I met her, but as we started talking, feelings started to bubble up. We share a lot of common interests, values and how we see the world; it all lines up.

Anyway, some time passes and we finally meet in person among our group of friends we made over quarantine. We were flirting and things seemed to be going well, but as the night went on drugs came into play and I got in my feelings and made the grave mistake of dropping a bomb on her and telling her I was into her instead of showing her. I know. Stupid.

Safe to say it didn't work out in my favor.

Now the thing is, though I still have feelings for her. we've remained friends. We have friends in common and cutting the friendship would just cause a lot of unneeded discomfort and tension in the friend group. And she is a great friend to begin with. That's how things started off and I thought I'd be okay with it reverting back to that.
Things went pretty smooth for the most part, we'd hang out often, go on road trips. Maybe an awkward moment here or there but nothing too crazy.

But things have gotten very sour as of late.
A lot of misunderstandings over cancelled plans. Which has caused us to not see each other for almost two months now. We've talked things through but other misunderstandings would pop up.

As of late, I've learned that she was going through something pretty serious personally. 
We've had some very lengthy talks about it. I did this to try and establish myself more as a friend (even telling her im there for her as a friend) and hopefully quell my feelings for her but that hasn't worked out either. 

I still get emotional reactions when she does things. For example we make plans, a friend isnt able to make it so she says she too tired to come out. I suggest inviting other friends over and all of a sudden she's okay to come out again. Basically she's uncomfortable hanging out with me 1 on 1. And I can't blame her. There's a part of me that still wants to change her mind. I usually don't take rejection this badly. I'm just very unsatisfied with the way I handled things with her, because I felt like I had it and ruined it by revealing my feelings.

I just don't know what to do anymore. There's been so many ups and downs as of late. When we talk, it's mostly on our group chat and on the surface it seems to be fine but there is a thick layer of tension.

I really don't know if I should just have a heart to heart with her and try to clear the air, or to sweep it all under the rug and hope that this tension just goes away.",11Sep2020,1

455,"Okay, so i'm in my last year of school (year 13 for my fellow British people or my senior year elsewhere) and i'm education-wise the happiest i've ever been, i'm putting in the effort and getting decent grades in order to go to a good university. My parents are supportive of my grades. But they've had their heart set moving 4+ hours away for like 2 years now and since my mum got a job offer at the location, they're all up for moving. We've been there several times on holiday but each time i find myself disliking it more and more, whereas the rest of my family seem to adore it, i have no issue with them moving because all i want is for them to be happy but i already know that if i move with them i'll be deeply unhappy.

Now i'm basically getting a guilt trip of if i don't come with them i'm ruining their happiness, being selfish and making my mum depressed. They've chosen a university close to the location and expect me to happily apply there no questions asked, despite constantly changing their plans of where they want to move and basically stopping me from going where i want to go. My original plan was to find a uni i liked and move into student accommodation whilst simultaneously working and having a job, and although it would be a heavy load i believe it would be better for my mental health. Everyday i dread coming home from school because i'm scared of what mood they'll be in and how they'll treat me that day, this has been worse in the quarantine as i have had no escape mentally or physically from them. Even if i did move with them, i believe that the situation would just get worse because i'd have no one to escape to (e.g. my friends) for months until i begin uni and they make me feel like asking to go outside for an hour is an awful thing even though i'm almost 18.

Another month after that, my ex asked me to meet up again. So I went, but made up my mind that I was going to talk and not let it become a kissing session. I wanted to get back together and I noticed that me ex only wanted to meet me and kiss me. So when we met that day, I dont remember a lot of details as it happened years back, I remember him wanting to kiss me. I put my foot down and said but I dont want to kiss you. So he said 'I will still force and kiss you'. And he went in for a kiss on my lips, but before thats I took my lips inside my mouth and closed it firmly. Unable to kiss them, he stopped and then I pushed him away. I don't remember if we spoke after that, but we left and I knew that I wasn't ever going to agree to seeing him after that. Today, a good number of years later, I know that this was really problematic and qualifies as sexual assault. But I dont know what i can do about it or why i hadn't understood this earlier. I know that had I told my parents, they would have spoken to his parents and his parents would have taken some action against him and that would have been it. I also understand that he was a minor, just like I was, and probably didnt know the illegal intensity of his words or actions, like he knew it was wrong but I guess not how much. But having said that, he still violated me and it seems that he too doesnt remember this incident as he was trying to connect with me as 'friends' a few months back.

468,"I started highschool about 2 weeks ago. I really need help. Its a private school and its in person. most of the kids came from the same middle school. everyone has friends except me. Although, everyone there is awfully nice, its completely out of my comfort zone. I came from a public school where it was the exact opposite. Everyone was rude, violent, and didnt care about school. I need help. I dont know how to make friends. Every once and a while someone will come up and talk to me, but I dont know how to carry a conversation. Ive become familiar with a lot of people, but i haven't clicked with anyone. I feel like perhaps I'm asking for to much to soon. Its only been two weeks, should I have made a friend by now? Should I be more social? I was considered the quiet kid in my old school, but that was because of the environment. Im so happy at this school, i just want to make friends.",11Sep2020,1
469,"Hey Reddit! I need your help again. 
Background information: I never really had night terrors before, as a kid I had insomnia so I couldn’t sleep at all. My sleeping has been fine for years now tho.

So since I started sleeping at my boyfriends place I started experiencing more and more nightmares. Then after a year I experienced having trouble breathing and the nightmares got worse. Especially when he went to his job and I went back to sleep all alone in the house. That’s when I used to have the worst ones and I would wake up with my heart racing and me feeling like crap.

The usual nightmare was that I was trying to wake up and my mind would trick me over and over again and I would never wake up and that always made me panic. It felt like I was stuck in it for days. Untill once, such a nightmare turned into a night terror and I was sure I had woken up. I felt awake, I looked around and was glad that the nightmare was over, but then this black shadowy thing appears over me and starts chocking me and it was so realistic that I felt like I was having a heart attack. 

My boyfriend woke me up and even tho I was awake I still saw that thing as a hallucination I guess? For like 4 long seconds and kept chocking untill he helped me out of that state. I cried after that.

So this same chocking night terror has happened at least 4 times now and my heart and lungs hurt so much everytime. 

I’m writing this out because 2 things have happened. In one of these dreams when I was being chocked I managed to grab the things hand and it turned into human skin.
The second thing that his thing was in my dream last night but as a friend of mine took a picture of me in my dream and it just stood behind me. That was the first time I saw it’s face and I can’t even discribe it but it was female! 

It’s important to add that in my life I have been chocked out aggressively by my mother but also by a guy I though were my friend. I don’t know if this has anything to do with it but I just want to be able to breath when I sleep. Can anyone help? In any way?!",11Sep2020,1

I'm an extremely nurturing person in general. It's like I have a maternal instinct towards everything. I've been this way since I was little and my mom says I've always been a mother hen. That being said, I have 1000x more compassion for animals (specifically dogs) than even human babies. I listen to true crime a lot and my only no go zone is animal abuse. I can listen to the worst things happening to a person and, while it will upset me, I can get through it without crying or anything most of the time. When it comes to animal abuse tho, I just CANNOT hear it, see it, know about it, think about it or I will feel so sick and depressed. Does this mean there's something wrong with me? I have heard people say that it's a bad sign or a trait common among really bad people like Hitler and Karla homolka who were both big animal lovers. 
 I feel like they need more love and protection than humans bc humans can improve a bad situation they might find themselves in whereas animals can't. It's a human's world, at least for the time being so I feel like we don't need as much protection/support as animals. Idk am I crazy?",11Sep2020,1

476,"First, some background info: I have made the decision to move in with my SO who lives in another state, but only temporarily (for about 4-5 months). I’m a 24 year old college student and since we just received confirmation that spring 2021 semester will be online, I thought why not as it’ll be the perfect opportunity to experience life somewhere else. I currently live with my family, 8 family members in one household. I love them but I am overwhelmed and I have been for years. I am also the eldest sibling, so I carry a lot of responsibilities on top of my own. Here’s my dilemma. I have a good job here. It’s a small practice. I’ve been at the place for 4 years, and aside from the crazy stress of the job, my boss accommodates my school schedule, the experience I’m gaining will be beneficial for my post- grad, and my boss is a very caring and understanding person. It might sound selfish, but I would like to have this same job when I return. I don’t want to sound entitled. I am aware that I have to give sufficient notice, I am just unsure how to go about asking for something like this. Would 4-5 months be a leave of absence, or just a leave, or something else? Again, since it is a small place, we have a small staff and I am aware management will have to hire to fill my spot because we are busy. I plan on talking to my boss about this either late this month or mid October, and  to leave mid January and return back to my state in May or June. (The duration of the semester)

We've been snapping for a few weeks, keeping up interesting conversations, and my liking for him has only continued to grow. However, he sometimes leaves me on opened. I thought it was okay at first, because I didn't want to keep bothering him. But then, today, he left me on opened, and when I told him about it, he still left me on opened, not even replying. I thought he might be busy, so I waited and didn't spam him, but he continued to leave me on opened when I sent even one message like ""u busy?"". I don't want to annoy him like this, but it really hurts when he leaves me on opened. I really like him, but I'm scared he doesn't like me back, and him leaving me on opened makes me worry even more.

479,"So bunch of unemployed and not working or studying people are following me around, and they are not the best examples for success. They failed their degrees, some didn't graduate. They are unemployed and not doing anything (based on how much they try to talk to me) with no paid work history or anything beyond temporary internships, if that and this is important, I haven't met them yet. I don't share social media with them. I graduated years ago, and I did really well, tbh. I am a PCM grad from 10th to 12th which is equivalent to GED and then I did University, I'm an architect and economist. 

They want me to prove that I am worthy of being hired but they will never hire me in their entire lives and aren't in a position where their recommendation has any value in my life. At this point, I have more to give them than they ever will be able to give to me. 

How do I explain to them that I am not interested in them being HR in my life? I'm not in their field, and even if I was they aren't in a position to recommend or hire anyone.

The only issue with this beautiful job offer is that it’s a 90 day contract with very little possibility of extension. I’m so confused as what to do, should I take the 90 day contract that could potentially help me in the future or should I take the safe route and stick to the full time job.

484,"My dad got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer when I was around 17 and died a year later. It broke me and still to this day I feel broken. I am now 23 years and still think about him all time. I also have an older brother who is 3 years older than me. Even though my dad never said it, I was always his favourite kid. Maybe because I was the younger kid or we just got along better, I'm not entirely sure why he was closer to me. 

Up until, I was around 12 we all lived together; me, my brother, dad and mum. My dad came from a lower class family, but worked extremely hard in his youth and went from a chemist retail person to starting his own business in real estate well before I was born.

In 2008, when I was around 12 years old, my family decided to migrate to Australia to lead a better life but honestly our life in India was pretty good. We lived in a high-class gated community and had servants and our life was smooth but even though we would have to struggle in Australia for a long time my parents thought it was better for us in the future. Another downside to moving to Australia was that my dad had to stay in India for his business and could only live with us for 2 months every year or two. 

Although, it was rough in the beginning, Australia soon became my new home but with the new freedom of having only one parent, my younger self didn't realise what I was missing. Sometimes I feel like I lost my dad right there and then. I remember the first phone call we made to him after arriving in Aus and hearing him cry which I knew to be devastating because I remember that I cried uncontrollably for that whole day because I knew him really meant; I had only heard cry once before that when I was around 7 or 8 - we were in the car going to my dads grandmas funeral.

But soon we started adjusting and school and friends became life. My dad still showed me the most love but him being so much further we were drifting apart. In the teenage years after adjusting to the fact that I will rarely physically see my father, slowly the weekly phone conversations went to fortnightly then monthly and so on. I had made some good friends and not having my father around and my mother working double shifts. I started to really enjoy my freedom. I started going to school late, came home late and was out for the pretty much the whole weekends. I got used to it so much that when my father did come to visit, I felt like I was in the military and despised the fact that I had to come home straight from school and was only allowed to come out for a limited amount of time. However, I missed him a lot during that time too so it wasn't all bad. I just hated the feeling of missing out on fun hanging around with friends.

In 2014, after finishing my shift at the local Maccas (McDonald's) while approaching my house. I noticed the light for the living room was on. It was a little odd as usually the lights are all off because my mum usually went to sleep early for work. I could see and my mum and brother talking on the phone, I didn't know this phone call was change my life in the worst way imaginable. The closer I got, the more I felt like something was off. Then my mum looked me in my eyes and started balling her eyes out. I couldn't understand what was happening until brother told me 'dad has cancer', I don't know what happened after that - the next few hours are a total blank. I do remember I ended up sleeping with mum that night and crying until we could not cry no more.

Soon, my dad came to Australia to live with us and have his treatment and chemotherapy here. It was stage 4 we knew it was serious but we still had hope. I remember looking at articles and hearing people stories of surviving through stage 4 cancer which I know were probably untrue or at least super rare. I slowly watched cancer kill the man who was my father.

The reason I hate myself is because even after learning to not to hold my dads strict rules against him I still didn't realise the main lesson it should have taught me; cherish every second and minute I have with him. But no, I was selfish and still prioritised going out and hanging around with friends even after the fact he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. What kind of a person does that? Yes... I spent a good amount of time with him, much more than my brother ever did but that is not a good justification I feel like.

I honestly believe he would be so ashamed of me and the actions I took and continue to take. But, I also I wish he or someone could've said told me to spend more time with him or something.... I think he never asked because he was being strong. Maybe I'm forgetting how much time I actually spent with him but all I know now. I regret everything I did and I hate my self for it. The memories of him are fading and his face is getting more blurry by the day. I remember the feeling of 'love' I felt around him but cannot picture the exact moments. I hate my self for not doing more and spending more time with him. I sometimes use being a kid or having never really encountered death as an excuse but it doesn't feel good enough for me.

Now, I am a broken man. I despise so many of my past actions and I'm angry at what I missed and threw away. Losing my dad so early has broken me in more ways than I ever could imagine. I hate the fact no one showed me how to be a 'man' in this world. I hate how few memories I have of him. I hate how so many memories have vanished. I hate.... me.",11Sep2020,1

I’ve never been popular, I’ve never had many friends, now that I am nearly out of high school I feel a sort of kinship with those older than me, as I think is only developmentally right during this time in my life (18). I met an older woman, let’s call her Betty, on Facebook. We met because of a shared hobby (which is rather obscure) for the sake of storytelling let’s say this hobby was knitting (it isn’t obviously, since the hobby is so obscure I don’t want to say it on here) well, we began trading words in the comments and next thing I know she invited me to her house to trade knitting items. We did, and she was admit the first time we met that “we would meet again.” She actually lives in my town only about a two minute drive from my house. I thought our friendship was strictly knitting related, as that is how we met. Recently she has began sending me Facebook memes (which of course for as cringy as they are I find endearing) and links to interesting, non knitting related articles.

498,"1. I put every written word /account as police information and lodged an FIR in India and a FIR in the country I am in, after I started losing faith bit in the previous process cause all they asked me to do is to represent me in court and I can't do that right now. This targets everyone, everyone who ever wrote anything against me, and the persistent ones I lodged for stalking too. I also included defamation in a job written context just to end the loop. I gave the same information to both parties. I have added even people for slander who didn't write anything online but reported by words to third parties. Just general, everyone, even if you talked in proximity of someone else. I just keep sending them new information. 

2. I kind of talked about all sources about people these people thought no one will ever know, including their not photoshopped pictures but this gave me no joy, cause they are already losers. You don't get any joy by telling a hooker they are hookers or a fat person fat. It's not slander. It's just journalism and I felt very icky on it, cause though I was honest, they are just so bad it felt like kicking a dog when they are down. I also got major information out about any people they are related to but it's not satisfying. I thought maybe put another FIR to get someone to sign them up for involuntary hospitalization in a psychiatric ward. They mentioned they are having psychosis and bipolar disorder and autoimmune issues, among other trauma related issues (lost a kid, got into sex work, maybe recalling abusing their family members) so really maybe there is no method, only madness, which would explain alot. I think if I use my FIR as a sounding board I can get them forced in a facility. This may not be a bad idea, cause they already have been chucked out of rehab 4 times and this forces them to get treatment which I assume would be free, on government expense, cause I'm sure their second problem is they can't afford it. I'm thinking this might be the empathetic way to go. 

3. About persistent harassment, I don't want to. I like easy quick cut situations, and I am not having such low self esteem that this is the only holy crusade of my life. Also, it didn't affect me much, or at all, made no difference in my life, contrary I got new friends. The people who I am attacking have such delusional walls to their ego, cause I guess they are already suicidal and it makes sense to keep that up to protect themselves. I think I gave them more PTSD than they hoped to give me. I think even if I hadn't given them PTSD they already had PTSD, based on their life circumstances. 

They also got nothing out of this endeavor. No new contacts. No new relationships. I got all the attention. Their exes and crushes adore me. Their hopes killed off in March 2019. More debt and canceled loan options, credit card debt, I am not sure what but that. They don't even get to date at all. The guy claims he was in a relationship with me while they just got pity. 

5. Obviously, cause they have no value, and their family also doesn't, they are the first ones in their family to get through high school and stop raping their brothers, I got rid of them from my life. I blocked them all, restricted the non slander but not done enough team, basically on value as a person, zero value. They were child predators in their teens and adulthood, which explains the delusional thought process. 

6. They keep bringing up I am anxious and depressed but I really am not, I am really happy I never was. They just are hoping this made an impact to me and all it did is it exaggerated my trust issues, but these people and me never had a relationship or were even acquainted. Out of 4000 people I know I got batshit conspiracy theories from 2-3 people so it wasn't difficult to get rid of them. Also, I report every comment I get to police, just cause. 

Do I need to do anything else or this is enough? 

I think I have annihilated their life? I'm not interested in establishing a host and parasitic relationship. I know this is how they build their self esteem, but in my opinion I destroyed them for perpetuity.

My main anger about this is not what they did, my main anger is how did I end up dealing with this.

I recently found out that people who are rich like me, and tend to have more going for them, prolific and pretty tend to attract these kind of people, like a host to parasite relationship. So, had I had no value, they wouldn't be following me around persistently for years. The idea that I have value makes me a target. As long as I am rich, prolific and competent, this will be a problem for the rest of my life, if it won't be them, it would be someone else.

Should I hire a cyber security/team for physical  safety? I'm not elite but I am VIP enough to be 5-10%. I think I need one at this juncture, cause the number of people I have stalking me are officially in 100s.

499,"So this sounds strange, but hear me out. I notice that when I'm being outgoing and talkative in a social setting, people tend to get worried about my state of mind. I will literally see people stumbling around drunk, but people gravitate to me asking if I'm ok and if I need a ride, etc. 

At first I brushed it off, but now it really bothers me and makes me feel uncomfortable. I feel like if I argue that I am not intoxicated, then people will only be more convinced that I am.

It's frustrating and hurtful, because I am responsible and aware. It's just that I get really enthusiastic and come out of my shell when I feel comfortable with people. During a highly social time, I tend to mimic other people's energy, so I do feel like I blend in, or try to at least. 

I don't want to hide this social side of myself, but I'm tired of dealing with this negative stereotype and having to force myself to be quiet around people. 

I know in my normal day-to-day I'm very reserved, so I guess that can startle people into thinking I'm tipsy.

Can anyone help me understand the vibes I'm giving off? I really feel icky and I just want it to stop.",11Sep2020,1

504,"1. I put every written word /account as police information and lodged an FIR in India and a FIR in the country I am in, after I started losing faith bit in the previous process cause all they asked me to do is to represent me in court and I can't do that right now. This targets everyone, everyone who ever wrote anything against me, and the persistent ones I lodged for stalking too. I also included defamation in a job written context just to end the loop. I gave the same information to both parties. I have added even people for slander who didn't write anything online but reported by words to third parties. Just general, everyone, even if you talked in proximity of someone else. I just keep sending them new information. 

2. I kind of talked about all sources about people these people thought no one will ever know, including their not photoshopped pictures but this gave me no joy, cause they are already losers. You don't get any joy by telling a hooker they are hookers or a fat person fat. It's not slander. It's just journalism and I felt very icky on it, cause though I was honest, they are just so bad it felt like kicking a dog when they are down. I also got major information out about any people they are related to but it's not satisfying. I thought maybe put another FIR to get someone to sign them up for involuntary hospitalization in a psychiatric ward. They mentioned they are having psychosis and bipolar disorder and autoimmune issues, among other trauma related issues (lost a kid, got into sex work, maybe recalling abusing their family members) so really maybe there is no method, only madness, which would explain alot. I think if I use my FIR as a sounding board I can get them forced in a facility. This may not be a bad idea, cause they already have been chucked out of rehab 4 times and this forces them to get treatment which I assume would be free, on government expense, cause I'm sure their second problem is they can't afford it. I'm thinking this might be the empathetic way to go. 

3. About persistent harassment, I don't want to. I like easy quick cut situations, and I am not having such low self esteem that this is the only holy crusade of my life. Also, it didn't affect me much, or at all, made no difference in my life, contrary I got new friends. The people who I am attacking have such delusional walls to their ego, cause I guess they are already suicidal and it makes sense to keep that up to protect themselves. I think I gave them more PTSD than they hoped to give me. I think even if I hadn't given them PTSD they already had PTSD, based on their life circumstances. 

They also got nothing out of this endeavor. No new contacts. No new relationships. I got all the attention. Their exes and crushes adore me. Their hopes killed off in March 2019. More debt and canceled loan options, credit card debt, I am not sure what but that. They don't even get to date at all. The guy claims he was in a relationship with me while they just got pity. 

5. Obviously, cause they have no value, and their family also doesn't, they are the first ones in their family to get through high school and stop raping their brothers, I got rid of them from my life. I blocked them all, restricted the non slander but not done enough team, basically on value as a person, zero value. They were child predators in their teens and adulthood, which explains the delusional thought process. 

6. They keep bringing up I am anxious and depressed but I really am not, I am really happy I never was. They just are hoping this made an impact to me and all it did is it exaggerated my trust issues, but these people and me never had a relationship or were even acquainted. Out of 4000 people I know I got batshit conspiracy theories from 2-3 people so it wasn't difficult to get rid of them. Also, I report every comment I get to police, just cause.

fast forward to february of this year , being afraid of the friendzone and well-accquainted with rejection, i couldnt take it...and i told her everything and to be honest , it just felt good to  say my feelings...she said how she would love to and how great of a guy iam to date but we needed to talk more and get to know each other more first , she also mentioned that she  broke up with her ex about a month prior and shes not over him and still needs time...i admired her honesty and accepted that and tried my best to move on...

But i couldnt..i tried multiple ways to get over her and i couldnt , now i feel like im stuck and dont know what to do to get her

I recently heard she's moving to a new school right next to myn this month , this really made me think about her more and how this is maybe my chance...

Believe anything Breitbart, Fox, or Trump will tell them. Even though my siblings could learn from home completely fine (all of them are high school aged, we have good wifi, they very well behaved, and we only have one working parent), they “need to go back to school” and “need to go to sports practice” (where kids aren’t required to wear masks!). Meanwhile, here I am, locking myself up for six months, refusing to go out like a GOOD NORMAL PERSON SHOULD BE DOING, not even seeing my boyfriend, and they’re going out willy nilly, risking MY health and the lives of my grandparents (since we’re caretakers for them)!

513,"Two years ago when I [27F] got pregnant and went through the nesting phase I became *extremely* OCD about things being clean and organized. This never really went away.

I have previously been diagnosed with OCD in *counting* meaning I am *always* counting things in my mind. Basically, when I add up things in my mind - whether it be mailboxes, window panes, or lines on a sidewalk - I have this tick where no matter what I count... everything comes back to 4, 5, or 6. and this is because I view numbers in my mind like that of an analog clock. If you look at number of lines in the numbers on an analog clock, there are 4 lines in the number four, 5 lines in the number 5, and 6 lines in the number 6.

So, of I count 147 mailboxes, that essentially equals 6 in my mind - because there are 9 lines cumulative in the numbers 1, 4, and 7; there are 6 lines in the number 9, and 6 lines in the number 6.

Back to the nesting phase... It seems I have almost replaced this *counting* tick with a *cleanliness obsession.* I have also been diagnosed with BPD, Depression, and Agoraphobia - for which I have all received treatment. Of these, I feel the most effected by general anxiety in my current life.

I feel completely unable to relax in my own home until EVERYTHING is clean and just so. This means... Trash taken out, dishes clean and out of the sink, counters wiped down, floors swept, laundry done, bathtub and sink rinsed and all hair off the floor and out of the tub, bed made, and clean trashcan and sheets in the baby's nursery, etc. Blankets folded up perfectly, candles lit, etc.

If there is a dirty dish or empty glass sitting, I must put it in the dishwasher right away... Or I will have physical symptoms such as tightness in my chest, and will become angry or snappy if I just try to leave it and ignore it.

I change the sheets at least 3 times per week, clean the bathroom every 2 days if not everyday... Wipe down the sink after I use it each time, and vacuum at least twice a week.

I also have a hair phobia - an extreme fear of loose hair - called chaetophobia - which makes me gag and shiver at the thought or sight of lose hair. My partner [27M] and I both have long dark hair, and both refuse to cut it.

My partner is very supportive and tries his best to clean up after himself and follow my ""rules."" But when he doesn't, I hate feeling like I am *always* nagging him for not rinsing out the tub or immediately throwing out his empty beer bottle. It is taking a toll on relationship satisfaction which is otherwise impeccable.

These issues are something I need to learn to cope with - and at this point I just don't know how. 

I know I need to go see a therapist, but for the time being - until I can find one who accepts my insurance - I am asking you, Reddit, for some coping skills and mechanisms to put into place... to help me learn how to be more relaxed and not let this OCD/anxiety control my life.

517,"Disclaimer: this post is kinda long and there's a lot of backstory sorry :/

So my sister and I are six years apart (I am 21 and she is 27). Recently she graduated and got her phD. Straight after that she got a good job- I'm pretty sure she got the first one she applied for. Anyways her life is great. She has a partner, a job she loves (and also gets paid a lot for) and they recently bought land to build a house on. My mom is so proud of her. Her life is great at the moment... and I'm mad. Don't get me wrong- I congratulate her and act happy and all but on the inside I can't stand it.

Ever since I was young, my sister treated me like crap. To be honest, a lot of my self esteem issues stemmed from her. As my mom was always working, a lot of the time I'd be stuck with my sister. I think she used to have anger issues. She'd hit me all the time- sometimes for no reason. And the thing is- I couldn't really fight back as I was a lot smaller than her. And not a day went by where she'd remind me of how crap I was. She'd tell me I was useless, stupid, good for nothing and an idiot everyday. She convinced me that I was dumb as well. So for the longest time I thought I was dumb and couldn't achieve anything. Due to this, I started thinking of myself as the 'dumb' one in my family. The thing is, my sister is the 'brains' of the family and she constantly reminds everyone. She'll say things like: ""I'm obviously the smartest in the family"". She has a huge ego and honestly, it gets really annoying. 

Anything that I did, she'd put me down. Looking back, she was like that toxic manipulative friend. She'd put me down for everything that I did. If I disagreed with an opinion of hers she'd get extremely annoyed and either hit me or just get super aggressive- like I said I think she had anger issues. I never told anyone (including my parents) because she'd threaten to hit me more. She was seriously a fucking awful, arrogant person and to this day it's hard for me not to hate her. It almost felt like I was an outlet for her anger. 

In my last year of highschool I got really depressed. When I started seeing my psychologist I brought this up and realised how much I was holding in (she only started being nicer to me when I was depressed). I didn't realise how much it had affected me and always sort of just took it. Anyways I finally grew the balls to call her out on it/ confront her. She ended up apologising for it and even admitted that she knew she was a horrible person/ was sorry. I forgave her obviously. This happened a few years go. And while my sister is a lot nicer than she used to be, I still have this underlying resentment toward her. 

Whenever I see glimpses of that mean person, I get really triggered. It's like my sister drags other people down to make herself feel better. She literally points out how she thinks so and so has 'no friends' or how they'll end up 'alone'. She looks down on people who don't go to uni... she literally said once that people who aren't educated (don't go uni) are usually less interesting and have nothing going for them. It's like... umm.. okay? She makes jabs at my cousin sometimes and how he doesn't achieve anything working at a shoe store. She even said that his girlfriend seems like she has ""nothing going for her"".  At times she's mean to her partner as well and when I see glimpses of this person I just hate her all over again. I go through phases where I just really really hate her. If she weren't my sister I would've just cut her off. There's just so many things about her personality that just bring up those feelings of resentment. And it feels like I'm constantly trying to push them down and just forget about it but it always comes back to the surface.

And now that her life is really great I just feel so mad about it. Everytime she has an accomplishment she needs to face time our whole family. Like today her thesis was passed and she had to face time everyone. And while I was all like ""omg that's so great!!!"". On the inside I was like I honestly don't give a fuck.. would you like a medal? And I don't have this problem with any of my other siblings. It's just her. And I know that being mad about how great her life is turning out is not productive and won't do me any good. But these feelings of resentment just won't go away.

People talk to me about some things that interest them and I'm always confused because I'm bad at knowing the names of things.

They met on a live streaming app through a mutual friend who we’ll call Angel, and there’s this other guy let’s call Brian (17m) who’s also on the app. Angel, Brian, and Jane met on the app and continue talking to one another through Snapchat and Group text. Brian is a tricky case. Sometimes he can be pretty funny but other times he can make things weird by being too aggressive, or sexual. Personally I’m surprised he isn’t blocked by them but they keep him around cause he’s “funny”.

Well Jane was on a FaceTime call with my friend, and her phone was showing her computer screen. They were going through her old photos and videos, enjoying each other’s time when she opened a video of a screen recording she took. The recording consisted of her opening a snap video and it was Brian’s junk. So my friend is obviously weirded out by this whole situation. He’s not sure where to go from there. 

She did tell him a little while back that Brian sent a dick pic to her and how she sent it to her friend too for “proof” so this is just the recording of this situation.

In the 3 years I learned that he was in a situation where someone murdered his friend in a drug deal gone wrong so my ex went back later and killed the guy that did it. 100% premeditated murder. I don't have many details but a general area of where it happened and the general situation. Hes really messed up about it and spends most of his time drinking to forget it. Also, he attempted to order a hit on a guy in the same area while we were together and I put a stop to it. 

He was a generally good to me but obviously had his problems. I left because he never wanted to spend time with me. When I left I intended to leave on good terms but he changed completely and started harassing me all the time. Completely out of character as far as I was concerned. It's been a few months now and I'm still dealing with his shit but he's joining the army. I'm still on the lease to the house we rented. I want the house. It's an insanely good deal and my current living situation kind of sucks so it would greatly improve my life but he's refusing to just let me take it over. Because he was joining the military I decided to just leave the murder thing and let him figure his life out but with him purposely trying to screw me over it's getting harder to want to protect him from what hes done.

I have three options here. 1. Forget about it. He's trying to better his life and I shouldn't interfere. 2. Telling him that I'm keeping the house and lease as-is or I'm making a phone call. And 3. Just saying fuck it and making the call.",11Sep2020,1

526,"My bf and I have been together for almost five months if you don’t count a three week long break up. I asked him last night if he felt that there was any chance that our relationship had some sort of future. He then told me that he doesn’t like to think of the future and questions like that grate him because it makes him feel like he is dealing with his parents who ask him everyday about his plans to go to eventually go to medical school as he works as a medical researcher and then accuse him of wasting time each day he’s in medical school. 

I was not aware of this home situation so I apologized and agreed to back off and let him decide our future in his own time. And I plan to keep my word on that but inside I am freaking out. How do I know that this is not just him blowing smoke up my ass? And if he’s not, how long should I wait for him to decide our future? I mean, I personally can’t see myself staying in a relationship for more than two years without a ring on my finger or talk of moving in together (not without a viable reason for it anyway). Does this mean that I will have to propose to HIM in the future (ugh! such a cringey thought of having to propose a girl)?

529,"I'm getting so sick of dealing with him. To explain how this started, her husband of several years had apparently been beating her. She moved out from him after a particularly scary comment he made. During this time, her current boyfriend was offering emotional support to her. She's now living with him.

The issue is, the guy is an obvious alt-righter who only wants to talk about this stupid disgusting conspiracy theories. Lately, he's been accusing me of being racist just because I'm not a right-winger. He also seems to have become convinced that I'm mentally handicapped. And the stupid thing about all this is he's a Jew of all things. Yes, this guy is seriously a Jew who blindly supports Trump, refutes that the alt-right are racist and accuses the left wing of being the actual nazis. He also apparently believes in the illuminati and other such non-sense. I've seriously questioned more than once in the past if he believes anything that's actually true, because all he ever wants to talk about is his stupid racist conspiracy theories. Well, not so much 'talk about' more like 'lecture you about and never ever give you a chance to say a single word. I've actually been trying to interrupt him lately, just so I can actually say something. 

Another big problem is, well, I'm having car problems, and I don't know the first thing about cars, but he does. My latest problem, I've been trying to fix on my own, but after several failed attempts I ended up having to call on him since he has a volt meter and I do not. He wasn't able to find the problem either, apparently because he hates electrical work (he normally prefers vehicles from before either of us were born). Of course, like I said, this guy believes all sorts of weird non-sense, and he seems to only be getting worse. I'm afraid of the effect he may be having on my sister; she has apparently taken to some of his more benign conspiracy theories like Abraham Lincoln being born in this county, though lately she's also seems to be downplaying the coronavirus. Yesterday, she was apparently surprised that I wore a mask when they came here, even though this area is still under lockdown. I have never seen her or her boyfriend wear a mask.

Another annoying problem, is he keeps trying to make friends with me, and I'm getting sick of it. I mean, yesterday he actually let me keep his volt meter (he claimed it didn't have all the features he wanted, so he was looking into replacing it anyway). 

I don't know what to do about this. If it wasn't for this guy, my sister would be homeless right now. I don't have room in my tiny house for another person, and besides that she's obviously developed an emotional attatchment to him due to all he's done. Now, he's not really an evil person, just one that's not firmly grounded in reality. Either way, he denies the corona-virus is lethal, and I'm afraid of what may happen to my sister if Trump is voted out. Not that I think he'll do anything to her; worse case scenario is they'll break-up and he'll kick her out. Either way, he'll no doubt go even further downhill if Trump loses, which seems highly likely at this point. Of course, he seems to be living in denial of that; he's convinced that Biden doesn't have a single supporter, even though 80% of Americans want him in office. Yeah. 

I don't know what do about this guy. I'm sick of having to deal with him, and I'm afraid of what effect he may be having on my sister. I just don't know what to do at this point. Also, he'll be returning on Saturday, assuming he can information on my car. Honestly, I was thinking of trying to use this volt meter he gave me to find the short myself, but I'm not sure I can do that considering I'm not 100% sure how to operate it. He only explained to me how to use it to see if something has power. My father used his to test continuity, but I don't know how to set this one to do that. If I could test continuity, it would make it a lot easier to figure out which wire is which. Yeah, fml... It would be nice if I could fix this problem before tomorrow, but given my ignorance and complete failure to fix the issue myself several times now, I don't know if I could seriously do it. Funny, I've actually thought about getting into tinkering with electronics. Of course, a car is far more advanced than what I was originally thinking of starting off with.

He's also a giant weeb and is very open about all of the moe shit he likes. He has a very close relationship with his club and runs a discord for them and stuff.

I should have the maturity and know how when something is affecting life and make executive decisions but I like having second opinions and people helping me, in case there had been similar cases like myself.

I am a first year uni student studying engineering, I passed first semester well, Second semester now is a little different. I have harder subjects of course and coronavirus is affecting classes at the University. But for me that feels like I'm making excuses.

Some of my subjects, I am seeing a decline in marks and my study schedule is almost non-existent. 

I am very gaming orientated, building my gaming pc and playing with friends and thinking about how I can break from uni work and go play. 

This has started to make me wonder if I should end up selling my gaming setup and go to more of a workstation computer setup that would be more suited towards uni work and being productive.

I am torn because I love my gaming and my friends online but I honestly feel like it's dragging my studies down and how my results could be better.

Thoughts? Advice? Opinions? Please don't hold back and be 100% honest as needed.

537,"Going to try to make this brief. 
I (23M) broke up with my year long gf (22F) in late January due to the fact she kept insisting we plan a trip somewhere. I was not opposed to the idea but at the moment I was struggling with student loan debt, credit card debt (and it's rising interest), recovering from a car accident that left me with a metal plate in my leg (and the bills that come with that), trying to find my way back into school (which I had been out of for 6 months) and just getting the ball rolling at work again. 
Talking about planning a trip seemed very inconsiderate compared what I was currently going through and one day enough was enough and I broke up with her. She didn't take it very well and walked out the door saying she knew she was never going on a trip anywhere and that I don't communicate enough. 
After being told I don't communicate enough I tried to express how I felt the past year through an email some months later. I did not like a good number of her responses to my email. Then Coronavirus happened but I managed to more or less get over her. 
About a month after I broke up with her my family and I found a lawyer to look at the car accident and he managed to place a claim which resulted in me getting a check that erased my student loan debt and credit card debt. Pretty lucky right? I did not mention the money in the email of course. That would just be weird and maybe a little cruel. 

However, my older brother (29M) was furloughed, then laid off, and he had a mental breakdown where he was then diagnosed with schizophrenia and psychosis. He's going through some pretty serious depression and anxiety and I do my best to keep him company. For some reason, incredibly unbeknownst to me, seeing him go through these things make me think about my ex and the specific scenario where I have a conversation with her as to why she thought talking about a trip was appropriate given what I was going through. I've seen a therapist about this, but I guess I can say it didn't do that much to help and I still think about reaching out to her, especially when I see my brother the way he is. 

Do you guys have any similar experiences such as this? Would you reach out to her? Should I reach out to her and try to talk to her in person? She did block me from Instagram and Snapchat but left her work Instagram open for me to see. I am unsure why but whatever. I still have her number.

540,"Hello all. It was a challenge to fit what I needed to in that title, but I think I managed it fairly well. I turn 26 here soon and recently my age has been \*really\* hitting me. Specifically, how worthless my life  is and has been. I am not clear on how to even go about this request properly but I will try my best. Basically, I need a job. I need to be able to make more than minimum wage and support myself and 2 kids along with bills and such. But that is getting a bit ahead of ourselves - lemme tell you a bit about my worthless self first. It looks really long, and it is, but I feel like its important for you all to know how shit of a person i am in order to help give me the best advice you can give. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spent all of high school watching anime, reading books, and playing video games while coasting through with minimum effort. My GPA was somewhere around like 1.3 but I ""passed"" and graduated in 2013. All of my friends were in other states/countries so I never went out anywhere either. Super bad issues with social anxiety and other mental stuff. Got a cashier job so I had gas money to drive rather than keep doing the 40 minute (not a joke) bus ride to school. Spent \~6 month not being able to even look a customer in the eye without getting red and panicking inside and tearing up, thats how bad my social anxiety was. 

During HS I went to a trade school for programming first, but despite putting in actual real effort into something finally I just couldn't seem to memorize any of the content nor could I wrap my head around some of the important concepts even with additional help. Wasted my time there and swapped to networking. Did a bit better here although still worse than everyone else, but I managed to get some business certs before I was done. 

Spent a year doing nothing while living with my grandmother, and this is important. I lived with her from 11th grade till a year after HS was already done, and she did \*everything\* for me. Woke me up with bacon and eggs and toast, did all my dishes, came and got them from my room, did EVERYTHING while I played games for 18 hours a day in a dark room only leaving for work and school, until school was done and I quit my job to ""force myself to find a tech job"" but instead played games all day. 

Eventually I met my first girlfriend, quickly rushed into things and moved in together a few months after I got a job at Geek Squad, had our first kid, had a 2nd kid, and slowly became an alcoholic. I woke up at 2am to go pee and would drink vodka, wake up for work and drink vodka, drive to work drinking, drink at work, drink while at family functions, drunk 24/7 but functioning well enough that nobody noticed. I don't even fully remember much of my life from those few years. A BIG part of it was extreme back pain that nobody could figure out. Anyway me being so much of a slob unable to take care of myself properly and my mental issues led to us breaking up, but we cant fully split because neither of us can support ourselves and the kids and neither of us have family that could help that massively either. We manage to live together but it is not exactly the most calm situation. 

February of 2019 it all finally came to a head and I left my job (same place this entire story, retail) / would have gotten fired / found out I was drunk all the time / wanted to go into rehab / take care of my mental issues / everything changed lol. Therapy helped me realize I was trans and ignoring/suppressing that, I am bi-polar, etc. Doing better now but still a mess and go back and forth with periods where I am able to function as a human and periods where I am not. Still big issues with it all though, depression being the biggest these days and especially lately with my 26th birthday coming up. 

I have tried a few times to study programming or networking again but I just don't think those fields are gonna work for me anymore. I have no idea what else to do or what interests me really but I need to do something with my life. We live day to day barely getting by even before Covid, my credit is trash, I have big debts that aren't paid, loans, credit cards, etc. No money saved to speak of either. I DO have reliable transportation in the form of 2 working cars. 

&amp;#x200B;

SO! With that all out of the way we can get back to the original issue at hand. Where do I go from here? I have always thought of history teaching as my ""backup"" job, but I also know that teaching has pretty shit pay and can be hard to find jobs and I need to be able to support myself and the kids. I think it would be best if I can get some ideas that I can start learning and working towards at home and on my own time rather than going to a trade school / college right away since I am so unreliable and my living situation is so crazy all the time. I would love to write and have started a few stories before but the longest one was only around 50k words or so and I no longer enjoy that story or the direction it was going. I also know that writing is really hard to make a living off of and expect it to remain more as an occational hobby when I actually get proper motivation a few times a year. 

I feel like this post ended up a bit of a mess even and I am having trouble thinking of how else to change this or what is important to add or too unimportant and so on. I'm just going to post what I have here and add information as people request it if I am missing stuff that is important. Sorry. I am at home for now but Fridays and Saturdays I work Uber and will be leaving in the next hour or two so I will keep replying / updating when I can. Thanks for any help.",11Sep2020,1

I don't think I self harm, when I think of it, I always think of cutting with razor blades or anything that releases blood so when I bite/pinch/scratch myself I never consider it self harm because it doesnt do anything. I bite and pinch because I like the way it looks, the marks look pretty and I wish they'd last longer sometimes. It feels nice and helps me zone out on occasion. Does this count as self harm? It's not seriously damaging after all. Shouldn't I be cutting if I am actually depressed?

I have suicidal thoughts, very often in fact. I don't want to be here, the release death would bring seems beautiful to me. However, I would never kill myself, I'm just too scared.

We then came back to my friend’s flat and had some drinks. I then proceeded to get quite drunk and while that happened, the person started putting their arm around my shoulder and stroking my hair to which I didn’t really bother thinking about as I was drunk. 

They started to mention getting pizza to which I was like, okay whatever, and then I started to feel sick from the drink and said I wanted to leave and go home. They tried to persuade me to go back to theirs for pizza because they carbs will help with the drink’ or whatever but I said no and went back to my flat.

I've broken my laptop. The hinge on the right side has broken completely, and when I try to close it it just makes it worse. I don't know what to do because my family and I probably don't have the money to get it fixed and I don't think I have a warranty yet.

571,"I (30) am struggling a lot with my mental health but I have supports in place to try help myself and I’m working on myself as best I can. Most days I struggle but I’m getting there. 

My brother (29) struggles massively with his mental health, doesn’t work, doesn’t socialise, and I worry sick for him and his future as he is in a constant depressive state. 

He messages me constantly with his problems, he’s either extremely depressed or angry. Usually he’s telling me that he’s ruined his dinner by dropping it on the floor or burning it again (I don’t know how he does this) or that he’s scared away ANOTHER girl he met on tinder by coming on too strong or saying the wrong thing. I think he probably has undiagnosed Aspergers personally, as he fits much of the criteria. He is obsessed with playing and talking about guitar to the point I’m sick of hearing about it. 

I love him but I just can’t handle it anymore. Worrying about him is destroying my mental health. I got lots of messages off him today as usual and now I can’t concentrate in work because I have anxiety. He has mood swings where he could explode at me or burst into tears and I never know if what I say could trigger him. 

His friends can’t deal with him anymore either, most of them have now cut him out of their lives. He doesn’t see he’s caused it. He also does nothing to help his mental health. He’s totally self absorbed. Conversations always revolve around him. But he’s also very vulnerable and child like.  

If he wasn’t my brother I would have cut him out of my life long ago but he’s my brother and I worry so much about him. But I just can’t handle it anymore. Talking to him about it isn’t an option as he’s not emotionally mature or self aware enough for that conversation.

I’m great with the kids to be honest, I love playing with them and I’m mostly the only adult there who’s willing to run around with them and tickle them or play fight. The others mostly just tell the kids to sit down and be quiet.

Changing diapers makes me super uncomfortable though. For whatever reason I’m so scared of being seen as a pedophile or something because I absolutely adore these kids and I would never ever harm them.

I finally got myself a new car and started working a new job that pays really well. My only problem is that I’m constantly feeling depressed and thinking of my past. So I wake up not wanting to do anything or jus sitting there after I get ready for work thinking of my past. Even right now, I’m in my lunch break listening to some old music from my past, looking at old videos and pictures, searching up posts on here that have my old towns name. I hate being like this. Everyone around me is happy and living their life. My family is focusing on improving their life, getting new jobs, hanging out, saving up to move. My friends are finishing up college, finding new jobs, hanging out (online I mean), while I ended up moving away from them. Not because there were any problems, I just didn’t want anyone to see me this depressed. That was two years ago. And two years later, I’m still depressed and anxious. 

It’s the same routine everyday, for the past three or so years. More so the past two years. I wake up, think of my past, watch a video that I recorded of me driving around my hometown. Then I listen to old music, specifically of 2013-2014, and then I watch old videos or shows or movies that aired from that time frame or I watched during those two years. It’s kind of scary too because I rewatch the same things over and over again. I haven’t been caught up to date with anything new. It’s usually the same old shows or movies. 

I’m stuck in the past. I’m obsessed with my past. I don’t want to be. I want to live my life (as much as realistically possible) without being dragged by my depression and obsession over what happen between 2013-2014. I don’t want to waste my life anymore. I don’t want to quit this job I have now because I can’t function correctly, because my first and final thoughts of the day are of my past.

Long story short, both my parent's anniversary and birthday are coming up and they're wanting to make a family trip out of it. The plan is to go to a popular beach destination near us and spend the week there. 

The one thing that has me nervous is restaurants. 

Knowing them, we're going to be going out breakfast, lunch, dinner. 

My parent's been going out to eat nearly every weekend, whereas I haven't been out (other than take-out with my friends). I don't feel comfortable going out to eat at restaurants because it just doesn't make sense to me having that be the one place it's ""okay"" to not wear a mask. 

Both my mom and dad are high-risk (especially my dad), and they still go out to eat as if there's nothing wrong with it, and granted, that's their choice, but, I'm just concerned about this trip coming up and honestly, I don't feel comfortable going out to eat like that but I don't want to be an asshole, especially on a trip like this commemorating his birthday and their anniversary.

Does anyone have any advice? I know that if I tell them I'm not comfortable going out to restaurants because of COVID they're going to tell me I'm ""over-reacting"" and that ""everyone's gonna get it at some point"" and that I need to ""stop being selfish"".

Obviously, I freaked out when P told me because I'm just 14 and this is a middle-aged dude I've never ever met IRL. When I asked her about it, she just started laughing at how I was panicking. She told me both she and her dad were laughing at me and I was so creeped out.

Since then, I've been trying to cut her out of my life but it isn't really possible if I have only one other friend who I can talk to. What's worse is that the friend is more loyal to P so I don't think it would be easy to tell all this to her.

What's more is that P has no clue that I'm trying to cut her out of my life. I've been more distant with her than ever, and she still keeps sending me instagram reels like we're still great friends.

So I've been staying with this guy for a few months now and have noticed some strange things. He seems like a very nice guy, he is well educated and has a good job that he's kept for many years... so he is able to function in society but something is off that I can't put my finger on. Sometimes I'll pass by the living room to see him pacing around talking to himself while watching tv, it's not always audible but his facial expressions are as if he's having an intense conversation and sometimes he'll even laugh at/with himself. As soon as I talk to him he'll stop and it's like it wasn't happening. Sometimes we eat dinner together and if the conversation gets quiet, I'll look up to see him talking to himself (not out loud). Sometimes I'll ask him if he's ok, if anything is bothering him or if he has something to say and he's like ""oh no, I'm fine"" and smiles. I even told him one time he was talking to himself and he said no he wasn't. It's almost like he doesn't realize he's doing it.

Another strange thing is when I first started staying here his room as a complete mess. His bed was in the middle of his room and was surrounded by boxes and just... his junk... like there was just a path to his bed and the rest of the room looked like a bomb went off. I'll help him clean it but it ends up going back to the same. He loves old cartoons and has pictures of bugs bunny and other Disney drawings on his walls. He has a daughter who's full grown now but he keeps her finger paintings from when she was a toddler hanging on the walls as well. Sometimes he'll even talk to me in this baby voice ""would you like a dwink?"" He has a very hard time throwing old things away and he has told me that his brother has OCD and is a hoarder and I can't help but feel like he might also have some of that...

He's also socially... off or maybe awkward. He'll knock on the door when I'm in the bathroom and I'll say ""I'm in here!"" and he'll just walk right in so I have to be like um no! and he'll be like ""oh you're taking a dump sorry!"" Like wtf.... we went grocery shopping together one time and in the middle of an aisle with other people around he was like ""omg I can't believe you like that poo-pourie that my mom bought me!"" and I was just like.... uhhh what why would you say that right now &amp; so loudly? Just weird.

I don't see any medications around the house... I have a feeling he's flown under the radar all his life. I know that he's spent a lot of his life living alone and maybe that has something to do with it.",11Sep2020,1

600,"Okay I apologize for this being lengthy but I have to set the scene.

My boyfriend and I bought a home at the end of May. Our dream home. We have some animals, a little bit of land, and a house that we absolutely love. My sister asked if she could move in with us before we even bought a home. We thought it over and said, sure, why not? We agreed she would pay rent and that we would revisit the arrangement in 6 months time.

Well, fast forward to almost 4 months later and we are ready to revisit the arrangement...

She leaves a few dishes in the sink and doesn't put the dishes up, she doesn't clean the counters or the stove when she cooks, she has taken the trash out one time that I know of, maybe twice, and for a while there, if I would ask her to do something she would get an attitude. I talked to her about all of these things and she seems to have gotten better about the dishes, although she still leaves them in the sink a couple of times a week, and she doesn't give me attitude like she used to which I really appreciate. 

I am a year younger than her so I had to have a talk with her about respecting my home and in turn, respecting me.

I will say she does help out by taking my dog out to do her business and has helped look after the animals a couple of times when we were out of town. She has washed and put away my boyfriend and I's dishes a few times as well.

Besides the lack of cleanliness, I think the biggest issue is simply that we do not have the privacy we imagined. We bought our dream home and want to walk around naked, should we choose to do that. We want to get it on whenever and wherever. We are trying to make a baby here and it's really difficult when someone is just on the other side of the wall. We want to enjoy the home we purchased the way we want to by ourselves, as selfish as that sounds.

My heart feels heavy, though, because my sister recently lost her job.  I think we feel this so strongly because of that reason. She is **always** around. When we wake up, she is there. When we get home from work, she is there. When we want to get it on, she is there. We hate feeling like we have to tiptoe around our own home. But, there is a pandemic going on, times are really difficult. She hasn't had the best of luck with men. She suffers from depression and anxiety from time to time. And to top it all off, I basically want to kick her out. Maybe this is better suited in r/AmItheAsshole.. Because I really feel like that asshole.

I think it has worn on my partner the heaviest which in turn weighs on me.. I feel like our relationship has suffered because of it. Seeing him unhappy and uncomfortable is stressful. I feel overwhelmed with guilt for agreeing to something that has negatively impacted my relationship.

Any help is truly appreciated. I don't know what to do. I love my sister. I feel like I am on the verge of a panic attack because I can't make everyone happy.",11Sep2020,1

604,"There is a guy named Mufti Menk and he is a popular Mufti in Islam. My grandmother really looks up to him and always heeds his advice. She first followed him on Facebook and then they started chatting on Google Hangouts. I was suspicious at first, but I wanted to think that just maybe it was legit. It has been over a year now and she has sent this guy pictures of Me and my family. He isn't the person he is pretending to be and is lying to my grandmother. My sister told her that it wasn't actually him, but she refuses to listen to any of us.

I went on her phone and tried to report the account and am currently waiting on a response from Google. I honestly don't know what to do about this, but I am concerned about her and our safety. Does anyone know a way to stop this? The texts that they have been sending each other can get quite disturbing, especially considering that he is supposed to be a married man with children that spreads the word of Allah. Even though I know that this isn't him, I hate the fact that he is manipulating my Grandmother.

605,"So, to kick this off I have a friend of 1 year, who is a couple years older than me. We are both college students and roomates, but I dont know what to do or what's going on? Lately hes been purposefully hurting me in small ways, like rubbing sore spots from workouts with his elbow and stuff while sitting on the couch together. We usually get along well but hes also a little two faced when it comes to addressing issues, due to social anxieties (Assuming, since he has social anxiety issues). He just smiles and laughs awkwardly when hard topics come up. While were at it does anyone know what the psychological term is for someone who is domineering, or doesnt like situations outside his complete control? I dont like talking bad about my friend but I seriously wanna know these things and find a way to try and mitigate the issues without things becoming awkward or ending our friendship cuz of it.

606,"My work team have all been working from home since March, a couple weeks ago one person invited us (6 people total) to their house to meet up as it’s been so long.

This week our country, with rising COVID cases, have stated from Monday we can only meet a maximum of 6 people. There’s also a local lockdown in my area in effect from next Tuesday stating we cannot mix with other households.

Our meeting is tomorrow (Saturday) so we won’t be breaking any rules by going ahead with it.

On one hand I [23F] want to go and see everyone. The risk is low as we are all wfh and so do not go out and mingle with others. We’ve agreed to sit 2 metres apart. 

On the other hand I don’t want to risk anything. I would also be driving another team member there [63F]. &amp; My dad [56M] recently got diagnosed with cancer, so needs chemo in October. 

One of my colleagues [43F] agrees with me that the risk is too high and wants to cancel. The other 4 team mates, including the one I’m driving, are fine about it all. My dad is also pushing me to go as I’ve been working from home for so long and ‘after this weekend who knows when you’ll get chance to go out again so go and have fun’.

What would you do if you were in my situation? 

(Worth noting both my parents have had cancer in the past, this is the 4th time my dad has had it.

613,"I don't burn my hand severely at all. I only do it to the extent where there's just a mark on my hand afterward and I can't touch anything for the rest of the day. I don't know why, but the routine is just to keep putting my hand on the stove to see how much pain I can take before pulling away. I enjoy the rush I get and it's addictive. My eyes water up and I start to feel dizzy. I haven't had any serious injury at all. A couple of times I poured small amounts of boiling water on my hands when washing up to see how what point I've had enough and rinse them with cold water.

I just thought this was harmless, but it wasn't until yesterday I was listening to a podcast where someone said they used to do the exact same thing, and it was classified as self harm. i was a bit surprised.

Is this just harmless exploration of the physical body and its reactions to external stimuli? I personally think it is, but I thought it'd be safer option to ask for another opinion just in case.

616,"In February 2019, one of my best friends (let's call her Jen) hooked me up with her childhood friend. We live in different states and started texting/calling. Let's call him, Ben. Ben is the emotional opposite of me: overly transparent, needed constant contact, planning for the future on the 2nd or 3rd conversation, asking incredibly personal questions immediately that I did not answer. As a professional black woman living in the midwest, it was nice to get this kind of attention from a professional black man (this matters), but it was a lot. I am a very private person and tend to be incredibly slow to warm to people because of personal history. And that same history has taught me I do not do inconsistency/extremes well in my personal life. 

In the 2nd week, Ben, who works as a mental health care provider, said he had something to tell me and made me promise I wouldn't tell anyone. He said Jen didn't know (which should've been a red flag because they've known each other since elementary school). Ben went on to disclose that he lives with bipolar 1.  (I work with indigent populations, and am very familiar what this diagnosis looks like in people without resources, but have no familiarity/experience--that I know of--for what this looks like for people with resources, or what it's like for the partner of someone with this diagnosis.) I'd  explained to him that I need time to process and learn more about the diagnosis, but would honor his privacy. He also stated that there jobs he was applying to did not know about his diagnosis, which concerns me for his clients. Trying to remain open minded rather than following my gut and cutting things off, I started reading articles and stayed in touch with him. I become more concerned as I learn about the adverse interactions between alcohol and the types of medications prescribed for Bipolar 1 as on more than one occasion, Ben was taking shots while we were on the phone. 

A few days later, I got a text from Ben saying he's ending the ""relationship."" I respond that I'm confused, but hope he's safe. He goes on to say that he thinks it's best to cut his losses. I tell him that he didn't give me time to process, which I had to do alone because of my promise to respect his privacy. That I told him I don't do drama or hot and cold, so I hope he has a good life and goodbye. He responds goodbye. I think that's the end of it. 

For the next week, Ben calls me twice a day every day and sends me text messages asking me to call him. I don't answer. I'm of the mindset that when people show you who they are, you believe them and walk away. I don't believe in ""closure."" Finally, he leaves me a voice mail stating that if I don't respond he'll leave me alone. I blocked him after that, so I have no idea if he continued to attempt contact. I tell our mutual friend she's no longer allowed to hook me up with anyone, but continue to respect Ben's wishes and don't tell her what happened.

I purchased a new phone at the beginning of COVID and later learned the settings didn't go to my new phone. March of this year, he sends me a text asking if I'm COVID free. I don't respond, but didn't attempt. 

About a month ago, I joked to Jen that I'm willing to help with a project of hers if Ben isn't involved. Unbeknownst to me, she went to Ben and asked what went wrong. I later found out he initially stated he didn't know, that he'd tried to reach me and I didn't respond. Ben then went back to read our texts and told Jen he'd fucked up. He also realized he was no longer blocked and started calling me multiple times a day and texting me. When I confronted Jen, she told me about their conversation and said she didn't want to be in the middle. I blocked Ben, again. Then I got multiple calls from another number in the state Ben is from. No vm, so I blocked that number. Then Jen sends me a screenshot of a text to her from Ben asking her to have me call him. After reminding her she said she didn't want to be in the middle, I went on about my business. 

Yesterday, I get a call from a local number I don't recognize and don't answer it. No voicemail. That unknown local number then sends me a text asking if I heard what happened. I respond, ""who's this?"" and the response? ""February 2019."" So I block that number. 

If he tries another number, what should I do? After no response from me for over a year, you'd think he understands I don't want to talk to him. I'm concerned responding to him now will be seen as a green light and I have no interests in any sort of relationship/interaction with him. I don't want to threaten him professionally, there are very few black men who've reached his level of education and professional success. But I'm also tired of this.

617,"I seriously can’t tell..

I’ve been in a relationship for about a year and a half now, and I am starting to worry that I’m just settling for less. A lot of things I’ve asked my partner to do seem like too much to ask though, idk.
Basically all I really want is more attention and affection, and for them to be there when things are tough, because I’m struggling mentally big time right now. But asking that seems like not much, but I guess in the big scheme of things it is. 

A lot of times I feel like I get put off in favor of work, but I can’t really tell if I just feel that way or that’s actually the case. Like for example this morning I wanted to be able to text with them for a little bit and say good morning, but they said they couldn’t text more than 15 minutes because they’re supposed to turn in an assignment. But they also seemed aggravated with me that I was texting but it’s probably justifiable cause maybe I’m just annoying and demanding.
I try to make sure I’m doing enough too, I make food for them a lot and like to give them little gifts I’ve made, I also really like to talk to them often. 

Over the past month I’ve talked a lot about asking more of them, just more time together and more listening more affection and idk if that’s bad or not. Cause a lot of the time I feel like I do all these things for them, in addition to struggling with my mental health, and then I don’t get much back. But lately they have been trying to do more which has been nice, but idk if they’ve really gone out of their way to listen to me and comfort me which is really one of the top things I asked for. It always seems like they have some over exaggerated excuse for not calling or texting or hanging out with me, it’s putting a damper on our trust a little bit I think too. So I would like outside opinions, am I just being entitled or is all this stuff way too unreasonable to be asking?",11Sep2020,1

621,"This is complicated... my best guy friend (or so I thought) was in my wedding party 2 years ago. He had just started dating his boyfriend a month before. When he showed up, he had changed, and not in a good way. Sparing the details, his boyfriend was very clearly toxic and his bad behavior had rubbed off on him. We've been pretty distant since then, and honestly, due to some really messed up stuff that happened at my wedding (he and his boyfriend stole from me... yes, stole from me during my wedding, you read that right), I had considered ending the friendship.

They got engaged last year. He called me this morning and left a voice mail asking me to be his ""best woman.""

I don't want to do it. First off, I cannot support his marriage to this guy, because the man is extremely toxic, as i mentioned before, and i simply don't want to be there near either of them. Secondly, I'm still really unhappy with what happened 2 years ago, and I'm uncomfortable with the idea of taking on the responsibilities that come with being what is basically maid of honor because of it.

I don't want to hurt his feelings (even though, yeah I know, he was a complete shit head 2 years ago and it's effectively hurt our friendship and maybe I shouldn't care) because I know how big of a deal this is to him.

We flirted a little but I do this with a lot of my friends so I thought it was all cool. Long story short one night I was over at his place, all our other friends had left and I was really high and drunk and slept with him. I hated myself sooo bad for doing this. Next week when I saw him we talked and he said he would tell his gf what happened because I hated to have to keep that secret for him. We would talk again the week after. Then COVID came in the picture and I haven’t seen him or spoken to him in six months. He is still with his gf and I don’t think he told her. He was so calm about all this that I think he does this more often (cheating).

My company is only a few years old and therefore does not have many training resources. They have no training plan in place. They wing it every time somebody is hired and try to disperse the training among other coworkers in similar roles.

As I express my concerns and the things I’m struggling with, I’m met the sentiment that I should ask more questions, which is confusing and disheartening. A lot of my work is time sensitive and scheduling a zoom meeting with another already-stretched-too-thin-coworker is difficult. So after I send emails and make calls and try schedule zoom meetings with my coworkers as my first line of attack, I’m typically left to figure things out on my own.

Then I’m told I need to ask more questions??

These are major parts of my role I’m trying to get assistance with. The latest was in writing budgets for next year. I have followed budgets but never written them, let alone been trained in the particulars of how our company operates when it comes to budgeting. I’m left to scrounge for answers wherever I have been able to and have now written multiple budgets with no training. I have little confidence in their quality. 

I have presented my email threads, call logs, and attempts to schedule meetings on a particular topic that I need help with in an attempt to show that I’m stressed because I can’t get any training. I was met with the sentiment that I’m doing a good job and that this role is easy and I can figure things out. I’m flattered they have so much confidence in me, but I would be a lot less stressed and unhappy if i could have somebody train me rather than allowing me to make mistake after mistake to learn from. And I truly don’t feel this role is easy for somebody with little experience.

It was mostly toxic so after graduating I felt that trying to continue any of those friendships wouldn’t benefit me.

Before lockdown I wanted to go out more and try to push my social life, getting to know people and stuff, but obviously that wasn't meant to be. I'm currently staying in my home town, which is like two hours away from said city and it's not even much, but you have to factor in the fact that my parents may not agree with me going there and I would be kind of irresponsible during a time like this (I'm from Italy and even though the situation is way better than it was a few months ago, it's still hazardous). Luckily, my friends and family are here with me, so I'm not alone and feel blessed that nothing has happened with any of them. 

But here's the thing. I was bored during lockdown and downloaded some random messaging app. I got to know this girl from the city I study in. We started talking and adding each other on social networks, and now she's kinda my friend. Problem is,  I wanna meet her in person to get to know each other better, and try and see if something could come out of it. I really want to go there, but that may not be the wisest thing to do right now. We're not in lockdown anymore, but more and more cases are still coming up every day. But if we just keep talking on social networks this way, I fear she may move on and eventually find someone else she can actually meet in person. Of course if I eventually get to go there I will respect each and every social distancing rule.

633,"I had a math teacher the last two years that was almost like a mentor to me. I struggled a lot the last 3 years with an eating disorder, and I was always having a hard time keeping up my grades cause I was really struggling with my mental health. I cared about learning but I was so deep into my eating disorder that I was having a really hard time. My teacher let me work in her classroom during her free period and helped me a lot so I could catch up on work and ask her questions so I could get better at math cause I really wanted to understand it and get better. I improved so much with my grades cause of that. She didn’t know that I was struggling with anorexia and she was so encouraging to me even though I never opened up about it to her. I had no encouragement in my life outside of school cause my parents were abusive, so hearing encouragement even though I wasn’t the best student was honestly the only thing keeping me motivated to stay alive. She showed that she really cared about her students. At this point, I never had opened up to anyone about my ed yet, and I knew that she was into health and fitness cause she would talk about it sometimes, so I felt like she would be someone who would actually understand if I told her about it. I requested a google meet with her over quarantine because I knew that that would be my last week as her student, and I thanked her for being so supportive even though I wasn’t that good at math and I apologized for when I used to not care about my work and how I was really happy that she motivated me to try harder. I opened up to her about how I was struggling with my eating disorder the past few years and she was SO supportive and asked me a lot of questions about it. She said that she understood because growing up into running and fitness, she had a lot of friends who struggled with eating disorders also. She said she was really happy that I opened up to her and that she was proud of me. And she was super excited for me about my career choice and college plans for later this year. She seemed like she was looking forward to seeing “how far I go” with my future career after I head off to college. I’m really sad that I have to leave high school because at home I have no encouragement or support at all, and my teacher was the only one in my life who seemed to care about me improving with both my grades and mental health.

636,"I have a friend who was supposed to be getting married in November.  The invite list is 250 people.  There was a lot of debate among both sides of the family, but luckily they all agreed to postponed the wedding.  She was also having some major league cold feet, so I’m pretty sure postponing due to covid is more of a postponment to work through some relationship issues and decide if getting married is really what they want to do.

Anyway with all that information in mind....her bridal shower is still on for tomorrow.  I ordered her gift a little while ago.  I found out earlier this week that I had a fever at work and had to go for a precautionary test and quarantine myself until my test results come back.  So I can not physically attend the shower.

So....do I drop the gift off to her?  Do I return it since I’m not attending the shower?  What is the etiquette here?

Thanks everyone!",11Sep2020,1

It was with the friend of mine, on whom I had a crush on. I know it was a mistake, but it wasn’t the worst part. I told him I was a virgin beforehand. At first he held my body with his hand and just pushed his penis inside of me forcefully when I was still dry, it was awful. During sex I had to tell him several times to slow down because it hurt so bad. When I was on top of him, he suddenly pushed me aside like a rag doll, finished himself off and went to sleep. I felt so awful, you have no idea. No consideration for my pleasure, no respect for me and my body. He didn’t even cuddle with me afterwards. I felt really hurt, like I wasn’t a human but an object he just used for his pleasure only. I cut ties with him after that, but in very polite manner and didn’t mention to him how much it hurt me how he treated me. He normally is kind and friendly person, so I trusted him. But after that experience I realized he’s not good guy after all. I’m traumatized after all this tbh. I’m so angry and just want to tell him how awfully he treated me! Is it a bad idea to text him this?? I dont want him to treat another girl like this. I don’t want to feel like a used doormat anymore, I want to stand up for myself. This happened 3 years ago, but it was such a bad experience for me I cant get it out of my head. Every time I watch TV, and there is sex scene, i get flashbacks and I want to cry and Im filled with anger. What should I do about this?? Should I confront him??",11Sep2020,1

641,"Hi, so I'm a bit of a mess right now so sorry for the ramble.

We've been together for over two years, our last vacation together was last year in June for a week. I work in a big company, time off is settled a year in advance, while he's working from his home office... Deadlines are sometimes s thing for him, but not this month. 

My two week vacation started this Monday, I had to present my bachelors degree paper for my diploma (I'm not sure how it works in USA, I'm from Europe) but due to the pandemic it was online on Google Meet so I could've been anywhere. I did it today, after 8 years of struggling to finish college (long story, it's over now and I'm so happy). We planned to go on a car trip around our country this week, he said let's wait until you finish on Friday, I said ok.

Today he went out to give me space for my presentation and to meet with his main client. He came back once I was done, said congratulations and that's it. We were supposed to leave tonight to his parents to drop our cat (one hour drive) and leave from there tomorrow morning.

I went to sleep for two hours, he said he has to work.

Now, this is my only time when I'm available for going on this trip and he knows it. Like I said, he has no deadlines, but it's just who he is. He always has to answer the phone (we had a whole thing in the beginning when I explained you can't get up during sex to answer to your client, he's a little better at this now). Now he told me it's very late (6 P.M. Here) and he's tired and didn't pack a bag, so we should go tomorrow afternoon to his parents, and leave on Sunday. The thing is he wants to be back home Wednesday afternoon (again, his terms, not mine) so that leaves us three days? What around the country trip is that?? I'm just...sad that I can't even celebrate my diploma with him (lots of backstory here about my parents never supporting my accomplishments, I thought this time it would be different).


I really need to know if I'm wrong here or not...and if I'm not, how do I talk to him about this, because I want to support his work, I don't want him to drop everything at a whim but not neglect me either...

I'm going out with my friends tonight to celebrate. I've cried about this enuhh, I want to enjoy this evening. But thank you in advance for any advice you have for me!",11Sep2020,1
642,"I have an issue and was wondering if people might have some advice?

I live in a fairly narrow road with not much parking. People sometimes park opposite my drive which leaves me hardly any space to manoeuvre off my driveway to the point where there have been occasions where I haven't been able to get my car off the driveway without my daughter moving her car from the adjacent space. 

I've spoken to my neighbour opposite (who's house this issue is outside of) about this and they now park in a way which doesn't compromise my parking for which I'm very grateful. Recently, a car has been parked in this spot more often and, this morning, I wouldn't have been able to get off my driveway if my daughter had been home. I left a polite note on the car, and spoke to my neighbour who then also left a note as the car was parked over her dropped kerb too.

We then discussed that the car may have been abandoned so I called the police on 101. They then contacted the owner of the car who told them he was parked legally. I then called them back to state that he was parked partially over the dropped kerb but also to ask them advice about how to get off my drive if the car was effectively blocking me in. While on the phone, the driver came to his car and took photos of his car, my neighbour's car and wrote a rude message on the back of one of the notes which he then put under the neighbour's windscreen wiper. He then drove off. My neighbour is upset about the note and worried about any further drama.

I've contacted the council who have said it's a police matter, the police have said it's not really to do with them. I genuinely don't want to cause a fuss, but I just want to be able to park on my drive and get the kids to school without a drama every morning. 

I also need to say that this man has actually parked his car on my drive overnight before which meant my daughter had to find parking elsewhere on our road. 

I'm actually really worried now that he's going to come and have a go at me at my house, or worse, have a go at my neighbours opposite who had nothing to do with the police. I'm worried he's going to damage our cars or something too. I'm a bit of a nervous wreck about it, actually. 

Just wondering if anyone has had similar issues or any idea how to resolve this without further drama? Hopefully, he's had his bit of aggro and will perhaps park a little more considerately from now on, but I don't know. I don't know where he lives so can't knock on his door and have a chat about it, and I'm not sure I would if I knew anyway. Though I was thinking maybe he had a wife/partner who might be more approachable...

I’m so excited to live with him. It feels right. We’ve spent weeks together before, have a really regular routine with each other &amp; coexist great. I think we will be a great team and I don’t really have any doubts about it for myself.

I don’t really feel like they’re going to get it and I feel like they’re going to judge me for it.

648,"I’m not sure how I feel anymore? I almost feel emotionless and I’m not sure if that is completely normal with my current situation or if I should go speak to my GP? 

I’ve had my moments where I have been a complete mess, anxious and feeling as if my life has completely flipped upside down but now I feel nothing. Literally nothing! In my head I feel like nothing is wrong with my dad and everything is fine and no matter how much I tell myself my dad is very poorly in hospital, I can’t seem to shake off that feeling? I only felt like this for the last couple day’s.  I feel almost guilty for reaching out because I’m making my dads situation about me. 

A bit of context for you. I had recently lost my Auntie to Lung cancer two months ago. She had been diagnosed with cancer and within one month she had sadly passed away. I don’t feel like I’ve had time to adjust to this and then to now find out my dad has cancer. 

Last week my dad was completely fine, then had random tummy pain which the doctor thought it was his appendix and sent him to hospital. It turned out to be a cancerous tumour which had perforated his bowels.  This identify that he had bowel and liver cancer. He should be home now and starting his chemo, however he has caught another infection and won’t be allowed home for another week. 

I have been looking after my mother/brother for the past week or so, making sure they are fine and supporting them any way I can. They haven’t seen me cry yet and neither has my dad. I emotionally switch off around my family so I’m the strong one and try to carry them. I don’t live with my parents and I’m only (24F). 

I guess I’m asking for advice from anyone who has gone through similar situations?

652,"I just got engaged earlier this spring. Before my fiancé proposed he went to my dad to make sure he was ok with it. While my dad did bring up that he thought it was a bit soon he didn’t seem totally opposed to the idea.  He went ahead and proposed to me a couple weeks later and I said yes. Looking back at the time my parents took to get engaged(6months) and the time we had been dating(1year and 3months) we didn’t think this was all that rushed. 

A month into our engagement we decided on a date for later this fall. We were just about to go around announcing it to everyone when we were told that my fiancé was no longer welcome at my family’s weekly dinner or even allowed on my dads property for that matter. It hit us like a ton of bricks. We didn’t know what happened to make my dad hate him so much and still don’t. There was no argument, fight, or anything. 

As a result I decided not to come to the family dinners anymore as I didn’t feel right about going where my fiancé isn’t welcome. I haven’t seen my dad in months, not that I would have seen him if I had gone. I heard he hasn’t been showing up at them either even though they are in his house. 

Recently my dad has made it known that he wants to talk to me because he heard through someone about when the wedding is and is surprised I didn’t tell him myself. Keep in mind my fiancé isn’t welcome still. He even got a message to my dad at one point that he wants to talk to my dad and try to resolve whatever is happening between the two of them. My dad has shown no interest in talking to him still and keeps insisting he wants to talk to me because I am his daughter. 

Due to anxiety that is not a good option for me. I break down into panic attacks just thinking about it. Just thinking about it causes the muscles in my throat to tighten which makes it hard for me to breath and next to impossible to talk. As a compromise I wrote him a letter explaining all my hurt and that if he would try to resolve things with my fiancé it would go a long way to helping my anxiety and making it easier for me be able to talk to him again. 

There has been no response and the wedding is just one month away. I know he read the letter because he read it out loud to my mom. Should I have him at my wedding knowing he doesn’t want to fix things with my fiancé or should I tell him not to come? Honestly I don’t feel comfortable with having him walk me down the isle if things don’t get better but I feel like it will cause more problems later if I don’t.",11Sep2020,1

660,"As of recent I want to move out of my grandmother's house to live with my boyfriend and his roommate. I'm nineteen years old and after being kicked out of my father's house in January I had the idea of leaving after I graduated high school. I never told anyone my plan except the high school counselor and she told me it was my decision. After graduating and spending time enjoying the large amount of time to myself, I thought about leaving again but there has always been one complication. 

My family wants me to go to college right after I graduated high school.

I thought going to college was my plan at first but soon realized that's what my family wanted but not what I want. Yes I would like to go but I wanted to take time off and go seek out help for my depression and past trauma before I entered into college. I made that statement obvious to my mother and grandmother but they didn't agree with me and said I should just go into college.

Truth is, my mom had left when I was 12. I was raised by my narcissistic father who absolutely hated my mother who escaped the abuse recommended by her doctors and made the decision to leave her two children behind. I grew up in fear and every day I would look forward to moving out to find some where better and to get help but my father would destroy the thought of leaving. At the time my grandmother, my father's mother, knew of the abuse and neglect but never did anything. Over time I had begun to hate my family for not letting me get the help I needed. Suddenly my mother came back into my life and she wanted to be apart of my life by the time I was 16. At this moment in my life,  I had lived without her and saw her as a stranger.

Eventually chaos struck and my younger sister, who has autism, left to live with my mother while I was left alone once more. A week after my sister left, my father kicked me out and my grandmother allowed me to stay at her house. From January until now, I've been living in her house. My father would not let me get a job or get my driver's license and I thought maybe my grandmother might help me do those things but all she told me was to wait until after I go to college. I understand where college is important but as of now I would rather worry about getting a job to get insurance to go look for therapy since my family didn't want to help me.

I've always been the black sheep of the family and when I got I to a relationship suddenly everyone started to show me attention because they wanted to see if me and the guy I am dating were going to break up. It's been nearly a year now and we haven't broken up. A few months ago my boyfriend's friend asked him to be his roommate and my boyfriend saw an opportunity to help me get out of my family and try to get me the help I needed. He brought it up with me and I spent a few months thinking it over before I told my mother and grandmother. My mother at first didn't know how to take the news but eventually accepted it but my grandmother said no and left it at that. 

Skip forward to now, my boyfriend has always said he wanted to go into the military and I supported him while my family disagreed. Just yesterday he got registered and he was ecstatic about it and I was happy for him while my family continued to disagree. I originally was supposed to move out in December but it changed because my boyfriend would be send off to boot camp in October. Which meant if I moved, I would have to get a job until he started to get money and we could share a joint bank account. I said I didn't mind and promised to do my best at finding a job. While my boyfriend would be at boot camp I would be living with his roommate who is busy going to college. When I brought up the living situation my mother and grandmother told me it was a bad idea and that I should just stay in my hometown and go to college. My mother accused me of cheating on my boyfriend and I don't know why while my grandmother told me, my boyfriend's roommate would rape me. 

Keep in mind that my boyfriend and his roommate are both eighteen and I've known both of them in school because we all went together before our friend graduated a year earlier than my boyfriend and I.

I want to move out but now I sound like i want to run away from my family but that wasn't what I wanted it to be. I wanted to leave because I am just think I'm better off fending for myself. I still want to move out but I only told them that I wanted to leave to be polite and not just leave without telling them.

 I regret telling them now and I need some advice on what to do because I'm on the verge of crying and about to break up with my boyfriend because of their demands and expectations.",11Sep2020,1
661,"Hi, and sorry if this is a weird question. To preface this, I *know* this isn't something that's legal to do technically, and I *know* I need to get my stuff sorted.

I'm a new freelancer and I'm from the EU, in a smaller country. I'm working with a US client and have been doing stuff through a freelance site so far, and now for a separate project I'd like to move out of the website because of the large chunk they take out of my pay. I haven't put aside enough money to open a legal business yet, and besides, I wanted to see if it was a good investment first. In my country (and presumably most of the EU), you can't just invoice someone as an individual contractor, as you can in the US, and then simply file your taxes at the end of the year. You have to have a legal business, which is obviously a whole process and costs some money to set up.  So right now I don't have any legal form of billing.  

I noticed that through sites like Waveapps you can invoice someone without having to enter any company details, like registration numbers, etc. You just have to upload a logo and write the company names. 

Because this is not an individual, but a company, I know he needs some form of invoice for any service bought, so every penny is legally accounted for. So my question is, would this person run into any issues because of an invoice like this? Does anyone actually check? Would *I* face any issues? I don't mean from my own country, on that front I'm pretty much safe since it's small sums of money.

Sorry again if this question breaks any rules, but if this is a really bad idea, I'd rather know straight up so I can figure out some other solution.",11Sep2020,1

I also know 6 guys from school, I met them last monday/tuesday and they are fun to hang out with on discord and are good students I will proberly learn a lot from.

But I don't like guys! I don't feel like doing these 'guys' things. Yes those things are fun. But I am worried, I have some set life goals. Like getting a GF or some more girl friends. Bc I can relate more to them idk. They talk more about feelings and I am a really sensitive person.

Besides that, I rather have a good laugh with a girl then a boy. Idk why. I mean, I feel better laughing about a good joke then some dumb fucking nazi joke. I find them both funny but really I rather have the first 1 knowing I am not making fun of something stupid.

That's also why I like my crush. Bc she just sushes me when I make dark jokes. 

But well, she hangs out with this guy and they seem pretty close so yeaaaaah..
I guess her status will be 'taken' in about a week or 2.

So yeah, Normally I would say 'Next'! 
But litterly! Where am I going to get more girl friends?
My school is full of boys, My 4 friends are not really easy to hang out with because it's long distance and I only like 1 of them. My work isn't the kind of place to get a GF as all of them are pretty stupid people. I am talking about girls that have sex addiction or are being stalked and stuff, or some girls that are too much of a male type. Which isn't a problem. Just not my thing.

Maybe it's bc my job is attractive to troubled people.
Even tough one of my 4 friends has litterly been with me in a mental hospital.

Never the less. I am proberly not going to find a interesting girl in the upcoming 4 years. And getting a GF at the age of 23 feels a little late to be honest.
Also, I don't think I want to wait till then. I am inpatient.

Also bc I enjoy it so much being with a girl, Bc I like to have a GF really really bad It seems like I am missing out on male friendships which I can litterly make if I put some effort into them. I do not, guys are not my priority right now.


It's just so annoying that I am going to be stuck with the same set of people for the next 4 years. 

Can't they just kick out some boys that are going to fail game dev anyway and replace them with some motivated girls? I don't like being with guys.


Disclaimer: I do not hate guys, I just rather be with girls. This is proven by the fact I am on good terms with my fellow schoolmates. I actually played this normie game fortnite bc I tought it would be fun to play games with them. But like I said Guys are not my priority so it was not actually putting effort in I was just enjoying the moment.

What Should I do? I don't feel like seeing no one in the upcoming 4 years. I don't feel like spending another 4 birthdays without friends. I don't feel like spending all my times with guys knowing it won't bring me anything except fun goofy moments. I want my life goals set. 

TL;DR
I am stuck to the same set of people for the upcoming 4 years. My crush is proberly not interested. Every girl I am on good terms with seems to avoid me and are long distant and I just want more girl friends and a girlfriend ASAP as waiting till I am 23 seems like torture. What should I do? I keep losing friends and no one sticks, why is it that sometimes it is so hard to make male friends and so hard to FIND girl friends.",11Sep2020,1

670,"Hello 

last night my boyfriend broke up with me because of my weight. He told me that he doesn't envision a life with me or having children with me because he thinks I'm too big. This wasn't the first guy to break  up with me because of my weight. my last 2 boyfriends also broke up with me then later admitted it was because of my weight.

this really hurts but also confuses me because I guess I wanna know how does someone stay in relationship for so long knowing they don't like their body. I've always been curious about. Has anyone been with someone plus size then later decided to end it? what really goes on in a guys mind when they do that and why do they do it. 

please help.",11Sep2020,1

673,"I'm 19 years old and just got my first real job a few months ago. I have had 4-6 month long internships before this job, so I thought I knew what I wanted from a job. I applied to what I thought was my dream job, but after a couple of weeks I became so depressed, overwhelmed, and anxious that I was crying at work, sobbing when I got home, having anxiety attacks at work, and I would be on the verge of tears all day. I knew I needed out because I already had underlying depression that was left untreated because I couldn't afford healthcare, but I also made too money much to qualify for free healthcare. 

Anyway, one day at work I had an anxiety attack so big that I knew I had to leave. I was hyperventilating, my face was numb and tingling, and I was inconsolable. I was scared to quit this job because I needed the money really bad, but I knew I had to quit because it was becoming impossible to even get out of bed in the morning. I quit my job last week. I planned on applying to every job I could find that night I got home. I was smiling, finally felt free, and I was excited to get a new job as soon as possible. 

That night when I got home, I broke my ankle and I can't even walk from one room to the other. That put a pause on my job search. Now all I can do is sit here until I can finally get a job. I'm 19 but I feel like I'm running out of time. I feel so useless just sitting here while my friends and family my age all have jobs or are going to college. I hate being jobless and wasting my days away. I don't know what to do and I've grown so depressed from everything these past few months.

676,"so I've been leasing a Honda and I remember when signing my agreement that I have a ""sentinel package"" which means all oil changes and tire rotations are free. Well, every time I have gone to the dealership they have always argued with me and said that I need to pay. It was $45 and I thought maybe I'm wrong and didn't understand? So I always just paid for it. Let's fast forward two years later and I moved and it was time to do the oil change again... so I take it to my local Honda and guess what? I didn't have to pay! They explained to me that it was free because I have a package. I'm so pissed, I have him highlight the areas on where it states I have a package, I contact Honda- nothing. Blip. They tell me it's a holiday and I won't hear back they don't take my contact info they suggest I just call back!! They take MY money and I should follow up with them?!!?? I wasn't happy with that, so I did some digging. Found this idiot's contact information, I email him. He emails me back not the least bit concerned or apologetic. ""I'm out of town, I'll get back on Tuesday."" Tuesday rolls by it's 10 am haven't heard shit from this asshole so I email again. His reply is he is currently going through his records to see what I was charged for... he will get back to me. Mind you- already provided Honda receipts and the highlighted portion that says I have a package. Anyway, a whole day goes by, it's Wednesday morning haven't heard back, so I email this asshole again. They found that I was charged incorrectly and that they will write me a check for all oil changes. I ask when will I receive it... he says they need to sign it and he will get back to me. It's Friday, haven't heard shit from him on where my money is- has it been sent out? Nothing. What should I do now? Should I contact corporate?

So far I've learned that our manager, I'll call her ""C"" has a bad habit of spreading rumors and starting drama with staff, especially new hires and I've learned that she's already talked about me to the bartender (who thankful stood up for me). I kinda figured though as she had a weird vibe to her when I first met her, she would get on me about stuff I didn't even do, a few nights ago she tried scolding me for seating a family at a table and not giving them menus, then I told her I didn't even seat that table and she shut right up. But it seems like she wants to get on me about everything that goes wrong and it's frustrating. Also apparently no one knows when we're supposed to get paid. Everyone I asked said it was every other Friday and when I asked people of it was this Friday no one could answer, not even the owner and checking my bank account this morning I saw that no money came in so idk if it's because we're not getting paid this Friday or if it's because someone messed up my direct deposit information.

I love them but ever since they all had their coming out, being gay and girls are like the only topic we talk about and it's making me uncomfortable because they ask what I identify as and tell me things like ""I think we're all a bit gay, I mean have you seen women?"". 
I know that I'm hetero but I almost feel too afraid to tell them straight up because they absolutely don't see it as valid. I like to make jokes with them and I do hype the women they like because objectively they are really pretty but it still gives me an icky feeling and I don't know what to do about it. It feels like if I said I wasn't gay, they wouldn't truly accept it and maybe even think I'm homophobic, especially because I'm a Christian.
I've been avoiding hanging out with them because it makes me so uncomfortable to be the only straight person and I know I'm probably sounding incredibly ignorant right now.

There's no point speaking about my concerns re the 1h30 each way commute, everyone just gushes with assurances how safe it is. They tell me to just be cautious. Yep staying at home is me being cautious. Other people are not cautious. They tell me to wait in the station until an empty train comes. I'd literally rather be working than standing in the station for an hour. Now that's really saying something. 

It's so obvious they say it's not mandatory so they can argue they're not liable if someone gets sick. So just pressure people to come in and then say that person *chose* to come if they get sick. 

I dunno how to react to a manager saying it's not mandatory but I should come because it'd be lovely to see me and ""I have to face other people eventually"" (right in time for our new spike).

And gave out reasons for the delay. Then the next day, totally no response and on the 3rd day the online store is gone. 😩

I have tried searching for them on the web and the person shown on the Identification. I found the person on the ID but he showed me documents that indicated he is also a victim of these people for identity theft, and that his Driver's license was lost months ago and these people are using his ID to transact scams online 😩

688,"So last night I asked my sister to watch my 6 year old daughter while me and my fiance went out to dinner with some friends, The plan was we were going to stay out for more then just dinner and my sister was responsible for feeding my daughter and putting her to bed later on that night.

Well things didn't work out that way, Me being as clumsy as I am tripped over my own feet going down stairs and even though one of my fiance's friend caught me I still badly sprained my ankle, I was in a lot of pain so me and my fiance decided to go home early.

When we got home my daughter was extremely distraught about something and when I asked my sister what had happened she just shrugged her shoulders and left.

When we managed to calm down my daughter she told me that my sister told her that when we had her brother in a couple months time my fiance won't want her as his kid anymore because he would have a child of his own.

Me and my fiance sat my daughter down months ago to thoroughly explain that my fiance wanted to legally adopt her when we got married so she already knew this and was extremely excited.

This has very much upset and enraged me all at once, I called my sister and asked her where in her right mind she had the right to say that, She denied it and told me my daughter is 6 she's a kid she makes stuff up, I then asked her why she was crying why she was crying the way she was then, and all my sister said it was because it was because my sister wouldn't let my daughter watch something on tv.

I know this is a downright lie considering my daughter wouldn't make a big deal over something this small.

I called my sister out for lying so she called me a bitch and hung up on me. I texted her she needed to apologise to my daughter but she told me she doesn't need to.

Every since last night my daughter has been difficult with this and for someone who talks about her brother daily and always shows how much love she already has for him, Has slowly show and made it well known she wants nothing to do with the baby or my fiance, We have tried explaining to her that she will mean just as much to us as her brother but she doesn't seem to believe us. She also has been avoiding my fiance every chance she gets and if she wants anything she will only come to me, which is sad considering the amazing bond she has with my fiance and I can tell this upsets him to.

I hate seeing my child upset over something that should have never been said in the first place. I know my sister doesn't like my fiance very much but lying to my daughter steps over the line.

I feel like this may have long term affect on my daughter, Which is something I don;t want I'm used to seeing a big smile on my daughter face not an unhappy face.

We talk pretty much every day whenever we can and facetime often.

697," 

I'm a male teen, and I would like to ask for advice on how to fix my life. So here goes my 'story';

It was 2019. Everything was OK, I and my family were happy. I sure was having some problems at school, but it was nothing that bad. And when 2020 came. I know 2020 is being rough for everyone, but I just refuse to believe that it can be THAT bad for anyone. Once 2020 came, I got EXPELLED from my old school where I had friends; and then I had to be part of a school where no one is cool. And the ""You'll eventually make friends"" argument doesn't apply here; no one there has a personality similar to mine. And then quarantine came. First I was doing bad at school, both because I didn't have friends, and because doing Online lessons were harder than normal ones. And then guess what? My dad died. One of the last bits of happiness my life had at that point was gone. Forever. My life would never be the same, and now not only do I not have any friends, but I'm doing bad as heck at school, and I have no dad anymore, which fills me with anger, sadness, and guilt. As you can imagine, my dad would obviously give the family financial support; so in terms of money, we have no money. AND SUDDENLY my girlfriend doesn't talk to me anymore, it's been a week and she just gives no shit about me. I'm pretty sure she doesn't love me anymore but whatever. All those things have happened in a short time span, and I'm so damn sad. I see no more reason to fix anything about my life or go on with anything. if you can't give me any advice it would be good to have a reason to keep going; I'm not planning to ever suicide, but I have no reason to keep going either so it's kinda neutral. :) Thank you very much for reading it this far, any advice would be appreciated.",11Sep2020,1

701,"I'm trans (MTF) and 16. I'm in the UK and go to college, though I don't know how long that'll last with the situation over here. 

I'm currently in the middle of getting my name changed legally to Charlie. How the law works in the UK is you can change your name at 16 without parental permission. 

On my first day back I saw the head of college and he said they'd accept an unenrolled deedpoll (a document you can make yourself) as proof of name change. Then the next day I was told I can't use it and I need parental permission, even though the actual government website says you don't and I know 2 other people who've had it done without parental permission, but that they can use Charlie as my preferred name.

Now they're straight up telling me I can't be called Charlie unless I get parental permission, and they need to see my parents about it. This has made me worried because my parents aren't supportive at all. Also again, the government website literally says you don't need parental consent after 16.

So I wasn't too happy. I'm honestly just pissed off that they've refused to let me use my name and I've made this clear to them. I asked them if they knew how serious gender dysphoria was, and can't they just let me use the name Charlie because getting deadnamed all the time seriously hurts. They're standing by their decision and honestly I don't even want to go back. 

I've just finished my first week and honestly I've been performing much worse in class already because of the constant deadnaming.

Hey, fine gentlepeople, I'm 13 and in 8th grade and I'm having trouble motivating myself to do things.

In terms of things, it's everything. I'm having trouble just doing my work for school (I do online) and I'm behind by a few weeks and I can't find myself to do the school work. I want to, but for some reason, I can't bring myself to do it. The same thing applies to, wanting to ride my bike and exercise more and playing my cello more except I feel like something will go wrong if I start doing those things. I also want to stop playing too much video games, but here comes the doozy part. I know I play way too many games, but I don't say I'm addicted to them. My mother and step-dad say that I am, but I've always had trouble with them and I don't agree with them on many things. I would also like to clarify they are on very thin ice and are, most likely this time, getting a divorce and my step-dad has done physical harm (not very often) and yells at me every so often. I've gotten to the point where I've stopped talking to my mom as much and in the process of doing that with my step-dad. In the end, I've been just listening to Lakey Inspired and just sitting down more or just play games and I want to stop doing it as often as I do.

I don't want to spin the story in a way where someone is the #1 bad person, but I'm bad at making good opinions.

Well, that's all I have you lovely gentlepeople and I hope you have a nice time of your day!

I’m 18M and I find I’m slowly becoming severely depressed again. Three years ago I was loaded on anti depressants and almost killed myself, and I’m scared I’m going to fall back into it again. I am not near that bad but I find myself in a constant state of sadness no matter what I’m doing. Whether it be with my friends or just waking up in the morning to being at work to just trying to sleep I feel so sad and there’s nothing I can do. I’ve tried exercising, I’ve tried eating all my favourite foods, I’ve tried to hang out and be with those that make me happy but nothing helps.
My life has gone so far downhill this summer, Didn’t get into the university program I wanted, so I’m taking another course which is ok. The girl I’ve been dating for the past 2 years admitted to going out with other guys while dating me and now I constantly see her and the other guys she’s with around my home town even though she lives an hour away so seeing them doesn’t help. I’m constantly feeling tired and sad even though my sleeping schedule is perfect and I get enough sleep but that doesn’t help and coffee didn’t help me either (3months off coffee). I feel like I’m going nowhere in life and I’ll never meet anyone especially with COVID and just holy FUCK I am not in a good mental state.

706,"My bf of 4 yrs and the father of our 3 yr old kid is pretty insensitive and does asshole things that hurts my feelings. 

Example: I spent over an hour cooking dinner (I consider myself an above average cook), he took one bite and chunked the entire plate in the trash bc he ""didn't like the taste"" then ate a bologne sandwich.. Cooking is my love language and it's what I do to show I care about you so it hurt watching him do that. He eventually noticed I was upset and became upset bc he felt like he didn't do anything wrong which ended with him semi-apologizing but still defending his actions. Now I'm refusing to cook because I feel like I'm wasting my time and money (I buy all the groceries)

This is just one example and it's led to me kind of being afraid to be upset with the mean things he does bc he always reacts by getting more upset and claiming no fault.

I don't think I'm sad but I'm also not happy no matter what.

We were all very mad at my dad, yet he said that it's his house, so it's his rules. That doesn't justify eating all the food that is meant for the whole family.

He doesn't do any chores around the house. There is a ton of stuff that needs to be done in the house, but my dad just sits around watching TV and eating snacks. He doesn't seem to care that other people need him to work more. 

The worst thing is that my dad hogs everything. He always hogs the bathroom. He spends about an hour each time he goes in the bathroom, and he releases loud and massive farts in there. He uses a lot of toilet paper, and he doesn't other to flush after he finishes using the bathroom. When he showers, he leaves his dirty clothes on the shower floor, and he uses all the clean towels available. He often leaves his dirty razor on the shower floor, and he pees in the shower. He uses the bathroom several times a day, and he always has massive diarrhea when he goes in there. He fills the toilet bowel, and he doesn't even flush or turn on the fan. It smells like a nuclear attack after he uses it, and since there is only one bathroom in the house, everyone else just goes to the local library, which is just 5 minutes away, to use the bathroom there.",11Sep2020,1

However the problem is, I don’t seem to find the guy that I would expect to have something deeper going on that would lead to a situationship or even a relationship. And now I’m desperate.

Since moving in 2 years ago,  I still have a lot of junk I need to weed out and get rid of. I try and take time to do this, but I always feel I should be upstairs doing something else with her around the house. So I often skip my projects. 
Today she had to call in repairmen to fix something downstairs near my bedroom. She took the opportunity to look in my room, then came up and said she looked in my room and said it was awful. I think the workmen heard us bicker. I think she shouldn’t have done that and she should have talked to me about it later. I felt like a 10 year old being scolded, or like a kid whose mom inspects their room.  The workmen probably heard us talking. 
I am living in her house, but feel I should be spoken to like a grown up. If she needs help with a project of her own we should allot time towards that, and then I should be free to go and work on my own projects. That would be fair I think.

725,"I (14M) loved singing since I was a kid, ever since I learned how to download songs I've been listening to them extensively, almost everytime, I feel like I would be a completely.

On another note, I used have to a have a very close platonic relationship with someone who I loved platonically and the feelings are mutual, but due to some unfortunate circumstances, we got separated, and we can't get in contact with each other as much as we wanted. 

It hurt me alot, I cried alot, thanks to my mum for being there for me and having a shoulder to cry on, months later, I got an inspiration from watching Japanese musicians and singers like Mafumafu, yorushika, and kobasolso, they sung very deep songs that captured my heart. 

I made a song that I've developed for 1 month making it with the mindset of capturing hearts of people like how the artists who did the same to me, it's called ""Your memory is out of my reach"". 

Based on the fact that memories fade no matter how much it hurts (Natewantstobattle - cover of Re:Re) like reaching for something that's almost there but in the end you can't reach it after all, so you're just forced to move on.

Some of the songs spirit and lyric concepts are inspired from Japanese music like Ruru's suicide show on a livestream, yorushika, Mafumafu's inochi ni kirawarete iru, and don't worry, I made sure it doesn't sound like them, just inspired by them and used the same concepts. 

I sung it to 2 members of my family and I've gotten good feedback and I almost made my mum cry because she knew from her heart that I made it from my heart and said good stuff about it. 

I don't have money to buy equipment to record it and I can't make money because I have no allowance due to this pandemic and the minimum age required to work in my country is 18, but I wanna release it so I can hopefully make my best friend hear it and reunite us once again.

Any recommendations for equipment? Advice? I also wanna try doing covers on Japanese songs I love (especially songs from Mafumafu).

One roommate, we'll call her Stacy, stayed and got an important job over the summer. The job has strict restrictions on COVID and self-isolating with others. 

The roommates who left in March are now returning to the house. They will need to self-isolate here for 14 days. Stacy's job will not allow her to stay in the same house as someone who is self-isolating. 

Other roommates are also not comfortable being in the same house as someone who self-isolating as almost everything is shared. In addition, no outside friends will be able to come over to the house, and current roommate outside activities will be reduced (such as going out to each, etc) out of respect to other people.

728,"It all started when I (21F) quit college. I was simply not happy with what I was studying (my parents forced me into it). I told them I was unhappy and not able to do it against my will, my grades were really low.
After my exams I talked about what I wanted to do, and they didn't support me. After a few weeks, they told me I could try the entry exams. So I did that, and I failed. It made me pretty sad, not knowing what I should do. So I looked for a job, and found one that suits me pretty well.

Mom still doesn't support me, even when I'm happy. My boyfriend (21M, let's call him Jake) on the other hand, never doubted me and made me feel like I was good enough. I've done everything my parents wanted me to, but it makes me soooooo unhappy. 

My parents restrict me from seeing Jake too often. I can only see him once a week, because of covid. This used to be 2-3 times a week. The government (of where I live) has allowed us to have direct contact with 5 people you're close with outside your family. This means my sister (who moved out to live w her bf), my boyfriend Jake and 3 more people.

My parents dont let me hug him and dont let me sit directly next to him. It makes no sense, and I tried talking to my parents about it. My father doesn't have a problem with me seeing him more often, but for an unknowin reason, my mom does. I understand that they care about my health, and I care about them too. It just isn't necessary to restrict me to see Jake and when I ask my mother nicely, she'll yell at me.

I planned to see Jake tomorrow and my parents knew. Today I asked my father if I could see Jake, he said yes. When I came home from that, my mother told me I couldn't see him tomorrow. Of course my mother wouldn't allow me to see him tomorrow, and ahe gave me no reason. All she told me was: ""if you leave with him tomorrow, I'll kick you out of the house.""

She has been saying stuff like this whenever I ask her why I cant go somewhere. All I do is sit down next to her and ask her nicely.

732,"Hey, this is my throwaway/anonymous profile for advice so what’s up! I’m 19 M and I just graduated high school this past year (yes, class of covid. hardy har har lol) and over this quarantine I felt like Ive gotten a taste of a the real world when in comes to friendships where you see who your real friends are and who are really gonna ride with you through life. 

For the sake of privacy I’ll call my best friend James. Me and James have known each other for 5 years now and got really really close about a year and half ago. I mean we’re like brothers and family, He’s has had me over at his house plenty of times, his family loves me, I love them. Our friend group is pretty tight knit and super real. And best of all, me and James relate to each other on a lot of personal and political topics so we kinda share the same brain. We don’t share a lot of common interests, I’m the art guy who doesn’t really work out and he’s the soccer guy who loves fitness, but we both adore Disney lol. 

James has always been more of a private person and doesn’t really open up about his personal life. He is a total class clown and was the hype man at my high school and everyone loved him there. But he has opened up to me about things like hating the attention because these people don’t truly care for him as a person and only what he brings to them. He’s opened up to me about a couple family and personal things and we got through a couple rough times together. Basically, he’s just not very open, and I can tell he has a lot of pain he feels he has to keep private, and while I don’t think keeping your pain hidden is best I am sensitive to the fact he’s not ready or may never open up. I try to be a good friend and influence by always supporting his goals in soccer (his dream is to go pro) and also giving affirmations like how it’s okay to be vulnerable and get help if he needs it, it’s helped and he’s actually opened up a few times but he’s the type of guy who’s the mans man and thinks vulnerability is weakness ... even though you can see in his eyes sometimes he wants give in, but rejects people who try to get too close.

The problem for me comes up where our friendship feels one sided. Throughout our school years I can count on both hands the amount of times he’s texted me first about important things or just having fun talking out of the many times I’ve contacted him for similar reasons. And in school as well he doesn’t come up to me often to talk to me. Yet he has told me he really appreciates when I talk, reach out, ask him how he’s doing...but he never really does the same to me or tries to ask how I’m really feeling. It feels like some disconnected relationship where I give give give and I get a squirt of affection in return. I know he is short spoken and extremely private but it has hurt me and feels like his words don’t match his actions. He also has anger issues that people in our high school have actually feared him for. Nothing violent, but he gets really agitated really quickly over small things. And when I’ve tried to talk to him about his personal things in life, being careful not to pry much, that has set him off. And then he acts like it never happened and starts a different conversation or shows me a meme..????? Especially when it’s something serious over text he will straight up ignore me if he doesn’t want to talk about it. And I’ve going through a hard time right now with mental health and I tried to find support in him by sending a text and he just didn’t respond because he said “it made him uncomfortable”. But when he confided in my for things in the past I was open arms.

Now within the past few months, we’ve been the closest ever before graduation. And then when we graduated we call to check in on eachother and our conversations end flat because he just doesn’t open up and he give one word answers for everything. “How’s family?” “Good” “How have you been?” “Fine” “oh okay well how’s the school search ?” “It’s alright” ...and I just feel like giving up...
Other close friends and teachers that have known him told me to give up and that he’s got his own issues to deal with. Even if he still cares for me, the fact he doesn’t show it at all is toxic. 

So Reddit, can you help me out with some advice?",11Sep2020,1
733,"Personally, and I kinda hate admitting this, but I find it so gross when people cough and/or sneeze into the air, their hands, or their shirts. I just think that we’re in a time period now where everyone should’ve already learned that you cough and sneeze into your the bend of your elbow or a tissue and then you throw it away and then wash your hands. It find it pretty disgusting and really inconsiderate, impolite, and unsanitary for a number of obvious reasons. So my question is, is it wrong for me to feel this way? Am I being petty? Is it wrong that I sometimes get all judgmental and make a face at people who do this, to the point where I don’t even say “Bless you,” (when they sneeze) and then think I’m being dramatic when I’m genuinely and perhaps rationally disgusted?",11Sep2020,1
734,"I love animals and have a few pets. I always do my best to take care of them and make sure they’re happy... I believe that they are. However I’m just not sure what to do with these two ferrets I have. 

My boyfriend and I have had these ferrets for about a year (they’re a year old too). They’ve been nothing but trouble and extremely high maintenance. There are certain things that they just don’t tell you about them, so we were unaware that we were being blindsided by taking on the responsibilities. 

Let me start by saying that we give them ample attention. They’re allowed to free roam for 4+ hours everyday. They get treats every night, we discipline them, keep their cage clean, they have good food, we play with them... basically all the necessities. They even have they’re own insta page. 

But holy hell, they destroy our house. Whether it’s with their own hands/mouth or with their urine/feces. We have litter boxes and pee pads everywhere all the time, but they find other places anyway. They tip everything over, chew just about anything, and have broken several things of ours. It seems like they’re always putting themselves in the way of danger and it’s really hard to prevent them from doing this. If we close a door, they’ll scratch it and leave marks. If we block something off, they’ll destroy the thing in their way. There’s no such thing as a pet gate for our ferrets. I even went out of my way to create a DIY pet gate that they figured out how to destroy anyway. One of them is deaf, so he’s naturally extra bite-y and doesn’t understand scruffing, which is not only something we have to worry about, but I worry about him biting other people or our other pets too. Basically, it’s starting to feel like a huge chore to let them out. 

I think the cherries of all of this is that they also cost us a lot of money, they hold us back from leaving the house for &gt;1 day, and keep us from having certain things out in the open (ie. decorations, everyday objects, etc.). 

I don’t think our situation/ferrets is different/unique from other ferret owners. I think we were just severely ill-informed about what it takes to take care of them. 

We don’t really know where to go from here. We’re attached to them, but frustrated. When it comes down to it, we could make it work,  because I don’t want to surrender an animal to a shelter that needs space for others that are actually in need of a home. But I’d also lie if I said I didn’t feel dread for the upcoming years of their life.

I'm currently in a prestigious, rigorous, high school, taking all the honors courses I can take, and I have several extra curricular activities.  However, I have anxiety and stress constantly about everything, and I have terrible study skills. I am constantly exhausted and procrastinating, causing my grades to slip.

737,"Ok before I start 1. my grammar is kinda all over the place sometimes its good sometimes it isn't so bear with me here 2. as of writing this I'm fairly anxious so it might be kinda all over the place! ok let's begin, I'm a 14-year-old teenage boy in a Christian family that I wouldn't call strict but kinda strict I'm gonna start were the problem arises: my parents (not to knock them down or anything) did a very bad job at keeping me from the places they didn't want me to be on the internet (videos of swearing, etc) so yeah essentially I was free to roam youtube being a normal child I didn't do what my parents wanted me to do and I watched whatever the hell I wanted so I ended up learning about sex (id say around this time I'm maybe age 8? idk) but yeah I learned about sex, etc live progress on we have learned about porn and drugs and all of this information and being homeschooled spending my life on the internet my personality etc has formed around it! and I love that! I love myself for being me however my music humor and whatever makes up me my parents wouldn't really like so everyday i have to monitor myself and what I say I've been doing this for years its like second nature and that, unfortunately, make lying second nature to when it comes to those things so obviously this causes me a lot of anxiety and stress for someone my age or at least for me I guess, so when your goals people you idolize the music you love has to be closeted it's very annoying so.... here are my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. how do i get my parents to let me listen to my music etc and explore the world freely because my parents introduced me to sex last YEAR at 13 they don't even know that I know what rule 34 other sexual things are! they  
2. right now im trying to watch some mature movies and expose myself around these things with my parents around and ask them about it  (hoping to watch super troopers soon) 

&amp;#x200B;

one last thing, I am ok with my faith and being different but I'm scared because they again... don't know that I know about this stuff I'm sorry this is so long this is kinda a vent thing because mind go crazy also Grammarly is amazing",11Sep2020,1

740,"
I am here with my current relationship dilemma in hopes that someone on here can offer decent advice. This is a sensitive issue so I cannot ask friends or family. I (25M) recently ended a year long relationship in February. This relationship ended because of a gut feeling. I felt she was not the one for me and that  she didn’t have the same goals or interests as me that I thought she did. It is safe to say that the sex was amazing, but I could not string her along much longer since I was finding myself interested in other women and regretting the relationship. I am not the type to cheat but I will break a heart. After this relationship I found myself single, focused on my career, horny, and spending more time with friends.

With this pandemic going on, it brought us all closer and that included me and my best friends’ sister (20F) who just got out of a relationship herself. We got close and would stay up later than everyone else most nights. We spent our time smoking weed, talking about relationship issues, and discussing life goals. You can imagine how comforting it was to talk to someone of the opposite sex after a relationship has ended. I found myself falling for this girl and not physically even though she is stupid ""fine"". My gut was telling me to go for it but I couldn’t get past the fact that she is the sister of my two current best friends so I didn’t jump on it. 

A few weeks pass by and she ends up back with her high school sweetheart whom she is no longer with as of this September. I saw this as a sign that I should just keep on doing what I am doing, and time will bring something my way. 

It is then the first week of March and I am a month out of a relationship. I get to work and there is a note in my inbox. The note is from a receptionist (23F) at work who wrote, “Hi, you are a hard guy to catch but you should text me sometime (Inserts number and name)”. Reading this made me feel all kinds of happy but my gut wasn’t feeling the same. I chose to ignore my gut and listen to my heart (Penis) so I text her and we hit it off but I was skeptical.

Initially, I told my current GF (23F) about the recent breakup that I had and that I don’t want to rush into something too fast. We agreed to keep it casual and to see where it goes over time. A few months go by and we are now a couple as of August. Life seems to be going great, I’m happy, sex is amazing, we vibe, and we smoke together but I do have my doubts due to her personality, daddy issues, and life goals. I would like to point out that while she seems to be perfect for me, there is always a moment where I question the relationship and whether it is the real thing or not (especially during or after sex). I have feelings of love for this girl but I am still trying to figure out if it is LOVE or LOVE LUST.

HERE IS THE KICKER!!! This past weekend, I was at my best friends house with all the entire squad including my sister (27F) and their sister (20F). It is a holiday weekend, so we all decide to take some ecstasy while we party hard. We eventually all end up on the balcony where we smoke and that is where things get interesting. 

My sister and my friends sister begin to talk and that’s when my sister finds out that the she is now single (boyfriend cheated… fool). I am just doing my own thing and that’s when my sister asks where my GF is. I tell her that she couldn’t make it. She then says, “Good because (23F) isn’t the one for you. I can tell”. I then ask why she says that and she just says it’s a “Gut Feeling and her vibe is off”… She goes on to say that I may be with this girl (23F) for now but life has different plans for me. She says, “You should be with (20F), I just met her and I can tell there is something between you. She is perfect for you, trust me I’ve known you your whole life”. That shit shook the room up with ????..... The image of me and 20F being together was definitely something I want to happen but now im in a relationship... what is going on here!?

It is now the next day and 20F asks if we can talk about last night. We talk and agree that it’s a weird situation and time for this to happen. I am in a relationship and she is fresh out of one. I told her I had a crush on her… then I corrected myself and told her I still do. She smiles and feels the same but we still agree to keep the peace and not do anything to hasty.

It is now Friday, a few days later and I am still thinking of her (20F). I am also rethinking the relationship I am in. Is this relationship really meant to be or was it another test from the universe? Should I have stuck with my gut feelings in the first place or is my mind in the right place? Should I tell my GF about this tonight or wait it out and see where it goes? Even if I don’t end up with (20F), she will always be around me and any other girl I am ever with. Will these feeling for her remain… IDK but my gut is pushing me toward ending this relationship so that I can focus on my mental/emotional health. The hard part is telling my GF about these feelings and figuring out how work would be after the fact. Help!",11Sep2020,1

742,"i have just started my first year at college and the drama has already started! i met this friend at the start of my college about 3 weeks ago and we have connected pretty well and hung out a lot. she’s in a long distance relationship atm because we are in college far away from where she is from. she flirts with me constantly... like we were discussing having sex yesterday and our kinks... i asked what was her girlfriends name and she said my name (first and last) as a joke through flirting loool. she invited me over to do sexual stuff and then uninvited me (presuming it’s due to guilt bc she doesn’t wanna cheat lol). anyways, this friend has expressed that she probably will break up w her girlfriend soon because it’s toxic, but i don’t want it to be because of me. i’m not a home wrecker, and i’m not trying to ruin something. i just think me and her have a connection and she’s obviously into me too with all the flirting lol. what do i do?????",11Sep2020,1
743,"Hey guys! I would like to hear your thoughts on this.
So I’ve just found out that my wife cheated on me. This was awhile ago. Before we got married, but I’ve known for a long time now. Or I’ve had my suspicions.
And now I’ve come upon some proof of it. After all this time, my suspicions were correct.
We where going through a rough patch, back then but I didn’t really know why. She never had time for me, and made me somehow feel responsible for something going wrong in the relationship. I felt like shit, meanwhile she was with this guy behind my back (who btw was her teacher back then).
I didn’t know how far they went back then, but the proof I’ve recently came upon, reveals they had sex and everything.... 
This has plagued me for years, and now I know. The truth.
I want to confront my wife about. Make her tell me everything. Every single thing. And if she lies, I’ll know.
I just want to hear her say it. To tell me the truth. How long it lasted. Everything. I think I deserve to know. She got out of all that without a scratch, and made me somehow feel like the bad guy.
We’re married now and have a kid together. And do love her. What do you guys think? I just want some closure. I want her to tell me",11Sep2020,1

749,"Hi guys im a 17 yo guy, ive been bestfriend with this girl (shes also 17) since middle school where we were in the same class. At that time we talked pretty much every day and there was a good relationship between us (not dating ofc). Now we are in the same highschool but not in the same class. Over the past 3 years of HS we talked much less than before even if we kept in touch for some school stuff. I was starting to like this girl at the moment we started to talk less. Btw now in the present i was feeling pretty lonely, after a break up with my ex that happened a year ago. Because of that i was thinking that if i ever want to be with a girl, it has to be her (my middle school bestfriend) and now i started to like her fr. The problem is that for a while we chatted and talked only about videogames cause she is a gamer girl. The fact that shes into videogames does not bother me ofc, i love that, but i mean to get more close to her i dont want to talk about that topic all the time. Thats problem number 1: how can i change this topic to get more close to her? Problem number 2: in the next school year we'll be in the same building (cause my highschool has 2 different buildings dont ask why) and we'll prob gonna see each other often than before, so how am i supposed to behave with her?

751,"I'm a mother, i'm a minor when I got pregnant, I know it's really evil but we tried aborting my baby since we are not ready and we don't want our parents to know, obviously, we failed and when our parents discovered, they encourage us to keep the child; we did but there's a lot of problem, she has mild hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, epilepsy and meningocele. I blame myself, she have all this because I took a lot of things to get rid of her. 

She is the sweetest girl but she's a lot of work, she can't even speak properly and cannot stand, I need to be a full-time housewife to take care of her, my partner, on the other hand, tho I believe he loved me, he looks at our daughter like she is a punishment for all the bad things we've done. He needs to work for almost 14 hours a day, to be able to provide for us, including our daughter's medicine and speech therapy. He is a good man, a good husband but i believed he got fed up of our condition. It's really hard, its a lot of work, but we really don't have any choice, my child is so fragile and even her grandparents don't want to babysit her. I do love my child with all my heart, it's just that since she was born, it's always been so hard and problems after problems. 

Pandemic hits really different, my partner needs to work at home, and he really hit depression, he is always agitated, he is not comfortable to be with our daughter for a long time, ( on normal days, he is going home really late and my daughter is already sleeping). Just like normal couples, we fight, but the last fight is different, he suggested that we need to give up our daughter to some orphanage or a shelter of some sort, he said that he don't want to spend his life working for a curse. It hurts me a lot, of course, I don't want to give her up, he is insisting, saying it's easy for me to say since Im not the one earning the money for us,  then left when I stood firm that I want to keep her. He left, saying that he don't like his life anymore and its driving him nuts. He left, took everything and I cannot even contact him. It's been over a month since he left, were pass due on rent, just received an eviction notice, and we can just eat everyday because of our neighbors, I can't afford rent and my parents doesn't want us to live with them because of an issue on the past, luckily I can still afford some of her medicine with the help of some government allowance, but still, I can't search for a job since no one will look after her. 


I don't know what to do, we can't afford to live on the streets especially during pandemic, it's to dangerous for her. Should I really just gave her up on some shelter? Should I just accept that I can't take care of her? I love her, it's my fault that she have all of this. I really can use any help, kind words or anything. It feels like I'm alone on this now.",11Sep2020,1

753,"A little context, near the start of quarantine my mom was diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma and it was quickly growing. Things were getting bad but I had hope that she would make it. Me and her both luckily got into the same college which was very competitive for our state and we had long conversations about what we were going to do if we didn’t get in. We’ve dated for almost 3years and talked about getting married later in life and how we want to spend the rest of our life together, kids and all. We are extremely close and I consider her my best friend. My family loves her and practically adopted her as their own.

Almost 2 months ago she told me she was bi as a “distraction” from my mom, I think it caused me more panic than good as I thought she was trying to tell me she was lesbian at first. After that we talked about it for a min but that was it. I was really not in the head space to really work it out. This really came out of no where but I was ok with it as long as she wasn’t like looking/taking action on it, just needed time to process it. Process that was on the back burner as I was still working on stuff with my mom. 

A couple of weeks ago my mom suddenly lost her battle and I came home from college. She told me she would be there for me as I had when she was dealing with her depression treatment back at the end of last year.  

About a week ago we had a fairly long talk about her bi sexuality now being a part of her identity and knowing herself. I was confused and worried about what this meant for our relationship and future. I was skeptical about what this meant but she told me she wasn’t going to act on any of it which reassured me but I still needed time to think and process my mom. I asked her if we could pause this conversation and not talk about it for a bit. She agreed and thought it was for the best too.

Last night she came over and we had dinner while watching avatar but the bi topic came up again. I was talking about how my life felt like it was full of special cases and she asked me if she was one. For some stupid reason I said kinda. She started crying then we talked and she told me she Felt the only way she could really help herself and figure things out we’re by taking a break so she could experience it and never have to wonder again. She said that it would be best as she couldn’t be there for me and I could sort out stuff on my own too. I got upset and started crying too at some point because to me we would be breaking up or at least not acting like were in a relationship as she is 1) no longer seeing me 2) going out with other people etc..3) she said the max time should hopefully need is a year. when talking about it she said that this was not a definite thing and would likely be in awhile when I felt better and that she still needed a little more time to think it over. The thing is I’m not cool with putting an expiration date on our relationship for when I or we got better. I told her that we should be trying to work through this together but she was determined that if/when it happened it would have to be a part. We stayed up almost the whole night talking about it and crying and crap. When we went to bed she came to my bed and I laid on the opposite side as I needed time to process things and didn’t really know if we were broken up or anything. She at some point tapped me sobbing and told me that she didn’t want to do this if it caused us this much pain and meant she couldn’t be with me. We talked a little in the morning and she said that she couldn’t promise that it wouldn’t come up again. So I don’t know how things were really left off.

I know most people tend to side with the LGBTG community when it comes to these topics and I hope that no one sees me as some sorta bigot or her a monster or anything like that. I still love her but things just feel Idk wrong or something. I just want her to be able to find herself and be happy but It would break me even more if that means taking a break and her potentially seeing other people. Please note that this is from my perspective and is likely abit bias and I might have misunderstood some details etc.

My oldest friend that I met in preschool turned out to be a complete shit head with no respect for myself or my family. He and I practically grew up together and while we weren’t the closest of friends in recent memory we still got a long ok and hung out with the same group of people. About a year ago my dad who’s a production manager for a citrus company gave him a job he didn’t need to give out on the reasoning that my friend would use it to jump start his career in citrus while simultaneously giving him time off whenever he needed to get school work done to earn a degree in that field (he only did so to fuck off instead) his only major rule: don’t hunt or trespass on the pasture land the company owns, it’s part of my dad’s job to keep any liability out including poachers. Fast forward 8 months and it turns out that not only was he going out there but he’d bring truck loads of people with him, caught hogs and shot gators with no permit and leaving one to lay dead in a pond which is an easy $10,000 fine and possible conviction if FWC found it. He was caught after crashing his truck in a ditch on the pasture while hog hunting even after he was given clear warnings by at least 3 different people countless times including me telling him and I quote “if you ever get caught there you’ll be fired on the spot” and what happened? He was fired on the spot and what boggles me is that he immediately cried in front of his boss because he got caught. The rest of my friends however don’t seem to give a fuck they still hangout with him even after telling me that they agree he’s a piece of shit or was fucking stupid for doing it. There’s the saying “guilty by association” and if my other friends don’t seem to care about what he did are they any better than him and if they allow that how do I know they didn’t go with him even if they say they didn’t?

I grew up the oldest of 10 kids. My dad is a janitor, my mom a cook, and my stepdad a construction worker. We grew up poor.

I got good grades in HS. I worked at Dunkin Donuts after school to help pay bills, we were poor. I helped raise my siblings.

I applied to colleges and got into almost every college I applied to. I decided to go to University Of Pittsburgh, as an in state student. The final cost after fafsa loans and scholarships was $11k.

My parents have bad credit scores, and couldn't financially send me. All the money I made at Dunkin Donuts went straight to bills.

My father, mother and I have never been the same since. We argue all the time.

I ADMIT my wrong doings. I know that I am to blame for part of this situation. I apologize to my parents when I mess up.

I went to community college for 2 years, and working to afford a Bachelors degree. Life isn't going great. I'm a broke dishwasher, scraping up every penny I make to save for school.

My dad and I are the worst. He believes that going to college fuels the ""Liberal Agenda"". He thinks I'm a ""Liberal Queer Commie"" for wanting to go to college. 


Not one of my parents went to college...and we grew up on food stamps. Not saying a college degree guarentees you a good life...But I do whatever it takes to give my future children a good life. I dont want to spend the rest of my life as a dishwasher.

Then there are celebrities who are deeply concerned that I might end up taking an important role as competition, so need to have enough ammo on me so they can throw me in oblivion. Keep in mind I have a really cool set of accomplishments and family going for me. I'm sure their actual competition has wayy less of that. 

If you aren't paying me, you aren't useful to me, you are probably useful in your field, but I don't work in your field and you are overreaching, I don't get what I am trying to have less terrible attitude about. I'm bourgeoisie enough to not need to bow to bourgeoisie or in some cases middle class. 

The only thing I am for right now is, atleast these people are not bottom tier trash but they arent doing that great either to get a free pass on my network I build on goodwill and even worse, mooch off it, cause I happened to pay their salaries once when I was a child.",11Sep2020,1
763,"This guy started off pretty nice. He started complimenting me through comments and he even made paintings of me so I reciprocated. However, as time went by, the messages and comments got more intense. He even reached out to my mom and started asking her stuff about me. After a few indications that I wasn’t interested in pursuing a friendship or anything, I stopped replying to him. He still pushed through and commented on every single thing I post on every social media site. I started blocking him on some sites like facebook and instagram so he made a twitter account and started messaging me there so I blocked him as well. Now, he’s also commenting on my YouTube videos and who knows he could make a Reddit account as well and start messaging me here.

How do I make this guy stop? Why is he doing this even after I blocked him? Haven’t I been clear enough? It’s so annoying and creepy.",11Sep2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently staying at home for the semester even though I'm in college, just because of all of the covid-19 stuff happening. It honestly looks like my college might send people home as students are already breaking certain social-distancing guidelines. If I'm being candid here there was another reason I was hesitant to go back and that's that I was sexually assaulted multiple times last year by someone who is living on my floor again this year. I haven't told my parents that this person exists or that something like that happened to me, just because I frankly have a hard time reliving the trauma the situation caused and also because I would be afraid of what they would do and where the conversation would go. I'm the oldest of their many daughters and they're very protective of me, which I guess plays a part in a lot of their decisions.

After this happened last year I asked my parents if I could possibly move off campus for this year. Pretty much immediately they said no. They sort of pretended they were considering it but I know them well enough to know they probably weren't going to budge on the issue. When that didn't work I asked them if I could buy my own car, since I recently saved up enough money to get one after having my license for three years. They told me if I got myself one they would be very upset with me. I honestly just wanted a form of escapism and I felt like they weren't giving me any hope for that. Again, I know I didn't tell them the specific reasons I was asking but either way, I feel like I'm old enough now to make those kinds of decisions for myself. That's not really what I'm asking about today though, but it provides some context.

My friend invited me to come and stay with her for a few days in our college town, and I really wanted to go, because it's been such a long time since I saw her and I'm honestly starting to regret not going back to school, especially for the reasons above. I asked my parents if it would be okay and they've been extremely hesitant about it. In their words, colleges are a hot spot for rapidly spreading viruses. I don't disagree with that, but my friend lives off campus and all of her classes are online, so there's not that much risk involved in my personal opinion. I've been really upset about it ever since. Over the summer they've let all of my siblings stay with their friends overnight. They even let one of them stay with her friends for multiple nights at her friend's vacation house. I brought this up to my mom and she said that the friend's mother had told them that they had been social distancing up until that point. I told her she couldn't expect that of me because my friend and I are now old enough where that's not a thing. I know my parents only want what's best for me but I'm not a child anymore. What would you do in this situation?",11Sep2020,1
766,"Spam account because some of the people mentioned know I have reddit. This might be better formatted for r/AITA but I can't figure out their community guidleines, so I was hoping to post it here.

So basically this post will be strictly condensed to 4 people- me, W, E, and L. So L, E and I are all girls and freshman/sophomore year we were all best friends. W is a boy and has been a lifelong friend of L. W had a crush on L for years, but because she didn't want to ruin the friendship she made it clear she didn't want a relationship. W took this well, and they have remained close friends. E and L were childhood bestfriends. E and L were close friends, and E introduced me to L, who introduced me to W.

So now that I've set a little bit of ground-work, I can move on to the actual part I need advice with. I became friends with E when I was in the 3rd grade, and I'm currently in the 11th grade. Obviously we have a lot of history. My freshman year I met and became close friends with L. I was friends with W, but I was a very different person then (uptight and stressed just absolutely constantly) and he was a little more lax so we didn't talk much, but we were friendly. My sophomore year of highschool, W and E got into a relationship which L and I were both excited for as they were two of our closest friends. While I had expressed some interest in W, I never really made any remarks beyond physical appearance (i.e: ""W is kind of cute""- nothing derogatory I swear). E knew this and they got into   
a relationship but I wasn't bitter because I didn't have some massive crush on him, I just thought he was cute. However, throughout the relationship, E became a totally different person.

E complained about W constantly to L and I, saying that he didn't make any moves and she was bored of the relationship. We both told her if she didn't like him anymore to break up with him as she was wasting both of their times, but she continued to be in the relationship for 6 more months, all while complaining how bored she was. She asked W to stop talking to L despite them being lifelong friends because she thought L liked W, even though L had specifically shut down any previous moves that W had made towards her (before E and W's relationship.) E talked behind both my and L's back to W saying that we were closer to eachother than we were to her.

Throughout the year, she has also been not a great friend. She has been going through some personal issues regarding her family, so I've tried to give her a pass, but it's all become too much for me to excuse at this point. Basically after E broke up with W, L cut off her friendship with E. Her reasoning was that she was toxic for talking behind her back and treated her poorly throughout sophomore year. I continued to be friends with both of them separately until E asked me to choose between either her or L. Her reasoning was that ""L treated her so badly and she didn't even know what she did."" I think L had plenty of reason to cut E off, I mean she asked her boyfriend to cut off a girl who he was very close friends with because she didn't believe either of them when they said there was nothing going on. Although W might have had feelings for L in the past, he was not emotionally cheating. He was a great boyfriend to her and was completely devoted. 

I told E that it was unfair of her to make me chose, as L has been a great friend to me and I don't feel I could cut her off because of drama between her and E's drama. L has told me time and time again she has no issue with me being friends with E, she just feels she's outgrown their friendship, so it was really only E asking me to chose. I reiterated I wouldn't chose, and we've grown apart obviously. I've tried to reach out to her, but it really seems like she's moved on.

So this is where I need help. Well now it's junior year, and I recently got a job where W works. As a result we've gotten much closer over the past 3 months or so. We're very close, much closer than we were back in freshman year. He's extremely caring, and has overall just reinforced my belief that he's a great guy. I really, truly like him.

L and a couple other friends have told me that I wouldn't be a bad person if I dated W because E was a bad friend to me and a bad girlfriend to W. L thinks that we would be good together and that I would treat him well. But at the same time I don't want to be that girl. Even though we're not that close anymore and she hasn't been a great friend to me lately, I still feel like it would be going too far. I don't want to be a bad person. Neither of us have made a move (besides like him subtly flirting with me), but I haven't acted on it. I just feel like I need an outsider's point of view. Thank you, and have a great day :)",11Sep2020,1
767,"Hi! This is a long one but I'd really appreciate your advice! (all names are fake names)

So I've been dating my boyfriend for the past 7 months and we had been close friends for 3 years before that. We're both 20. He has this work friend who I would consider a ""pick me girl"" that I knew and was friends with when I was 16. She ended up freaking out and blamed me and another girl for ruining her sleepover when we both explained we had very good reasons for not being able to go (I had an emergency but said I could arrive later that night and the other girl had a stomach bug). She flipped out, saying we were horrible and she had put so much effort into it. We apologized to her but realized it wasn't a worthwhile or healthy friendship to be in so we decided to not be friends with her anymore.

I had explained this to my now boyfriend while we were just friends and that he should be careful because she had really hurt my feelings and trust. But through working with her he began to know her more and told me she had grown and was a better person now (even though he didn't know her prior), and he thought she was cute and that he was thinking of asking her out. Being his friend at the time, and wanting to be supportive I encouraged him to ask her out but just be careful. Turns out she was beginning to see someone else (a acquaintance of my bf) so he didn't pursue it further and remained good work friends aka. hanging out after work and going to each others house party's.

Now that we're dating, he recently asked me if I would consider being friends with her again despite him knowing I don't like her. I said I have been friendly with her since we were 16/17 (it's hard to avoid hanging out with someone as we all live in a small town) and I’d made no attempt to be mean to her and was polite when I did encounter her but I didn't and don't intend on being good friends with her. He continued to try to convince me that she is a good person now and that she knows I don't particularly like her as she has brought it up to him due to ""vibes"".

I consider myself a kind person and I’m always kind to people even if i don't particularly like them. I have been right in the past about 3 of my boyfriends friends who ended up not being nice people even though he was oblivious. I think that I have pretty good intuition on people. Despite this, he doesn't seem to get why I still don't really trust her or want to be friends with her. I think that she acted irrationally and spoiled, maybe she has changed but I don't really feel like I owe her a second chance or anything more than friendly encounters when we do meet. I also kind of feel a bit jealous and weird knowing my boyfriend thinks she's very pretty and previous asked her out (I didn't feel like this before we started dating, I think that's why it bothers me so much)

The reason I'm struggling to bring this issue up to him is because I knew him during his last relationship with a girl we will call Sam, who really didn't like my boyfriends best friend, who is also a girl who we will call Emma. Sam made it very very clear she hated Emma and insinuated that he wanted to cheat on her with Emma and plenty of other accusations. This made him distance himself from a very important support figure in his life and he really missed Emma, eventually leading to their breakup. I think Emma is a great person and I'm really happy she's in my boyfriends life because she really cares and supports him and I know their friendship is very important and I respect it, unlike Sam. His entire friend group including me agreed that Sam was a crazy jealous girlfriend and has become somewhat of a running joke within our group that both him and Emma tended to have relationships where their partner heavily dislikes their friendship.

This issue of this work friend has really been bothering me because typically if I encounter a toxic or unhealthy friendship in my life I usually drop that person, don't interact and avoid getting hurt again without being rude or unkind to them. I remove them from my life. I am also of the opinion that some people just don't get along and I don't think i get along with this person, we don't click anymore. 
As of the past few nights I've had dreams with her and my boyfriend in them and in them I end up being mean to her and I am angry with her when I wake up. This morning I woke up angry at her again from a dream with her in it and my boyfriend texted me asking me to go to brunch with some of his work friends including her. I had to decline because I knew I'd just be glaring at her throughout the meal because I was so mad. I didn't say that to my boyfriend btw I just politely declined.

I hate how this person is making me feel, I am usually an extremely chill girlfriend, and I'm scared to bring is up in case he or his friends think I'm another crazy jealous girlfriend like Sam. I don't know what to do, it's making me feel very insecure, like I was his last choice of a girlfriend and that he would choose her over me if she wasn't in a relationship. I know its just me over thinking and I know he loves me very much (he always talks about me to his work friends when they go out, (I get plenty of lovely drunk calls where he just compliments me so much in front of everyone lol), and he always checks up on me.

I just don't know if I am being mean by not giving her a second chance or if I'm being crazy or if I'm right to think like this.  Should I talk to Emma? I feel like she might understand but I also don't know? Or should I bring it up to my bf? Or should I just leave it be? Any advice or opinions would be helpful I know its a very childish problem but its been really making me emotional so I'd like to sort it out,

Thank you!!!",11Sep2020,1

The other night my bf of 3 years and I went to friends house. My bf was the designated driver so he was sober the whole night. I on the other hand was not. My friends and I were taking shots left and right as well as hitting the bong. I was really f***ed up to the point where my bf carried me to the car. I remember coming home and turning on Black Mirror. After that I don’t have any recollection of what happened. Yesterday morning my bf wakes me up saying that he needed to tell me something. He goes on to say that after I turned the show on we started making out and it was getting steamy but at some point I became unconscious. He said that he saw I was extremely wet and started to finger me and then proceeded to have  sex. He said that I got up said wtf and fell asleep. At that point he stopped and felt bad. That’s that. Idk to me it’s like if you are fingering me and see that I’m not responding or acknowledging what’s going on then wtf but he went a step further to f**k me. What do you guys think?",11Sep2020,1

So its like a mini market but with big parking space that can be divided into 2 sections, one, buyers who already placed their order through website, and would just drive to the store and park at their designed (?)(idk the right word) parking spot and would wait for the worker to send the item to the car (would be done in less thn 5 minutes or so) and second are the buyers who hasnt decided yet what to buy but they can do so while at the parking spot.

771,"Hello, reddit.

I'm a 21M college student raised in a very kind and caring Christian home. However, I have an older half-sister on my mom's side who is, frankly, the worst person I've ever met. At the age of 16, she ran away from home to join a lesbian witch coven that started in her youth group, and since then has been the most anti-religious, anti-Christian person we've ever had the displeasure of meeting. She even starts out her Facebook profile with ""#1 Atheist"". She's the kind of person who will post flagrantly false and slanderous things about Christians, then get called out on it, then proceed to get her equally atheist and liberal friends to hate brigade that person's profile, among many other things.

She has many, \*many\* times mocked, abused, even slandered myself and our family on social media based on our faith, but my mom still tries her best to help her and keep her in her life, even though my younger sister and I have effectively cut her out. 

My sister has a bevy of issues, including alcoholism, mental/emotional instability, and a history of abusing partners, friends, and even her own husband and children. Despite all she does, my mom still plays Devil's advocate with her, but it has made her very wary of me or my younger sister leaving the faith. I would never do anything like my older sister, but I haven't been able to call myself religious for years, in spite of even being on the worship team for the sole purpose of making my parents happy and saving face. These are the reasons behind everything I've ever done, never being for myself.

I want to be able to go and live my own life for at least a while, but I also don't want to break my family's hearts. My mom especially has been more pushy lately as my sister continues to act horribly toward us, which only makes my mom more invested in faith as a coping mechanism. Moving out is not currently in the cards for me, and I'm looking for advice on how to maybe go about distancing myself from church without hurting my family.

Thank you for any advice you have, or shared experiences.

TL;DR: I'm looking to distance myself from my family's faith, but my older sister's radical atheist lifestyle makes it difficult to do so without hurting my family. What should I do?",11Sep2020,1

I had to use a different card because the original card wouldn't work.  On my way home I filled up on gas at a grocery store gas station. I used the original credit card at the pump to see if it was working again. The pump accepted it so I got my gas and went home.

Turns out my bank froze my card for fraudulent activity, but I was somehow able to still get gas. The banks says the transaction is declined and will never clear.

I brought this up to my mom and she said that the friend's mother had told them that they had been social distancing up until that point. I told her she couldn't expect that of me because my friend and I are now old enough where that's not a thing. I know my parents only want what's best for me but I'm not a child anymore.

788,"A little background, I come from a, um, not so friendly household, we'll say. So when I was like 11 or 12 (I'm 16 now) I heard about something called emancipation. Where, if you had the money, you could become legally independent from your parents before the age of 18. So I made it my goal to do it by 16.

Clearly my goal failed, but I don't even think I'm on a path to make anything by 18 or beyond either.

Here's a ""timeline"" I started with an affiliate marketing website. Didn't work, So I closed it and started a second one. Didn't work. But at this time I was only about 12. I then started creating a card game. I wanted to make a Kickstarter to fund the game, but it would have costed way too much money upfront. I stopped for a while and then I started to learn C# the programming language. Over 4 months, I made a mobile game for android. Then, in one week, I made a second one. Neither did very well, so I stopped. I started a website about language learning, and since then I've started learning four languages. The website gained a little traction, but nowhere near enough to generate income. So I made a third app, a language learning app. It was super hyped by the few people that used it, and people loved it, but the UI design was complete crap, and I wanted to revamp the UI before I spent money on promoting it.  should add, developing this app was one of the hardest things I'd ever done, and, while improving the UI, I completely messed up the code. So, realizing that I'd have to redo everything, I stopped.

At the moment, my plan is, take a three month break, finish the language learning app, finish another app project I've been working on, then rewrite all of the posts on my website with updated material and better writing + add some affiliate links. Then I'd spend all of my time trying to promote the app and my website, until I turn 18.

I'm taking a three month break at the moment, because I seriously feel so burnt out. This has been my only real major goal for as long as I can remember, and I still haven't made a dime. Working completely independently and online is a goal for A LOT of people, I know, but surely I'd've seen *some* success by now... right?

Anyway, if anyone has any tips / ideas for where I should be putting my work efforts, I'd be happy to hear them. I just feel so lost.",11Sep2020,1

790,"TLDR: Current job sucks so I got another one. Had planned to leave #1 for #2, but will gave to keep both for now until I am able to get fulltime at #2. I haven't told #1 about my other job yet and have been able to buy myself some time until I have to. How do I go about telling #1 about my other job and the fact that I will have to change my status to partime?

My first job is at a grocery store and is an awful place to work for many reasons; basically a dead end job for most of the people working there. I wanted out, so I applied elsewhere and was able to get in. The 2nd job is still retail, but much better in every way. I had intended to leave #1 as soon as I was hired at #2, but will not be able to now for awhile.

Herein lies the problem: job #1 will not be happy that I have a second job and I still haven't told them. I did something dumb which bought me some time while I do my training at #2, but it won't last forever. For the next 3 weeks I will be training at #2 with full time hours, but after that I was told that hours at not guaranteed at the moment due to COVID and my performance will determine whether or not I get more hours (I can always pick up some as well).

I hope you see my dilemma. I will basically have to turn #1 into a part-time and work both jobs until I am able to get fulltime at #2. Job #2 takes priority for me and I am trying to figure out a way to tell #1 in a way that wouldn't upset them and jeopardize my employment. I have never worked two jobs before so I'm currently floundering and trying to figure things out.",11Sep2020,1
791,"BD and I share a two year old. We are not together at the moment but we are communicating and hoping to make things work. I told ""Lexi"" my best friend of five years that we were possibly getting back together and she messaged me ""If you get back together with him we can't be friends."" I was hurt by this bc I had hoped she would support my happiness and what was best for my son. I did not respond to her message. I told my BD what she said and he replied ""Lexi is not your friend"". He eventually admitted that they slept together 3 years ago, while we were supposedly on a break. He claims Lexi came onto him at a hotel room after she noticed that I ""wasn't giving him the time of day"".  What was worse is that she was engaged at the time to a mutual friend of ours, ""Joe"". We used to work together and double date. We even had our kids months apart. Well at the time that these two slept together I was supposed to be her bridesmaid. She even invited us to her engagement party (which was super awkward looking back). Apparently they slept together shortly before the engagement party. And have been lying to me for years. A couple months ago Lexi told me out of no where that my BD had once ""told her he loved her and wanted to be with her"". But that she had turned him down because he was not ""her type"" (Her husband is a heavier less handsome version of my BD, no offense to him at all but they look similar, both mixed B/W with dark curly hair -\_-). But I felt uneasy with her telling me this, not sure if she was trying to make me jealous, and also not sure if she was telling me the whole truth. Fast forward to now and it adds up in my head that she was lying to me and what my BD is telling me is true. She had admitted to me in the past that she had cheated on Joe a couple times but I kept her secret and never knew that she had dipped into mine. I am so angry and hurt by the both of them but especially my so called best friend who I thought was my sister. Her and Joe have a blended family of six kids (think Brady Bunch), with two together, one being a newborn. I know that this revelation would be upsetting to her family, but should I be forced to keep the lie a secret? Should I confront her and tell Joe the truth? We are all friends on fb and I was thinking of publicly confronting her. Is that wrong of me? To want to humiliate her the way she has done to me? I can't sleep at night with the weight of this on my heart. I do not wish to keep our friendship. I just want to know how to confront her, but I already know she is going to lie. Help!!!",11Sep2020,1

So, this year I got 2 AP classes (basically a class that could get you college credit), and btw this is the first time I stick with it.  One of the classes is fine, but the other is just workloads every day.  I would get out, but I have never been in a CP (average) class, ever.  I know this might sound dumb and all, but it bothers me.  I think the teacher is pretty cool, its just the work.  I prioritize my family over school (the homework given out by the teacher), always, but this time there really isn't a way to get out without dropping it to a CP class.  I am also in the AP class because I'm relatively smart top 5 in the school, and to drop it knowing people that aren't that high, kind of makes me feel like a failure.  I also feel like I would be leaving the people that I knew for so long, because they're relatively the same people I get every year since they're decently smart as well.

I met this girl 2 weeks ago and she is super fun to be with and a good friend. I developed feelings for her and I tried to make moves on her like complimenting or flirting with her while we were playing Minecraft of hanging around. She rejected all my moves and I realised I will never be with her in the future. Addisionaly some common friends we had said a bunch of stuff like she was into other guys and such. I also felt like she wasn't giving me any special attention of any sort. I didn't know how to react. I felt that every time I saw her face on any social media it reminded me about how lonely I am and that a girl has never liked me back. In the heat of the moment I decided to block her on snapchat. Even if I loved her I would just get sad by seeing her and think about how she will never like me back. I now regret it after my friend said that the girl I liked actually noticed and missed talking to me even if it was as a friend. And I miss her too. I know it will be super awkward to add her back and stuff. And she might not want to be my friends anymore.

I don't know what to do. Please give me advice in the comments.

794,"I really need advice. My sister is 17, she’s been caught shoplifting makeup before (a year and a half ago) and was banned from a store for life. That really shook her up and she promised never to do it again. A few days ago she was caught again, this time with a friend, they had gone to 3 shops and stolen hundreds of pounds worth of stuff (makeup and clothes). The shop people decided not to get the police involved, all they did is get my sister to call a parent/guardian, she called my mum and they let them go. 

My family is really shocked and worried, no one in my family does stuff like this and we’re not really sure what to do. She said this is the first time she’s done it since the last time she was caught. This is obviously a lie, she lies a lot. 

I guess one reason why she does it is because she doesn’t have much money, my mum doesn’t have much to give her and she steals things she wants. But that’s no excuse, I’m 22 now and can afford my own stuff now but when I was her age I didn’t steal stuff I couldn’t afford, I just saved up or went without. 

She’s going to be 18 in 2 months, is she going to end up a criminal and in prison? I have no clue.

Then I received a text from the same number that said “who is this”. I responded “you called me, who is this?”. Then I got multiple *67 calls. I finally answered one (because it was nonstop), and a woman who sounded very upset accused me of calling her daughter. She said I called her daughter and told her to “stay home. Stay safe”. I didn’t call anyone, and after I explained who I was/how I have been working all day she believed me and apologized.

His body is so ugly I can't even bear to be around him. I sure wish I was adopted. He also slurps really loud, and he has terrible posture. He burps and farts all the time, and his burps smell like hell. He has zero respect for other people.

He reuses dental floss all the time. He just puts it on the bathroom table to dry, and he reuses it. It's so disgusting when he does that. He eats with his hands, and he touches other people's foods as well. He has stinky feet, and he doesn't bother to shower at all. He drips a lot of sweat everywhere he goes, and he has yellow teeth. He literally drips his sweat on books, paper, the tables, chairs, and everything he is around. His hair is gross and puffy, and he doesn't bother to shave his pubic hair. His armpit hair is so long it makes me want to cringe.

He sings really loud as well. He sings off-pitch, and I just want to punch the wall when he opens his mouth. He sings all the time, and he also makes really gross and high pitched whistling sounds. It absolutely destroys my ears to hear him. He stomps really heavily on the stairs, and each time I'm downstairs and I hear his footsteps, I just run away and hide in the bathroom until I hear him go back up the stairs.

His face is really weird, it looks like a potato. His face is chubby and gross, and he has a lot of whiskers growing everywhere on his face. He has thick thighs and thick calves, and a large potbelly. He has no sense of cleanliness. He often just puts his feet up on the table, and he sticks his hands down his pants.

I asked her where the mailbox key is, and she said she doesn't know. I asked her if she could help me find it, and she said no. My mom tends to not care about important things or do things people ask her to do. 

I tore up the entire house looking for it. I looked in the living room, kitchen, garage, bathrooms, her (broken) car, and nothing. She got mad at me for making noise and ""bothering"" her. I did all of this while she sat on the computer and played Facebook games the entire time.

Her sister is pregnant and her mom disabled (not sure how) and is frail, so neither one of them drive. 

Kristens sister had an appointment a couple of days ago and she asked me if I could take her sister since her car is still being looked at. I took the mom and the sister to the appointment, the pharmacy, and the grocery store. I didn’t mind, they paid me gas, which I don’t really need but they insisted, they even paid for my lunch. 

During the car ride her mom told me Kristen doesn’t clean up around the house, which I kind of figured, she doesn’t know basic things about cooking or doing laundry because when it comes up in conversation she’s very clueless about it. She also doesn’t pay any bills, only her car payment, her dad pays her phone and everything else. Mind you they aren’t rich or well off her dad and sisters husband work a lot to pay bills. Then the mom also told me Kristen  makes a fuss when her mom or sister asks for a ride, even though they pay gas, and give her extra money. The sisters husband even pays her but she still makes a fuss and rushes them. 

The other day, when I picked up her mom and sister, Kristens boyfriend was picking her because she spends the weekends with him. He drives 2 hours to pick her up because she doesn’t want use her car right now. Plus she’s not really working, she works part time due to COVID but gets like a 1000 unemployment.  Which she just spends or clothing or her car payment. 

I was just think to myself, Kristen doesn’t pay bills, she doesn’t do any chores, she barley wants to drive her disabled mother or pregnant sister, but she always tries to make it seem like we have the same struggle? I work full time, I live alone, I pay all of my bills, and clean my house and cook for myself. Which isn’t a big deal I have to do all of this to survive, but she likes to pretend she and I are in the same boat. But now I don’t think that’s the truth. 

So is Kristen a bad person for this? I feel like she’s okay as a friend, but I feel like her priorities are in the wrong place because she bends over backwards for her boyfriend, but never for her family? should I talk to her? If so what do I say? Is it even my place?",11Sep2020,1

It seems like they have an unspoken competition where they talk over eachother and increasingly get louder than one another, and ive tried to explain to them before that i have something wrong with my brain, im not sure what it is but i hate noise and social situations, when they all come over i have to wear my headphones so that i can speak to them and hear them at what i would consider a normal volume, they just call me a tweak when i tell them they are being too loud. These past 3 days i have been trying to tell them how annoying it is and how i feel like they make fun of me behind my back (my family does this because im considered the special one of the family) they mainly ignore my feelings and respond with jokes like how they will put their nuts on each others faces to get back at them for being loud. Just now i sent 1 of my friends a really long paragraph about how i hate how my feelings are ignored and i hate how i get made fun of because im sensitive to noise.

My dad is the youngest of 5 and is the only one in his family with his last name.

This pressure has been on me has done nothing but rapidly increase as I’ve gotten older. My eldest sister and her fiancée don’t want children, so I’m my moms only hope for grandchildren.

They are constantly badgering me on why I’m not dating or don’t have a girlfriend. Like I can’t come home from my college without having to hear about how they think it’s weird that I’m not dating. I always am set up with my moms friends children, and being introduced to random girls that look around my age. No matter how much I plead for them to not do this, they refuse to pull back.

The hardest thing is that I legitimately want to date around and be in a relationship, but it’s not particularly easy for someone like me. My dad was a jacked 6’3 college footballer and military man, that could’ve been a model at my age, but he married a short woman so I came out 5’11 and he forgot to pass down his good looking genes. I don’t want to say exactly how bad I looked, but being called ugly by the people around me and women I’m interested in, isn’t exactly an uncommon thing. That combined with a naturally introverted personality makes it INCREDIBLY hard to talk to women. So I’m not sure if I’ll ever be in a position where I could have my own kid

I feel like my constant begging for them to leave me alone has just been ignored. At this point I really don’t know how to get them off my back, well other than be in a relationship, but that’s not realistic at this point in my life. What can I do?",11Sep2020,1

822," 

Hello.

I currently live with my disabled mother, she has MS and epilepsy amongst other issues, and requires a good deal of care. Until recently she has been looked after by my step-father, who has now been rushed to hospital I wont go into detail but we are being told me has 'a matter of days'.

I work full time @ minimum wage, long hours / late nights (noon -&gt; early morning)

My step father is responsible for a large portion of our rent and bills, although this mostly comes from his pension. None of us has any savings to fall back on.

Rent is too much for me to be able to support just by myself, my bills between car/phone/electricity/%ofrent leave me with nothing at the end of the month as it [is](https://is.my/). My mother does receive disability benefits and these pay for a portion of the rent and food for herself, but the rest of the bills fall to my step father.

I'm worried mostly about my mother, she is not well, mentally and physically, and I doubt she would be able to move to another property. We currently have carers that come 3 times a day and help her with medication / bathing / etc.

With my step father passing away its likely that my mother will be left alone in the house for long periods of time while i'm at work, and between carer visits. I'm at a loss of where to even begin. carers are due to come in a few hours and will talk to them about increasing visits, but its a moot point as i am currently going to be unable to pay rent/bills at all within a few weeks. As far as I know there isnt any life insurance/money that is going to be passed on from my step father.

please advise, I am panicing.",11Sep2020,1

825,"I'm in 11th grade and he is in 8th (he is the cousin of one of my old best friends from middle school. We are both homeschooled). He has autism, depression, anxiety, and a few other things. He is also trans and pan. His mom wasn't accepting for a while and is one of those people who don't really believe in depression from what I can tell.

She did buy him a binder a few months ago and is letting him wear masculine clothes now. She was upset though when my friend cut his hair short, but now she is okay with it. He still has to go with his deadname around family though.

He also has two younger siblings he has to take care of and has a lot of chores. I don't know what is going on exactly, but he isn't allowed to lock his door and is punished pretty harshly for small things. I was never punished as a child, so maybe I just think it is harsh when it isn't, but I don't think his mom really helps him at all. I don't want to give any details as I feel like that invades privacy.

I moved about a year ago, so I haven't seen him in a long time, but we still talk a lot. I also have depression and anxiety and my little brother has autism, so I understand some things he is going through. I knew he self harmed sometimes, but recently he has been doing it more or has at least been telling me. He has been trying to stop and downloaded one of those apps that tracks how long you have stopped. About an hour ago he texted me and said he hurt himself enough for blood (not a lot he said) and I'm worried.

How can I support him? Is there anything I can do? I don't have any contact with his family and I can tell that if they knew they'd make it worse instead of helping.",11Sep2020,1
826,"In 1 week I will be graduating from a beauty school for Esthiology. When I enrolled after completing FASFA, I was given two options for finances. 

- The first option was for a “Parent Plus Loan” that would covers a large chunk of the loan (about 11,000) and whatever was not covered by the Parent Plus Loan, I could make 6 monthly payments on ($480) 6 months after graduation. 

- The second option was to use financial aid (I forgot the name of the exact loan), I was only approved for about 4,000 and received a small amount of pell grant money, and if any balance was remaining after I would make 6 months of payments on. I don’t remember the exact amount but it was around 1 grand a month.

I did not think my mom would be approved for the parent plus loan but I was told by the woman helping me with enrollment and finances that it didn’t hurt to apply either way, so I did. A week later I was told that my mom was approved and that I needed to come in to the school to sign the agreement paperwork. So I went into the school I signed all of the paperwork and I begin school in March. It is now September, I have one week left of school, and today I get a phone call from my schools Financial Manager saying my mom was declined for the loan, but fortunately he was able to get me approved for extra pell grant money so now I owe the balance of $1600, which needs to be paid ASAP or else I will be placed on financial leave and will not be able to graduate or take stateboard to get my license. I said “that doesn’t make any sense how would I have gone six months and have one week left of school without signing any form of agreement for payment?” He said to me “you signed paperwork showing you acknowledge that your mom was declined for the parent plus loan.” He called me back with the school director on the phone as well, I told the director I need my file emailed over to me with everything I’ve signed. The director told me he was not able to do that because the paperwork can not be  verified to be real over email. I was given no straight answers to how I was able to get six months in the school and one week away from graduation without signing any financial paperwork.

833,"Just to be clear, I'm in the US, an adult and not mentally incompetent. I also posted in  r/legaladvice. 


Last year, when I was at the office of my late father's estate lawyer to sign some paperwork regarding a Trust fund that my father left me, I signed a document that gives my estranged, abusive mother power of attorney over my finances. The estate lawyer instructed me to give her full authority. He explained to me the documents that I was signing, but not in great detail. I didn't know that I was giving my mother full control over my finances. He told me where to sign and I didn't question it because I blindly trusted him. Long story short, I no longer trust him, and I don't think it's a good idea to give Power of Attorney to my mother. He tried to control and manipulate me since the moment I stepped into his office, and he even had the nerve to ask me to tell him the private details of how my mother had abused me as a child. I told him some of the details, but he interrupted me 3 times to invalidate my feelings before snapping, ""I don't want to hear anymore!"" He's been a friend of my mother and father for decades, but he's no friend of mine.

Why did the estate lawyer want me to give my mother full authority over my finances? Is that something that I'm legally required to do when I get a Trust Fund? If not, what could be the reason behind it?

Should I have the POA revoked since I'm an adult and not incompetent?

I feel like my father, who I was estranged with the last few years of his life, is trying to control and financially abuse me even after his death. I hope I'm wrong about that. It wasn't until I turned 30 when he finally returned to me my passport and SS card that he was withholding from me for so many years. Whenever I asked him for them, he said that the documents were safer with him. Do I need to hire my own estate lawyer, tax attorney or both, to sort all of this out?

Even before I signed the Power of Attorney, someone (either the CPA that my father hired to do my taxes or someone else) has my original tax documents and won't return them to me. I requested those documents from the CPA, but he ignored my request and didn't return them to me. Two of the documents (K1s) are prepared by him, yet he never showed them to me even though I asked him for them. He didn't send me my 2018 Tax Return until July, 15th 2020 (after more than one request), and when he sent me e-file authorization to sign, he didn't send me the prepared tax return with it. 

I fired the CPA a few weeks ago via a certified letter and requested him to return my original tax documents, but he still didn't return them to me. I filed a complaint against him to the state board of accountancy because of his misconduct, but that could take months to be investigated. I tried to fire him 2 years ago, but he angrily snapped at me that my father instructed him to do my taxes, that I should be thankful because it's free for me, and that if I do my own taxes, I'll risk being audited.",11Sep2020,1

During those 8 months, D and I have grown to hate M and developed a different image of K. I have struggled with eating disorders for a long time, and I worked very hard to get to a good, healthy place. Once K and M moved in everything changed. They ruled the house and I had to tip toe around them. M would constantly pick on me and make comments to me about what I was eating, how frequently I was eating, or make comments about my appearance or weight.

initially, when she moved back in, it was fine. we even celebrated my birthday well. yesterday though, i really think she went too far. my mom went to the derm to get moles removed and i told my mom that it was just overgrown skin. my sister said it was genetic and i just said, ""well, it's just overgrown skin."" she started to yell at me to the point where my mom literally had to pull her back. she stopped for like ten minutes and started yelling at me AGAIN because she had googled it and said she was right and i was being ignorant. i started to cry and she kept yelling, saying i would never survive in the real world like this. my mom had to take me to my room because she wouldn't stop.

839," For some context,

I moved into this house in November, being a first year in college .My dad gladly brought me back into his life. 

Unfortunately i'm not exactly the best mentally and im recovering from 6 years of trauma and ongoing depression, with a additional unknown learning disability that effects the way i learn and process information, along with some memory issues. With this, my dad has a certain way of asking things of me and telling me information,.

With all this, till summer started, i was fine.

My step mother was a quiet person. Then suddenly, i was sinful for wearing shorts, and was a bad influence on the child in the house, when i was gone, She went into my room, and ripped down everything i'd placed on the wall. It was odd she didn't take down the things i spent money on but threw figures on the desk that i had. She had a picture of Jesus on my desk, on top of my laptop, and i realized everything was unplugged in my room.

I got angry, called my father and told him what happened. But suddenly my phone was turned off. Then i decided to message my friend who lived in the same town as my mother and she picked me up to take a break from my step mom, i went back to the house, my dad was asleep in the house but the car was gone, all the doors were locked. My step mom got back and she said she disconnected the phone.In my confusion i said okay, and she brought up that i had a porn magazine in my room and how dare i bring that into her home, i told her that i told dad i had one, and she said he didn't know that i did. He must've forgot due to his Parkinsons. She started spouting that my father was her God.

we fought and she said things along the lines that Jesus had sinned and that my soul needed to be saved. My friend who is a believer in Christ told me to get my clothing and lets go, I said i would be back in 3 days. I came back, tried apologizing to her immediately and she went to my dad saying that i need to move out. Spouting things along the lines that my mother and grandmother were witches who had cursed me and killed the cat which i had very close connections to (cat had a urinary infection and died from complications after surgery) on purpose to hurt me.

Dad said enough is enough and that it's done. She got back.They talked, and she cried on his shoulder apologizing. Things got better, she got quiet again and such.

Now it's September. Suddenly, my dad got a text, about how i'm damned for the shit on my walls and i removed it with no fight. Happy for a night then got mad again, spouting that in note, a shirt i was wearing was a statement to her (it was a comfy black shirt that i lounged in, and im on my period) The note also stated that i needed faith in god, and that i needed to get a job and take responsibility, That i am a manipulator and that my excuse all the time is that i don't feel well so i don't do things. So i decided with that i would put the note downstairs, i was followed, told my chores for the day, and then yelled at for putting the note down there when dad already knew.

Turns out dad didn't know about the note. He had to rush home because i called him crying. We talked. Dad in a low tone says keep her happy and deal with her, that she's stressed that she has to get a job herself. Now today, chores are sudden, she's in a pissy mood. Keep in mind that she's giving the orders to dad. I came from downstairs, did the vacuuming where i needed to.

She starts to follow, while im going up the stairs. ""Do the living room"" I said i already did it, and she said okay and looked at me with a scowl. I said have a nice day in a neutral tone due to me over hearing while i was vacuuming that dad asked her if she wanted to go out. She yelled ""Have a lovely day too"". Exclaiming that the tone and the look on my face was telling of all.

Now i'm locked in my room, a blanket covering the under of my door so that i receive no note. Typing this out, i'm scared to even speak a word and i am very hungry due to doing chores right away and not having anything to eat.I ask that please do not put this in any video or Instagram featuring the sub Reddit.

843,"Hello, I'm not sure if this is the place for this and I am incredibly anxious to post, but I am desperate for advice. I apologize for the length as there is a lot to explain. 
I've (21 F) been with my potential ex boyfriend (21 M) for 2.5 years. I have severe depression and anxiety and for the past two months it's been at the worst state I’ve had in my life, which could be due to COVID-19 and quarantine. As a result, it's put me in a difficult position with my partner because I've been having a lot of difficulties feeling any sort of love for him. However, I know I love him, especially because these lack of emotions happened out of no where and whenever I think about not having him in my life I cry and feel so much pain. Our intimate life has also been lacking for over half a year, and now our emotional life is starting to suffer. I don't desire a relationship with anyone else, nor do I feel any arousal or affection for anyone else. 
Over the past month him and I have broken up three times because I feel a lot of anxiety and feel that the only way for me to get through this is to be alone. I just feel very numb and a shell of who I was. My partner also has a hard time managing his anger, which was the tipping point for me to break up with him a third time. We try to utilize healthy ways of discussing any problems between one another, but he has a harder time either holding back passive aggression, petty behavior, and aggression or asking for space to avoid saying anything hurtful. I'm at a point mentally where I'm incapable of emotionally caring for something like this outside of my own mental health. 
I feel like I have to be alone because of a few different reasons. 1) His anger (just want to clarify he is not physically violent by any means, it’s just verbally angry and does scare me sometimes into not voicing my true opinion) makes it difficult for me to bounce back from arguments. 2) I try to ask for space, not specifically from him, but from people in general including him. However, I know he gets sad and also feels hurt (extremely understandable) when I ask for space, which makes it difficult for me to fully benefit having space. 3) My anxiety has also gotten very intense with my desire to control. I was a very controlling and toxic person to my partner early on, where I would try to isolate my partner from the people he cares about. I know how awful this is and I’ve worked on it with a lot of progress today, thankfully to his patience with me.
However, with the slump I'm in it's been the most difficult thing to control these possessive and controlling desires and to work on myself mentally at the same time. Whenever I try to take space for myself mentally, instead of focusing on my own mental health I'd focus on who he's talking to, what he's doing on social media, etc. so I'm unable to focus on myself. It feels as though everything I have mentioned above is a burden on my ability to work on my mental health. 
Despite all of that, the idea that he won’t be in my life is terrifying. After I broke up with him, he sent me very angry texts, but eventually apologized for everything and after an in-person visit and a long talk on the phone he wants me to give him one last chance with a promise to be better about his anger (as it has been an issue we talked about for over a year) and to be better about my mental health. On top of this my mother found out about his anger and the awful texts he sent after I broke up with him, which led to her feeling hateful towards him. I value my mother’s opinion of my partner, but I want to put trust in my partner one last time. I’m afraid that this may be the wrong choice, because although I feel so much pain and sadness at the idea of not having him in my life, I felt the weight of my anxiety from my desire to control lift off my shoulders after breaking up. 
I don’t know if I should give him one more chance to treat me better, especially because it isn’t just his treatment towards me that caused the breakup. I don’t want to get back with him only to break his heart again if I truly can’t work on my self mentally while being with him. I’m also so insecure about my feelings towards him because of how little I feel. But I’m terrified of losing him as he’s also my best friend. 
I know this post is everywhere and may be confusing, so please don’t hesitate to ask for clarification. I’d appreciate any advice that can help me come to a conclusion on whether or not I should be with him one more time. 
TL;DR - I have MDD and anxiety that’s difficult to work on while being with my partner.",11Sep2020,1

I’ve been going to school part time for the past year. At the rate I’m going I feel like it’ll take about 5 years to graduate, if not more. Because I’ve had a descent stable job I was able to get approved for a home, which I’m in the process of right now. Once I move to this home my parents and one sister will be moving in with me. I have low monthly payments and will have help from family. This puts me in a position where I can finally leave a full time job and do something part time to focus more on school. I’m considering a bar back job to start where tips are supposed to be good. Especially since I live in Nevada. Would it be a bad idea to leave a stable full time job to focus more on school? I’m closing on the home loan this month and will finally have support from another’s financially. Also, my parents are getting old and considering leaving the country to retire somewhere else. They said all I might get from them in terms of monetary support through rent, is another couple of years. Should I act and go to school to pursue a dream or keep going part time?",11Sep2020,1
846,"So basically I have typed this on google and gotten very vague information that didn't really answer my question. I've also heard that blocks eventually can settle into the ground and basically ruin your shed. I have a very simple, cheap idea and I don't see why it wouldn't work. I have 2 about 8 or 10 ft long (can't remember) large posts that are pressure treated I thought about just digging a hole and setting them in the ground and then maybe getting 2 more pressure treated posts or using a couple trees as the rest of the frame. I don't see why this wouldn't work as they are pressure treated. Pressure treated wood doesn't rot or takes a very long time to at least so I don't see the need of using blocks...

I got this idea from just looking at fence posts and my friend gave me a bunch of fencing. I already built a small greenhouse this way back in the spring and it's still standing. It even withstood very high winds that destroyed many sheds but my greenhouse is still standing with no damage. Of course I used the fencing posts for that and built my way up with the rest of the fencing and pallet wood, etc. I'm not too concerned with it but would like a very sturdy shed and it will house a lot of important stuff. 

I would like an actual floor in the shed but honestly it wouldn't bother me if it just had a dirt floor as long as none of my stuff would be damaged. Maybe I can just lay down pallets inside and build on top of them, and just replace them if they ever rot. But I don't see the actual pressure treated posts rotting. Maybe I am wrong as I am not a carpenter. Sorry if this is confusing, this is the best way I can explain it.",11Sep2020,1
847,"To start, I know that everyone is one their own timeline. I also know that I have accomplished things that other's haven't.

I also still live at home - well with my boyfriend at his parents. We want to move out, but California is expensive.

848,"19/F, Throughout the past two years I've been dealing with problems that resulted in my father's suicide and a guy from school getting away with molestation because of my principal not wanting a bad rep for the school.. (her advice was to stay away from each other. Also that we were ""young""). Even through these events I've graduated from high school and have been attending college for art. 

Due to covid, I've had to leave my dorm and shelter back with my mom and her verbally abusive boyfriend. He would constantly scream at me and my mother because I would leave a cabinet open accidentally or vacuum my current room. Then he would get drunk and fight with her over me being there..

I've mentioned my father's suicide because his wife's current location is still in that home (the house he killed himself in) and my mother is forcing me to live there now. The loft I've been paying for currently stopped requesting money about a few weeks ago and I don't know if I even reside there anymore due to no contact..

849,"I'm on mobile so I apologize for any formatting problems. Also, TLDR at the end.

I (F19) met this guy (M20) online through an anonymous chatting site. We have been talking for quite a while now to the point that we have shared our real names and our personal social media accounts with each other. I have asked him early on what he expects from our exchange to avoid confusion since he has expressed that he wants to talk to me on a daily basis. He also implied that he was single so I know that we need to gauge our expectations and set boundaries. He said he just wants a friend and I respected that. However, there were multiple times that he crossed that line by flirting with me. I don't reciprocate his advances most of the time as we talked about this already. But it's undeniable that we both are interested in each other. I try to hide it though and do my best to treat him like my other friends. 

Anyways, It's been a few days since he gave me his real name. I only thought of doing a background check on him today and when I did, I was shocked to find out that he has a girl? I don't know if she's his girlfriend but they're definitely flirting.

I talked to him just now and I asked him about the girl. I have saved our chat history before our talk so that in case he tries to delete our whole conversation (it's possible in the app we're using), I still have all the evidence I need. I asked him first if he has a girlfriend right now. He said he doesn't. I asked him next, ""ok but then who is (girl's first name)?"" He didn't reply for a while but then he answered that she was just his friend. After that, he told me that he was in-game so his replies wouldn't be fast. In less than 10 minutes, he replies. Now that's kind of sketchy to me because I also play that game and the matches last longer than 10 minutes. Their team would have to be pretty good if they defeated their enemies that fast. Okay so he was back and he asked me what I saw. I think this is a mistake in my part because I told him that I saw her posts. Maybe I should've just kept it vague. He said again that she was just his friend and that they're just openly flirting because they were pranking her friends. I don't know if I should believe this though. So yeah. The rest of the convo is just him repeatedly saying that he has no girlfriend and me trying to laugh it off by saying that it's okay if he has one.

Tbh, it really is fine by me if he has a girlfriend since we are just friends. What's not okay is that he is flirting with me while he has one. He knows that the reason why my ex and I broke up is because he was cheating on me by texting other girls so this situation really is upsetting with me.

What can you advice? Should I believe him? Should I cut off contact? Should I talk to him more about this? Any kind of insight would be delightful and appreciated.

TL;DR: dude said he was single (which is technically still true) but found out after doing a background check on him that he is flirting with someone else besides me. i confronted him about it and he said she was just a friend and some other lame excuse (they said they were only flirting publicly to prank the girl's friends).",11Sep2020,1

We have had our ups and downs, but without any hesitation I can say that we have grown together and fostered an amazing bond and relationship that is still just as strong despite my issues, which is my periodic tendency to meet guys online and either form online relationships or simply seek attention from these men despite having an abundance of it at home. I have told him of this problem and while he is unhappy about it he has given me his trust that I will work on it and I will stop. I have spoken to my therapist and taken steps to expunge all of it from my life but I still find myself tempted to go back. I don't know why I feel this need as especially lately it doesn't make me feel better nor good and I'm simply not interested in any of them besides to be told I'm pretty. I want to feel free of this desire and I want to never seek for this sort of attention again, but I don't know how. I think it stems from my childhood (alcoholic father, absent mother) but despite working on myself and therapy and starting medication I'm still struggling. I guess ultimately I'm asking for advice on how to curb this behavior and feel better, I love him so much and he doesn't deserve this. I don't want to be this kind of person either and I don't want to feel this need anymore.

I feel suffocated everyday I spend with them. I have little to no social life and no one to talk to about how I feel. I hate this country. I cannot have jobs and fend for myself, I am fully depended on my parents as they pay for everything and I am grateful to them for that. 

Without anyone's knowledge I did start dating. My parents do not support homosexuality at all, nor do they support relationships before marriage. I fell in love with a girl while being a girl myself. They will kill me if they know of it but I do not seek for their approval, even if I did that's not something I'll ever get.

My brothers study as international students in Australia, but I am not allowed to even go there for university. I know they will marry me off to a man if I stay here, I do not want to be in an arranged marriage. I am stressing about what to do now.

Lately I have been wanting to eat more sweets and more food in general and I think my body is trying hard to tell me im not okay and that eating sweets is the way of me suppressing it. Im not obese and Im a male and this very new to me. This also always happens when im at college. Food is like widely available up here compared to at home. It might be the stresses of college but I dont know. Im not that stressed this year. 

My childhood rapist who is my first cousin had his baby yesterday night and its been taking a toll on me. I was 8-12 when this occured and he took advantage of me. He was 10-14 when this happened. After thinking he changed he did it with another minor 5 years after. He was 23 and she was 15-16. Its been bothering me so much, he cheated on his girlfriend that he had the baby with to have sex with that underage girl 3-4 years back. It bothers me to think that this child wont grow up in a stable home and could possibly have the same thing done to her. 


I feel like my girlfriend isnt really fair when arguing. Its like she doesnt know how to pick and choose battles. I try to just say ok and try to deescalate arguments but its like she doesnt know how to and keeps going despite it not really being serious. It really just takes a toll on me and I know Im not perfect. But even when I try to tell her about something small like “ wow you took that turn a little hard didnt you, you whipped me lol” she blows up and gets so defensive and goes on and on. Ive tried telling her to calm down and realize that it isnt fair but it doesnt work at all. Ive even tried thinking to myself how would I react. I would honestly just say sorry and ask if she was ok and keep it moving, but yesterday it was like she was so heated cause I told her she took a turn too hard. I love her alot and she is amazing but I feel like her pride is over the top.

Fast forward to this April and Mark starts digging for his foundation, since it was raining he asked if he could plug the sump pump he had to our garage instead of bringing a generator, we of course said yes, the following weeks he asked if he could stay plugged again to frame the walls instead of bringing a generator, he then mentioned he would give us 10$/day for every day that he used our power, at that point every person that was coming to work on his house was plugged to our garage and taking our power, at the time there was the covid relief with our hydro company so even though we used more we ended up paying less so we brushed it off, it kept going all the way into august and he has now started using our water to water his lawn. 

I should also mention that we let multiple people that worked on his house park in our driveway, use our yard to access his back yard and let him use some of our tools.

He always asks politely of course and we always say yes since he's our friend but he hasn't mentioned paying us anything since the first time, he's moving in this weekend so now he doesn't need us anymore and he has now offered more than once to come over for a beer this weekend.

My bf said he doesn't mind and that he's a friend and that we're being neighbourly but i can't help but think he took advantage of us and that if it were somebody else living in our house he would've had to figure stuff out for power and water. 

I'm really not looking for money nor would i ever ask him to pay us what he technically ""owes"" but i just feel like we were used.",11Sep2020,1
864,"ive been in college for about 2 weeks and i have friends but they’re not in the same dorm. so far the people on my floor r mainly the party/ loud people which is def not me but i remembered that there was a pretty cool looking person on my floor that i talked to on move in day. i suddenly remembered that person and was determined to be friends so the next time i saw them i literally went up to them and went hey i think i saw you on move in day, they said you probably did, and then i asked if they wanted to be friends. 

i got their number and we texted for a few minutes and they said that their roommate was pretty chill and i said cool i wanna meet them but they suddenly didnt reply. its only been a day but i bet i totally freaked them out right? im a pretty direct and straightforward person",11Sep2020,1
865," 

So for context, the last 3 years of my life have been hell. I lived in Ohio for 2 years and was miserable, we lived in a houses that was falling apart, my mom had depression, and it was always grey outside. Last year we moved to Tennessee and I thought it would be better but it isn't. We moved due to my dad's job, he's a teacher but wanted to get paid more. Fast forward now and he gotten fired last year because some ultra rich person complained about their kids grades.

The house im ""stuck"" in is falling apart, my mom is going back into depression and my dad doesn't seem like he wants to parent anymore. It's like my parents have lost all willpower to do their jobs. tbh I think my parents are getting really lazy and it's been this way for a few years now. My mom can't work due to medial stuff and thats fine, but she NEVER tries to improve herself. so their on unemployment and im stuck in the house. I can't afford to do much and most of my friends are out of state or I can't see them because school is online now.

The only way i've pushed through all of this is making goals I can work towards such as getting a job, learning to drive, etc. I want to get a job soon and get a learner permit but I feel like I can't do it while im living with my parents. My goal is to leave as soon as I graduate high school (i'll be 19). In order to get on with my life I need to leave home, but for me to do that I need to learn to drive and stuff. Unfortunately I feel like I can't do these things while living with my family. Im kinda skinny and need to hit the gym more but my dad can only take 1 person at a time because he can't afford a decent membership for 2+ people.

What should I do? I've been  thinking alot about how I want to move in with my life, I *know* how, but in order to do it I need to learn some ""adult"" skills and finish high school. On top of that corona has made it harder to go out so Im basically a couch potato rn, any advice?

I need help with my mental health but I can’t afford therapy. I’ve reached out with the one on my school but I was hoping if there are more immediate ways to get help.

867,"My boyfriend and I just broke up a few days ago and I am devastated. I take full responsibility for why we broke up and I admit that I was in the wrong. I do genuinely believe he is just so frustrated with me and either wants some space or is waiting for me to reach out and apologize. It’s been three days with no communication and i’m sort of waiting on him to come to me, which ultimately isn’t fair because he wasn’t the one at fault so I want to reach out to him first.

My biggest fear is that I pour my heart out to him and he rejects me. I messed up significantly and I want to show him that I care. He is worth fighting for. But i’m just so damn scared of being   vulnerable and for some reason I look at it as “i’m begging for his love“ and the thought of being rejected by him would hurt me so much.

Why am I like this? I’m so in love with him and I want to make that known but the thought of reaching out to him first honestly makes me feel so uncomfortable to the point where I feel like I need to have a drink/ be tipsy to send him a message.",11Sep2020,1

870,"TRIGGER WARNING (suicide, mental health issues)

A bit of important background, I have psychotic depression and whilst I’m on medication and receiving therapy, I have hallucinations which can make me spiral down very quickly. A low point lead me to attempting my life by taking overdoses of various medications about a week ago. At this point my dad was suppose to be taking care of me.
When I started showing symptoms of an overdose my dad took me to the doctors who urged him to take me to the hospital, he refused flat out, I don’t know why, only letting me go when they threatened to call child protection services. This is the first major thing he did wrong.
A few days later when I returned from hospital I was still feeling low, at this point my dad began to try and get me to take various drugs from his collection, such as Valium and cannabis, saying they would help me. When I refused he became angry (I am a minor btw). This was his second mistake.
He also pushes suicidal idealism on me and tells me the things I hallucinate are from another reality which is not helpful to someone who’s grip on reality is sometimes limited.
During this time my mum was working and my dad and me agreed to tell her nothing about any of these events (including my overdose) to stop her from stressing out.
I don’t feel safe around my dad, I know if I tell my mum she’ll divorce him and maybe get some legal action but I feel as if I’ll betray my dad (he is bipolar and an addict, he is very weak mentally and act’s unpredictably)

872,"This has become a consistent issue for me, seeing I'm turning 26 in a month and I still live at home / work at an entry level job. I've been doing the same job for 4 1/2 years and it's both my biggest source of stress and the most social interaction I get. 

I was home schooled all my life, only attended actual school in college. Changed my major a few times, then dropped out before I could get my AA in Liberal Arts due to financial instability. Over the past few years, I've developed some pretty bad anxiety and tend to get anxiety attacks when overwhelmed by stress (which is *perfect* in the chaos of the hospitality field), this I find makes it harder to stay motivated for longer than a day or two. 

My parents have been up my butt for years to get my life together, I've tried my hardest to stay motivated and find something I want to do. It always ends the same, I lose interest or motivation faster than it started and end up back at my old job. Part of me is scared of leaving my job, because it's a comfort zone and I've never majorly stepped out of my comfort zone before in life. But I know it's necessary to grow and vital to my living situation to find something to do long-term that can provide for me. 

I guess my question is how do you maintain motivation? How do you find out what you want to do with your life? Is this an anxiety thing and  I should go to a therapist for it?",11Sep2020,1

I don't know if any of that has to do with anything.

Sometimes I feel like I want friends but I also don't. It's like.. It is exhausting to try to participate in stuff and to pretend to be so happy and all.

I also feel like I am boring.

When she got mad at me she said ""you were the one who asked I am fine with not talking to you"" (I asked her like 3 days ago if she wanted to join a call but she couldn't that day and since then she have asked but I couldn't/didn't feel like it)
I asked why she said that and she said she didn't mean it and she's just mad at me for never being able to join a call with her.

I feel like nobody actually likes me. Other than her I have 2 other friends who are also friend with this girl.. She is our internet friend. (we all are with eachother irl every summer holidays and stuff)

Then at my mums it’s a 30 minute car drive (compared to 10m at my dads), she can only take me 3 days of the week and so I’d have to get a taxi which is £20 (which will add up a lot over time), she has nobody else who can pick me up or drop me off and she has work early so when she can do so, we arrive 2 hours before lessons start and have to wait an hour at the end of the day

We had been talking for almost 3 weeks and she had said she was interested but wanted to be friends for now and get to know me first, which was totally cool. She had had some issues in the past so was careful to trust. I was just happy to at least have a friend with so many common interests. I have friends but not much in common so no one very close. It was just nice talking to someone like that. 

Long story short, she got more comfortable with me and starting being more forward (both of us are pretty awkward so it was a nice surprise) but I ended up giving off the wrong impression and made her think I was being too forward. I had sent her a meme about asking for a kiss and she had said she was worried if it would be bad and wasn't sure, etc. I guess I mistook this for general nervousness cuz she said she doesn't have much experience. I'm autistic so I find it really hard to read people :( She told me it made her feel uncomfortable and I apologised profusely, I really didn't mean it. I checked if we were cool and she said we were. But me being me, I explained myself again the next morning just to be sure (it happened the night before) and she said we were definitely okay. Turns out we weren't, later that day she brought it up again, said I made her feel uncomfy, etc. Explained myself again and apologised a lot again.

Cut to yesterday morning (from last Sunday), I checked my messages and she had blocked me. I did some more checking and she had blocked me on everything she had added me on. Everything was fine since then I was so confused. Messaged her on another account I had just asking why and she blocked me on that too. I feel hurt, upset and angry.

898,"I go to a very small college in Asia, with extremely liberal views that I largely share. In my freshman year, I dated this girl that I had become very close friends with for about a week. We broke up because my smoking was a dealbreaker for her, and I understood; we remained very close friends after. There were no hard feelings between us. I even introduced her to her current boyfriend, and they as a couple are some of the closest friends I have here. 

From what she's told me, a few weeks after we broke up, a guy asked her why we split. Her, wanting not to share too much and meaning to contain our privacy, said ""He did something I did not like."" From what I understand, the guy spread this around as me having raped, or done something analogous to sexual assault, to her. It became especially problematic when it reached a girl who, believing that she was protecting people, directly targeted whoever she saw talking to me and told them ""He's a rapist, stay away from him."" After my ex learned what was happening, she talked to the two people involved, as well as others, trying to explain that I had done nothing of the sort. 

Fitting into here has been an issue from day one, due to the cultural differences between my home country and where I am now; but since I was asked, very casually, how the ""sexual assault investigation went"", it has become impossible. It has been three years since I first learned of this, and I can't get over it. I feel eyes on my back whenever I am out without someone whose reputation is extremely ""wholesome"". I feel targeted, suspected, and ostracized whenever I think about going to a party or participating in an event; I cannot approach a girl without feeling creepy. I feel a need to justify any interaction with someone I'm not already close friends with. My romantic and sex life since this consists only of my trips back home and even then I doubt myself whenever I start to think someone might be interested in me. Even when I'm talking to a complete stranger, who could not possibly have heard this rumor, I find myself overthinking every action, doubting any show of interest, and self-sabotaging if things seem to be leading anywhere. I feel guilty over having sexual urges or romantic interests, as if they are dangerous, shameful, or sick. I am unable to take any initiative. If I meet someone new in our school my first thought is when will they find out, when will I see that look of disgust and maybe be asked about this if we spent enough time already -if. I feel deeply isolated and alone, despite having a wide circle of friends. 

At first I doubted myself, replaying every interaction that was even mildly intimate with any girl in the few weeks before this rumor spread; then I started to doubt myself, what if I had done something and don't even remember it? I had been a victim of sexual assault a couple of years prior and at first this rumor both kept me reliving the experience and from asking for support. I felt like I did not deserve help, simply out of the possibility that I had made someone uncomfortable. I tried talking to the body that handles cases of sexual misconduct in our school, and all I got was that there was never a case against me and that my name had never been mentioned. I tried talking to a couple therapists, who tried to help me come to terms with this -they have failed. I am thankful to my friends who are active in sexual health advocacy circles, who explain my situation whenever they encounter it, but I still do not know who knows, who believes it, who heard of it and hasn't said anything about it. 

I am unable to move on from this. I can't dare approach someone romantically. I can't see myself as likable, I can't see someone finding me attractive possible. I can only feel better if I am high, and that's not sustainable.

900,"I’m a junior in high school this year working a part time job making $10 an hour and about $350 every two weeks. It’s not a ton of money but it’s allowing me to get some good savings going (about $1000 in a month and a half). I’m also taking 5 AP classes this year and one honors class. At the beginning of the school year I made the decision I would choose work and good grades over returning to wrestle this year for the school. 
That changed when today they called me into the athletic office to give me my varsity letter and certificate to verify I wrestled varsity last year. On the walk back to my class I couldn’t help but think about the good times from last years season and now am considering going back.
Wrestling will be about 3 months of practicing 3-6 after school and tournaments almost every weekend, this would mean I would have to cut my work schedule down significantly and would possibly have to quit to keep my grades up as I was struggling with just 1 AP class last year. I love the sport and the grind and the pain and the gain of wrestling so much but I also come from a poor family so I don’t know if I can/should do what I love and need help

When they hang out I get sad and when I see them together I get sad and I hate how it all changed. I need to get over them but I have no idea how to. Does anyone have any advice?",11Sep2020,1
902,"I'm autistic and have been out of education for many years through no fault of my own. I don't have any irl friends that stuck around longer than a month or two once i left school. like many 15 year old kids i joined discord. Started a server for a new game that had come out and started welcoming people in.

I became very good friends with about 6 of these people and after admin'ing that server with other people for a while eventually we broke off into our own friends server.

Apart from one problem. They were all between the ages of 20-28 and I was 15. Bc of my autism I find it incredibly hard to relate to anybody my age and according to my mother I've always wanted to 'be at the adults table' and always interacted better with children years older than me, and i was finally thriving in conversation with these guys instead of being the backdrop. So when this group started to complain about another user who was just two weeks younger than me bc they could access 'mature content on the server' and 'interacted with them at all' (I'm not claiming that old server was handled well) I ended up shutting the fuck up about my age and have since bc i didn't want them to push me away too.

Basically I'm 17 almost 18, I've been close friends with these people that long and many of them have met up irl and sometimes invite me which i ofc turn down. They don't know my age and assume I'm 20-23, I've never corrected them.

I used to justify this lying by saying I've never directly stated im over 18 but I've so heavily implied it and never corrected them when they assumed. Now my guilty conscious is catching up and i don't know what to do. I've accessed nsfw content, talked about incredibly mature topics where if they knew i was underage for sure would have never happened. They helped me form opinions and discover my likes and dislikes and identity in a safe manner.

(And for the record its a group of guys/girls/inbetween, nothing sexual or romantic in any way we're just all bored friends talking about whatever topic of the day we decide on and help each other do art.)

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to fucking do. I just don't want them to shove me away like every other friend has even if they're completely in their right to after all this

I was planning on saying my age sometime after new year... but they've complained about young children 'infiltrating' adult spaces which just made me collapse further in on myself

I know compared to other topics here this is probably trivial... But it's been eating me up for the whole time i've known them and I'm scared. My life is awful and i think being rejected here would be the final straw before ?? Something idk, I'm tearing up just thinking about this all, im so selfish but i dont want all these relationships to end",11Sep2020,1

I would like to clarify that he has drunk alcohol before, like a beer in the summer, but never two on a day or more than 3 in a week. Since about a month ago, we have been dealing with financial issues. I live in the Netherlands, where it's taxes on taxes on taxes... My father's company has also lost a significant amount of revenue due to the coronavirus (physiotherapy), and he almost lost his job if it weren't for the financial support issued by the government. Not only that, but the car company from which we rented has suddenly issued us to 'pay up' the money. My dad's recent girlfriend broke up with him as well... we just have a rough period going on. But now he's suddenly drinking whiskey, like three glasses a day. I don't think three glasses a day is that bad, but still, I'm kind of worried... Is this normal for people undergoing a stressful period? Is this just a way of coping with financial problems, or just problems in general? Should I be worried?",11Sep2020,1

I don’t need to heal. I don’t have any trauma and I’ve been single most of my life - I’m just scared of getting my time wasted and worry that a relationship might affect my goals and be a distraction. I don’t want to feel this way anymore and I want a girlfriend.

The text message had some pretty X rated stuff like how he wanted to have sex w me and how he had a surprise for me. I mainly replied because I was curious and wanted to know what surprise he had. This man had given me money before because he’s kinky and I was hoping it was something like that I was not planning on meeting up w this man at all but I shouldn’t have texted him at all in the first place because I love my boyfriend and now I jeopardized my relationship because I just wanted to know what surprise this man had and he didn’t even tell me what it was. 
After my boyfriend saw the text he immediately got upset and we talked about it and he told me he doesn’t trust me, that’s what hurts the most that he doesn’t trust me. I’m just really sad because this is all my fault and I ruined my relationship because I was curious what that man was gonna say and I had no intention in ever meeting him and now my boyfriend thinks I’m cheating on him or I’m a hoe. We have been talking about this whole situation and he’s still upset with me, I don’t blame him. It just hurts because we were at such a good time in our relationship and now all because of me I ruined what we had, this is also our first ever fight as a couple. He keeps saying he needs time and that’s why we’ve taken a break but I’m afraid during this time he’ll just break up with me because he doesn’t trust me and he thinks I’m a liar.

Don't plan to give, I want to keep going hard at it. It will be worth it, maybe it doesn't have to make sense; it just has to keep you going.

Did theraphy, and I noticed that it works but only because I'm sharing my ideas with someone; however when I share my ideas out of this, my family and friends get scared. They think I'll try it again. 

I enjoy my solitude, but I can feel the pressure; Don't know if it's me or the world wanting me to cooperate.I want to find something meaningful and go at it. It's hard, it's lonesome but I feel I must do.

I'm lucky, I've a work that is challenging and I still have many things to learn.

Feeling the pain everyday of improving myself. To learn something new, so new ideas can emerge and I can truly know myself.

I come from a third world country, I have seen and lived things. My father and my mother always pushed to be productive and not emotional. I was abused. I got bored in school. Always liked computers and coding, it took me where I am today. I was emotionally abused a few times, by people I trust the most and I have learnt to deal with it. 

They say I need to be confident, but I'm where I'm at because the lack of it. Because I know I don't know enough. So is confience really that good? I can pretend to be confident, but pretending would be lying to myself. I rather doubt what I do so I can continue improving it and increase my understanding of the world.

He went lowkey insane and ended up admitting to some fucked up stuff and believe me if I’m saying it’s fucked up, it’s pretty fucked up. I’m keeping it intentionally vague but he did implicate himself in human trafficking amongst other things

I asked r/drugs if there was any chance that he was so high/confused he ended up admitting to stuff he didn’t even do but they said that’s unlikely. More likely accidentally admitted to some serious stuff. I’m nervous to confront him about it but I probably should

The stuff he said is serious and this is coming from a Heroin and cocaine dealer who’s seen a lot of stuff. If what this guy said is true I think his time is up

938,"As the title states, I've basically given up trying to start any conversation with the opposite sex. This probably makes me sound like an ""incel"" or ""beta"" but I've been with my girlfriend for over a year now and we get along perfectly fine. To be fair though we've been childhood friends since birth so conversing and sharing with her is as easy as breathing. Any other female though, it's just a total nightmare. I've always been introverted and shy after puberty hit. I never thought of it as a bad trait so I've kinda just hid myself away in my own world. Whenever I am out and about or at a party with my girl or family I just feel this glare coming off from most of the ladies around me. The guys they talk too are usually super extroverted and usually just straight up obnoxious. That made me think back to my junior high days when I was on riddlin with ADHD. I was exactly like these ""bros"" and all the girls in my class would laugh and joke, even if I pulled their hair or was just an outright dick. Hell I even had girls sneaking into my room when I was little. 

 Now that I'm shy and quiet I feel like they never feel the need to start conversations first. Even girls that I know who are quiet and awkward just like me would rather have the conversation lead by someone else. If I ever try to talk to a girl I can see the awkward expressions they make and the brief pauses they make before replying with the quickest response to get the conversation over and done with. I don't think I talk about outright insane topics or come across as a creep (idk maybe I do come across as a creep, I guess there's no real way for me to know..)
 Is it just a mother complex that all women are born with? Do they feel like they have to be more mature and intelligent than the guy their talking too? Do I have to be a total ass and wave my dick around like a helicopter to actually feel normal around them?

Anyways, I have been thinking a lot about this lately. Why go through the trouble of being alive? I mean I am not going to kill myself any time soon or anything like that, I mean it literally. What’s the point? Life is full of pain and beauty, I get that. We can find meaningfulness in it and all. But what’s worth the trouble of living a “good life”? happiness?then we die? Sure, but why?
Lately this question has stumped me so much I am haveing trouble going after my goals. I am in college getting my AA, but I have no drive anymore. During global thing, all my habits have turned up side down and I don’t feel like setting new ones. I sleep in till 12 and feel nothing. 
I could cook and clean, learn a new hobby, do my old hobbies but why? Why am I doing this if we all die. What’s the difference between dieing today or tomorrow and not having done my laundry? I have lived a happy life. I have lived a sad life. Life is life.
Why get out of bed when I can lay in bed? The bed is comfortable, if I am doing this life thing to be happy then why not just lie here forever till I die comfortably? 
Okay that’s sounds really pessimistic, but that’s the question right?
Life is trouble, why go through the trouble if just to die? Littarly why should I care about getting out of bed and going out and doing anything? I don’t care.

940,"I have people in my contacts who I haven’t talked to in 2+ years, some only like half a year.  I don’t see me or them talking any time soon, or ever.  Some people we just stopped talking, others we just had a falling out and some we probably have each other’s numbers to send the homework that one time. 

I don’t know why I feel so guilty about doing it.  I’m going to college next year anyways.  I thinks it’s because I don’t like the last interaction I’ve had with some of these people or who I was during those times so deleting their number makes it “official” that it’s staying that way.  I also don’t know why but I feel like I’m playing the unrealistic “what if” game, like what if they do message me.  I know they won’t.

I guess I’m just asking is should I do it/ should I feel guilty?",11Sep2020,1
941,"Hey reddit. Uhm so 6 months ago, almost to the day, I met a girl who I love dearly . She’s incredibly strong and sweet, and has been through a lot of pain in her past, in family, and in past relationships. She has depression and anxiety and frequent panic attacks. We took two weeks getting to know each other before we decided to get together. This continued for another two weeks until we decided to take a break for a while, for emotional reasons . For a month and a half we kind of drifted, each had a crush on another person for a short time, before we both kind of mutually realized that we made mistakes stopping talking to each other, and that we never really lost feelings for each other. So we began dating again, and had four amazing, happy months together, spending all our time together, planning out futures, meeting families, proclaiming love for each other. Then her mental health took a dive. More frequent panic attacks and depressive episodes, her going in and out of wanting affection and love, (which I love giving) and wanting space. Eventually last night she told me she wanted to take another break, for her mental health was suffering, and she needed to take time to herself, love herself , and get better before a relationship. We agreed that we still loved each other, and that wouldn’t change, and that eventually, we wouldn’t be surprised if we got back together once she was okay, because our connection is strong for each other, we just needed time to grow, and for her, time to love herself. We still see each other, I still hug her, kiss her forehead, we still even on occasion say “I love you.” Now I’m just feeling lost, and alone, and not wanting what we have to end again. Even if it’s only temporary, it still hurts me, because I want my life to be with this girl. And I already miss the little things and cute phrases and nicknames in our relationship. So my question is: how can I make this wait easier, how can I keep my hopes up, and what is your overall positive input on the situation.",11Sep2020,1
942,"So earlier today at about 7 AM EST, I noticed my right ear ringing ever so slightly. I can just barely hear it but I can hear it at all times. Is this anything to be concerned about?

944,"I've always identified as straight, and never thought much about it, and never considered that I may be otherwise even despite the fact that when I was younger I would go on a private browser so I can sneak a peak at pics of beautiful girls, sometimes inappropriate ones, sometimes not. Although I am attracted to guys, I only follow pretty girls on instagram, literally no guys unless they are comedian youtubers or gamers I watch, and girls seem to turn me on way more and way quicker than guys (although guys still turn me on). 

I have lots of LGBTQ+ friends, and I've had some girls catch crushes on me, but since I identify as straight, I immediately decline before I can even think, but sometimes I consider it, and even get jealous when they have a crush on another girl instead. I've always supported that community but never even slightly thought I'd be apart of it despite all of the things I feel.

I wonder if it's just lust because I hear lots of straight girls that don't mind hooking up with girls for fun, so I just brushed it off as one of those things, but lately I've had a lot of time to myself, so I have been thinking about what it'd be like dating a girl, and putting lust aside, and only allowing romance, and even went on a lesbian dating site just to look at all of the options, and honestly, I wouldn't mind dating a girl, I think I'd really love her even without lust involved, I think it'd be lovely. But I mainly go for guys, like whenever I think of dating, I think of men, so idk if I'm just a loving person who would love anybody regardless of what they are, or if I actually WANT girls. 

I haven't tried dating one yet because I don't want to risk hurting a woman's feelings trying to 'test' things out, but also what if I'm missing out on the love of my life? Do all people of the LGBTQ+ community go through these thoughts before they come out? Or do straight people just think of these things sometimes?

I'm embarrassed to talk about this with anyone I know ESPECIALLY my family, they've caught me one time in a private browser looking at women when I was a kid, so I worry that they still remember that (I'm 20 years old now) and that they may suspect something of me. My family is very accepting, my dad is somewhat accepting, he has mentioned that he was worried that I was gonna become a tomboy when I was a child (even though I ended up girly anyway sjndjdn) and that lead me to believe that maybe he wouldn't disown me, but he would be a lil disappointed. 

But regardless, I don't feel comfortable talking to my family about this, and I don't wanna tell my friends and it end up not being true. Then they'll forever look at me differently. I really don't know what to do or where to turn. If you are straight, or LGBTQ+, please let me know if you've had these feelings before, and what it may mean",11Sep2020,1
945,"I know this seems like a stupid immature question but I'm genuinely wondering how people do it. I think the main thing is... how do you get over someone when they stopped loving you? I've had relationships break apart before, or we've decided it's just not working, but how do you get over someone when you still love them but they just stopped loving you. I feel like it would be easier if they had cheated on you or they did something wrong to break your feelings for them. But when it's just that their feelings for you have faded, how do you deal with it?

I know the common answer is probably just self care and time, but I can't imagine that you ever really forget it. I understand there's an element of grieving to it, and it's probably happened to every person you've ever met. 

But do you ever really stop thinking of them? Do you stop holding on to the hope that they may change their mind back? Does the memories of your time together and future that never was forever flicker behind your eyes, and do you ever stop wondering how they are now and the desire to just know that they are doing ok?",11Sep2020,1

948,"I'm doing this on a throwaway because I plan to delete this soon bc I don't want any trouble to come from it.

So I've been friends with this girl for a couple months and have grown really close to where I could trust her with my deepest secret. Seriously she has been there for me through some really rough times, and today she decided to share with me her darkest secret...

Apparently when she was younger she used to be a little into Zoophilia... apparently there was no sex but it was all self pleasure material  (reddit wont let me post the real word) . She went on to explain that she grew up with practically no sexual education and was really reserved and confused. She got so desperate for ""contact"" that she saw a video that gave her ideas. She never hurt the first dog and she explained that the moment she became aware that it wasn't right and became more aware of how awful it was she stopped. She never did anything with the privates again, but sometimes she would slip and let them lick her breasts. (Sorry if this is weird to read but I figured it was important) She said she would feel sick for it after and soon she was able to kick it altogether. She was able to turn her perspective completely and now even the thought sickens her. She has been clean for a couple of years but now its a source of never ending guilt, shame, and regret that will leave her depressed for days at a time.  She has talked a little with her therapist about it and they said that was was important was that she stopped and realized it was wrong. She made it up to the dog by apologizing and making sure he lived the best life he could before he passed away years later (the best food, affection, and comfort) and he didn't show any trauma. The second dog (Whom licked her breasts) she taught to never do so again and again showed no signs of trauma. She also plans on talking with a sex therapist about her issues in the future, and considers one day donating to animal rescue organizations (whenever she gets enough money) 

She has made the decision to try and be a better person for the rest of her life. Which I believe fully as she has always seems to have everyone else's happiness in mind (I found out that she gave all of her savings to help her family pay their bills secretly one summer). I was a bit shocked to hear it at first but after she started explaining how she grew up, her traumas, and how she never was fully attracted to the animals rather just craved the sensations I started to understand more. Especially after I learned more about people who actively are into it.  She really is a good person and has a lot of issues she deals with regularly. (recent revelations about being emotional abused, anxiety issues, and being developmentally slower for instance...) and she only JUST found out about therapy. 

I have accepted her for what she has done but now I am worried about her. Since she confessed she has become depressed which is something she says happens whenever her mind brings it up. She says that though she has talked to herself, her therapist, and made amends to the almighty but she cant shake the overwhelming feeling of shame, regret, and just general disgust. She thinks of herself as one of the worst people in the world and has even confessed that at her worst she feels she should just die since she isn't worth loving because of this. I've tried to explain how there are people who did worse to animals, and how there are so many who don't ever feel remorse for what they do but she keeps putting herself down and her mind just wont let her move on. She says that she deserves to feel like this because of it. I've tried talking to her about it more seeing if there was anything else but she says there isn't. I don't know if I should just let her have her depressed state (as she puts it can last a few days to a week) or if I should try talking to her more about it. 

One thing for sure thou is that I CANNOT bring this up to her family. They have some issues that make them impossible to approach even about her possibly being gay! Also I don't want to ruin her life by suggesting she talk with her therapist more about it because I don't want them to get her arrested.",11Sep2020,1

951,"Disclaimer.. I have gotten many comments on other posts of mine saying I have very bad grammar. I apologize for any grammatical errors or If it seems like Im a 7 year old writing this. Im a fast typer and I dont put alot of attention on making my writing grammatically perfect. I usually just try to get the point across. So in advance. I apologize.

So my situation Im in is probably unique to this subreddit..

Let me start with who I am.

I am a 19 year old (M) and I am pursuing photography, Videography, YouTube and possibly teaching a class on photography.

Here is what I can do in each of my job titles.
Photography: Portrait, business, wedding, product and I also do personal creative photography.

Videography: Wedding, Business, advertisements and documentaries.

YouTube: I am currently changing my content and making Instructional videos to help beginner photographers and videographers develop their skills

Teaching: pretty simple.. I would work for a partnership program where homeschoolers can attend fun classes and stuff.. Kinda hard to explain.

What the problem is and where I need advice is.. my mom. Let me start by saying she is an amazing mom. She is very supportive of my career choice, isnt abusive in anyway. A solid 9/10 mom! 

But she always needs my help. 
Cleaning the kitchen, she needs my help.
doing 5 dishes, needs my help
Going to the store, needs my help
The littlest things that would take her a minute to do she needs me to do it.

Im happy to help her and I will with no complaints, but at the same time. She takes up 75% or more of my day just doing things for her. Just this week I have had 2 days where Ive had only about an hour or 2 to do my own stuff.

She isnt in the best of heath so I understand that, but she is in good enough health to do basically everything she has me do.

Something that bugs me aswell.. when she calls me to help her, Im usually in the middle of doing something myself. So I have to get up, go help her. When I get back it takes me a minute to get back in the groove and flow of work and by the time I am, she calls me again.

The reason why this is so frustrating is because I recently decided to go full time into Photography and Content Creation, and that takes so much damn time itd crazy. Im constantly planning, constantly writing, constantly editing and planning shoots. But when Im interrupted 10+ times a day or sometimes have to be with her away from home morning till evening. I cant get anything done! It straightup kills my motivation and Im left exhausted and depressed making it 10x harder to focus and work on what I need to work on.

I want to do this stuff for my career and its important to me that I do this but my mom Is also Important to me and I want to help her out as much as I can. Im just so exhausted from all this I have no frwaking clue what to do. There are also alot of other crap Im going thru outside of my family and I have nowhere to turn.. so thats why I came here. 

This is kinda I guess me venting but I also need advice. If you have any questions, comments or advice please tell me.",11Sep2020,1

I like her ngl I’ve had a crush on her for a few months she’s pretty chill. We’ve been dating since the 24th. I love her but I think I still like my ex. I think about her some but not more than my current gf and idk what I should do. Ik I have no chance with my ex so I wouldn’t break up with my gf so I could go back to wishing I was dating my ex.

11AM until 1.30PM. About 500 customers and they come in waves.
There is this one girl who comes at 11.30PM and literally stares at me and smiles. When we catch eyes, she blushes, but quickly looks away. Sometimes she looks back when she leaves. she looks like a cute nerdy girl and acts very shy. I just can't get her out of my head.
But she always comes with a group, and I need to quickly check their badges and say: ""Ok, thank you, thanks, thank you maam"" and so on. They just hold it in the air and walk pass me.
I started to greet her differently than the others and say ""HI, thanks""  and when she leaves with her group I look at her and say: ""bye, have a nice day"" something like that. She gets red and smiles, and quickly leaves with her group. 
Everyday I am trying to think of something that won't emberrass her in front of her friends, because I think she doesn't like to get attention infront of many people. 
I checked the homepage of her bank, and there was a picture of her somewhere with her name. Now I start to sound a little weird, i know. I found her facebook of course. But I don't want to send her a request, because you can guess how weird that would look.

958,"About a week ago I was hanging out with friends and we were out driving after curfew. I drove through a tollway and I don’t have an I-Pass, and I couldn’t pay with change because I didn’t have any. I can’t pay the charge on my debit card because my dad can monitor the account, notice the charge, and find out I was driving past curfew (on the highway, no less). A friend of mine has already offered to pay the toll but I need to create an account on the Illinois Tollway website in order to pay by plate number. Problem is, it seems the only way to create an account involves ordering an I-Pass transponder which costs $10.00 and I can’t find a way around it. I can’t pay $10 or order a transponder because, again, my dad can see the charge on my account and then I’m still screwed. I don’t think my friend can set up the account in his name because he doesn’t own the car and I feel like that could cause complications if my dad ever decides to buy an I-Pass for the car in the future.

960,"So I (20M) live off campus with my sister (22F). She has a boyfriend and likes to have him over a lot to be with. However because I also live there, alone time is harder to come by. I would call myself somewhat introverted so the extra “pressure” of having someone extra around the apartment, even if they’re in a separate room, stays with me for some reason. I just don’t feel as free to do whatever I want e.g walk into the kitchen without having a conversation about something.

961,"About a year ago, my wife left her phone turned on and I decided to take a look at who she was talking too. When I was looking at her text messages she had one on silent with the name “Laura” I didn’t make much of it because that’s one of her best friends. As I was scrolling down I seen another “Laura with emojis” 
This made me go back to the first “Laura” messages and read them. It turns out it was her ex boyfriend. I looked at the dates &amp; time of then texting and notice how she would text him while being next to me. Obviously I didn’t make much of it because all I seen was “Laura” which made me think it was her best friend. 

This past week I have notice how she tents to hide her phone more. She also doesn’t use her phone when I’m around. 
I asked her for her phone last night to make a call, since mine was charging, she said yes and i called my best friend talking about random things. And told my wife I was going to use the restroom, when I was in the restroom I started to snoop around but didn’t find anything. Maybe she deleted everything? Maybe I am just being paranoid since it was around this time I found her texting her ex ? 


I know we both need our privacy &amp; I really want to know if she is doing something wrong and deleting all evidence.

He is like give me a good reason why u not gonna help its not like u got homework to do right. Im like its not about that i got nothing to do, its about principles like if u just asked me nicely like ""sorry i forgot to tell u but I need to go set-up a bouncy castle can u help me?"" ofc i would say yes. But now u are like no choice u gonna go. so he said like so u not gonna help me? Im like nah now u tryna get me in that position where there is no other choice than saying yes sorry i dont work like that.

963,"To start out I want to say that last month my (27F) bf (26M) and I moved in together. It’s been kinda stressful but I’ve been enjoying having my own space away from my family; mainly because both my brothers like to bring their friends over without any forewarning and it’s annoying not being able to walk around my own house without having to see random ass people I don’t know or care to know tbh. What they’re into is nowhere near what I’m into so I usually don’t mingle with either of my brothers friends. 

Even though it’s been stressful at times I do enjoy just having space to myself. It’s been nice. However my bf...he constantly, constantly complains about how he doesn’t have money for anything except to put gas in his car and even with that since we share his car for now I will put gas in it one week and he’ll do the next week if we need it. Every single day he’ll make a comment about how broke he is or how he doesn’t have money for this and that (even before we met he didn’t save money for anything and had no savings until I told him he needed to make one just in case) and it’s becoming very annoying. I tell him constantly to leave his job and get another one since he hates his current one so much and find something that’ll pay more but no he’ll apply or look but if it pays more and is 30-40 mins away he won’t go to the interview cause he cares too much about losing maybe an hour or two of pay from his current job. 

He’s gotten an offer to work at a law firm in LA for 22-28$ an hour and I encouraged him to do it because where we live now isn’t that far from LA on a good day with no traffic. He’s gotten offered jobs where he has room for over time that won’t leave him exhausted unlike where he works now, even one of his old coworkers who is a manager now told him that if he wanted to leave where he works now he can come work with him and all he’d have to do is basically demand the wage he wants and he’ll give him both the pay and the job and for whatever reason my bf has taken up none of these offers. 

No matter what I tell him, no matter how much I encourage him and tell him that even if he doesn’t leave his current job that we’ll be fine money wise he still gets negative about it. He’s got debt that he caused by not paying his credit card off fully before deciding to move out and now he just complains about not having money to pay it off but does nothing to actually help himself. I would understand more if the pandemic was really affecting his job to where he was bringing home hundreds less than what he brought home before the pandemic but he literally only brings home 100$-200$ less because they aren’t doing over time right now. But he still makes good money way more than me but still he just gets mad or thinks negatively when I give him suggestions on what he can do to make at least an extra 200$-300$ if he doesn’t want a part time weekend job. He went to and finished school for photography but doesn’t do it all and ppl have contacted him about it too. But does he listen? No.

I’m not regretting moving in with him but his constant negativity is affecting my mental health and makes me question if we should’ve moved out or waited longer. It annoys me that I find it hard to comfort him every week about it cause he does nothing to change it. I’ve even told him if he can’t afford something then I’ll pay for it and he can pay me back later. Does he do that? No. Does he ask me to pay for anything at all? No. I’ve stressed this mainly because I don’t want to hear him say I’m broke constantly or have him basically say that we can’t do anything or travel anywhere because he’s broke as if he’s the only paying for anything. No matter what I do or say he has it in his head that he pays for everything himself even though we split everything 50/50. Idk what else to do for him so he can de stress and just not think negatively on us living together but it’s hard. My mom even offered to let us stay with her should we feel the need to break our lease and just save up more money but he doesn’t want that. I don’t either but if it meant he stopped complaining then I’m not opposed to it.

I just want him to see his own potential and give himself a chance at a job that actually cares about him. I’m tired of hearing the constant negativity about us paying bills and what not. I personally am at a loss on what else to do for him. I’m reaching the point of just saying “yes honey it’ll be okay” but I know he’d get annoyed even more. If anyone can help me figure out what to do with him, I’d appreciate it. Thank you.",11Sep2020,1

I’m not sure why but it almost gives me anxiety just thinking about it. How can I get over this and stop being so afraid of this?

967,"So I dated this girl about two years ago. Everything was great we were in love and young. Ready to do a lot of things together. And about a year ago we broke up. Of course I was sad. We both “moved on” I went through two relationships and wasn’t happy at all with them. Not their fault, it was mine. She moved onto this guy but they broke up about 2 months ago. And we reconnected. But now she’s with this new guy and he lives in the same neighborhood as me. I thought I was over her. I’m not attracted to her but I can’t bear to see her with a new guy. I don’t know what is happening",11Sep2020,1
968,"I could go on and on about it but it's pretty much what the title says. I just feel terribly isolated most of the time and I don't get it. I mean it's not like I have a reason to feel that way, I've got friends and recently started dating someone, but whenever I'm on my own or something I just feel it weight over me and it brings me down. I also feel I can't really tell anyone because I reckon it would sound stupid. I guess that's why I'm posting here, because if it actually is stupid no one actually knows me so I'm not so ashamed as I would be irl. I also sometimes feel kind of disconnected from myself if that makes sense. I mean it's as if I wasn't actually living my life but instead I was watching someone else live it and that makes me feel even lonelier. So yeah that's about it.

Any help appreciated.

Much love.",11Sep2020,1

970,"I know that if I embarrass myself or make a mistake almost everybody will forget it, or not even even notice it in the first place. I know that everyone is too busy focusing on themselves to be thinking about a small mistake someone else made. I know if someone happens to see my mistake, they either come from a place of empathy (""we've all been there before"" type of mindset) or they judge me. But if someone judges me, I know that they're probably just an asshole and I shouldn't care about what they think anyways. And I have no way of knowing what other people think of me anyways so I shouldn't worry about it. I know in order to grow, mistakes need to be made, and that all mistakes are simply learning opportunities.


So if I know all that, why do I feel so self-conscious still? I get this rise of fear and nervousness in my chest when I do something like accidentally talk over someone. I get nervous when trying new things even when everyone else is also a beginner. My body shakes and my heart races as soon as something unexpected starts to happen. Before covid I'd spend up to an hour deciding on my outfits even though most of what I wear is a t-shirt and jeans. 


Every time I see the ""no one actually cares"" stuff on reddit people comment on how it makes them feel liberated or something like that, but I'm still very nervous. I don't get it. Don't know if it's important but I'm 17F. Does anyone know why this could happen?",11Sep2020,1
971,"You don’t need to read this part, it’s just some background:

I’ve changed so much that the old me is a whole different person.  I know that old version is still me and a part of me and I’ll never try to hide that because that’s why I’m where I’m at today.  

We’ve all made mistakes, we’ve all done regretful things, we’ve all cheated in some way even if it’s minuscule, and we’ve all been jerks at some point.  I know that and I know that I can’t change that.  I know I can’t change the past and what I’ve done.  I’ve changed the way that those actions made me feel and how I act because of those past events.

I’ve cheated on homework, Ive judged people for no reason, Ive sassed people for the heck of it, I never tried to be a part of anything, I didn’t care about myself, I didn’t understand that people could get their feeling hurt, there’s so many things I’ve learned and this is just the surface. 

I can’t and don’t want to say that the person I am right now is the “final form”, the best I’ll ever be.  I want to keep learning and changing.

The hardest part is being myself around other people.  Around people I first meet, sometimes around friends, painfully around family members.  I’m so sick of the fake version of me and I feel like that’s the next thing for me to work on.

Here’s the part that would help to read:

I don’t really accept myself that easily so when I meet someone new or whatever the case where I can be myself, this fake annoying person comes out and I’m always thinking to myself, why are you doing this?  

The fake version is awful.  Overly smiley, exaggerated high voice when I have a deep monotone voice, a little too interested in what you’re saying, innocent but not in a good way.  Innocent like I’m clearly hiding something.  I have no idea why, I have no control it feels.

The very few people I have been able to be myself around right off the bat always say that I’m the chillest, coolest person they’ve met.  I like that.

How do I do that more?  I’m not sure how I did that those few times.  Is there even a possible answer that I can receive?  Is this another one I have to figure out on my own because if so, that’s okay.  I can accept that.

I got a little bit drunk and couldn't be myself in that party, I was pretty uncomfortable. And then that girl started talking to me, she was beautiful and smart and was exactly my type. We had a few conversations on and off and she seemed like a very nice person. Then I got tired of crowd and just scrolled on reddit and had a little bit of myself time. Then she came to talk again and asked me if I was okay, I said yeah I just got tired of the crowd. Then she invited me outside to talk and we had that very deep conversation and I enjoyed her company a lot. We talked about our problems and what was going on in our lives etc etc. And then she started to get cold, at first I didnt notice it and was like oh okay I guess its time to go soon. I asked her if she was cold and she was like yeah a little bit, I just talked on. Then I said that your cold we should ho back inside and she was like yeah. And then I knew what was happening, at least I think she wanted me to put my arm around her to warm her or sth but I didnt do it because I was tense.

I went there with some other guys and hide there a bit, she was there as well and rested her head on my shoulder. Then when we didnt hide anymore and the cops were gone we got down and she didnt even make eye contact with me anymore. And then I went home. What was going on? Did she like me?

976,"My bearded dragon, Nacho is a total sweetheart. Not sure of it's gender yet but for now we are using male pronouns. Anyways, he is very well behaved, has NEVER bit me, waved or bobbed his head at me. His beard has never been black anytime I look at him. His tank is in my room and I talk to him and sing/play ukulele for him. He seems to love it when I sing for him too, he nuzzles into his hammock and could listen for hours. 

He gets the correct hours of sleep depending on the season. And he eats a mix of apples, bananas, prickly pear, cactus, carrots, kale, collard greens and mustard greens. He also eats live and freeze dried crickets, live super worms, and live and freeze dried meal worms. I dust his food with calcium at least 2-3 times a week. His tank is a very good size and he's about to get a gigantic one made for him soon. So he's a pretty happy camper. 

However, he's a jumpy little thing as well. Up until a couple weeks ago he would walk into my hands and let me take him out of his cage and would hang out with me. He never really let anyone else in my family do this but I left to go to my dad's for a week and my mom took care of him. I've now been back for a week and he has been running from me a bit when I try to take him out of his tank? I feel really bad because I don't know if he's scared of me. I haven't been harsh to him at all. Granted, he was shedding when he wouldn't let me pick him up but I don't know if that has anything to do with it. When I gave him a bath he was calm. 

But when I took him out to hang he started jumping! He always jumps a bit when he's out which makes me nervous but usually when I hold him he doesn't really jump and when he does it's not to far. I mean when he jumps it gets me scared! I know he would be totally fine if he got to walk around my room with super vision but I'm totally anxious about it. I don't want him going in a crack I can't get him out of or hurting himself. I love him so very much but I'm not sure if he feels the same about me. Honestly, I haven't taken him out in a few days. I feel terrible about it but anytime I try to get him he jumps and I don't want to stress him out. 

Also, he glass surfs sometimes. He used to this because of his reflection but now I think it's because he wants out. But when I try to let him out he runs and jumps. I haven't been mean to him so it doesn't make sense of him to be scared. I don't know how to bond with him. Its so hard what do I do? Helpp",11Sep2020,1

979,"I’m living in an apartment with 4 other roommates, and some of us have agreed to go in together on an internet plan. The building we live in provides internet, but it isn’t the best, and has daily data caps (which the gamers among us aren’t fond of), so we decided to get our own. However, I have a question/concern, and I’m hoping someone on here can point me in the right direction (I tried to phone the service provider, but I was about 30th in line, so even if it’s a long shot, this could be quicker). 

The company we’ve gone with has informed me via email and voicemail that for this setup, it’s unlikely that a technician will need to enter the premises; they can do everything remotely, and then I should just hook up the modem at the end of the installation window tomorrow. However, reading through the instructions that came with the modem they sent, I’ve realized that I don’t think I can do that. There are what appear to be coaxial cables in my bedroom, the common space, and in some of the other rooms, but they’re all cut and lacking the screw-on piece that attaches to the modem (please excuse my lack of technological knowledge; it’s why I’m asking in the first place). If I’m understanding this right, no coaxial to hook the modem into = no internet connection. Is there something I can do about this, or will they have to send a technician in to install a new one? Setup is supposed to be tomorrow, and I’d really rather not have that delayed if there’s any way to avoid it (especially since I don’t have access to the building WiFi since reformatting my laptop). 

Tl;dr - my apartment has no intact coaxial cables and I’m supposed to get a new internet service hooked up tomorrow. Can I do something about it, or do I need a technician?",11Sep2020,1
980," 

basically since the start of quarantine,i stayed at home, the only time i got out of the house was when i had to travel with my mom and siblings becasue she was worried that her dad might hvae cancer( he didnt), we went back to our country and i still do the same thing, we live in a pretty shitty village, with alot of people that think that the virus is a hoax and eevrytime that i leave for a walk or to get myself some water from a grocery store ( doing all the precautions ) i get the weird looks like i am a maniac who listens to the goverment, anyway so i am afraid to go anywhere and i only go for like walks or whatever, so i am home about 22 hours a day,i spend my day studying watching streams or playing league of legends in my room, i spend about an hour a day with my family downstairs and the rest in my room.

my mom every 3rd maybe, would come to my room criticise me to death and then create a problem when i am really comfortable and leave, sometimes she would make big fights how i am the worst child ever and how i am a disgrace, she once said i am mentally ill for being introverted, in her defense she probably thougth i wouldnt care about what she screams when she is angry, but i did and it hurts me.

today was the final straw for me, she wanted some groceries so we went with the car, i went down and i asked the guy there to check me out on the stuff that i want to buy, the place was crowded and it is pretty old so only one cashier and like 5 different customers, so he checks out on random, he does it first to the people who he knows, you know what i mean, not so nice, i didnt say anything but he took alot of time to check on my stuff, after 15 minutes i went to the car and i talked to my mom over the window and asked her if her stuff wwere necessary for her right now, i said ill come by again later to get her those stuff becasue i was pretty pissed from the bad service, she screams at me that she needs them by tomorrow, i go back and i ask him to check me in on my stuff and he finally does it and apologise, i go to the car and she was lecturing about how i shouldve checked in faster and maybe even shout at the guy, now whether this is right or not, i told her to stop lecturing because honestly i dont want to have a fight with her now, no tune i am pretty sure of this, she doesnt say anything else, we go home and she starts again, i listened to her as she finished nodded my head and walked to my room without replying, i was pretty pissed, she comes back later before going to bed, says i dont wish for my son to be like this, like you dont care aboutt the house youdont care about anyeone and all that talk and leave, i walk to her to calm her down and she refuses to talk to me, i followed her and after a couple of i dont want to talk to you, i leave her alone and go to my room.

my sister comes in, says i am in thw wrong here, says i am eating my siblings rights in the house and i only care about myself,we have a little talk and then she says, spending one day a week with your grandparents is too low and you are an asshole, i told her no i am not, my mom sleeps at my grandparents 4 days a week and its no secret that i hate sleeping there yet she takes me with her like a toddler, she says you cant show them that you dont like going there, i never scream or get angry with anyone often so no i did not show any obvious sign, in the end she says so what only your satisfaction and comfort matter to you and i said yes, she stormed out of the door, and i said under my breath just get off my ass, yeah maybe i shouldnt have said it, but i didnt intend for her to hear that, she came back angry and swore she wont talk to me.

my mom is pretty controlling, i dont wanna talk more about her because you guys cant hear her side of the story and it wouldbe biased but i cant wait to go to my unis and quit living with my family, i honestly dont know anymore.

like so what if i stay in my room alot? i spend a little time daily with my family, i dont like sitting with them much becasue, they are unbearable, they like to talk about stuff that dont interest me and i dont like talking about them, and if ididnt share in the conversation she would also get mad about how i am not sharing with the family, i do any chore asked of me and i personally dont see what i can do right now.

as of this moment i am not planning on talking to any of my family for a while, i honeslty think i hate them but i am not sure.

for context, i live in a small village, so alot of people didnt go to schools here, and before the pandemic, if i were to hang out of the house 21 hours of the day, my mom wouldnt have minded at all, but it looks like the thought of me being alone in my room is what pisses her off, i sometimes go out of the house pretend to go on a walk and just sit alone, i know atleast i wont be judged for it.

sorry about my english, this whole thing just happened and i tried my best to translate from my og langauge to english and i did so without changing much to avoid bias.

if anyone is to reply, ill reply back in the morning after i wake up its pretty late for me, i know my story is nothing compared to other out here but i need some help, thank you guys",11Sep2020,1

So if anyone has every sold a car to this company can I please ask that you answer the following for me if you would be so kind;

-how you found the website for your initial price estimate
-when they called you to get you in for your vehicle assessment how did you find that process?
-was it a fairly easy process to do or did you discover any issues along the way?
-did you feel pushed into the sale or were you able to make this decision of your own accord?
-how did you find the overall experience? Good? Bad? 
-would you consider using the company again?

Later he casually mentioned how he will start looking for dates irl and all that. I was upset and told him and ceased all romantic talks. Only platonic. We went on off there with romantic stuff because it was hard to not get back into romantic routine. I even organised a date and we enjoyed. 2 days later we had a fight and he said ily and to discontinue talking from then. I agreed but out of grief and missing, texted him a week later. It was very awkward and he kept ignoring me. I asked him if that's his sign for me to stop texting but he said he's busy. This continued for 2 week when i asked again, he said he didn't wanna talk. I quit talking.
After a month he slid into my DMs. He kept stalking me on social media tho during that whole month. We soon started talking platonic. 3 weeks in he told me about him crushing on some other girl. I was upset and lied about me dating too but told him I don't wanna listen to his crush talks. After a while he apologised for treating me badly those 2 weeks. 
Now I see him simping for that girl on twitter ( she's from another country , just as far as me from his country)

991,"I'd love to hear some opinions as I am feeling a bit discouraged. I did the assessment and noticed that I was low in conscientiousness and high in some other undesirable traits. A bit of background on myself, I am a 21-year-old female. My main goals in life are to have children, create a small business, buy a home/farm in a small town, continue to work on personal growth, and travel. I would like a pretty simple life you could say. I am much more family-oriented than business-oriented. I am diagnosed with ADHD. I deal with Anxiety &amp; OCD, and I am healing from sexual/emotional childhood trauma. Based on those few things my big 5 results seemed quite typical, although some of which I didn't quite agree with. I do feel quite discouraged by my results and feel very driven to improve some of which I disagree with. It's frustrating to see that things out of my control have created personality traits in myself that I do not want. I do fear that I am stuck with these traits that I do not want. I've listed below my results. In all honesty, I am just looking for support and a bit of guidance to help me overcome my adversity. I want to come to a place of acceptance.

**Agreeableness ( 90th )**: I'm not too bothered by this one.

**Compassion ( 95th )**: I am happy with this.

**Politeness ( 71st )**: No issue with this.

**Conscientiousness ( 15th )**: I am very unhappy with this one. I would say I'm a fairly driven person but I find that my ADHD and trauma symptoms get in the way of me achieving some goals. Most people would say I am a very driven person. This result makes me feel embarrassed, sad and hopeless.

**Industriousness ( 8th )**: This is an embarrassing result as well. I do not wish to be like this and it has always been a struggle. It is not a lack of trying.

**Orderliness ( 36th )**: I really enjoy order and routine to a point. I would like to increase this because I struggle with being late and keeping order. I feel that it is important that I improve this before I have kids.

**Extraversion ( 92nd ):** I see no issue with this although I've always considered myself to be an introvert. I enjoy being alone and get quite drained being around big groups. I have a small group of friends and prefer it that way. I would consider myself to be an ambivert.

**Enthusiasm ( 96th )**: I am happy with this. I think this part of my personality makes me a very fun and enjoyable person to be around.

**Assertiveness ( 73rd )**:  I scored higher than I would have anticipated. I am typically very easy going but I don't let people push me past my boundaries. I am happy with this result.

**Neuroticism ( 99th )**:  This would explain my struggles with mental health. I would obviously really like to change this. Although I score high in neuroticism I am typically a very happy and optimistic person. I think the combination of the 2 makes me fairly balanced.

**Withdrawl ( 97th )**:  I feel somewhat indifferent about this result. It would be beneficial for me to lower this aspect of myself.

**Volatility ( 99th )**:  I would definitely want to lower this. I struggle with my emotional stability. This is a trait that is important for me to change before I have kids.

**Openness to experience ( 64th )**: Not much to say about this one. I am happy with the result.

**Intellect ( 23rd )**: This is one that I would like to change. I was surprised by the result as I was expecting myself to be higher in intellect.  I would consider myself to be quite intellectual as well as many others. I very much enjoy the complexity and find simple things boring. This result does embarrass me.

**Openness ( 90th )**: This result does not bother me. Although I would prefer to bring it towards the middle as that seems more stable.

I greatly appreciate any feedback you may have. Any advice from others who have healed from childhood trauma. As well as advice from those with ADHD would be very helpful. Thank you.",11Sep2020,1
992,"I put a ""?"" because I'm not sure if my brother could even be considered abusive. For clarity, my brother has severe adhd. He can't form full sentences or understand full sentences; we have to talk to him like he's 3. 

Anyways he's been like this since he was little. Getting into fights all of the time and stuff. At first it seemed like a thing any kid would do, but he's 15 now. I'm scared that he will grow up into someone terrible in the future. 

I don't have many examples due to my bad memory; but one thing I can remember is when he threw a butter knife at me. It hit the top of my forehead and left a scar. I bled out like crazy and almost died. He also stabbed my sister in the back (It didn't go super deep) and hit her multiple times, on multiple days, with a stick that left bruises. He also broke the leg of our old puppy Sammy. (She's hopefully in a safer home now)

Today he wanted my other brother to take a metal pipe upstairs (Not sure why?) He didn't and my younger brother got angry. I was near the stairs and saw the first blow, he hit him so hard that he crashed into the wall. My younger brother is super short, but he is way too strong for his age. He continued to hit him with multiple items he found laying around. I tried to break them apart but he hit me with a brush. It left a bruise on my lip. (Y'know how anime cat girls have that fang on their tooth? My bruise looked like that-) Obviously I fought back but didn't get many hits in, because my older brother was protecting him. My older and younger brother are complete opposites. My younger brother is a spoiled brat who will destroy everything (No joke, with have multiple broken doors + walls..) and my older brother is the kindest guy you'll ever meet. How is it possible?

Anyways, later after the fight I was shit talking about my younger brother. (It's a pain writing younger, but I want to clarify) I didn't mean the most of it, but my dad told me to calm down. How?!? He does this almost everyday and you're gonna tell me to calm down? You should be trying to calm him down! I can't believe how they're so ok with this?? If anything they supply his anger. They buy him anything he wants as long as he doesn't kill anybody. And the things he want are abusive games that probably get to his head. He curses all of the time while playing this game it's annoying. He is so disrespectful, especially to the ones who can tolerate or even actually love him somehow? My mom and my older brother show him nothing but respect, and all he does is curse and hit them. It's painful to watch. I have to hug my mother everytime I see her hurt to tell her it's gonna be ok. Hell, I'm trying to get a job right now and I'm 16 fucking years old.

I'm sorry if this whole story sounds like bullshit or something, but how? How do I deal with him? How do I make him a better person? Not just for me, but for my family, and other people who will be in his life soon. How? Please help..

P.s. Sorry for my language I'm just super upset..

I will also probably delete this soon, because this is very personal.",11Sep2020,1
993,"Hi all,

Sorry if I’m posting in the wrong place but am relatively new to Reddit.

In May/June time of this year during a conversation with an ‘acquaintance’ (not a friend per se, more a person I know) they mentioned that their dog required emergency surgery but they were struggling to afford it. Being an dog lover I felt compelled to offer to loan them the money. They offered to pay it back in full on their next pay day. However, as they are a young family with children and owing to the amount ($500), I did not want to leave them without so I asked they pay it back at $50 a week, for which they were extremely grateful.

They paid the $50 for the first three weeks but then approached me and asked if they could miss a week owing to it being a child’s birthday. I agreed and they paid the $50 the following week. They again approached me and advised they were struggling again so I told them not to worry about paying until they could afford it next. They again apologised for the following two weeks but then have not paid/approached me/apologised etc. since. It has been around 6 weeks now.

Whilst I do not want them to go without or struggle especially for the children’s sakes nor do I want to make them feel awkward or put upon I am concerned that if I do not address with them, that I may never get my money back. I feel by them not advising me that they are unable to pay or even offering a ‘goodwill gesture’ like $10/$20 just to show that they are still going to pay it off, they are hoping I will either forget or metaphorically, wipe the slate clean.

Any advice on how to approach this without causing them embarrassment , offence or upset would be greatly appreciated.",11Sep2020,1

I’ve been talking to this girl alottt recently for quite some time now. 

We were childhood friends back in the day, lost contact for a long time. But for the past month or so we’ve been talking a lot and getting closer

When we talked about a relationship she said she has been hurt before and has bad experiences and wants to take things slow and let’s see where things go. 

Since then she’s started sending me “good morning!” texts and stuff like that....

Here’s the thing tho....she’s alwaaayysss talking about other guys and it makes me question the whole thing and makes me feel like I’m being used. Part of me feels like shes just using me cause she likes the attention.",11Sep2020,1

1001,"Hey, this is my throwaway/anonymous profile for advice so what’s up! I’m 19 M and I just graduated high school this past year (yes, class of covid. hardy har har lol) and over this quarantine I felt like Ive gotten a taste of a the real world when in comes to friendships where you see who your real friends are and who are really gonna ride with you through life. 

For the sake of privacy I’ll call my best friend James. Me and James have known each other for 5 years now and got really really close about a year and half ago. I mean we’re like brothers and family, He’s has had me over at his house plenty of times, his family loves me, I love them. Our friend group is pretty tight knit and super real. And best of all, me and James relate to each other on a lot of personal and political topics so we kinda share the same brain. We don’t share a lot of common interests, I’m the art guy who doesn’t really work out and he’s the soccer guy who loves fitness, but we both adore Disney lol. 

James has always been more of a private person and doesn’t really open up about his personal life. He is a total class clown and was the hype man at my high school and everyone loved him there. But he has opened up to me about things like hating the attention because these people don’t truly care for him as a person and only what he brings to them. He’s opened up to me about a couple family and personal things and we got through a couple rough times together. Basically, he’s just not very open, and I can tell he has a lot of pain he feels he has to keep private, and while I don’t think keeping your pain hidden is best I am sensitive to the fact he’s not ready or may never open up. I try to be a good friend and influence by always supporting his goals in soccer (his dream is to go pro) and also giving affirmations like how it’s okay to be vulnerable and get help if he needs it, it’s helped and he’s actually opened up a few times but he’s the type of guy who’s the mans man and thinks vulnerability is weakness ... even though you can see in his eyes sometimes he wants give in, but rejects people who try to get too close.

The problem for me comes up where our friendship feels one sided. Throughout our school years I can count on both hands the amount of times he’s texted me first about important things or just having fun talking out of the many times I’ve contacted him for similar reasons. And in school as well he doesn’t come up to me often to talk to me. Yet he has told me he really appreciates when I talk, reach out, ask him how he’s doing...but he never really does the same to me or tries to ask how I’m really feeling. It feels like some disconnected relationship where I give give give and I get a squirt of affection in return. I know he is short spoken and extremely private but it has hurt me and feels like his words don’t match his actions. He also has anger issues that people in our high school have actually feared him for. Nothing violent, but he gets really agitated really quickly over small things. And when I’ve tried to talk to him about his personal things in life, being careful not to pry much, that has set him off. And then he acts like it never happened and starts a different conversation or shows me a meme..????? Especially when it’s something serious over text he will straight up ignore me if he doesn’t want to talk about it. And I’ve going through a hard time right now with mental health and I tried to find support in him by sending a text and he just didn’t respond because he said “it made him uncomfortable”. But when he confided in my for things in the past I was open arms.

Now within the past few months, we’ve been the closest ever before graduation. And then when we graduated we call to check in on eachother and our conversations end flat because he just doesn’t open up and he give one word answers for everything. “How’s family?” “Good” “How have you been?” “Fine” “oh okay well how’s the school search ?” “It’s alright” ...and I just feel like giving up...
Other close friends and teachers that have known him told me to give up and that he’s got his own issues to deal with. Even if he still cares for me, the fact he doesn’t show it at all is toxic. 

So Reddit, should I let them go ? :(",11Sep2020,1

I need advice on how to become better at confrontation is what I'm trying to say.

For example i just had an argument with my sister, i spent 2 hours cleaning the kitchen and then she comes in puts a dish in the sink and tells me that she will do it tomorrow si i ask her if she can do it now since i had just cleaned she started yelling at me saying what difference does it make if she does it now or later and tells me what did i even do to the kitchen basically saying that it doesn't look any different while it looked like a pile of shit before and she started telling me well i do this amd that and bla bla bla 
We all do stuff around the house i choose not to always say i do this and that but she always says what she does making me look like i don't do anything infront of my family she keeps making remarks if i have my headphones on or if i was focused on something and didn't hear them or if i got scared amd jumped
She constantly makes remarks like that and wehn i try amd confront her i forget everything and if i remember she makes me forget by turing the blame on methat i yelled at her when I'm 100% sure i didn't and she tells me it was my fault when i asked her to clean her plate how ? Idk 
Or when i tell her how she yelled at me when i asked she tells me well you yelled at me back 
Or but you kept throwing the pmate and bumping into stuff hard she tells me well you later slammed the door.
Which is not true since i was holding alot of stuff and could barely open it so if i did i didn't do it on purpose. 
The point is she turns the blame on me bad mouths me to my family and they believe her without hearing my side of the story and expects me to later be the oneto apologise to her so does my family. 
Idk what to do to be able and remember what i want to say it's weighting on me and i feel horrible and sad and alone to have no one to talk to about it.

1012,"Hey. So I’ve had this on my mind and I’m not sure how to deal with it.
 
I have dealt with emotional/psychological issues most of my life and didn’t start college consistently until I was 21 (almost 22 at that point). I began at a community college. For the time I was there, everything was fine socially. I related to most people my age and younger, up until my last semester at age 24.
 
It was at this time I decided I wanted to transfer to a university out of state. Here’s where the possible fuck-up was.
 
I transferred to a school out of state and got along with people there, started to make friends etc. However, I decided to bail early because the school was expensive and it just didn’t feel right to me for some reason. I spent the rest of the year working and went back to school at a new college. Same situation, related to most people (I was 25 at this point), though I noticed a definite disconnect with freshman students. “Oh well.” I thought. I was far from a freshman at this point anyway.
 
So COVID happened, school went online. I decided to transfer again to a new college that had some on campus instruction.
 
However, when I arrived to campus after Summer, I noticed that everyone I see looks like kids. I have this feeling like I’ve officially aged out of college. Like, some switch in my brain went off during the summertime.
 
It’s scaring me, because I’m 25 (gonna be 26 in about a month) and I still have about 2 years of college left. I wanted to transfer earlier, around Spring of 2019, but I really wanted to get into the school that fit me, and that could offer the real “college experience” so-to-speak. Especially after being at a commuter school for so long. But I’m worried that in my indecisive quest of looking for this type of school, I unknowingly and ironically aged out socially.
 
If this is true, I don’t know what to do with this info. My old friends at community college were 4/5 years younger than me often, and I still spent time and had fun with them. Though at the time I was 24 and they were 19-21, so the gap was admittedly small.
 
What freaked me out a bit was seeing to responses to the dating thread on here, and how people felt like they matured a lot between their early and mid-twenties.
 
But I guess I’m curious: Can I still make this work socially? Or did I royally screw up?
 
What’s worse is I was thinking of taking this semester off and transferring back to the first school next semester, as I could save up enough money for it. I’m just worried the people there originally might be gone, and I’d be in a pool of younger people I can’t relate to anymore.

1024,"So, last Friday was kind the day that everything came to a head. It's a bit of a long story, bear with me.

So, I've been working in retail for a year now, taking some time off from college. The department I work is an overall sh** show, but I transferred intonit in December because I like a challenge. For months I really did enjoy the job, but the job is certainly not built to be endured for long periods. (We have an extremely high turnover rate for a reason). 

As the months went on I began feeling like I was burning out, in fact most of my coworkers were feeling that, but we kept hanging in there for each other, for the team. The turn over rate sky rocketed, everyone started quitting or just calling in or not showing up, but the workload stayed the same some weeks and increased in other weeks. To put in perspective we are supposed to have a 40 member team per day, and the last couple of weeks we've had as low as 6 people for a whole day, with a 40 person workload. The job and the people working it was coming to a breaking point. 

Well, that's pretty much what happened for me on Friday. I broke down at work. I broke down sobbing (believe me I really tried to hold it back). The stress and the fact that nothing was improving, became unbearable. I cried and cried but I worked to the best of my ability through the day. My manager was pissed, it was a 6 person staffing day and she was just furious that I couldn't keep shouldering 200% efficiency after months of running at 200% above and beyond what I could do. 

Up to this point my life outside of work had already fallen apart. The only thing I got out of bed for, was to go to work. My apartment was a disaster, my friends and family hadn't seen in forever, I never answered the phone, and I only showered if it was a work day. Work was the last rung of the latter the fall for me. So, when I broke down at work, it came as a small suprise to me, but a huge suprise to my coworkers. I was putting everything I had left into work. I had the highest productivity metrics and perfect attendance and had sacrificed my life outside of the job to keep that up. 

Anyway, I finished my shift on Friday. I called in the next day, had my two scheduled days off and then called in again. I was a disaster the whole time, crying, sleeping, eating is what those days off consisted of. On Wednesday I still felt like crap, but I pressured myself to go into work. When I got there my manager had taken me out of my normal position, every bone of composure I had to get there fell. I hadn't even got a chance to talk about the situation, or what had happened or how it got to that point before they made a decision. Unfortunately in my fragile state of mind I muffled a cry and headed to personnel.

In personnel I explained the situation, and she understood. She gave me some options and said we can work something out the next day, and I could go home for the day if I needed. I went home, worked on gathering myself for the next day.

Well, the next day the same personnel lady did a 180. Was not supportive or understanding, anymore. Said I did not have any options she said I had the day before. We talked with my manager, and my manager interrupted me at every turn. How can we find solutions, and work towards bettering the department if she doesn't even want to listen to what the problems are??

After the talk I feel devastated and hopeless. I also feel guilty and ashamed for missing work for my health. I am faced with returning to work tomorrow, but I don't know how to handle it. I don't know what to do from here. Does anyone have some advice to get through it?

(FYI I am in the process of looking for another job, but with COVID jobs are not very abundant, so the hunt is taking a lot of time.)",11Sep2020,1
1025,"I’m currently enrolled in an in- state university and will have zero debt after I graduate. I am thinking about transferring this spring semester to an out of state school because their programs are better and they are well known institution. I would be attending DePaul University in Chicago. What I really want to do is be a film editor, I know I can learn this on my own but I have 0 self motivation to do so. They don’t offer a film program at my current university, and DePaul is one of the top programs in the country for it. Editing has about a 11% growth so I’m not too worried about not finding a job but the minimum amount per year I would be making is about 32,000 and the average amount around 52,000. The amount of debt id be in with interest is 55,866 dollars and I would pay $466 a month for about ten years.

1026,"Sorry if my english is terrible it's my second language... okay, so there's this guy I like and he knows I like him we've made a pact that once I'm my goal weight we will hook up because we are interested in each other. But here's my question I don't worry about the not wanting to hook up until I'm my goal weight because obviously everyone has their preferences. My worry is he knows how much I like him and even though he has not said anything about liking me more then a friend we spend everyday talking like legit everyday for hours, he doesn't want me to get rid of the romantic feelings I have towards him because according to him ""we don't know what the future holds "" he is younger then me by 3 years don't know if that's valid I'm 24 his 21. Back to the question he enjoys the control he has over me because I like him this much like I'd drop anything if he asks, and I make a lot of money and apparently gifts are his ""love language"" and I like spending money on people. But he always talks about other girls or his previous experiences with girls yet he doesn't want me to be with another guy until we meet up when I'm my goal weight but I have no idea if he's seeing other girls during this. I'm scared that his using me for my money and that's why he doesn't want me to change my feelings because he knows the hold he has over me... so my question is, is this guy using me or am I just overthinking shit?",11Sep2020,1

1029,"hi. I’m a 17 year old girl, I’m turning 18 next month. I have $0 to my name, no license or car. I was planning to get my GED next month because I never finished high school. I have always had a rocky relationship with my parents, but this year has been absolute hell. They’ve said despicable things to me in the heat of the moment during arguments- they wish I would kill myself, they’re counting down the days till I’m 18 so they can kick me out, they wish they just aborted me like they were considering in the beginning, stuff like that. My mom has told me that I’m below her (verbatim) and that she’s gone through way worse than I have so I have no excuse to be depressed. I despise her for the things she has said to me over the years. My stepdad used to beat the shit out of me for years and only stopped because my mom threatened to leave him, so I resent him. All in all I’ve stopped trying. I’ve kissed ass for years, tried to talk things out, woman to woman, human to human, when that didn’t work I tried standing up for myself, fighting back, it seems that no matter what I do, I lose. I’ve accepted that I will never win.
I tried to kill myself a couple hours ago. My mother and I got in another fight where she was screaming and telling me that after all of these years of trying to get me help for my bipolar depression, she’s tired of me still being a “shitshow”. Ive never felt more useless or ready to leave than I did in that moment. I never get used to hearing those things. Even if it happens every day. It’s always a nasty slap in the face. I sat sobbing on my bedroom floor for what felt like forever, talking to myself and saying my goodbyes to everyone I know (not directly, just out loud to myself) holding this big ass knife trying to gather the courage to actually use it. She walked in on this and got so pissed. And then ensued more screaming about how I’m just trying to guilt her, everything is about me, and the dramatic gesture would not work on her. She took the knife from me and I sat there feeling empty, I had no idea what to do anymore. I couldn’t even die. 
A little bit later I go out to the kitchen to get some water, and it’s right next to her bedroom. The door is locked but I can hear her loudly sobbing on the phone talking to my stepdad, telling him how tired of me she is, and how she doesn’t want to wait for the next 3 weeks to kick me out. I get up against the door and he’s on speaker phone. I hear him say that they don’t actually have to wait. If I’m going to be this terrible, they can do something about it now.
Idk what that meant. My first thought was that they were sending me to my grandparents house. She comes out of her room and says, “you win. You fucking win. Figure out a place to stay and we will book you the one-way ticket to Chicago.”
For some background info, we moved to Florida from a small suburb about an hour outside of Chicago two years ago. All of my friends are there. I really have nothing here, I never got a job or joined a group or made a single friend, but I’ve kept in close contact with all of my amazing friends in Illinois. I’m not too scared. I have a place to sleep. I have 3 different friends who are offering to let me stay with them, and I’m extremely close with two out of three of those friends, so it’s not extremely uncomfortable. The one I’m probably staying with is a long-term friend, I’ve known her for 6 years now, we’re like sisters. I’m extremely lucky and grateful to have a plan B. But it’s not ideal... as the minutes tick by, more and more complications arise in my head. I don’t live cheaply. I rely on lots of things- I take 3 different types of antidepressants, I have a therapist, I need contacts to see because I’m legally blind. Like I said I don’t have a car or a license, so as much as I wish it would be as easy as just getting a job up there and saving to move out, how will I get to it? How will I even have the money for drivers lessons to get my license if I don’t have the license to get to a job to make that money? Even for things like my GED, that costs money, I cannot live my life without a high school equivalent. It’s not super expensive, but it costs. There’s just so much and I’m freaking out. And I’m going to miss my dogs so much, and having my own room. And how will I even get my belongings from Florida to Illinois? I have so many books I still haven’t read, $500+ worth of books,  a lot of other shit that I can’t fit in one bag and board onto a plane. Not a TON of shit, not a lot of big things, I don’t NEED any of my furniture.. but there’s a LOT of small stuff, and my parents are so done with me I know they won’t pay hundreds of dollars for a mover to transport my things. So I’m gonna have to let go of a lot. 
It’s sad that Right now I’m mostly just excited for a way out. Living with bipolar depression, every day was a fight just to feel okay. And every time I felt like I was kind of getting the hang of it, I’d get screamed at and told I was worthless and all this shit about how I make life for everyone else a living hell. I’m scared but I just have to work my ass off. I really just don’t know how I’m going to pull everything off. There’s so much now that I have to figure out. God it’s just a lot. Any advice helps, I’m so lost. At least I’m getting out though. It’s so far from ideal but at least I’ll be staying with people who love me and don’t tell me that I’m a burden to them.",11Sep2020,1
1030,"Yo! I’m a competitive powerlifter and my coach is honestly one of the dopest guys out there, Super impressive programming, shit is legit. Anyway, to make things short we have “phases”, I pay him a lot of money and although he helps me with a lot of stuff outside of strictly power lifting, it’s really frustrating- whenever I get my programming and workouts/diet for a phase it’s all good for about the next month and a half or so, but as soon as it rolls around to the next time and I ask for it he will send me like work out by work out, and sometimes he’s not available so I don’t get my individual workouts. 

He tells me 4-5 times, yo gonna do emails tonight, going to send emails in the morning etc... but it takes like two weeks for him to actually get them to me when we chat everyday! And he will bring up stuff like “Bro you have the work out you’re all set” and stuff to put me off. He’s a great dude and we have a great relationship but this shit is so damn frustrating!

1031,"So for the past 6 years I've been plagued by extreme acne. There's days where it's better than normal, but for the past 2 years it just seems to only be getting worse. I already have permanent scarring on my face and I've come to terms with that, but I'm so done with having bad skin. It's one of my biggest insecurities right now. I've tried quite a couple of medical treatments, but in the end they didn't change much. Now my question is to the people who've had acne and have gotten rid of it. How did you deal with it and in the end manage to get rid of it?",11Sep2020,1
1033,"Four years ago, my family came home with two Weimaraners. Their names are Gunther and Stella, and they have been the best family dogs that I have ever come to know. Little did we know, getting 2+ dogs at the same time causes them to form a pack mentality, and they are extremely protective of each other. Because of this, neither of them like guests, and we usually have to gate them on the other side of the house when we have company over.

Most dogs give warning bites, but Gunther is not one of those dogs. He has a history of bites, which makes things all the worse because he loves us more than anything else and he just wants to keep us and Stella safe. Two weeks ago, some contractors came over to the house, and one of them didn't mention that he was bringing his son over. My mom thought that since the dogs had recently gotten better with guests, they would love to interact with a child who had a lab at home and was familiar with medium-sized dogs. Stella sniffed him first and ended up sticking her nose in his butt, which of course caused the child to react. Gunther, whose primary motive in life is to keep Stella safe, ended up biting a child on the leg through a muzzle, and he had to get 7 stitches. After that, my dad made the appointment to put Gunther down.

Fast forward to this week. I made it back Saturday night from college to spend some time with Gunther, and he is just as loving as I remember. Every single morning he paws my door open just to kiss my face until I get up, and he will go for minutes if I don't get up fast enough. He is so goofy and loving and just wants to protect those he cares about. This isn't to disregard any of his dangerous behavior, but given that we know about his tendency to bite, we should have certainly made greater accommodations to make sure that he wouldn't be given the opportunity to bite anyone.

We gave him the best last week we could, and the morning of his appointment (he was scheduled for 2 pm) we gave him a pancake and cinnamon roll, took him, Stella, and our beagle Maisy for a walk, and played with him outside until we had to give him his sedative.

By the time we made it to the vet, the sedative had worn down or it simply was never strong enough. He was walking around on his leash and kept pawing at the doors of the building. It was very easy to tell that he didn't want to be there. By the time the vet came in, every person in the family was crying. This just made him even more anxious, confused, and scared, and it was very easy to see it in his eyes. By the time they were giving him another sedative, you could see the fear and betrayal in his eyes, like he was saying ""please don't do this to me. I don't want to go."" I had never in my life seen such agony in a dog's eyes, and I don't think I ever will again. After the sedative, he was given the euthanasia and breathed his last breath. The way he looked at me in his final moments will easily scar me for life, which isn't much compared to the sentence we gave him.

I am a huge believer that the last moments of anyone's life are the most important, as they are the ones that they will remember most before they fade into eternity. I don't believe that an afterlife exists, or at least the cliche that he's out running in a field full of flowers and happiness, but I also don't want to be wrong in Pascal's Wager and ignore his existence if it is there. I can't undo the hurt I have helped give to the one who trusted and loved us more than anything, and I have no way to let him know how sorry I am. 

I understand that worse tragedies than this occur every single day, but this one hits as close to home as possible. I'm vegan since I don't want to be responsible for the killing and suffering of animals that don't want to suffer and/or die, and yet the one I cared about more than any other suffered one of the only fates I didn't want for him to have. 

Every dog we've had before had gone because of old age, and they knew it was their time  (usually they would outright stop eating, and we knew). This time, the dog was in the prime of his life, and just wanted to fight for his life and protect us. We were the ones who held him in place as he was given a lethal dosage, even though he was screaming for help in a language we can't hear. 

Does anyone out there have advice on how to move on from tragedies like this? I don't want to be cold and callous and just downplay the situation, especially since there's no way to prove whether or not some form of him still exists or not (and if none does exist, that's even worse). I understand he was a dangerous dog, and that was why he had to be put down, but I don't think I could ever forget the way he looked at me with such agony in his final moments of life.",11Sep2020,1
1034,"As mentioned above, I had a dream about my ex-boyfriend in high school this morning. We dated on and off for almost 2 years before he moved away.  You could say he was my first love and when he left, I went in a super dark place. It took me almost 3 years to move on...it sucked but I had to let him go. It's been 6 years since we've broken up and I honestly don't think about him much. 




Anyways, fast forward 3 years later. I started dating someone new and I've been the happiest I've been in a long time. Everything has been amazing besides our occasional disagreements. However, I had a dream about my ex-boyfriend. It took me by surprise and when I woke up, I was in total panic mode. My boyfriend works super early so he wasn't there when I woke up. 




The dream was at my old house. He was there playing football. Then the dream switched to our old school and we walked by each other in the hallway. We never said anything but we looked at each other. Then the dream switched back to my old house again...he had a bag and was leaving. I ran up to him and told him I love him and always had. He starting crying and told me that he still loves me too...but he doesn't know why. I begged him not to go but he said he had to...he was on probation. I went to kiss him goodbye but he pulled away from me. I remember looking back and he started crying harder...then I woke up. *I know the dream is pretty vague but I tried to write down what I remember as much as possible*




I have thought about this all day. I don't know why but I feel so shitty for still thinking about it while I'm dating someone. Am I a bad person for dreaming of my ex? Should I tell my boyfriend? I don't know what to do but I really needed to get this off my chest. I would appreciate any kind of advice, please.",11Sep2020,1
1035,"(21/F) It's been 5 months since me and my ex (now bff) decided to end our 7 year relationship and ever since then, you know, I've been going through the classic breakup phases. Feeling shit some days feeling untouchable the other days. 

There's also this guy that's SUPER into me and has been for a year and counting. He was also somewhat the reason to why we ended the previous relationship with my ex in the sense that he made me REALIZE that I wasn't in love with my ex anymore and that things weren't as ""ok"" as I thought they were. 

Moving on...

I'm pretty into this guy? and we've been talking ever since the break-up, he has been there for me emotionally and I really needed that during the time but then we had these on and off moments because I kept on telling him that I didn't want to use him to get over my prev relationship and blablabla, he said it was okay and stuff blablabla BUT COMING TO THE MAIN ISSUE, I know that what I probably need is as much alone time as needed. I ALWAYS want to be in a relationship and I don't know why! Insecurities maybe? WHO KNOWS. What I do know is that I want a healthy relationship and for that, I need to be in a healthy mindset. 

SO, how df do I stop myself whenever I feel the electricity with this guy. I am always drawn to him cuz he gives me the attention I CRAVE as well. I don't even know why I like him!!! I find him very attractive and don't like the idea of him talking to others yet I know that our communication isn't that great and he is kind of immature, more immature than me at least yet each time I tell him that we shouldn't speak or we need time, I JUST WANT TO TEXT HIM. I wish I had the will power to just NOT feel that way all the time and it's really making me feel shit. 

How do I control this urge? Hobbies, movies, friends and family aren't doing it for me, I'm not getting distracted, he is always on my mind!!",11Sep2020,1
1036,"So this is a bit of a long story but about 10 years ago, I was flirting with this guy (lets call him Tim). I kind of knew Tim IRL from school but most of our interactions were over the internet. Tim and I never went on any dates but we talked and unfortunately pictures were sent. This lasted maybe two weeks until Tim started showing up at random places when I did like where I got breakfast before work and the store that I go after work, I had never seen him in these places before during these times but suddenly it was an every day thing. It wasn't until I saw him sitting in his truck (never getting out) at the pizza place I went to on Fridays that I thought, something isn't okay. After that, I started to distance myself from him and started getting texts about how I'm late for work (my car was parked elsewhere, also I never told him my work schedule and my work place is a secluded place) or asking why I wasn't grabbing food in the morning or who I was hanging out with at the coffee shop. Maybe I overreacted but to go from never seeing Tim to twice-three times a day was off. I gently started to ghost this guy by deleting my whole online presence, getting a new job, moving and getting a new phone number. Any time I would see him and he would ask about this stuff, I would come up with a logical excuse and it worked. He later went on to some other girl.

Fast forward to now. I have gotten married, I have two amazing step children and one biological daughter, let's call her Sally. 2019, we moved back to my small hometown to be closer to my parents. Tim during this time never crossed my mind, that was until I started hearing about a boy named Conner (not real name). Sally started saying this kid Conner tells her everyday that they will get married. My first instinct was that's kind of cute. Sally was in 2nd grade and Conner was in 1st. Things began to get a little bit more intense when Conner would scream as loud as he could if anyone would sit next to Sally and he couldn't sit next to her on the bus. He would call her names or threaten her when she wouldn't play during recess. When he found out that Sally had a crush on another little boy, he attacked him with a pencil. After I found out all of that, I spoke with the principal and they were going to take care of things but the next week, covid hit bad and schools were cancelled. Not sure anything was done because, you know, no school.

I never connected Conner and Tim (Tim has a common last name) until when I was grabbing supplies for remote learning and there they were together. To my knowledge, Tim would not have known that Sally was my daughter but I guess I'm wrong idk. Anyways, Tim walked up to me, said his son had something to ask me and Conner asked me to marry my daughter. Tim followed that up with saying I always knew we would end up together. I informed Conner that we don't let Sally date and quickly walked away. I went straight to the office and asked if Conner's family had been made aware of the situation with Sally and they had. So that was weird.

Fast forward to now. Sally sits with her older brother (my step son) on the bus. Conner informed her Monday that he still loves her and him and his dad walked by our house everyday during covid. Apparently she turned white and started crying, her brother told him to sit back down and leave her alone. Every school day since, Conner has informed her that he loves watching her. I don't know what to do. I don't know if Tim is encouraging Conner to bug Sally. I don't know if my past experiences are freaking me out and I'm overreacting. It's all bizarre and I just want to keep my daughter safe. Help?",11Sep2020,1

On an unrelated note, we’re in highschool atm, and in middle school we won an election for best artist together. pretty storybook sort of thing to happen. 
Anyway, we’re close as friends, so telling her I liked her wasn’t incredibly difficult, and it hasn’t impacted my friendship. But, I can’t entirely imagine it working out in the long term. I can’t, but I also can’t imagine her liking another person, so I’m a bit indecisive. I mean, I like her because of her personality, that’s how we became friends in the first place, but she does look nice too. It’s between “man.. she’s perfect,” to “will this really work?”
It might not, I dunno. First romantic experience for me. I’m a bit of a jealous type apparently. Writing this, I think I came it the conclusion of just going for it.

1042,"So for full context. I’m 20M, and a couple months ago my girlfriend 19F broke up with me because she wasn’t attracted to me in a sexual way. We were together for about 5 months and I was fully conscious to be respectful of her and her body and to not objectify her and everything but at the same make her feel beautiful. I completely fell for this girl but she’s in hindsight a pretty self centered person who didn’t really care about how I was doing the whole relationship, which was something her own family warned me about. Anyways. After the relationship I’m still a virgin, which doesn’t bother me all too much, but I’ve always had a certain way about me where I don’t want to just have casual encounters and all that because I want to feel something for the person I’m with.

1043,"My 5 year old cat has been constipated for about a week he has not been eating and has been throwing up. We took him to the vet yesterday and were told they could see the stool that was backed up in him so he was given an enema and was sent home with medication. The enema did not work and he still has not pooped. He’s been trying to poop and keeps going back to his litter box but there’s just been nothing. The vet also recommended Mira lax in his food but he won’t eat, and he spits his pill right out. He is supposed to go back to the vet today if he doesn’t pooping anything out to be monitored and prepped for surgery within the next few days. The surgery costs about 3 thousand dollars and my mother doesn’t have the money, I am 22 years old with no money at the moment and I am truly scared that if he doesn’t pass any stool he might have to be euthanized at home and it’s breaking my heart.

1044,"I have a friend who during this Covid lockdown I'm really worried about. She's a super intelligent shy girl who unfortunately who was bullied tremendously and it's really left it's mark on the poor girl.
Because she is so self conscious of talking that she refuses to speak unless there's no other option.
This morning I dropped off a present for her birthday and was expecting her to talk through the door softly or something but instead she went to the window and first tried sign language and I told her I'm not that smart she got a pen and piece of paper and started writing notes and she seemed a different and destroyed person. I have been too caught up in my own life to notice anything but after that I choose to call the few friends she has since no family and quickly found out she hasn't spoken a word in over 6months or left the house and is really starting to scare me. I can text her but they are often rambling.
Any ideas on how I can bring it up and try get her to speak and get some fresh air as I can see it's affecting her mental state.
We are in Stage 4 lockdown which adds an extra problem even though she thinks it's a ruse and government population control.
Any ideas please",11Sep2020,1

1046,"My bf works with a company where he drives a truck. He asked his supervisor multiple times if he could take it to doctors appointments, meeting with his ex wife, and a party for a kid. So, everytime that supervisor always said yes, and it goes against company policy I guess that the trucks are not to be used for personal use. But my bf got permission to do so. (I see that it can be a gray line). Anyhow, he drove to the kids birthday party and came back but when he woke up he found that his truck was damaged severely. He has no recollection of the incident whatsoever. (He has memory issue that we were working on but it’s never been to this degree). To this day he does not know what happened. Anyhow, he got put on FMLA and yada yada until his dr. Released him to go to work. His doctor did, 3 months later. Guess what?! The guy over the supervisor, after 3 months wants to terminate him.  Saying the supervisor above him said he didn’t not allow permission to use the truck for personal use. My bf, has no car, truck, bicycle even. If they were to terminate him he could not get another job because he wouldn’t be able to get to a job site. His landlords already have some problems with his payments being late because of covid and FMLA screwing him on his paychecks. He wants to hire a lawyer but the lawyer says $200 at least because he owed him some from before. I don’t know what else to advise him to do at this point because I am so scared of what will happen to him. He could evicted. He has a dog, 2 actually. Why didn’t they fire him after 1 month. Why would he wait 3 whole months to fire him??? What are my bf’s options?! He is thinking suicide would be better and I’m telling him NO!

1047,"Hey Everyone, i never used reddit before so sorry if its in the wrong category or whatever. Im currently 19 and i work and have my side hustles but I need advice. 

My step father is a very bad drunk. All he does is work come home, drink, then sleep. When he is sober he seems so innocent. When he drinks he is a straight up abusive ass hole. We found him multiple times passed out in our basement stairs after worrying about where he was at because we couldnt find him. The alcohol addiction is getting so bad its unbearable and it seems as if he is on another drug thats how bad he gets drunk. Me and my siblings stay in our rooms all day to avoid him as we just cant stand him. He has no cap and doesn’t give no fucks about anyones feelings.

Today we found him passed out again. Me and my mom had a deep conversation. She told me she wants to leave. She has been with him for over 13 years and its been going nowhere. She told me that she is tired of it and honestly she doesnt have any feelings towards him anymore. Theres no fixing him anymore. Ive seen the way he treats my mom and thats no life to live. Ive heard the things he has told her and it seems as if he doesnt love us (my siblings). 

The thing is my mom, me, and my siblings have nothing. We now have a nice house due to him working and we love and appreciate him for that. Ive heard him multiple times brag about how we arent shit without him “you guys wouldnt have shit if it wasnt for me” what kind of person let alone father says that type of shit? He says he works and busts his ass everyday and he really doesnt give a fuck about anything other than alcohol and his job.

I dont want my mom to go through this anymore. My little brother doesnt need to see this or go through what i did as a child. Im more worried about my mom. None of the abuse is physical but i can tell its getting to her mentally and i truly love my mom for everything she has done.

Like i said we dont have much. Me and my mom work and i know if we leave ima have to help out and if its for my mom ill do anything i can because she dealt with him for over 13 years for us. I owe her the world i wish i can give it to her. I need advice what should i do. If we leave i dont know where we will stay. I was trying to grind and get my money up i have around 8k right now. I live free right now because of my dad and pay my own bills. I would love to save up to start my businesses and invest in real estate and i have a feeling if we leave its going to slow me down. But like i said ill sacrifice anything for my mom and siblings.

Thank you to anyone and everyone for any advice given. Id appreciate any advice I need help.",11Sep2020,1
1048,"Let me start by explaining the situation. I have a group of 5 very close friends that I have known since I was 6. One of these friends has always acted... very strange I guess. In my early years he would frequently lie to me about things just to make him look good. You can excuse these type of lies because he was little, but little did i know that from this it would transpire into something much worse. When I was 14 years old I started to like one of the girls form our friend group.  Surprisingly enough we actually started dating and were boyfriend and girlfriend. We decided not to immediately speak about our relationship to our friend group and decided to take our time. This also meant we could not be flirty when out with friends. But obvious signs came up that we were in fact into each other so we slowly started telling our friends. Eventually everyone knew because this ""friend"" basically found out by forcing me to tell him what was going on. I also forgot to mention that he was always flirting with my girlfriend, before and after he knew we were together. Eventually we broke up (surprise surprise) and I would not find out why until 2 years later. When this happened, along with a few other things, i fell into depression. I lost a lot of weight from not eating and a bunch of other things. No one was there to support me but myself. During this break up, my friend continued to flirt with her and always made me feel worse. I eventually got over her (sort of) and was able to better myself. I started looking better, dressing better and changed my hairstyle. Of course none of my friends were supportive, especially him. But somehow I managed to build my own confidence and move on. Now I am 16 in my second year of high school and I he is the same. He gets mad and frustrated when I receive attention (especially from girls) and just when I am genuinely happy with myself. He still talks to my ex frequently even though he has a girlfriend, and is still trying to uncover about my relationship when he has the chance. I swear to god he knows more about my ex than I do. He actually told me the reason she even broke up with me. It is like he is personally obsessed with me and must know every detail about my life. If I am talking to a girl, going out with other friends, hell even what my hobbies are he has to know. Another annoying factor about this ""friend"" is that he talks shit about stuff you do, but later does the same thing. When I was going through my break up I started watching a lot of anime to cope and bought a skateboard to keep myself busy. He despised this and talked shit about them. Know he owns a skateboard and ""watches anime"". Why is this person so competitive, why does he hide things from me, why does he lie about going out, why doesn't he invite me to hang out with friends, why does he go out and not tell me, why does he talk shit and then copy the things I do, why is he invested in my past relationship, why does he text my ex frequently, why does he try to keep me from socializing with new friends, why does he hate when I try to chase girls, just why? Please if you made it this far, tell me why i'm receiving this toxic behavior from him when I have always wanted nothing but the best for him and supported almost all of his decisions.",11Sep2020,1

Which I probably was. I haven't spoken to him in a while but recently while I was at school I saw him for the first time in a while and when saw his eyes my heart DROPPED like my breath just left my body and all the sad thoughts went through my head because when we cut it off I was heart broken it hurt.

1052,"Title says it all. My sister in law is cheating on her husband and has been for about six months. What makes this particularly disgusting is that she serves on a board for a hockey team for veterans with disabilities. Her husband is a goalie for this team. She is cheating on him with the other goalie. She has been lying to her family and we don’t even know where she has been living for the past 6 months. Now she is moving out and plans to divorce her husband AND have him kicked off the hockey team so she doesn’t have to see him. 

I feel like I can’t just sit by and watch this happen. He has PTSD and I just know that if she tries to kick him off the team and then divorce him, I worry about what he might do to himself... or the other goalie.... What should I do? I want to write a letter or email to the president of the board but not sure what exactly to say? Do I say anything? Do I call? Do I tell her husband? Her poor husband has done nothing wrong and has been working to save this marriage for months, all while not knowing his wife is fucking the other goalie on the team. This woman is mentally unstable and I, along with my husband and mother in law, believe that based on her behaviors and compulsive lying, she has borderline personality disorder. 

What should I do here? Do I say something to the board, or her husband? She has him thinking they are going to therapy to work things out, when in reality that’s further from the truth. She wants to keep him close for his money. I’m just really upset by this situation and feel I can’t just sit back and let it unfold the way she wants it to.",11Sep2020,1

1055," This is complicated. I'm going to use fake names. I feel terrible. Stressful stomach ache. I'm not sure where to start, so I'm just going to talk:

I'm a ""smart kid"" to most people. I don't agree. Lots of the time, I feel like I'm not good enough, feeling inferior, and it hurts worse because I feel like people have a false perception of me and if they knew that I wasn't actually that smart, they would be... I don't know. Different. Lots of the time, I make jokes like ""I'm so amazing"" to make sure that nobody knows I have these insecurities. It works: because people think I'm a narcissistic stuck-up nerd. Boom, another insecurity.

Sarah and I are in 8th grade, we met in 6th grade I think. Our friendship is rocky. But I don't care, because she's honestly an amazing friend. We're both stubborn, so whenever we fight, we both usually get really heated and leave, and then a couple hours later, apologize, and grow as people. Our friendship is just awesome: we even got platonically married in the Game of Life, and refer to each other as ""wifey."" Sarah and I are friends with Sophia, Samantha, Stephanie, and Ruby.

Sarah, me, Ruby, Sophia and a 9th grader who's really close to us met up, and we decided to write a fiction book together. When we were writing this book, Sarah and I had our fair share of disagreements, but we were able to grow from that. Don't think we're bad friends because we argue a lot: we're both very passionate, and this passion makes us really good friends. Most of the time, we can figure out the argument, and really grow as people.

Anyway, a couple weeks back, Sarah, me, Sophia, and the 9th grader, Iris, were talking on the Google Doc and got really deep in life. I told them the insecurities I haven't told anyone, they told us their insecurities. We became close through this.

Recently, I was thinking about hobbies for my character in my fiction book. I decided on fashion designing after an argument with Sarah; I was being stubborn, she showed me that I was being stubborn. Anyway, to fix it up, I created a little section detailing the hobbies of each of the characters. When I saw how many her character had, I felt like her character was becoming superior, even thought she agreed that our characters were supposed to be equal. Typing this now, I don't know why we fought. But I still feel that if one character just does a bunch of activities, it's a bit crazy. To show her how it felt, I made my character basically do everything. After I did this, we got into an argument.

This is when the ""thing"" happened. I was talking about how it was unfair that her character was superior. She said: ""Just because you think you're superior in real life..."" I was heart-broken. This simple line was something that just reflected on all my insecurities. It felt like confirmation that this is all that people think of me, even my closest friends, stuck up. I felt like I had made people think I was the opposite of what I thought I truly was: and it sucked. I felt like she had taken the insecurities I had given to her and just lashed out with them. I felt like my trust was broken. I felt like my heart was broken.

I blew up on her, telling her that she's broken my trust, and that she's taken my insecurities and just used them as an insult. Looking back, I don't think she understood, that she just thought it was a typical argument, didn't realize she hurt me. She asked me why I was insecure about this, saying that I was blowing up over a character dispute. I repeated what I said. Then I left (by the way, this whole argument has been on Google Docs). I texted on the book group chat that I was considering leaving the story because of what she said, because if they didn't know ahead of time, they would have no time to figure out what to do.

Here's the thing: I don't know if she meant it. When Sarah and I were going through a rough patch, I think I unknowingly did something like this by calling her ""toxic"" when I only now realized that that's one of her biggest insecurities. And you can call this friendship bad, but listen: try and step in my shoes. Not everything is black and white. And as we go from teenagers to more mature, we stop fighting. Our friendship becomes stronger. And we keep going. And besides, most of the arguments we have about the story are like ""BUT WHERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE HUH"" and because I kept talking about superiority, she brought that up. Also, please don't think my insecurities caused this. Those are separate.

Sarah realized what she did wrong (I think). Here's where the issue starts. Iris is having an impromptu party this Sunday, and Sarah, Sophia, Ruby, and me were planning to bring her a surprise. Plus, Stephanie is also having a party in a couple weeks, and we need to plan a surprise for that too. Sarah left both of the surprise planning group chats. And then the road trip group chat.

I was feeling a lot at that time. Angry, because I felt that I couldn't express my emotions without things like people leaving group chats happening, making me the villain. Stressed, because 2 parties and 2 surprises with not that much time is hard, compared to the surprise party I made for my other friend that I had 10 people helping... and it still took 2 months. And sad. Because she's my ""wifey.""

Ruby texted me asking what happened, Sophia (who as one the doc) told me that she's there for me, Iris hasn't checked her group chats. I texted her, begging her not to do this, telling her we could discuss what happened another day, but she just apologized for saying what she said me, and then blocked me. This is where I need advice.

I don't care who's right. I don't care who's wrong. How do I have a discussion with her, help us build up our friendship, and make sure we can rebuild our trust? How can I make sure she talks to me Sunday, and how can I make sure that I can truly trust her?",11Sep2020,1
1056,"Hey folks,

I left my parents to live on my own at the age of 17 and now I'm a 21 years old male, and now it feels like I have missed learning on a lot of subjects (especially cooking). I was trying to choose a shampoo different from the one I normally use for a change, and then I noticed there are hair wash and body wash, I digged the internet to know about the differences and found out that it isn't recommended to use the same product for your hair and body.

As far as I remember I have always used the same plain shampoo for the last years for all shower uses, I don't use any single other product, I don't use any skin moisturiser, I don't use any types of cream and I didn't even use sun protection until last summer and that is because I stumbled across a YouTube video explaining the dangers of the sun's UV (and now I'm paranoid about the sun). I just use shampoo and hand soap, nothing else.

Am I doing something wrong? Are there long term effects I might be experiencing that I should be aware of? How is one supposed to know about the usage of all these creams and which ones to use, there are well over a hundred option of each type; foot, face, hand, body, hair, lips. Isn't it better to keep the the skin as natural as it can be and do the creams that give you a better skin really work? I don't know what irritating skin feels like and whether my skin is irritating or not to justify the use of additional tools. I would appreciate your insight and recommendations.

1057,"Hey wondering what you guys thought on this, that is if you thought anything.

So I've been struggling for with alcohol abuse for many years. In more recent years I've wanted to quit but it was only 2 months I really started giving it ago. I've had many relapses and day ones since then. But I haven't given up.

Over the course of this year I've managed to get into debt and almost completely destroy my business that I've been building for the last few years. Yes due to drinking. Now my friends may not know about that stuff but they do know about my struggles with the alcohol. Infact many of them are worse or the same as me. It's a binge lifestyle situation going on with some of them. Anyway everytime I try and quit I find that they don't quite get it. You know they still ask me to drink and through my own weakness and peer pressure I give in. They aren't bad people at all though don't get me wrong. Anyway I ended up on a serious bender earlier this week. To which I woke up feeling terrible and decided that my only way out was to ghost everyone. So I changed my number. This my attempt to remove myself from the ""lifestyle"" to get sober, get my business back on track and start improving my health and mental state. 

Where I'm hoping for someone to weigh in. Is in concerned that this may also be challenging on my mental health. Cutting everyone off, becoming lonely. Worrying that they might think I'm a complete weirdo. I don't know it just felt like the right thing to do. I was spiralling out of control and the relationships I'm keeping were pulling me back. Maybe it's my fault for being too weak to just say no. Have I made the right decision?",11Sep2020,1

now in my first relationship , which went on for 3 month after we parted our ways , it was full of such moments like my first kiss and all . but ever since i got together with my current girlfriend , which is 3 years now , we've literally not done anything . and that my boys includes kissing . we haven't even kissed and she just keeps rejecting my advances for the past 3 years and i've been so considerate and calm but quite frankly , it's getting too much to handle for me . i get that this is her first relationship and she's nervous about things but man it has been 3 years and we don't even text each other sexually . and i'm not sexually attracted to someone else or want to be with any other girl , i just want her and it's so frustrating , she keeps asking for time but 3 years without even a kiss with a girl i love more than anything is more difficult that i'd like to admit . and i just don't want to hurt her or pressurise her into things man.......

A calm and collected person, does what he wants, is confident and a little arrogant.

He doesn't like to talk much, he shows his feelings mostly by deeds (although he himself is not aware of that). Also he is a little possessive and selfish with people he loves. He doesn't trust anyone completely.  He does not reveal his secrets and his past to anyone. When you get to know him he is fun and playful, also bold. 

He doesn't make friends easily because he doesn't want to hang out with everyone (if he doesn't like someone he doesn’t want him around). 
When he was younger most of the ppl have used him and he also has family problems. I used that to explain why he is like that. Why he doesn’t trust someone 100% and why he doesn’t have many friends (he has one close friend). 

But the problem occurred, my main character falls in love with him. First they became friends, and that is okay but bc of the plot in the same time he meets my main character he also meets one girl (who he likes). And that means he made two friends. And he has to bc of the story. Does it sound realistic? For me not and so i thought to add that he doesn’t have trauma that to him people are just bother. He is not a boring person just had enough of fake friends. I don’t know is this concept good. 

I don’t want this character to be bad or arrogant or egocentric. But i don’t want him to be too friendly. Something in the middle. He is good and dedicated for ppl he cares about. But he doesn’t want to many people around him. He doesn’t want to be bothered. 

Does it add up that he doesn’t like people but is fun when you get to know him or that he made two friends?",11Sep2020,1

1073,"So I turn 17 in a couple of days. By the time I'm 18 I want to be out on my own in my own house I want to own a house. Not rent one! I have a job that pays 10 dollars per hour, I normally have 40 hours on every paycheck. I get paid every 2 weeks. I have been putting back 50 percent of my paycheck for moving out when I turn 18/paying for beauty school. 10 percent back for tithes and offering, and 20 percent back for a car possibly. So I have 20 percent of my paycheck that I can spend on whatever. I'm going to graduate I believe in May of next year and after I graduate I want to start cosmetology school and get my certificate. 

So all that being said, am I on the right track to move out when I'm 18? 

Is there anything I should start doing now to help me actually move out when I'm 18??
Because my brother also wanted to move out straight away when he turned 18, but couldn't cause he just got his first job so he didn't have enough credit or something like that...

I know the best Idea would be to stay at home while I can, but I really just wanna move out when I turn 18(for reasons I'd rather not state) 

Is all this realistic, to own a house when I turn 18 and to be paying for beauty school as well?
Are there better more realistic goals I should set?

1077,"I (23M) am a college student three years into university (though I've only taken two years' worth of classes). I studied mechanical engineering up until last winter term, and I was OK at it, though there were a few classes (like Strengths of Materials) which I really struggled in. I liked the major, at least at first; all through high school and my first years of college I did robotics, which was a ton of fun. Higher-level engineering courses were somewhat harder and less interesting for me.

Unfortunately,  I grappled with some serious mental health problems which caused me to miss three terms of school in 2019 and early 2020. These problems have largely been resolved, but as a result of missing school, and to be closer to home, I moved back in with my parents and transferred to another university. Around this time I changed programs to double-major in history and creative writing, with plans to be a secondary school teacher/eventual novelist. I do like my new classes more than my engineering ones; writing is my main passion and talent. On the other hand, I sacrificed a great deal of earning potential. My parents, oddly enough, vehemently encouraged the switch to a less lucrative career.

Recently I have received conflicting opinions about the viability of teaching. My parents and my best friend want me to stay on the teaching path, but I've also heard from several people that the pay is terrible (which I already knew) and that teachers don't get much respect from students or society as a whole. Another consideration is that I believe the world is on the verge of serious disaster, so I need to specialize in skills that people actually need rather than wasting my time on a frivolous degree. I've been debating switching back to engineering or maybe picking up a trade (which I've heard is a good living and in high demand).

I'm not very far into my history/creative writing program (two terms), and I think there's still time to switch. The question is, should I? I don't hate engineering, I just prefer to work with words instead of numbers, but I also want to cultivate real, marketable skills that will be in demand in a declining economy. 

I'd really appreciate some thoughts on this. Thank you!",11Sep2020,1
1078,"To make a long story short, my ex girlfriend snap chatted me a picture (out of the blue)of her sitting in bed with another guy right next to her. Knowing that she was probably trying to make me jealous and her attention from me I respond coolly with “nice.” She says “what?” And I go “oh I thought you were trying to make me jealous.” Then her friend (the guys sister) she’s with who I have never meant in my life sends me a video of her saying “fuck you, you’re irrelevant, nobody likes you, you’re so ugly etc.” So I, wanting to defend myself, Snapchat her back and say “shut the fuck up you don’t even know me.” The guy then gets the phone and kindly lets me know that he wants to beat my ass. And that was pretty much it. 

The point of all this is that I have never met those people in my entire life. So why do they hate me? Clearly my ex is talking shit about me behind my back and trying to get everyone on her side. (Side note: we ended on really good terms, no bad blood whatsoever) So really she should have no reason to be slandering me and hurting my reputation. She knows more than anyone that I’ve struggled with self image problems in the past, so why would she do this? She went from loving everything about me to hating everything about me for no reason and wanting everyone else to feel the same.

Here’s the issue: Should I talk to her and let her know how I feel about all of this in an effort to get her to stop, or should I just ignore her and hope it just goes away. Or should I do something else completely. Please help. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",11Sep2020,1

1080,"Before I explain what’s going on , I know covid has been hard on everyone and that a lot of things are far from normal however it’s unfair in any context to treat your employees like this by any stretch and now I need help. 

I work in the service industry for a reputable small business (cafe) the team consists of three baristas and a manager as well as the owner who (by nature of the job) is rarely within 100 miles of the cafe. The owner schedules a visit once or twice a week to the cafe in which he flies/ferries in to check up on things at our cafes as well as take stock of everything. 

My manager is what we’re here to talk about however! We’ll call her “B” for privacy purposes. 

B schedules herself 4 shifts per week, B will show up to these shifts late/open the cafe 1-2 hours late if she is scheduled to open. B leaves 3-4 early every day on AVERAGE. While B is present she claims to schedule, do inventory etc. however I’ve seen over her shoulder and most often it’s texting her fiancé/future mother in law. Not working. 

B is very quick to correct myself and the two other baristas despite us having more coffee knowledge and Barista experience than she does. The owner, Ill call him T, is unaware of B leaving as often as she does, B likes to keep him distracted/be present so  we can’t disclose the actual going’s on of the cafe. Many things are falling apart and are left upon us to deal with. 

This week was the breaking point for me though, B has been consistently adjusting my schedule so that my shifts now absorb most of her duties. Including a once a week shift at another location spent stocking AND then driving to finish my shift at our main location. Inevitably creating 10 hour days while simultaneously being chastised for taking over time. B continues to make excuses for herself but is very demanding of others. B Also denied my only sick day request in 6 months of working here unless I was willing to go to the hospital to “prove it” 

B took this entire week off because she had in her words “the sniffles” 

stretching thin the schedule of myself, the other part time worker and our only other full time worker.

Her scheduled hours in the last two weeks have been upwards of 85...yet she has worked 20 or less. Not really sure what to do here or what my course of action should be.",11Sep2020,1

He claims what I did is against school rules and says that I was ""Out of place"" which is a ""Suspendable Offence"" even though i was paying more attention to my real class than that one.

1083,"I know this probably seems like a very small problem among this subreddit but i would like to see if anyone could give me some insight.

I am in secondary school, and thanks to COVID I was unable to sit my rounds of standardised exams (GCSEs for those of you in the UK). So i was given teacher assessed grades. Now i really don't mean to toot my own horn or seem arrogant but I am in the higher band of students in my year. I was able to obtain As and even an A\* thanks to my teachers. I got the whole congratulations from others and it was a good day. Though what I really wanted was the scholarship which would cut the fees of my schooling in half for the next two years and with this came a nice special blazer for your uniform.

My year was always a smart one  with about 3 or 4 people achieving 12 A\*s and I am good friends with a bunch of these smarter people. Generally in my friend group I am the least academically proficient but i am better than them in other things, although now academics are all that matters.

The threshold for this scholarship was 3 A\*s, which i missed. A bunch of my friends got it and the letter. I was upset that I would be the only one without but quickly got over it. However today I got a letter (2 weeks later than they did) saying I got it which I was ecstatic about. However as we are a bunch of boys we took the shit out of each other. To which we came to the revelation that if I and a few others got it then the entrance level was downgraded, which to them further devalued the idea of the scholarship. This 'revelation' has really put me off.

 I was wondering if you guys think that I am overreacting? Because I really don't know how to think about this. As I said there are more people on this subreddit who would need your attention more than me  but any response would be appreciated. Thanks!",11Sep2020,1

Idk how this works, but basically I need some advice, objective advice. So my gf she is an active drug user she’s not an addict but she does do drugs at least a couple times a week whether it’s weed, ket, MD or coke.
I’m completely against drugs and have made that clear from the start of our relationship. I know she’ll never give them up, I just don’t know what to do because whenever she does them I feel so tense and don’t feel like I can talk to her (not that she talks to me anyway when she’s high). I should mention that it’s my intention to join the police within the next two years and if she’s still doing drugs which no doubt she will be, she’s not just putting herself at risk but she’s putting my career at risk too. 


Do I break up with her? Or find a way of tolerating it? Even though I wouldn’t normally go for someone who does drugs this often. Any advice is appreciated regardless of what side you’re on. Thanks",11Sep2020,1
1086,"I like creating/editing videos and producing/making music. They are two things I'm really interested in. Whatever it would take to keep me in the same circle of artists I look up to and listen to I would do it, whether it would be creating music videos, producing music, designing clothes, or even anything else like that I would do it. The problem is I'm a sophomore in high school with no realistic idea of how to do it.

To pursue my interests in making/editing videos I have thought about saving up for a camera from my part time job and then learning how to use it. I have an old version of Adobe programs given by my photographer/videographer uncle that I have a little experience with (Photoshop and Premiere Pro I can kind of use a little bit, nothing too complicated.) After getting a camera I was thinking about saving for a car (I can drive in a few months) or gas money for my moms car and then reaching out to artists I know/know of in my area and offering to shoot videos/take photos for them. 

To pursue my interests in producing/making music I don't really know what I can do. All I have thought out to pursue that is to eventually save up for the full version of a DAW and learn to use it. I have the trial version of one already and can make a simple beat but have no idea how to mix/master/record vocals/ make my beat more complicated. My knowledge in music is basic, I learned the piano from 1st until 7th grade and did choir in middle school and also orchestra for a few years.

Then, with creating a 3rd party D&amp;D book, there are way more issues. I would have to have some sort of group to do it with, I would have to find money for art and physical copies and even just paying the other, theoretical writers, there’s just no way I could do it.

im autistic so social stuff for me its kind of difficult, so far ive dedicated my whole life to my career (im a physician, currently looking to start a residency) and ive never really paid attention to my personal life, but as of lately ive been seeing all of the people i used to know in middle school or highschool settling down, marrying and having children so im starting to feel certain pressure to do the same. 
now, theres another problem, im not sure why guys arent attracted to me, i dont think im ugly, however i am painfully average looking. 
the main reason i think no guy has ever shown interest in me is that i think i can be kind of eccentric, not that i mean to be, i cant help it and i always stop being ""weird"" if someone points it out. 
i guess what i want advice in is, what to do, how to proceed and maybe how to find a guy that would like me? 
also on what i can do to be more likeable?
maybe if theres someone in here who is also on the spectrum and on a relationship and they could advice me, itd be greatly appreciated.
i have aspergers syndrome if you need to know the specifics.

ps: im not really desperate to be in a relationship RIGHT now, i just want to know how i can prepare myself to be in one since i am completely confused and i seriously do not know what to do, like i said ive never in my life been with anyone.
