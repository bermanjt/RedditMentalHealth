0,My parents aren't going to be home and they have no idea that my friend is coming over. What excuses can I make to satisfy her mom?,29Jul2020,1
1,"This has always been a topic that I have never been able to address well, as I had only found out all of this very recently from my parents. It's all quite fresh. I feel quite bewildered by it all. In short, just before I was born, my grandfather was convicted for the attempted murder of my grandmother (she barely managed to escape with severe injuries). They lived separate lives afterwards. Learning this completely flipped my perception of my grandparents - as a child, I always loved them, but always felt that something was off with my grandfather, almost instinctual. I don't understand why my entire family had kept everything secret from me for so long. My grandmother died a couple years ago, but I still see her as an inspirational, strong woman. My grandfather committed suicide during lockdown. I couldn't attend the funeral. I didn't know how to feel about the whole thing when he was alive, and I feel twice as confused now he is dead. What do I do to move on? He left many unanswered questions. I have felt at a loss since I cannot find anyone to relate to who is struggling with the grief and guilt over a relative who committed such a crime. The back of my mind is constantly ashamed to be related to him (and unnecessarily worried I could be like him). Is there anything to do to help myself? I cannot find any grief program that covers something as messy as this",29Jul2020,1

So me and a friend of mine (who is non-binary, they go by “bread”) we’re hanging out and I made a comment like “I like the name bread for you, but it’s a strange thing to have as a name” and they laughed and made a joke about non-binary names being nouns or whatever, and we were chill.

But,,, a few hours after I left they sent a very,,, VERY aggressive message essentially saying “I hope you know that comment about my name made me feel super fucking invalid” and after I tried to clarify what I meant and made an apology they wouldn’t listen? (That was a quote, by the way, but there’s a whole other paragraph berating me and I think it’s was excessive and it really hurt to read)

A lot of their old friends (old as in they aren’t friends anymore) would stop talking to them because whenever they would slightly fuck up they’d lash out and say some really mean shit, but I never listened to the warnings because I never had that experience and I would defend what happened to them, so I kinda fed into their behaviour? I don’t know the full story, so I guess it wasn’t all me

Recently it’s been happening a lot? It used to just be Info-dumps about fandoms and sharing memes or whatever but now they just insult me in rants (without naming me, but they call out things I specifically do that I never knew bothered them, I just wish they would SAY because I’ve made it clear I’d prefer them TELL me rather than I hurt them without knowing). 

They struggle with mental health issues, so I’m probably just being stupid and mean? There’s more stuff that they’ve done but I don’t wanna get into that, it’s private. I have mental issues too, but it’s noting compared to them, so that doesn’t really matter.

Am an asshole...? Please be brutally honest with me. How do I confront them about it, what do I even say?",29Jul2020,1
3,"I do not really know where to start so I apologize if this is messy and long. I (f19) grew up in a strict but also not so strict brown household.  My parents as I grew up became very strict about letting me out of the house. I had to beg them to let me join extra-curriculars and going out with friends was always a nightmare. I eventually lost friends because I was never allowed to hang out with them or facetime because my parents were always suspicious. If I could go out it was max 2 hours otherwise I would come home to name-calling and some sort of punishment. I used to make excuses so I could see my friends but I eventually got caught and ever since then I wasn't allowed to go out anymore, it's been more than a year now.

Now I know it doesn't sound too bad but living at home isn't the best either. No one talks to me in my family and if they do it's mostly about what I'm doing wrong and how my friends aren't important but family is.My mom recently told me that I'm not happy because I don't try to be and I should just smile more often and I will be okay. I told her its hard to be happy when I am stuck in the house 24/7 with people who don't even talk to me and just talk crap and she said that I just hate her and do not even try to talk to anyone. Ive been trying to build a relationship with my parents for years but at this point they are never going to respect me as much as they do to my YOUNGER brother.   

I am extremely grateful for all my parents have provided me with and the sacrifices they have made for me but I had to grow up on my own because they never felt the need to show me love and sympathy. I learned how to do a lot of things I should've been taught at home from my friends and teachers because my parents always told me I am too young to learn. In reality, they just did not want me to become independent. I know I am old enough to take control of my life but I live in their house and I am not financially stable enough to move out.  

(By not so strict my parents have never taken my phone or forced me to go into a certain profession which I am extremely thankful for because I have heard some horror stories. )

I just do not know where to go now. My academics have begun to suffer because the situation at home is really affecting my mental health. I can't go to the library to study or to some Starbucks because I can't leave the house. Staying in my room doesn't help because I can hear them talking about how I keep isolating myself.",29Jul2020,1
4,"So like a lot of women, I’m pretty insecure about my body. 

Despite having a healthy BMI and being at a healthy weight for my height, I have a lot of belly fat and love handles and parts of me jiggle and I have a bit of a muffin top. And one of my boobs is bigger than the other.

I’ve been sleeping with one of my guy friends lately and I’ve found that I’m just so insecure about my body and I just feel so gross and unattractive that I try to leave as much clothes on as I can during sex. Most of the time I leave my bra on and have only taken it off once and felt anxious the whole time it was off.

I never take my underwear completely off and instead just have him move them to the side. Stuff like that. 

He’s never actually said anything negative about my body and he’s very nice and has called me hot and sexy BUT I just can’t help but feel like he’s lying and that he secretly finds me repulsive or something.

I wanna be more confident in the bedroom but find it very hard to feel good about my body. Any advice?",29Jul2020,2
5,"life can't go and worse than it is right now.

I have nothing left in life. No education results, no work, nothing but my body.

I am still in debt and every time I make a few bucks I pay a part of it.

Lately I decided to get into Forex with 1000, turned it into 2000. Lost it all. Knew I could do better, took a loan for 10k, made it 35k, market manipulation when the US session opened, wiped my account.

Now I'm in even more debt.

All I have is my body. I am willing to be a slave -if this opportunity shows itself- to anyone as long as it eventually pays my 25k debt ( after that I don't even care if I don't make any money). I want to do good to the people I took money from, and I no longer care about what happens to me.

Selling my organs is also in my mind now. I am fit 64kg, 173cm,  and never drank or used drugs and I don't smoke, so you will get a good deal for fresh ones like that.

Any advice?",29Jul2020,1

7,"I finally got a job offer after 3 weeks, countless phone interviews, and a bajillion reference requests. They offered me more money than I expected and I am so thankful after for the opportunity after 2 long months of job searching. Its a great opportunity- an inventory job at a hospital- 5 minutes away from me, monday through friday, 7-3:30! My SO works 6-2 monday-friday so it is perfect schedule wise. They even have a daycare inside the hospital that I could bring my LO to. The only problem is I haven't told them I am pregnant. I prefer to tell them sooner rather than later and before they notice my growing belly. I am showing already and prefer to not have to hide it- as well as the fact I have felt so guilty for not telling them (all interviews have been done over the phone).

25,"Hello, for safety reasons i wish to remain anonymous. But here is my problem 

I have a younger brother who has played with a ""woman"" online for over 7 years. Back in december of 2018 they had a fight and stopped playing together. But recent things have come out that dont add up to me.

My brother swears he has never done anything exploitive with this ""woman"" and was only asked too once. But they reportedly ""dated"" for awhile. 

As a list of things that are odd
1. The woman says she cannot speak because she had her throat cut during a rape when she was younger that damaged her voicebox. Idk about human anatomy too well in that regard so we believed it.

2. She refused to ever send any photos or video chat or anything to confirm her face. Even when all of our mutual friends in a group chat would.

3. Multiple issues appeared in her story of her life over the years. All of my brothers friends and their at the time mutual frienss discussed it and had conflicting stories from her.

4. Occasionally we heard reports from her friends that she was doing odd things. Like years ago my brother said her and him were together to a friend of hers. The friend replied ""huh i thought she was dating that other guy"".

Perhaps all of this can be explained. But i want to know if i can find somebody to do research into her, and find out if she is who she is. And if she isnt what can i do to stop this predator from hurting other people. Say what you will, i wish i was more attentive in my brothers social life and i should have been as his older sister.

About five months ago I moved into my first apartment. I've lost my job due to Covid and have been living off my savings and unemployment benefits since. 

This cut from 600$ to 200$ weekly is too deep, how do I compensate? I pay 1350$/month for rent which I was able to afford along with other basic needs and food. Now 800$ a month isn't enough to pay my bills, while actively job seeking. 800$ a month isn't worth getting rejected or told there's no work available. Denver didn't used to be like this, I moved out here because of all the opportunity to work and now it's like a ghost town. I keep all my options completely open and am not choosy one job or task and not the other.

They talk about all these rental assistance programs everyone is collecting donations for but after several attempts at reaching out to several different community resources, I was ran around the block without ever recieving an official answer on how to access these ""benefits""

Tent, medications, sleeping bag, locks, backpack, etc. than I'd like to plan on how to budget and thrive off the least amount of money as possible so I'm able to save up every bit of each 800$ payment afterwards to hopefully rebuild again after the winter.

31,"TLDR is toward the bottom. 

Ok so I'm a miracle baby. My mom and dad had 5 kids that died in the womb or shortly after birth. And then I came along. 

So I was supposed to move out by the end of July. Like. With a roommate, in my city/state. However, my roommate communicated to her mother that she wanted to move out, so the mom spent her college fund and chose a monthly tuition payment plan. That she (the mother) refuses to pay. So my roommate has a few decisions to make, and I told her to take her time, we can still do this, and now we have more time to save and plan. 

So moving out-but-staying-in-city is still a go; just postponed. Because nobody else I know is 1) looking for a roommate, 2) trustworthy, or 3) making enough money/has a drivers license/has any means to do anything but *say* they want to move out. Until last week. 

Last week, a friend came over, invited me over, my mom said I could go. I come home and she has a list of eleven things she wants me to do. Some made sense, as in, showing her my grades (she helps me pay my tuition so that makes sense. I thought I showed her at the end of last semester but I guess not. So I showed her.), do all chores by myself (which I already do. I just work part-time, now. Again, no big deal, I was prepared to do *everything* in one day, rather than throughout the week). 

What was weird was when she told me to strip naked (in case I had any body modifications she didn't know about) and take out my piercings right then and there. So I said no. This is something I found weird and was going to put my foot down. 

For context, I self-pierced my ears (six times) earlier this year and she didn't find out till the second month of quarantine. She thought I was being disrespectful and have no right to use the time or the money I earned on my own body. Same goes with clothing and haircuts (and she's extremely upset about the undercut she didn't find out about until months after I first got it done, as well). 

Anyway. Her response to me saying no was to ""lock"" me out of the basement bathroom (the one that only I use) and to say that she'll just look at me naked as I shower in the upstairs bathroom (the one that only she uses). I admit, that sounded so crazy that I almost started laughing. But I went downstairs to go eat, and she followed me, told me I better not use the basement bathroom, and went to go grab the house keys. So I was like ""oh, sh*t, she's for real. Okay."" She let me get my toiletries before she ""locked"" the door. 

And then she turned around and said that the door unlocks when 1) I strip naked in front of her, *and* 2) I make an appointment to go to the bank, so I can joint my bank account with hers. 

Her argument for number 2 is so that she's my beneficiary, and that I'm hers. But she has a history of monitoring my transactions and demanding to see my shopping bags and receipts whenever she sees that I go shopping. And recently, she's opened three of my packages, now. So I told her that she can just wait for my death certificate, just like I'll wait for hers. I don't feel like her taking all my money out of my account because I pissed her off. 

And remember: she's said several times that she doesn't believe I have a right to do what I want with the money I earn, anyway. That I am a child and have no idea how to be reasonable or responsible. That changes when she's in a good mood, or if I'm grocery shopping. But if I made her upset, she changes her mind. I don't want to joint my account with her. 

Anyway. This on top of years of micromanaging where I go (Life360- I have many stories in which she threatened or used something as emotional leverage, in response to me being more than one minute late, or taking the wrong route. I can understand straight up lying about where I am, but cmon). What clothes I buy and wear, what I can and cannot do with my body (at 19 years old). She had grabbed me by the scruff of the neck when I cut my hair (no permission, I just did it on impulse) at 14. I have not been able to save money because she can see how much I have- which means she can see how much she can borrow- until I made my own bank account. I didn't grow the balls to close my high school checking until a month ago. But if it weren't for my second bank account, I would have no emergency fund. 

Bold assumption? Tell me the difference between when I only had a high school checking, versus having a college checking and an online checking. 

I have money, she doesn't know how much, so she asks *if I can afford to lend* rather than just telling me to lend. And now, it's *all* my money, not just the ""here's a little something to have in your pocket"" every so often. Because she loves me and I love her, but it's hard to see your own ways and habits. 

I call her out on em but she twists the story, forgets, or tells me I'm wrong if I tell her if/why my feelings are hurt. So I try not to do the same when she tells me that she feels disrespected because of something I did. 

But it's hard. Because a lot of what she's upset about is ""having no control at all over what you [I] do"" (her words- but she'd deny it. I stopped tape recording our arguments because what am I saving them for? To play back to myself and feel even more stuck? Maybe for inspiration to go to work, on the days I don't feel like it.) 

Because she'll mock me, I'll tell her she's mocking me, and then she'll say that she isn't. I'm happy that I've learned how to be so calm that I can hear what she's saying without it effecting how I feel anymore. But today was a little different. 

That night she ""locked"" me out of the bathroom, I packed my bags, and planned to stay at a friends the next morning. But our doors have The Ring (useless thing. Our packages still get stolen. She's using it to be nosy, I think.) so she saw I had a few bookbags and my guitar. I was driving when she told me to come back so I can give my therapist something (I did have therapy that morning, but planned to delete Life360, turn off my location, and go live at a friend's right after. I was planning to couch surf (and not for free) until my boyfriend (21/military) is done with his training and moves into his apartment on August 6th.

I didn't shower or pee until I *almost* left because I couldn't go anywhere in the house without her following me, and I can't pee in front of people. I lied about having work that day so I could sit in the store, use the bathroom, throw water on my face, and think about my next steps. I didn't think about turning to family because I knew they would try to dissuade me from moving 600 miles away to live with my boyfriend of four years. 

And I was right! Their argument was that he's a growing young person just like I am. So it's a better idea to groove to our own beats for a while. 

It's funny because we've been grooving to our own beats for the last four years. Long distance plus military plus we only see each other three times a year. I'm tired of people telling me about my romantic relationship. But I take it with a grain of salt. I get it. We need our independences. 

I've never lived alone (except for during a professional conference- that my mother threatened to come take my things because Life360 said I was at Navy Pier at 11:30. Curfew was 12, the university the conference was held at was 10 minutes away, ?? It was the last night my boyfriend was in town, we were there with other attendees and instructors of the same conference. And she blew up my phone, called me 3 times in a row to tell me ""about myself."" That I'm easy to manipulate, that my boyfriend is controlling me, that I don't listen to instructions, that I'm not ready to be out on my own. He was there the whole time and turned my phone face-down because he noticed that I started freaking out. And to this day, he brings this up as one of many reasons why he implores me to gtfo.)

And yeah. I like living alone. But I also like living with my boyfriend. We did that for almost a month, when I came to visit him. It was wonderful, we make a great team, we know how to listen to one another. And I know that last part because we made it work through three rough patches, now. I think we'll be okay. 

To add on to the moving-in-with-my-boyfriend thing: he predicted *this* (my mom doing some wacky thing that makes me go ""ok. yep. I'm done,"" take my car and go. *Or* she kicks me out like she's been threatening (and has done once before) since I was 14. And all the parents of those young-adult friends who say 'you can always stay at my place!' says that I can't stay with them.) I'm so lucky that he's this smart. But he's been here before, so he knows better than anyone. 

He chose the apartment and lease that he chose for me, he says. So that I can move in with him and have zero complications with his landlord. 

(Like??? Getchu a mans like this???? Anyway-)

I asked him about his individuality and he says that he's welcoming me, that he literally planned for this, and that he's been ready to move in together. He's lived alone before (his dorm) and he believes in us, too. It's unfortunate *what* built up to me moving in with him, in this case, but moving in with him is not unfortunate! 

But yeah. I ask my job to transfer me to his state, so I can help him pay rent (utilities are included). He tells me I can live with him for free and just save my money. Especially if I have other plans. But I don't feel comfortable with living for free, so I ain't plannin' on it. 

But yeah my whole family swears we're going to fall out and that he'll kick me to the curb immediately. But 1) I have reason to believe that he and I are both independent and mature as fuck for our ages. 2) I brought this up to him, and he said that the only reason he'd do that is if I try to physically harm him. Which makes perfect sense. Also has never happen and I can comfortably say I am above doing. So yeah. He says even if we broke up, he wouldn't just kick me out with nowhere to go right away. 

Yeah, actions speak louder, but he's a man of his word. I'm not concerned with he and I ending up like my mom and I. 

By the way: I didn't want to be *totally* insolent so I turned my car back around to meet my mom. She told me to show her where my technology was, and when I couldn't show her my laptop (I had a decoy for literally everything else!!! Dammit!) she asked to check my car. And then she started taking my (as in- I bought literally all but maybe 2 things. And only because she bought me those two things while I was in middle school-) things out, wouldn't stop when I told her to, and carried my guitar back into the house. That was *my* guitar. Also, I didn't want to be *further* disrespectful and just drive off (I should have lol). Because I didn't want her to think me leaving was a ""fuck you."" It's a me-thing. 

But no matter how many times I say this isn't a personal attack, nobody in my family hears me. It's always ""cherish your mother. We only have each other. You're not going to make it with your boyfriend.""

Anyway. Before I ""left for work"" my mom ""let me"" use the bathroom next to the kitchen. I went to the basement to find the basement bathroom door was unlocked. So she was harassing me in my own house because I put my foot down on shit I have a right to put my foot down on. My body and my money. Okidoki. I grabbed everything I thought I'd have to replace, put it in the bag I brought inside, and walked ""to work"" until I figured out how to take *my* car keys back. Because that- plus not having grown a pair- was the only obstacle, at that point.  

Like. The only thing I have to *really* lose in moving out of state with him, is the tattoo apprenticeship at the shop I love here. I'm *still* in the process of letting that go, or in the process of accepting that it just won't happen for a while. Everything else is fine. Everything school/scholarship-related is online for the next three years, I was told. I'm on a scholarship and a college fund (unless my dad's been lying, by I don't think he is. He's shown me the money.) so I'm good. My mom pays a small amount which is weird (court orders- it's based on income which pisses off my rich dad) but I'm not losing hair over their stupid we-are-divorced-but-still-had-a-kid-oh-no shit. If the college fund can pay my tuition for all four years, then use it, guys. Just saying. I decided not to let myself be put in the middle of their quarrels after I turned 18. So that's that. 

Yes, there's a guilt factor. I would love to rip the bandaid off and as much as I wish I had a normal life, I know there's nothing I can do about my family being a special case. I don't think there's a family that *isn't* a special case. But yeah my family does not pressure it's adults to move out and I'm grateful for that. But just cuz I don't want to wait until I'm thirty until I buy my first house and move out for the first time, doesn't mean I hate the person who chose to sacrifice everything to raise me??? 

The plan was to leave, let it process, and then force everyone to accept my decision. And then after acceptance everything is ""fine"" again. Just like every other ""major"" decision I've made. The difference is that I don't live at home, which means I don't have to listen to anyone trying to guilt trip me into doing a damn thing. Or fall for the ""you live under my roof, your ass is mine"" crap. Because I live under my own roof 😊 Same principal as anyone else has on why they'd want to move out. 

Like I didn't ask to be here and neither my mom not I are entitled to shit but. Yknow. I wanna say *something* if I can. 

So back to what I'm asking for your advice on. 

TLDR: ALL TEXT ABOVE IS CONTEXT. 

My mom and I both put our foot down. I'm tired of one day being fine, and four minutes later, I'm in deep trouble that I don't believe a young adult should be subjected to. So instead of making wishes about not having to put up with these ""rules,"" I'd rather just not put up with them. 

But my grandma called me crying begging for me to let her help me. (So I'm staying with her. I'm so tired of the old people in my family doing this shit!!!! I am grateful for you. But if I say I'm fine, I'm fine!! If I say I'm not angry, I'm not angry!!)

When I was a minor, I've tried to gather what I needed to legally emancipate myself. But my mom found the papers I did the math on, made the checklists on, and I wasn't allowed to leave the house or have my phone for a while. Ever since, I've been planning and saving money so that even if I was caught, nobody could really stop me. 

But my family and my mom thinks I left because I'm angry with my mother and am trying to spite her. She feels disrespected because she's done nothing but provided for me, and I turn around, pack my stuff, and leave without saying anything. (It doesn't matter that she harassed me in my own house. Or has told me to kill myself to my face more than once. Or put me into therapy to ""fix"" my sexuality when I was 13. Yknow? None of it matters, I guess. She's ""done nothing to harm me, and apologizes if she has."" 🙃 I still don't have a right to pursue the major I want to, to do what I want with my body or hair, *or* pursue the tattoo apprenticeship I've been working all year toward. Because I owe her, as she says. Apparently I have to ""wait until I'm grown."" I guess it don't get any growner than paying your own bills.)

I don't feel I owe anyone an explanation for my *personal decision*, but I don't feel I *don't* owe an explanation. Which is what my mom asked me for today, when she told me she feels disrespected and unwanted. *No matter how many times I tell her my personal decisions are not personal attacks on her.* Helicopter parents of Reddit, what would you like to hear if you were in her shoes? I don't know what else to say to her or my family. 

No, my mind isn't 10000% made, but I have a general plan to move out. If it ain't today, it's tomorrow. Y'all see my bags packed. I have been talking about and planning on doing *exactly* this since I was 14. I don't understand what's unclear.

I've *said:* I'm not doing this because I'm mad at anyone. I am doing this because I want to spread my wings. I can live and cherish my family without living with them. Just like I cherished my grandma before I started staying here. Like. I don't know what else to tell these wackos, or if I'm just the asshole. 

My therapist is my uncle (mom's best friend's husband) so. He offers counseling and insight but my auntie (mom's sister) swears he's biased. Also between him swearing on mindfulness, and my mom refusing that either of us need therapy or meds, we haven't gotten anywhere new in the last three years. 

Yeah this is a lot to unpack and there's maybe 7 or 8 years of odd situations that I haven't mentioned. Feel free to ask questions. 

Yeah so me leaving isn't a personal attack. I did the math and I will be fine as long as I have a roommate in my city, or as long as I live below my means in my boyfriend's city. Or just live/roommate with him. Which like. Sure, it isn't buying a house at 21, but I don't plan on staying in one place for the next decade, anyway. The exact math- and my phat, juicy, succulent, and thicc emergency fund- say that I'll be fine if I did move out, and numbers don't lie. I've planned this for five years. This was not an impulse decision lol. But me leaving has still been hard on my mom, no matter how I feel. I know she has a problem and needs help but she can't see that. So what would you do in my shoes?",29Jul2020,1

35,This year my friend stabbed me in the back. Badly. I had sat at this lunch table for over a year when all of a sudden one of the people there started to tell me I’m not wanted and I should leave. They said it in front of everyone there and no one did anything. I let it happen to me from October up until just before the schools shutdown and I finally decided to sit away from them. I finally decided to stop when he said to me on Instagram that no one wanted me in. I started crying that night. They made me feel sad and lonely and I still feel hurt. I always felt like everyone there was nice but they never tried to help me out. I’ve been avoiding any social media where I can see them and I feel like that’s not good to just avoid it all. What should I do to get over it?,29Jul2020,1
36,"Hi.

I’ve been living with this person for a month and a half. We had an altercation that occurred in the beginning of the month which caused me to lose all respect for her but I still try to maintain civility between us. By civility, I mean trying to avoid her at all costs. The altercation that occurred between us was entirely her fault.

She has a trend of being inconsiderate and dirty in shared places. The landlord already talked to her about the kitchen and I spoke to landlord about the altercation and her nastiness in the bathroom. He told me spoke to her and said she’d move out by the end of the month which gave me hope. He also said he’d try to tell her in a way so she leaves peacefully.

For the past 3 days, this girl has literally being the most filthiest and inconsiderate person I’ve ever seen. Last night, when I tried to take a shower, the bottom of the bath tub was covered in hair. Today, there’s dried fecal matter on the toilet seat. Like, I get you’re leaving in a couple of days but WTF. 

I’m not in the right headspace to tell her to clean up because I’m soo frustrated, angry and annoyed and i know for sure if I go to here rn and tell her, It might make it worse.

I want to tell the landlord to deal with her but i feel like I’m getting him involved in petty things. But, at the same time, I’m not getting paid to deal with so I feel like I have to take it up with the landlord so he can do something about it. What should I do?",29Jul2020,1
37,"I’m 25f. Ive always had this passion to start a YouTube channel and to make videos related to fashion, beauty, lifestyle and health. I love cooking and food too. I spend hours a day watching my favorite YouTubers and have always thought about how I’d love to start a channel and make my own videos. I love watching vlogs and find it so interesting seeing what people do in their days. I live in NYC and think that I could create some NYC related videos that people would enjoy! 

The problem is that I’m living with the fear of what people will think of me if I start making videos... I haven’t told my friends or family about this passion so I would just feel really weird if they found out I was doing this and they might think I’m weird or think of me differently. How can I not care? This is really holding me back from pursuing this - I can’t find the motivation to start this new project because I also just feel like it’ll flop. 

I should also mention that I work a corporate job at the moment in advertising so I wouldn’t be necessarily starting this channel for money- I just really want to pursue this passion and see if I would really enjoy it. I’ve been thinking about it for too long and I want to finally do it, but I’m scared.",29Jul2020,1
38,"I’m currently 16 weeks and 5 days pregnant with my first child. My partner(30m) and I(29f) have been married for two years and have an average-sized two bedroom apartment near our workplaces.

I have a friend that needs a place to stay starting the end of August but I’m uncertain. I want so badly to help but the situation is kind of.. strange. My friend doesn’t have a good track record of maintaining a job and they currently have unmanaged mental health issues that aren’t being medicated or taken care of. Before now they were living in an apartment with family, paying no rent. They have saved up a small sum of unemployment money from their last job, which only lasted about a month or two.

Being pregnant, especially during this pandemic, has been really stressful and I am so afraid that helping my friend is going to ruin our friendship. I don’t mind giving them a temporary place to stay until the baby gets here, but if they don’t work, I don’t know what kind of development I can expect to take place during their time here. I’m also afraid that if I give them a few months they won’t abide by the agreement and vacate before I give birth. They have no family to help them in their home state and no friends either. I feel like if I don’t help I’m just condemning them to die and I can’t think about it without getting upset. They are also extremely depressed and talk about killing themselves a lot and it really worries me. 

I want to help but I’m scared that the care of wellbeing of another adult is going to be more than a temporary thing. I don’t know if I can do that knowing the baby will be here at the end of the year. I don’t know what to do... 😭",29Jul2020,1

I really love her a lot but I can’t have kids I’ll be severely unhappy with a child. I don’t want her feeling unfulfilled in life and I fear I may have to break up with her because I’m positive when I say I don’t want kids, I wouldn’t be able to live happy knowing she’s unhappy. 


I figured I’d turn to reddit to see what things they have to say about this because I’m in dire need of help. I love her more then anything else but I have a genuine hatred for children.

He had cancer for a couple years and it just started to spread in his liver. He got bad very fast and then recovered for a day or two then worse than before. We knew he wasn't going to make it so we went up to visit him one last time and he died 2 days after we left. I think I should be crying because he was my grandpa but I don't know what feel.

It took a while to even convince him to take medicine in which he thought was poison to his body. Even then he didn’t take the right amount medicine and took less than recommended. It’s been a couple years since then and I’m completely emotional tired. Over the years he had many angry outbursts and even got violent at times. He has continuously emotionally abused me and my sister. At most he hits himself on the head with the corner of the wall until he bleeds and more recently he has punched a hole in the wall because he was told he couldn’t watch TV. The doctors have told him that he was ready to get back into his normal life a long time ago. Since then, he has refused to get his driver’s license(even though he knows how to drive. The only reason he has a job is because my uncle handed it to him after not working for two years. Even now, he’s not that dedicated to his job. Everyday he insults me but I don’t really care for that.

49,"Background: 

I graduated magna cum laude this May with a BS in Medical Laboratory Science and I took and passed my boards so I am American Society of Clinical Pathology (ASCP) board certified as a Medical Laboratory Scientist/Clinical Laboratory Scientist. During my undergrad I worked at my university tissue bank where I consented patients prior to their surgery to essentially keep their left over tissue afterwards which we then gave to researchers. Essentially, middle men in the area of human tissue research lol. OUtside of that, I also helped perserve and prep tissue for transport, searched records to find suitable candidates for collection, and assisted in industry research for medical device testing. I should put here that my supervisor and boss told me to my face that I was the best student worker and that they loved working with me. They even gave me (a student worker) a holiday bonus (of 50 dollars, but it was still thoughtful to me lmao). Also during college I worked as a tutor, volunteered at the hospital (168 hours, which sounds like a lot but if you check out r/premed that's nothing), did community outreach events where I educated on lab science topics (where does your blood go?).

Issue:

With my certification I can work at most any hospital as a lab tech which pays 40-70k (hourly though) depending on the region. However, the idea of working at the bench for the rest of my life where I get no holidays or even much time off sounds miserable. Especially since MLSs are not exactly respected due to the the fact that it is a female dominated profession and has long been pushed out of the public and often literally into basements. I love working with people and helping others, I especially like sharing my knowledge. I love medicine, but I also think it would be fascinating to study a more historical/sociological place of lab medicine (something I think isn't researched very often, but that falls into history of medicine, maybe). I definitely see myself furthering my education but I'm not sure what path I should take. I love teaching, but I'm not sure where to start since I never really planned on going the academia route. Advice and suggestions regarding how to start this and where to look for programs would be much appreciated.",29Jul2020,1
50,"I am the president of my college sorority. Like many collegiate chapters we are primarily white, as are the rest of the chapters in our panhellenic council. The George Floyd and BLM protests have shed a lot of light on some disturbing problems with in the greek life community which I am personally embarrassed we have not addressed sooner. I recognize this as a failure of my chapter and I am doing my best to educate myself on the subject. This is proving to be a more difficult task than expected. We are having several panhellenic wide ""diversity discussions"" but all of these discussions are white women talking about ways to make their chapters more diverse. I don't feel like I am learning anything about the experience that people of color have on college campuses and I do not believe the diversity increasing methods discussed are based in a genuine desire for inclusivity. It seems like a lot of tokenism and performance activism to me. I want to create meaningful change in my organization but I want to do so respectfully with out offending anyone or pandering. One of the best ways I think this can be done is completely changing the way we recruit new members. As you may have guessed, a significant portion of our recruitment process is based on appearance. I have always been fundamentally against this but I unfortunately have very little control of our recruitment process. My national organization exercises nearly complete control over our recruitment process and when I questioned their methods they told me ""this is how the chapter does it every year"" and they completely boxed me out of decision making regarding which members we should take. Another way I thought of helping the issue would be to have mixers with our multi-cultural greek council on campus. Covid-19 does not allow for any mixers on my campus and we could get in a lot of trouble from my university for hosting any sort of event. I feel very lost and honestly sad/disappointed in myself that I can't come up with better solutions but, I'm committed to improving the state of my chapter. Obviously I will take any and all advice but I would especially appreciate advice from BIPOC members on your college experience and what would help you feel more included?

They haven't gotten almost any followers and were pretty down about it, but their new idea is to pump thousands of dollars into equipment and even employees, under the false notion that money and effort = value. They are adamant about making enough money to quit their day job in a few months.

58,"I got r*ped by my aunts bf and now I have difficulty trusting others

I(13f) used to live with my aunt who was very abusive.

She would let her bf r*pe me and he would pay her when he did it. I got a really bad infection from the damage he caused and I had to get an abortion after the last time. I told the doctor about what had happened and I was taken away from them. My best friend’s mom ended up taking me in and I have been very happy with them.

That being said I have really bad trust issues with anyone who I’m not close with and wake up from nightmares about my aunt and her bf. It’s really affecting my life and my therapy isn’t helping much, what should I do",29Jul2020,1
59,"Hello guys, I don’t know if that’s the right place to post this but I hope it is.

This afternoon I (22M) got mugged by 3 dudes; to make the story short I was getting out of my appointment with the doctor and met those nice people. I tried to play it cool but I felt something off right away. In the end after I tried to gently keep walking, one of the dudes told me « look me right in the eyes, I have a knife on me, if you scream or if you run I stab you » then asked for my AirPods. I just said « ok », took them and gave it to him. Another guy tried to check my pockets but I kinda stopped him, telling I had nothing on me, that my phone was crap. In the end it kinda worked, one of the three dudes said something like « come on he said he had nothing let’s go » and it basically ended after this. I came back 30 minutes later with a friend to try to make it right but they were gone.

I talked about it with my friend, I’m not traumatized or anything I don’t think, I was a bit mad but pretty calm right after the incident. 
That’s why I’m here, I’d like to know if there is anything I could have done better. My friend says that I’m too nice which I agree with, it started with them asking for a cigaret and I accepted hoping that would be it. My friend said I could have tried to run or push/punch the tall one and run, and still I kinda agree with him even tho the knife threat was in my head (looking back at it I don’t think there was a knife at all, but who knows)

I know I took the safest bet but i kinda feel weak now, I didn’t try to run or anything really, I just said ok and went on with it. I’ve been boxing for a little less then a year, but truthfully I wasn’t feeling like fighting, even tho I started to be able to defend myself and the one I care about. 

I don’t know what to think really, either accept that I’m not the strong fighting type, or try to become it. 
I just wish I didn’t panic when it happened even if I stayed pretty controlled, I still had my hands shaking and my legs weak. 

Any insight, from someone who dealt with something similar, or someone who knows self defense, would be greatly appreciated to eventually figure out what to do next or what could I have done better. Thank you guys.",29Jul2020,1

64,Can someone outside of my situation help me out. I have been wanting to volunteer at a nursing home for years. I just turned 17 and I have one year of highschool left. I think I want to be a nurse. I don’t know what being a nurse would actually be like though. I have been thinking that if I go volunteer then I can get a better idea. I was going to figure it out before summer but that never happened because I was trying to stay focused on my grades even though school was online and stuff. When the virus was really being taken seriously I couldn’t volunteer at a nursing home full of vulnerable people. So I have been waiting. Then recently I have been getting ready to finally call them. My mom is really manipulative and she is making this very difficult. She knows that I am terrified of phone calls and that’s a big reason why I have been stalling. I got serious about calling them recently though. I did call but it went to voicemail and I can’t find their hours. I was going to call again today but then my mom said that I wouldn’t have a way to get to town. I swear she told me that my grandparents would drive me. Even her friends have offered but now it feels like she is trying to ruin my chances. All I do is sit at home and I feel useless. I really wanted to do this for the summer and everything is so frustrating. She is telling me that I will be ruining her plans and keeping her stuck at home if I do it because she will have to drive me. She says she never told me that we could “figure it out” and that I could find a ride later. Then I keep asking her about it because I’m seriously confused about what’s going on. She screams at me “call them then” but in a time where it sounds like she wants to rip my head off. I’ve never had a job or anything because my parents always do this to me. They won’t help me and they get pushed off when I try to help myself. Why should I have to spend my whole summer sitting at home bored or being stuck in my head camping. That’s another reason why. We are always camping and I hate it. I find it quite depressing to be in the middle of nowhere with no friends with me. It’s just not fun anymore. I really need volunteering stuff to get into university too. My grades are good but I have to write a personal profile thing for my application and I have nothing to put on it. Should I finally just figure this out on my own so she can’t stop me?,29Jul2020,1

69,"I understand that everyone has sexual urges, but I feel as though as if mine are more powerful than I am able to control. It started as soon as I started puberty. I started to have strong, sexual thoughts of many of my friends. I would masturbate multiple times a day to these thoughts. It wasn't long before I started masturbating to pictures of my friends. Eventually, I had the foresight to save these images. I never gave up the habit. I couldn't let go of these images. They think these images are long gone, but I still have them. Now, as an adult, I have volumes of pictures of my friends, categorized by name, going back to middle school. The best ones are from the girls that I keep in touch with. It turns me on so much talking to them knowing that I've spent the majority of my life blowing loads to them.

For the past year, I have gotten more brazen in seeking my sexual release. I started altering the images so that they appear nude in the photos. I get really turned on by humiliating them, so I started sharing the images online to strangers. Nude and non-nude. Of age and underage. All of it. Sometimes, I would get back the images with their cum on them or with their penis splayed on the images. In the community, this is a sign of appreciation. I saved these images.

Then, I started to get even more brazen. If I like humiliating them so much, then shouldn't I let them know what's going on? I set up anonymous, private accounts on various social media. I started sending them pictures of themselves drenched in cum or with a hard cock proudly displayed over them. The best ones are with images that they thought long gone years ago or the fake nudes that they didn't even know existed. I revel in imagining the humiliation they must feel when they see it. Whether they respond or not, I can at least tell that they saw it when they block me. I love it so much. As soon as I send it, I've succeeded.

The best part of it all is that no one suspects me. It's not that I'm invisible. It's that I've spent years cultivating an image of someone that would never do this. I knew early on in life that I would have to do this if I wanted to sustainably have avenues to relieve my sexual urges for a long time. I championed myself as someone that would never hurt women. I advocated for woman's rights since I was still a teenager, and not in a fake way. Not in way that most men do it. I wasn't virtue signalling or doing it just cause I wanted admiration from woman. Not on the surface at least. I knew just what to say to make it sound genuine, to earn their trust, to make myself look like an ally. I have held up this farce for so long that I have gained access to the woman's inner circle. They talk to me about their girl problems. They talk to me about their periods, relationships, sexual awakenings, etc. What I really love to hear, is when they tell me about this weird account that sent them these weird pictures. I see the fear in their eyes. I see how scared and tense they are by these images. They are terrified, and why wouldn't they be? They get dick pics all the time, but these are different. This is a different type of violation. There's someone out there that has these pictures that they haven't thought about in years, and some of them are nude. How could someone be obsessed enough to keep these images and fake them being naked? I could, and they have no idea. I get an intimate, raw look into all these complex feeling of fear and humiliation. My favorite part is how the source of all those feelings is right in front of them, and they are none the wiser. It turns me on so much.

Recently, I can't help but plan to get more brazen. I know them so intimately that they have no problem telling me their work schedules and their problems at home. In my head, I can't help but graph those that would be easiest to rape. The smallest ones, with the most late work schedules, and the most dysfunctional families are the best meat. Its easy to get them alone, and they don't trust their families enough to tell them if they got raped. I can just imagine them recounting their rape to me not knowing their rapist is right in front of them. It'll be the same feeling as before, but so much better.

I can picture it right now. I strike as they load their stuff in the trunk at the end of their work day. I approach from behind without being noticed. They set their stuff down. I take it away so that they can't reach their phone or pepper spray. I gag them. I do the deed there, from behind. Mask on. No way they can get a good look at me. Gloves on. Condom on. Hairnet under hat. Can't leave any DNA evidence. When I'm done, I tie them up in such a way that they eventually free themselves. I'm long gone by then. I know how to tie knots like that. I've been practicing.

I want to mark them in some way while they're distracted. Maybe get a tattoo gun or a stick and poke and mark them with a single black dot. Maybe its their hand or their neck. They don't notice. They're too distracted. I have marked them. As I start getting more practice, I start targeting my tougher friends. That way, my social circle is eventually comprised of nothing but my marked kills. They bond with me over their trauma. They are tainted by me now. They don't know that though. They are literary marked by me. I have them all by invisible leashes that no one knows I hold. That is my ultimate goal.

How do I get rid of these thoughts?",29Jul2020,1

71,"Sorry for the crappy mobile format, the lenght and scrambly sentences, I'm still feeling a bit weird.

I'll try to make it short. My (21F) 3 closest friends B, A, S (20F) and I are staying at my parents (mom and 2nd stepdad) house. I haven't lived with them, and never have in this still not totally finished house, for nearly 2 years, but my sister D(24F), her BF and my half-sister J (11F) do live here with them. We had planned something else but due to covid, this was a last resort to us not having to just give up on our vacation plans.

When I proposed this I kind of also wanted to use this trip as proof that the bad home years are behind us. A lot of stuff happened to mostly me, my sister and my mom. Let's just say CPS got involved way too late when I was 16 and we would've been taken away if the 6 weeks of like 5-10h a week therapy/mediation hadn't worked as well as it did. Big messy divorce when I was 1-6, multiple moves, abusive 1st stepdad, mom kind-off repeating his behaviour when he left and throughout all this; various serious mental health problems that went untreated. Some other stuff happened too but that's not relevant. I know by now my mom simply couldn't do better back then and through trial and error she is now able to be an okay mom for J and is clearly trying to do her best for me and D. For us two however, this is sometimes hard to see because of all the abuse and neglect we've gotten used to and the trauma's that surround my mom. Therefore; proof I can have a great time with my mom.

Mentally, I was great when I left home, but then stuff happened and now I have been jobless and sick at home for 1,5 month because of corona aftermath or my body simply collapsing due to all the unprocessed years of trauma's and stress or just both. I am smoking weed pretty much every evening my BF or someone else doesn't stay over to help with the symptoms and overthinking, but I tire super easily, often get over-stimulated and disassociate every so often. I've shared all this of course with A, B and S but only B knows my history semi-thoroughly and knew me from before I left home, but I have a hard time sharing my acute feelings and don't like talking to anyone about my home situation too much apart from D. To be honest I don't know that well how much B knows since my memories from before I left home are pretty sparse. Because of my current situation I've been able to hide pretty well whatever has been going on, but I don't know if I should due to the seriousness.

As I am typing this it is tuesdaynight, I've taken melatonin and still can't sleep. It started on saturday, the night before I came here. I couldn't sleep and hallucinated both in vision and hearing, although I thought it was due sleep paralysis. (I've had that once before, I have'nt actually hallucinated in like 3 years since I got my insomnia more managable, but I am somewhat accustomed to having like 2-3 trains of thoughts running through my brain which could either be my diagnosed ADHD or seperate personalities) When I woke up again I got bombarded by whispers and also the feeling that my boyfriend wasn't real, even as I was laying in his arms. I believed it for a bit when I was under the shower. I told him about the sleep paralysis, not about the whispers about him. When I told him, the whispers stopped. I disassociated a quite bit more on sunday but I didn't think much of it, I was still able to enjoy myself when I traveled the 2h with S to my parents house and somehow slept fine that night. Monday throughout the day B and A arrived as well and I don't remember hallucinating or any weird or disproportionate feelings. I was a lot more prickly in the evening but that just as well could've been being overstimulated and tired. When we went to bed however and everyone got quiet, I thought I heard S crying. I asked her if she was okay, she was confused by this and was like ""yeah?"" So I told her I thought I heard her crying, she reassured me she was fine and not crying. I couldn't sleep however as the crying kept going and I got more and more anxious with my thoughts becoming more erratic. I got out of bed to get some water but as soon as I stood, my mind became blank and my body just locked. After this it's a bit fuzzy but I remember running all throughout the house softly like an animal while my mind was just screaming ""HIDE HIDE HIDE HIDE HIDE HIDE"" over and over again. When I kind of came to I was very numb and in the middle of softly singing an endless song to the moon/myself in the most unfinished room in the house and had some scratches on me I didnt have before. I had a hard time directing myself back to bed but when I got there, about 2h had passed. I curled myself up against the wall like a cat and eventually managed to sleep for 3h.

I don't want to worry my friends, I believe I haven't hallucinated since and still can function like before, im just a bit more quiet, prone to zoning out and emotionally numb and void. I don't know if this is actually a psychosis, but it reminds me of what I saw in a friend of mine who had a psychosis. I don't want to go home and cut our vacation short since I feel like I can function just fine and it's not like only I can go home early or something. Of course I am telling my mental health worker this as soon as I see him. I don't remember experiencing anything like this before, but my stepdad has told me that I had a personality switch and talk with him a few months before I moved out. If I catch myself hallucinating again I will tell someone probably, but now I just don't know. I don't want to but I feel like my friends, especially B, would be mad and concerned if they discovered I kept this from them. I just want my friends and I to enjoy our vacation, and maybe be in denial a bit more about how bad my mental health has apparently/possibly gotten (again). What should I do?",29Jul2020,1

80,"Hello people! Right know, I (19 M) am walking home with  nighty moon (it's 01:28 a.m.) and something caught my attention. A vision of memory, that happened in the blink of the eye, while crossing street, gave me some type of childhood throwback. You see, right know, I am walking, to may way to the house, building which is reminder of my whole childhood trauma. Before I even start, I would love you to aclnowledge that I am non-native English speaker, soo there will be some words you won't understand...It's not your fault, afterall I am high and drunk at the moment.

As I said, I had some shitty things that happened In my days of childhood's purity. My father was alcoholic, an abusive one, my mother is/was victim of whole family(father's side) and is batshit believer in magic and astrology, frankly fanatic one, my sister found her love and thus moved to another country and my brother is highly working and smart guy. Then, there is me, the youngest one. Since my early days I was aware of my surrounding. Me and my family are living alongside my father's brothers, father(who was also alcoholic), mother(who initially wanted to abort my father) and some others cousins. We all have our houses and yards, but we never had our homes. Living in the same street made It even worse.There is that fake family atmosphere going everywhere in air which Is poising me everyday. My father as I said abused us, neglected us and most hurting one: he loved more to spend his time with hookers than his oen children and wife. The most extreme thing he tried to do was attempt of killing my mother bcs he tought she cheated on him??? Whish was not baised on any clue or fact, It was his alcoholic episode. My mother ofcourse believed that someone put black magic on him(and by someone I think his mother) soo she engaged ""white magic user""...lol... to undo any ""black magic attack"" performed on my father. Yes, you may think that I made this up, but believe me I would love that this is all part of my imagination. This was last of many incidents that occured in my family. After that, situation changed totally, It took some crazy, good-story turn...my father, as he Is aging, Is more family oriented and more loving figure in my life. Things were going pretty well, they are now to, but in spirit of 2020. my sister suddenly left our home to move with her husband and my brother one morning had ruptured duodenal ulcer which was pretty traumatic as I found him chocking in  a pool of blood. All these events made me someone who I am today. Strong but insecure, smart but shy, protective but unprotected. I don't think that I will ever succeed, eventhough at the end of september I will start at university and everyone around me have high expectation.

I struggled a little with whether or not I should tell her, I came to the decision to tell her incase something happened, or it came back to bite her in the ass.

84,"I was in a Snapchat group chat with about 10 people, all but one I knew. The one I didn’t know started an argument and then I ended it. Then after (a few hours later) he posted what looked like CP. Even everyone in the chat was taken aback. The next day I sent the report and then I told one of my friends that was in the group chat about what I had done and he told everyone but the person who sent it pretty much. Then someone told him about it and then after he freaked out we told him it was a joke, but it wasn’t. I told everyone that I didn’t send it since my phone died. Just a few days ago I got a call from the FBI asking me for more info and giving me a case number to say if I need an update. Then I got a text from my local PD asking me if I knew where this guy lived, I don’t know so said that. They thanked me and moved on. I feel really guilty because this person is under 18, and I feel like I ruined his life. I know that it was probably the right thing to do anyway but I still feel terrible. Beyond that actually.

91,"So for context when I started going to college I met a new group of friends and this person and I really hit it off. We would hang out constantly and do things usually with other people around but eventually it became just the two of us and we got really close. About a year after we met the topic of dating came up and we decided to try, we were already super close so why not just see where it went, right? 

Wrong. Not even two weeks later it all fell apart over some stupid mistakes and miscommunication on both of our parts. Luckily we didn't tell most of out friendgroup just in case things went south so only bojt three people knew what happened. After the initial breakup we talked about what happened and why and everything seemed alright, we weren't back together just back to speaking terms. Its been a few weeks and we still see each other every now and again and we still occasionally talk but everything just seems so off. I can't seem to feel comfortable anymore around them, like I try to joke the way I used to but every time later I feel bad for some reason like maybe I shouldn't even be around them. A big problem is that they're living most of the friend group so it's not like I can just avoid them, not that I really want too. I just want things to go back to before I guess but it seems like that isn't really possible.

95,"Things have been really difficult lately and, i'm not really sure what to do. It's all just so confusing for me to process and really decide on what to do.

 To start, there's this one girl who I really miss, for some reason. I don't know her too well, though she is someone who I oddly care a lot about. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I'll just talk about some of my interactions with her:

 *-The first time I met her, was in my freshmen year of High School. We shared a class together, I didn't really talk to her all that much. However, there was a new seating arrangement and a good friend of hers got put next to me. Her friend didn't seem to do well with being a part from her so, she started crying. The girl came over and asked me if I would be willing to switch seats with her the next day, I agreed to, mostly because her friend was upset with being apart from her. Though, her friend was still upset and kept saying that she didn't want the girl to go yet. Seeing how distraught her friend was, I asked to switch that day and we ended up switching that day.*

 *-Two years after, she took notice that my hands were all scratched up, red and really hurting me (I never mentioned them hurting, I guess she just took notice). She made a habit of checking daily and scolding me to go get them treated, this went on for about three months. My hands started getting so bad that I started to draw blood from how scarred and raw they were, this is when she started to really get on my case and express her worry. Talking about how she'd drag me to the clinic herself, whether I wanted to or not. While I didn't really care too much about my own health, I started to really feel bad for her worrying about me so, me and my mother argued all day until she finally agreed to let me go the next day (I've tried asking her to go before but, my mom just kept brushing it off). Needless to say, she was very happy when I told her the next day.*

 *-Before the lock-downs happened, i'll just say that I was doing so great, mentally and just generally not having a good time. So many things happened and I've never been so stressed out. I didn't talk too much to anyone about it, only two people and I guess some of the teachers knew. Even though nobody else who I talked to really knew what was going on, I made it so obvious because I was just so damn tired and upset about the things that might happen, plus my mental state was the worse it's ever been at the time. Though, I guess she just sensed that something was off about me and would make sure I was okay almost every morning. She would hug me a lot too so, I guess she really helped me out, even of she didn't know what was going on.*

Those were the most notable times I remember about her, the rest is just a lot of small talk. I can kinda understand why the things she did made an impact on me but, I didn't think she affected me this much.

2. For quite a while I was debating with myself on asking to hang out with her. The issue is that, i'm actually really scared of asking. I know she would probably tell me if she had no interest in getting to know each other outside of school, but I've had bad experiences with asking people like getting ghosted randomly, blatantly lying (It wouldn't hurt if they were honest), always saying ""Yes, i'd love too!"" but constantly forgetting/ditching me on the day, etc etc. I'm just sick of putting in effort when they can't even give me a straight answer. It left a bad taste in my mouth for people after all of that happened with others. I'm just so scared and unsure.                                                                                   
Plus, I wasn't there for basically the whole week and didn't really see her since, my own mental state was off the rails at the time. I only popped into the classes where something important happened and left after that. The kicker is, when I didn't go that Friday, I decided that on Monday i'd ask her. Even if I was scared of her not giving me a straight answer, it didn't hurt to try. Then the lock-down was announced just a few minutes after I made that decision (I'm not even joking, it legitimately happened right after). So, I don't know if that's a sign or what. 

3. After we graduate, I want to try to restart my life. Things like cut off basically all contact (save for one or two people, maybe), change my name, try and find a collage anywhere else except my home city, and move out as soon as I can. Since I plan on doing all that once i'm out of high school, it makes me want to push everyone away by then end of the year. I can't afford to have too strong of a tie to someone, in case I hurt them badly after I go.

I want to act more cold, uncaring and build my walls up so high that nobody will really know me too well anymore (I don't actually mean to, I just want to put up that front so, it's easier to push people away). So i'm trying to stop caring about trying to get to know that the girl, because I have this weird feeling that i'll end up too attached to her.

Not to mention that I can't tell if I just want to try to be friends, I like like her or i'm just lonely. I've missed her ever since it started and I really do hope that she's doing okay. Lately, however, she's been crossing my mind a lot. Usually whenever I can't sleep, I just imagine how she hugged me and it makes me feel warm, and I drift off easily (I'm sorry if that sounded creepy or weird). Maybe i'm just touch-starved and that's why it feels nice but, I just don't know. I don't even want to know because then it'll be even more difficult to leave everything behind me.

&amp;#x200B;

106,"My family is suffering a lot. We are in a place where a lot of people around us have LOADS of money, and are extremely religious... we have always believed in just working and dealing with our own problems, not asking for others to step in. I was raised to believe if yoh just work hard enough, you can make anything happen. And now I’m finding myself in a place that this just isn’t true. 

The church we used to go to is HUGE and has several houses they use for various purposes - missionaries, people without a home temporarily, families from out of town with medical problems, etc. At least, that’s what I’ve been told. I don’t know what they have for sure, as it is kept rather secret. We also know several
Millionaires (literally). We are at a point now that we feel it’s imperative we ask for help, but we don’t know how to do it without being offensive or sound expectant. No one owes us anything, not at all. We feel so ashamed. But we are very capable to make a reaL change in our lives if we get some help...two things we know would make it all happen (and yes, I know these are big) - 
1. Housing for 1 year while we save rent money for a down payment on a house or
2. Housing so my husband can get his degree and therefore get a good job to support our family better.

in 2012 i started having pelvic pain and back pain. i was constipated. i kept going to the ER and they never found anything. my pain was coming from my bladder area. the area where the pubic hair is at. then one day in 2015 i couldn't urinate and needed a catheter. i went to the Urologist and he was rude. he didn't find anything and asked me to stop going to his office because he has other patient with more important problems. so i went to another urologist in 2017 and i had prostatitis. i had a prostate infection and the second urologist found it by semen samples. the first urologist didn't ask for semen samples. through out it i still had constipation and that never went away. 

&amp;#x200B;

fast forward to 2018. i started having stomach pains and constipation. i was having trouble creating a stool. this went on since 2012 but slowly it started getting worse. remember the constipation came with the prostatitis. the prostatitis is under control now but the constipation remained. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 i saw a **Gastroenterologist. he said my constipation was due to not having enough protein. but that never went away. it don't matter how much protein i would intake and the protein powder didn't work either. then things got worse. the constipation was causing stomach pain. since i was constipated and i couldnt create a stool that causes a problem because the food has to come out. he did a colonoscopy and found nothing. the pain started digressing to my chest and abdominal and my rib cage. ive been having trouble digesting food, my stomach would get full fast and bloated for no reason. there are days where i have to stay without eating only because my stomach feels full when i havent ate. when i drink water it still gets full and my stomach starts to hurt so obviously theres a problem. all i can eat was seaweed. no one should have to live like that. i saw a second  Gastroenterologist and he ordered a upper gi endoscopy. before my appointment things got worse. i went to the ER 3 days ago. they found nothing. they thought it was covid-19 causing the chest pain but i tested positive and they send me home with the chest pain and didn't do anything. i was there for 8 hours doing blood work after blood work and i went home at 3 in the morning still not feeling well. once i got home i couldn't sleep because the pain got worse. i broke night. my stool started coming out black, really black. i never had black stool before, my chest pain stopped and it went back to my stomach. my stomach felt like it was about to explode. it felt like something trying to rip open my stomach. i rushed to the er. they took a stomach scan but found nothing. again not finding anything. so i called my new Gastroenterologist. he actually came into the emergancy room to see me and talk to me. he gave me an emergency appointment to get the upper gi the following day. so after he left i remember i had to use the bathroom. after i got in the bathroom a whole river of diarrhea came out. after it came out my stomach felt much better and 80 percent of the pain went away. but im still constipated and my stools are coming out black.** 

**i went to my appointment and my new Gastroenterologist did the upper gi. everything looked normal but he took some samples from inside my stomach so they could test at a lab.everyone keeps saying ""it looks normal"" so why am i having these problems?? although im waiting for the results to my pathology test (samples they took) im kinda worried, say if they dont find anything like before. how long i have to live like this. i can't eat because once i try to eat something my stomach gets full fast and that pain comes back. im hungry now but cant eat because my stomach hurts and feels full.**

111,"My parents are overly protective. They're also immigrants, so I guess that contributes to some of it. They've always been hovering around me, but never my brother. To give some insight to what kind of child I am, I earned an AA degree and high school diploma by June of this year. I've never shown that I am not trustworthy. They are able to trust my younger brother. They are acting like I am a child. Even when I was a child, they never allowed me to just go to a friend's house like normal. I would have to have my dad present while I was playing with my friend in 5th grade. When my brother wanted to hang out, they'd just let him walk by himself to his friend's house. I could never have sleepovers, even when I was in elementary school because my dad thought sleepovers meant doing drugs?! So I've just generally missed out on a lot of the teenager/typical childhood experiences.

My therapist and I had a talk about how suffocated I feel inside the house because of the lockdown. My dad wouldn't even let me go for a walk around the neighborhood.  My therapist and him had to have a 30 minute conversation just so I am able to go have a walk around the neighborhood. I went out for a walk alone today (with a mask) and I had my phone on me as well as keys. My parents have TWO GPS tracking apps on my phone, so they know where I am at all times. My younger brother DOES NOT have a GPS tracking app on his phone and he regularly goes to the park just to play basketball, even inviting friends. I told my grandmother before I left the house that I am going to a walk around the neighborhood to x park and will probably be back in 30 minutes. My parents freaked out when they came home and yelled at me, asking me what I was doing, who I was with, where I went, how long I was out for, and got mad at me for not telling them that I went out today. I already told my grandmother when I left the house. I would like to point out that they are not freaking out more because of the coronavirus and that they have always freaked out like this whenever I've had to go out. My room is right next to theirs and I can hear them ranting about me. My dad's saying he hopes some shit happens to me so that I know not to go out alone again. 

It's so suffocating getting barely any privacy, but the fact I am not allowed to take a 30 minute walk around the neighborhood when I've already asked for permission, told my grandmother, and have two GPS trackers on me is ridiculous. I'm about to be 18 years old and I've never once proven I am a ""bad"" kid (no drinking, no drugs, no parties, no illegal activities). The most ""bad"" teenager thing I've done was date 1 guy for 5 years. They are hovering like crazy, but my brother never gets this treatment. 

What do I do? Am I being unreasonable or too bratty of a kid? I can't even talk to them because they just want to argue and yell at me. They can't take what I say at face value. It's to the point my therapist had to have a conversation for me because they can't just see me as my own person. When I have tried to have conversations with my parents, it always ends in them yelling at me. My therapist tried having the same conversation with my dad and he ACTUALLY listened to her, but not me.

112,"Recently our neighborhood has gotten shadier. I’ve only been able to take the trash out at night and I’ve been approached once now by strange men while taking out the trash. 

Sometimes when winter is bad I’ll ask the neighbor to take out the trash but not much more than that. 

The fiancé of one of the three people who we share the trash can with is sketchy to say the least we don’t trust him. We always hire someone to take out the trash when we go out of town so they don’t know we’re gone. We are also moving in the next year. We have debated taking our trash to the dump ourselves but we currently can’t do that. 

Should we be the only person responsible for taking the trash to the curb and bringing it back in? Or should we try to find a way to negotiate with them? 

Know that this would be a hard conversation to have because they are not the most reasonable people and they are causing for us to move from this duplex to another in six months.  

I don’t know why I feel frustrated when I can’t get the trash cans pulled in, in a timely manner or I have to take them out early. Also they have three dogs two are ex-fighting dogs that are frightened by trash cans. So much so they pounce on me while on the leash if they are coming back from a walk when I take out the trash.

It comes to a point where if I don’t dream about him I think about him and when I don’t think about him at all I dream about him. I’ve blocked him everywhere because there was one day I even found out about his parents name and where they worked and where he lives even and it made me feel so sick concerned about myself.

114,"As the title says, I picked up a flashdrive in my University's library five years ago. I just found it in an old backpack, plugged it into my computer thinking it was mine and realized it is not. I don't specifically remember when I ended up with this in my possession, I'm assuming I found it in the library, meant to bring it to the desk but didn't for some reason.

I looked through what was on the flashdrive (because I didn't immediately recognize that none of the stuff was mine) and found out who the owner was. One Facebook search later and I now have a way to contact her. Do I? Pretty much everything on the flashdrive was school related but there was a sensitive document (the one that let me figure out who she was) but I mean that is also half a decade old.

I feel really bad that I never turned it in so she could have found it when it would have been useful",29Jul2020,1

116,"Can I get an outside opinion pls? I (23F)already think I'm delusional living at home. Lately, my mom has suddenly started referring to her business as ""ours"" and chewing me out all the time for not helping her. To be fair, while I have no experience with that type of business, I'm pretty sure she's doing an... inefficient job of it to put it lightly. But thing is, I have helped her out since like January of this year and called it quits in like late May because I would end up sitting in a hot un-air-conditioned house every weekend while being called ungrateful and being made fun of for helping her because I was""so useless I couldn't even hold a broom.""

Plus at a certain point, it seemed like I was just going there so she wouldn't get bored, and so that my weekend would be ruined too. Anytime she worked without me, she would harass me about it after and say snarky things about me being a princess and a brat and even called me a bitch twice which is honestly a line that's never been crossed in my family because I dared to say that I was busy and had my job to do.

I've gotten painfully close to job offers that would have let me become independent, but since those didn't happen, I'm currently a low-wage worker who has to live at home. So because I too am tired at the end of the week, I offered to pay her rent instead of helping at her business, and because I occasionally wanted to actually see my significant other and friends. She blew up and told me I had to help her with the business, and I was literally confused because of what's left (actually it seems like everything is up and running fine) I don't think I'm even remotely qualified to do.

She then yelled at me for not finding the right specialists and handymen, and other professionals to help, while she watches around 5 hours of TV a day, and her daytime job takes about 4 hours maximum 3 days a week only. She's also started dropping hints about me supporting her retirement. She doesn't ever ask me for anything, she is nasty and emotionally abusive, and in general, I'd move out, and keep to minimal contact if I could. I honestly suspect that she is jealous that I'm young, and am finally starting to see some success in life, and that I have a significant other and she puts me down at every turn it seems. **So I want to know, do I owe her this?** I know she needs help but in general, what she wanted should have taken I'm guessing no more than 3 months, and I'm sick of being vilified for wanting to live my own life.",29Jul2020,1
117,"I know this might not be a good use of your time reading this, but ask the title says, I really don’t know what to do. 
I’ve been trying to become a vegetarian, and I’m still at the age (i’m under 15) where I need to clear things with my parents to do them. We eat meat a lot, and yesterday I talked with my mom about it, and she got kinda mad, but later on she cooled down and said it’s okay for me to not eat chickens ( i used chickens as an example when I was talking to her about me becoming a vegetarian), but I didn’t mention that I wanted to stop eating all meat. I want to tell my mom and dad that, but they already think I am a picky eater to start with, and I’m worried that if I tell them that I want to stop eating all meat, they will get really mad at me. Last night we had pork chop and salad. I tried to just eat the salad, but my mom still thinking that I only want to stop eating chicken, made me had some. I ate a piece, but I just felt guilty eating an animal, because I’m an animal lover. The thing is though, I didn’t want to stop eating it because I didn’t want an animal to be killed and not fully eaten, because that would be a waste of an animal’s life. I feel like us and those animals that we eat are all the same, but even if not a lot of people reading this might agree with me, I just imagine if it were switched, I wouldn’t want an animal chopping me up to have for dinner. I see why predators do that, because it is just their way of survival, and that is also like us humans, but it’s not like animals have grocery stilted to go to to get salad and vegetables for dinner ( i’m starting to feel like i’m getting off topic so i’m just going to jump back to what i’m trying to say), I just really don’t know what to do, because I really think that I can be a full on vegetarian, but I feel like my mom and dad will think that it would be too much work for dinner, because we have meat quite often, but I just want myself to stop eating animals, because it will make me feel better, I just don’t know how to tell my parents that, and it’s not like I can just show them this post (Sorry that I did a run on sentence, it’s one of the things i need to work on, but please give me advice)",29Jul2020,1

I like anime I used to be more into it but it’s still cool and I like hentai. I’m a 17 year old girl and my boyfriend is very very into anime which I think is super chill :) but he has his best girls and wifuu’s which he really likes and has figures of some of them. I get really insecure because sometimes he says they are cute or he gets excited about them and will say shit about them and call them best girl jokes how he wants pillows of them and shit. And I don’t think he’s doing anything wrong and don’t wanna make him feel bad so I don’t bring up how much it hurts me. But it hurts so bad probably coz I have low self esteem. But, I thought I’d ask some guys probably like that what you would feel if your girl said it really hurt them and made them insecure because he tells me they aren’t real so I shouldn’t worry, but they are so perfect and made to be that way and also he likes yanderes a lot too and I always feel when I try and out on a cute anime voice for him or act submissive that I’m just acting like some bitch he likes and get mad. I even bought a bunny suit so I could dress up for him like Mai. He loves it but I feel degraded.

121,"I work at a vape shop and have been here for like a week and a half. This was my second shift in the store completely alone. This customer came in (in his 60’s probably) doesn’t vape and handed me a list of things (a battery and a coil) he needed for his friend. I don’t have much knowledge yet of our coils/batteries so I told him straight up I’m not too sure and I’m new but I can call the guy who trained me and see what he thinks. Well my trainer never picked up and the guy then told me “well is there anybody else you can call?”. I told him no I don’t have anybody else’s number in my phone partially because I’m new.  I even looked up the coil on the computer and found out it was compatible but he didn’t want to risk wasting $20 because I’m new. I told him to maybe come back at 2PM because my coworker who has more knowledge will be in to help. The guy was frustrated and told me he doesn’t have time because his lunch break is only 12:00-12:30.

Anyways that was in the morning and this guy came back near closing and told my coworker (guy who trained me) who was sitting outside of the store “I wanted this list of things but your coworker didn’t have a clue what to do.” The guy comes in surprised, pointed at me and said “Oh wow that’s the guy!”. I apologized again and said I’m new and that I would’ve helped him if I had more knowledge/experience. The customer got his things thanks to my trainers help and left. My trainer then kind of ignored me the rest of the shift/was very short with me. I felt like he was mad at me or thought I was incompetent. Thing is is my trainer always tells me that if I don’t know something that I can call him if I ever have questions and that he can literally talk to the customer for me if it’s not something I’m 100% sure on. We have a no return policy too so I don’t want to risk somebody buying a coil and not having it work. 

At the same time tho I feel like I’m making up excuses for my actions and maybe after a week and a half I should have the knowledge of the coils down. I feel like shit and a bad employee. I’m very paranoid I’ll get fired because of this. :( All I want is a job I’m good at. I’ve been trying to study the coils while alone in the shop but it’s taking me time to understand it.

124,"Hello!

I'll just put it out there; my younger sister, 11, just told me she likes boys and girls. I don't know if she just thinks that or if she actually is attracted to both genders and therefore bisexual. She has it now in her head that she's gay. However, given her young age, I feel like she only thinks she is. She hasn't had any relationships because one, she's 11 and two, she is not allowed. 

Here are my questions:

How do I know she is really bisexual if she hasn't had any relationships at all?

What can I do to make her understand that she is too young to figure these things out right now?

When she told me she liked boys and girls, I was accepting, yet thrown off guard. She never talks about liking anybody. Whenever I ask her if she has a crush, she isn't very forthcoming and I can understand that because it can feel kind of embarrassing to talk about these things even though they're normal. 

I just don't want her to confuse herself and think that she is bisexual, without knowing herself.",29Jul2020,1

129,"I (F16) was on my way to ball practice at one of the local parks and had parked my car much further away from everyone else at the edge of the park. There was a house across the street and two adults sitting on the house steps (I think they were drinking) while they watched two kids (probably around 5 or 6) playing with scooters on the street. I generally try to leave well enough alone but this guy just kept screaming profanities at one of the kids and threating to go down and beat his f****** a**. He kept screaming and swearing as I walked down the sidewalk and by the time they were out of my eyeshot I could here that the kid was screaming and crying as well. I wanted to do something and considered calling the police to maybe just see if they could send a patrol car by. I was able to get the address and location and vaguely mentioned it to my coach (which was surprisingly difficult and made me feel like a naive toddler haha). I've been blessed with great parents all my life but I understand that situations like these are depressingly common these days and are reality for so many people.

When it comes to sports, games, or many types of academics I’m as good as or worse than most of my peers. I keep getting pushed to think I’m not overall good at a lot of things but I am good at something in particular. For example, earlier this year I failed a midterm for a physics class I took and I thought “well maybe I’m not good at physics but I always seem to do really good at math”, but recently I’ve been applying to be a math tutor and I find myself failing topics I thought I was familiar with (though I may just be out of practice). 

I’m not trying to desperately sound like I’m a good fit nothing and ask for sympathy/pity, because there have been times where I’ve done things that even surprised myself, such as ranking all 1013 songs in smash ultimate, watching 61 anime episodes in one day and speedrunning a game for 33 hours. Thus I know I can do some things that many others can’t but Even if I try I won’t be as good as them at what they do. I can do unique things with subjects in school yet still do worse on tests and get worse grades than all the rest of the students. How do I determine what I can uniquely do and also do well?

131,"TL;DR: Insane mother is terrible to her baby and is risking two people’s lives by getting a job that could expose her to COVID.

I’ll try to keep this short, but good god my husband’s sister is INSANE and we can’t get CPS to give the grandmother parental rights. We can’t get them to do anything honestly, it’s appalling.

Basically, my husband’s sister has always been insanely manipulative, entitled, plays the victim, has no concept of love, and she is the most idiotic irresponsible person I have ever met. And my mom has BPD too....

Anyways, dumbass went and got knocked up with no job, no place to stay, no way to take care of the baby.at.all. Her only choice was to move back in with her mom. Of course the family is used to the sister’s crap but ever since she had the baby she has done things like: left the house without notifying anyone (while the baby was sleeping, she’d be gone for HOURS), she doesn’t clean the baby’s bottles, doesn’t change her diaper to the point of the baby getting nasty diaper rash, she yells at the baby, doesn’t know how to play with her, doesn’t bathe her, and just sooooo many other things. One time she took the baby and just ran off. Didn’t pack diapers, food, a coat, had no money etc. 

SO, my husband’s mom (the baby’s grandma) has called CPS many many times and because the baby lives with her CPS always sees the baby has tons of food, toys, decked out bedroom BECAUSE of the baby’s grandma. She does everything for this baby and I mean it. Now, the sister went and got a job (without telling anyone of course) and both the baby and the grandma are extremely at risk of death if they get COVID. The sister absolutely knows this and there is NO reason for her to need a job. The grandma pays for everything including the sisters food, car payment, she doesn’t pay rent, etc. She hasn’t had a job for a long long time and NOW she decides she needs one.

This is so god damn frustrating and I can’t even tell you guys how fucked up this family’s lives are...I mean the grandma is wheel chair bound for God’s sake...

So that was me trying to keep it short....sorry lol. Any advice dealing with similar scenarios would be truly appreciated. Ultimately, what we want is for custody of the baby to go to grandma (she has a partner that helps too) and we want crazy sister to just go away. Even just custody would be amazing but I know this is incredibly hard to do.

Any other ideas would be great, but they can’t kick her out (otherwise the baby may die she has a LOT of heath problems), they can’t just kick the sister out since she is technically a tenant of the house, and the sister knows all this so she just gets away with being shitty all the time.

142,"My now ex girlfriend and I were best friends irl for a few months before we dated and we both couldn’t have been happier 5 out of the 6 months we dated. I say that because in the last month she became really distant and weird talking to me. It got to the point where I wasn’t talking to the girl I fell in love with anymore. Two weekends ago she told me she has basically lost all feelings for me, and in fact has feelings for someone else, so of course we broke up. Because of COVID-19 we could only see each other 3 times over the course of our relationship, all 3 of those were one of us sneaking out. Very recently I realized, very often during our relationship I was so worried about being a good boyfriend I sacrificed my own happiness. The thing is, as I stated before we were best friends before and we both want to stay best friends, but I still have feelings for her, I don’t know why, I was so unhappy for the last month we dated and in hindsight we were just delaying the inevitable. After we broke up we talked about it and she said she thinks the main reason she lost feelings was because of COVID-19 and if it wasn’t a problem we’d still be together, and we’re both open to trying at a relationship again when things are back to normal.
All of this leads me to my problem. I can’t stop thinking about her. When we text and make jokes back and forth I’m happy and everything feels good and normal again but every off chance I have I’m thinking about her and I’m not happy.

But when I talked to one of them (that really didnt complain about me, so he didnt block me) and than hesaid that them decided that either I changed or not they wouldnt accept, but I indeed dont think that because I know they liked me, so maybe its just a matter of time if I showed them I changed, but what got me a lot worried because how would I do to show them, because they blocked me everywhere and I moved to another city close to my hometown but still another city, so my only hope is to come back to my hometown (where they are) and show them I changed, because I know besides everything they like as much as I love them, maybe they dont right now 'cause how I acted before really leaved them descomfortable, this whole situation got me crying a lot and very anxious but they're really good friends and I dont want to be alone again (im really hard to fit in) what sould I do?!",29Jul2020,1
144,"Hi everyone

I live in Toronto and I'm 24 years old. I was scrolling through Instagram and saw an ad for this guy in my area who showed he was successful with dropshipping/eCommerce and being profitable with it. Since this is something I've been dabbling in for a while I decided to send a DM.

We get on a video call the day after and he seems genuine, shows his Shopify app with how much money he'd made that month, and told me a story of how he was mentored by someone and he paid 25k for the mentorship. There were no red flags that I noticed at the time, I was mainly looking for someone that I can reach out to for questions and general mentorship with opening my own store.

I paid 1000 first for his course and mentorship, he then calls me the next day asking for another 500 for the theme. Now I don't know how important the theme actually is so I saw okay and pay him. The theme wasn't special at all in terms of the look and feel of it, didn't feel professional so I raised the concern, he sends me another theme (the second theme was better). His course was very basic and the weekly zoom calls were repetitive. I've now since been cut off from all zoom calls since i asked for a refund.

He was very slow to respond to my questions and would always dodge questions. I complained about the theme again because of the lack of customization that was available, he sends me another theme called ""Triss"" and after a quick google search found the same theme for $57. I told him about it and he refused to refund the original 500 I paid him.

I now am asking him for proof that whether or not he actually dropships and makes money from it. I called him all day yesterday with no response.

One more thing to add, I got added to an Instagram group filled with people who are against this guy, they all call him a scammer and a liar. Saying he fakes his results and doesn't know anything about dropshipping. I also reached out to his mentor that he paid 25k to, and he told me that he never paid 25k, only 5k.

What do you guys think? I know 3 people that have already asked for a full refund on everything. I also found out everyone else was charged only 200 while I was charged 1500...

Sorry about the long post but I just want to know what legal action I can take to get my money back (after i confirm he's faking results)

I heard from the other people who got scammed they texting the guy with a burner line and he gave them a refund. Although I wouldn't know what to say... I really need help with this...

TLDR: paid 1500 to a guy on instagram claiming he would help me with dropshipping, not much help was given. after asking for a refund on the theme I've been removed from the original telegram group and put in a new one (probably so I don't tell everyone he's a scammer) and the weekly zoom calls have now been cut off.",29Jul2020,1

146,"Hi all.
I am purchasing a vacant lot to build my dream home but I have a choice between two.

1. 8,600 sqft, in an exclusive area near the beach, 5 minutes walk. All infrastructure already in place (water, electricity, underground), land is already cleared and well manicured. Problem is they have many restrictive covenants that will make us have to adjust a lot of our plans, including home size, type of walls, height of building, how the yard should look, no guest house for my mother in law, etc. Sale price- $100,000

2. 10,600 sqft, 15 minutes walk away from the beach, area is okay. Land in uncleared, can’t even walk through it a sit is really dense, no infrastructure (we have to request poles for electricity, etc), no road access, less rules, sale price is $95,000

They’re both in the same neighborhood, it’s just that option 1 is in a cul-de-sac closer to the beach. None have a beach view though.

I love both, but I do think that option 1, being so upscale is a once in a lifetime opportunity. But option 2 seems like the obvious choice because it will allow me to build how I want without having to constantly check on the rules.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. This is in the Caribbean.",29Jul2020,1
147,"I don’t have a good relationship with my dad. I don’t hate him, but being near him makes me uncomfortable. For example, whenever I need to run to the store (a three minute walk away), he watches me from the driveway. I understand that he wants to make sure his daughter stays safe, but it’s over the top. I can’t go out with friends without him giving me a talk about how dangerous drugs are. The last time I invited my friends over (a year ago) we walked to a graveyard that you can see from my house, and when we got back my dad said he had been watching us to make sure we were safe. My friends told me that made them uncomfortable, and I haven’t invited them over since then. It made me upset as well. Now my father wonders why I never have friends over.

Because of instances like this, I don’t feel safe telling my dad about my personal life. He tells me that I can tell him anything, and I know he’s trying to be a good parent, but the way he does it isn’t okay. I’m a senior in high school and I’m not allowed to walk around town by myself. (I live in a very safe town). I have kept so many secrets from my dad because of this and it’s become super stressful. I dread going to my father’s house. For context, my parents are divorced. I trust my mother with everything (except for asking how to confront my dad). My father is remarried and I do trust my stepmom, but I’m scared that she’d out me to my dad if I told her anything. Another reason why I’ve been so hesitant telling my dad about my life is because he tends to get angry whenever things don’t go his way.

How should I tell my father that his overprotective nature makes me feel super uncomfortable around him?",29Jul2020,1

149,"I(30M) have essentially put myself in a place in life I feel is like a bottomless pit. I say put myself because while some things were out of my control, I refuse to deal blame to luck or other fake variables.

I've been divorced 3 years, but started my adult life out poorly financially from lack of financial knowledge early and found myself in a bit of credit card debt I wasn't paying and bills I also wasn't paying eventually going to collections. I don't know if this is a common reaction but I essentially just buried it and kept burying it including the small student loan I was forced to pick up by my future wife's parents who didn't agree my trade at the time was sufficient to provide for her. 

As my marriage fell apart around 25 my wife stopped filing our taxes unbeknownst to me which I should have been on top of anyways, so after two years of not filing and then getting overwhelmed again with lack of knowledge that I was fcked, I continued not filing ( I am Canadian). 

With basically no credit to speak of due to all these debts defaulting and a unresolved tax issue, I have no chance of getting any kind of student loan again for a profession I actually want to do which I have identified. And with COVID I lost my job that I hate and had to relegate myself to a much lower paying job than it.

I guess what I'm asking is does anyone have an advice on righting the ship despite all this? Getting on track to a decent career at my age and becoming essentially an actual proper member of society aside from the obvious that I really need deal with my tax issues? I feel like such a useless bag of shit as a 30 year old making barely above minimum wage, living at home and with no real direction and all I want is to just have a normal adult life and get out of this mess.",29Jul2020,1

I previously deleted her number because missing her and thinking that I wouldnt see her again was tearing me up and at that point I knew I had to move on with my life. When I tried getting her number back, I asked my friend who is one of her best friends if I could get it back. She checked and she said that she wasnt comfortable with giving me her number. 
That really sucked. Ive been angry for a little while and wondered why after all of this time. Lets just say our history wasn’t simple, but I never did anything to her. I always treated her with respect.

155,"Background: Been going to the same personal tax accountant for several years. He works for one of those large tax companies. I usually see him face to face. Relationship has been friendly but always professional. This year when COVID-19, I had to drop off all of my personal documents and he didn’t actually do my taxes until a few days later. I told him I would pick up the forms back at the office I dropped it off. Well.....a couple days later he calls and leaves a message saying he can meet me and give me my docs. I tell him he can leave it at the office. Then a few days later he calls again saying it would be best to meet since the tax office hours have changed and not staffed as much due to the tax deadline being over. Several weeks pass and I finally meet him at a very public place and he gives me the documents back. We make small talk and he asks me if I want to join him with his friends on a trip. I say no bc I’m busy. I don’t make a big deal about and we say goodbye...No hugs nothing. Several days later, he then calls and leave a message that he would like to see me And take me out and for me to call him and arrange a time to meet. WTF?  He used COVID-19 as an excuse to meet up and to ask me out. He also had been carrying around my personal documents (SS#, DOBs, W2s, all personal information) and had it on his person for weeks.  I really don’t know him well. Should I be worried? Should I say something to the company that he works for in case he does something dumb? I feel violated and taken advantage of since I have never given him the indication I am interested. By the way, I haven’t called him back and I’m not interested.  Help me. I don’t want to get him in trouble but I also need to make sure I’m protected.

156,"Today while talking with a friend we both realized that another friend (let's call him S) is a pathological liar. 

He always invents easily disprovable claims about himself and gets nervous when asked about it or gives vague answers. Obviously we are nobody to diagnose someone with something like that, but I don't know how else can I describe it.

Its not necessary to read this list, I just wrote the lies that first came to mind

In the past month, he lied that:

-He went to a nutritionist that's popular here [a lot of my friend are patients of him and he said he didn't know him]

-He regularly invents nutrition and health facts or stuff like that that make no sense, and says that the previously mentioned nutritionist told him that

-That he drives stick shift, several times (where I live is the norm) [Some days later he said he wanted to learn how, and when asked about the times he said that he knew how to he denied those]

-That his dad bought an office laptop that has 12GB of RAM [Asides from that being unobtainable here, his dad uses Word only, he is both smart and not that financialy well off enough to buy that]

-That he plays in the Minecraft server we all play and has a lot of stuff you get far into de game [1- He is really bad at the game and there is no way that is true 2- The server is literally a small server with friends were I'm one of the admins and I can CLEARLY see he has never logged in]

-That he had X car [when I live like 5 blocks from him and can see it isn't true]

-Last year he said that on a party his cousin hosted 2 girls blowed him off [recently talking about stuff he magically forgot to mention that, and his list isn't long enough to forget details]

-He told another guy that he was flirting with a female friend of ours and that he could fuck her if he wanted to [a friend found out who is really close to that female friend and is 100% its not true]

- A friend (let's call him K) had sex with an older girl a few months ago, he claimed to have talked to that girl and that she said K made that up [knowing him and the current situation there is no fucking way he talked with her, and when asked about it he avoided details and changed topics. Also I know K very well and there is no way he would lie that]

-Two years ago I had a fist fight with a random dude outside a party, he recently said he remembers clearly how I sucker punches him from the back [I remember what happened and I fucking know I would never do that, asides from other friends that were also witnesses and said that my version was right] when I said that was not true he insisted that he clearly remembers it and tried to give details. I went fucking mad and told him that if he wanted to make shit up at least don't invent things that make other people look bad. He went silent after that.


When me and the friend I first mentioned asked another one from our group if he agreed, he said something like ""Now that you say it, now I realize that I know he is always laying but I'm just so used to it to even care""

My own theory is that when he wants X stuff to happen, or thinks if Y happened that would be book, instead of saying it as a wish/cool idea/fantasy he just says like it's a fact. That way he gets the psychological reward he would get if that was true while living in the real world.

157,"
I’m (28M) in love with my best friend(30F). We have been close for years now and I met her through her fiancé (32M). She confides in me about their relationship and I know she isn’t happy. Her relationship is toxic yet she feels trapped. He proposed a month ago, and she felt pressured to say yes. She tells me about their differences but she talks in a way like I have all the right qualities that her fiancé doesn’t have. She will always mention “maybe I should find someone like you” or “nobody could ever be like you, you’re the perfect guy”. Despite all of that, I have a great friendship with her fiancé. 

I have never shown her my feelings before but I can sense that she feels the same. I by no means want to split them up, but I feel that it might be right to tell her how I feel. I also don’t want to ruin a friendship with both of them. We have great chemistry, enjoy similar hobbies, and get excited to hangout with each other. Without going into too much detail, I will just say that we are a perfect match, and could easily be together if she felt the same. If she didn’t feel the same way, I know she wouldn’t make things awkward and we could still continue our friendship. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this to myself.

158,"So... my sister is so difficult and weird that I don't know what to say anymore. She has developed tourette's syndrome when she was 7 and I guess that makes her talk out more of what's going on in her head (sorry for those who don't understand what tourette syndrome is). 

So why am I here specifically? She gets extremely rude to us. She always thinks she's neve wrong and she drives us crazy for years of being thr one that's so rude and disrespectful to her family. And she seems to have no shame and she's kinda unintelligent with emotional connections with people. Example, one time she did something wrong in the kitchen just a little mistake and then out uncle said to her by explaining the right way to do it and how she should never do the way she did it (this was 2 months ago so I forgot specifically) and she got mad and slam the door only because she got lectured at even though my uncle was talking calmly and slowly she still gets mad for that single act.

Like I said earlier, she has tourette syndrome now if you don't know what that means I tell you. Tourette syndrome is a mental disorder that makes you do noises and have tick movements. Why do I bring this up well this disorder also makes you speak what's on your mind and she is prolly unaware of that. Someone says something to her and she would prolly mutter to herself ""bit-ch shut up"" or something like that. We always ignored it because we didn't know what to do but now we need to do something as of last night.

So last night, she and my mom got into a argument about clothing or whatever. My mom got mad cuz she was being disrespectful and she banged on the wall. My mom got so pissed that she yelled and lectured her for years of being disrespectful to all of us. She got in detail of every little thing that wrong with her and it was kinda sad. My sister was crying as well. My mom went long and long about how no matter how hard she tried my sister is always the same. She doesn't want that no more. No one does.

This morning, I overheard her in the hallway. Her tourette syndrome kinda exposed this sentence. ""Bitch not my fault you started the argument I didn't do anything wrong"". I was kinda heartbroken because my mom works hard for us because we had a tough upbringing (not gonna go into that) and she really tried to raise us the best she can. I have my own issues, but at least I have the emotional intelligence to listen and apply what I learned but my sister is so dumb that she can't process to change her life.

TL;DR: Guys, I know this was long I'm sorry but please, any advice for what we should do? Is she mental? Does she have pysch problems? In the past, there were theories to even proof that she might have it. I don't know but I need advice, please.",29Jul2020,1

167,"So basically, I'm a 17 year old guy, and in 2019 my parents got divorced, my dad cheated and did some pretty fucked things, and I moved to wear I am now with my mom and my sister.

All I ask is that they leave me alone because my sister is a trash human being and all my mom does is yell and scream.

Started my new school, was only really happy for a little bit then it ended pretty fast, but overall I was just not happy there. Even though I was able to graduate early due to what I did at my old school, and I've started taking some classes at the community college, I'm still not happy.

Even thought I moved closer to my grandparents, I'm still not happy.

I'm scared that I'm not going to be able to be successful in what I want to do. I want to go into Cybersecurity, but I feel so fucking stupid and I feel like I'm way behind in terms of knowledge of even the basic basics.

I can't find a job, not even a fast food place wants me, I don't have any connections, no experience.

Things got pretty heated the other day between my mom and I and I was really considering leaving her and moving back with my dad. Her and I talked and I explained all the shit I wanted to and she did the same. However, at least in my eyes, it seems like the only reason she doesn't want me moving back, is because if I do, her car insurance is going to be fucked as well as child support or something.

She laid off on yelling at me for about a week or so, but now she did it again, and tried pinning the blame on me saying ""I've been calm, and you're being disrespectful and I'm not going to disrespect you if you're going to disrespect me,"" and her and I got into a very big argument.

Now my grandpa has cancer, and my grandma isn't feeling the best, and I didn't want to bring our shit to them. I then said ""Maybe I should've called him:(Him being my dad) and my mom said ""Ok y'know what, you wanna go and threaten me, let's go."" And we went into my grandmas place and she was laying down and my mom said ""He's not going to disrespect me anymore"" and says a bunch of other shit to her. I start walking down the hallway and I say ""Yeah maybe I should've fucking called him"", and my grandma flipped out and said ""YOU DO NOT TALK TO YOUR MOM THAT WAY"" so I yell that I'm not gonna stay here just to be chewed out, and I walked out of her house and walked back home. My grandma yelled that I'm a pussy as I was walking away, and my mom drove past and stopped next to me and started saying more shit. I said shit back, and she left for work and I went home.

I don't know what to do, like i said before, I'm scared I'm not going to be successful, I'm not happy where I am, but I don't know if I'd be any happier with my dad, yeah my dad did some fucked shit, but if i moved with him, I wouldn't have to deal with my mom or sisters shit. 

I'm just not happy, but when I tell that to my mom and grandparents, they always downplay me by saying ""OH YOU'RE UNHAPPY? LOOK AT YOUR MOM, YOU'RE MOM HAS TO....."" because my problems and feelings don't mean anything because I'm not an adult. 

My grandparents and mom always say ""What happened, you're so hateful now"" yeah well I'm sorry that a bunch of bad shit happened in the last year that affected me and I'm not fucking happy, and that I change and I'm not a little kid anymore. I'm just so fucking lonely.

I just don't know what to do, I just want to be fucking happy.

In the house I am in now grudges r a big thing. I uave apologized and been told later by a separate individual thats in that house, that has had the person who holds the grudge against, say they don't think I apologized truthfully (I didn't apologize in the way they wanted, I didn't word it rit for them to accept the apology). 

It's hard going from a house that, tho abusive, was quite quick to forgive and laugh. I guess when ur living in an abusive house u r tought that the harm done was in the moment to keep the hierarchy in place, but still. 

Its easier to deal with apology and let urself feel how u feel, but then laughing together was just better. I hate this grudge stuff. It goes on for days in some cases I've had months where they hold grudges. 

Some of things that they hold grudges for is kind of crazy in my opinion. I ""accidentally"" mentioned something that was embarrassing about my cousin in front of her yr long bf, she's 26 (we were joking around), I mentioned that she spits in her drinks so if anyone takes her drinks ""haha on them"". I was taught to apologize and then give space, so that's wat I'm doing, but its been 3 days and she doesn't acknowledge that I exist and it hurts. 

I can't stand these grudges and ""ur apology didn't seem genuine"".  

How do I deal with this?",29Jul2020,1

173,"Every year my family goes to Florida for vacation. The company we booked with is not allowing for refunds despite the current situation with COVID, so my family has said that we will be staying inside the rental home for majority of the trip, only getting food from the store, and wearing our masks at all times when there are other people around. I trust them. My family has always taken the virus seriously and wore masks way before it was mandated. However, I still feel a little uneasy about this, and my dad has said it's fine if I stay home. The thing is, my brother recently had something terrible happen to him (like we thought he was gonna die type of thing), and I would hate to leave him with just my dad and his side of the family. I just know that I would feel so anxious and guilty being in Florida right now, and quite honestly I'm mentally not doing well and don't feel up to it.

174,"My (35F) husband (35F) is a good man: works hard, is devoted to me, and loves me. But hes turned into a giant slob, and either bores or annoys the absolute shit out of me 24/7. We're living in a full r/deadbedroom situation.

For context, we've been together for 10 years, no kids. Own some real estate and not-fancy vehicles. Own 2 successful businesses, but pour all the profits back into the businesses--no paychecks. We make exactly the same money at our day jobs.

179,"Hello. I didn't know where else to put  this, I don't know what else to do, who to talk to, so I'm here instead. I'm in one of the most anxious states of my life and I'm only 16. It might be an exaggeration, I don't know, but the feelings in my chest are just tearing me apart mentally each day. Everything here I list I've learned only recently, and it may not completely be accurate as some are fuzzy in my head, but I really need help.  


I'm a high-schooler with two parents, a mom and dad, and an eleven year old sister. Ever since I was born, my parents have had a lot of issues with each-other, though they stay together because of us both. My dad has locked my mother out of all of their bank accounts so he is the sole owner of them, and she is unable to withdraw money and is forced to ask him for cash whenever she wants to buy something, even if its tutoring, groceries, clothes, she has to go to him. She's asked him before, countless times, to allow her back into the account so she is able to get money from the account as well (I believe this is what she told me). Even when my sister was born, she would still have to ask him for cash, and each time he would say no. 16 years she has continued to ask him to open the account again so she is able to access money just as easily as he can.  


His family told him to close her out of the account, because they don't like my mother, that they hate her. I don't know why, I've never heard reasoning from them, and I've barely been around them. The vaguest memory I have is visiting for Christmas when I was very little, but several years later I have not seen them in ages because of their rocky relationship with my mom. From what I have heard from her, they have lied about my sister not being my father's, they would talk bad about my mother in front of her, and my father would never stand up for her. His sister, in particular, was outraged hearing she was pregnant with me and stormed out of the house and drove off the day they told his family. These are little pieces I've heard about, but overall I know that they are very manipulative, from texts I've read and from what I've heard.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom and dad constantly argue over money, because my mom, for 16 years, has never had access to their dual account that holds all of their savings, and she cannot even access it. If my father were to ever get in a car accident, she would not be able to pay for his injuries and bills-- and even then he said he would still not open the account. I'm not very well-informed about bank accounts and whatnot, but I know its wrong. That your partner should not be shut out of an account that you both should own in order to equally support your children. He constantly dominates over us, claiming that everything he owns is his. Even things that have been gifted to me are his, my car, my phone, my laptop-- everything is his, even if it is in my possession. When I do anything wrong, he has threatened to destroy my possessions because he gave them to me, and that they are his, and it scares the living shit out of me. He is a very aggressive man, even if he doesn't yell, he is very intimidating, and over the years I've become very, very, very afraid and anxious about him. I've learned to recognize his footsteps when he comes in, because he's always wanting to know my business, always wanting to know what I'm on-- even if I have a simple issue with my phone or something, he will then proceed to dive into my internet history in front of me, and it feels as if I have no privacy, even if he is constantly keeping secrets from me.  


My mom has shown me a folder of files that she's found of my father having internet affairs with women online, specifically women that are very good looking, in which he writes very romantic messages to several of them, asking for them to move in with him, asking for them to be the mother of my sister and I. He's even sent one a photo of my sister, without her consent, and without both of us knowing. That, in particular, has absolutely shattered my trust and my heart. The thought of a random woman kicking my mother out and becoming my mom, a girl I don't know, scares me. He has never informed me of these emails and messages. Once he even impersonated a lesbian to talk to women, cat-fishing as a woman himself. The news was very disturbing, and I only scanned over a few files of screenshots before I got too nauseous to keep looking. This was in March of 2020, where my life suddenly had taken a toll, learning information about my father and his family that just scared the shit out of me. I've naturally been closer to my mom's side of the family, as I've grown up with them, but after learning proof and hearing recordings of my father even shit-talking my mom in rides to work, has simply made my perspective on him warped, and while I love him, at the same time I wish he would just leave. I hate him, too. I hate that he would even do such things to hurt us, to hurt my mom, me, my sister-- everyone. There are times where he seems nice, and times when I love him and appreciate him, but then I have to remember what he's done, and it simply tears me apart.  


Around a month after March was when things had gotten the worst. I do not remember the specific date, but my mother and father were arguing across the hall from me, I'm not sure what about, screaming their heads off. I got roped in, asking whether or not if he should leave, and while I'm aware I should definitely be kept out of the situation, I told him I wanted him to go. He was very, very angry to hear that. My mom kept blocking the door while he was trying to go, trying to tell him he should at least tell me and my sister goodbye-- to explain everything, that he wasn't just abandoning us, but he was very angry about that too, screaming that he wouldn't hesitate to slam her head into the wall and that he would punch her. I had video recorded parts of it, but it made me too anxious to keep on my phone, so I deleted it, which was probably a bad choice, but I have really been unsure of myself and what to do during this entire situation. He eventually stormed out and she followed him, so I went into my sister's bedroom to comfort her, but I heard a scream and ran out to see that my dad's truck was nearly pulled across the corner to pull around the corner, and my mom was unconscious on the road. I heard from bystanders that she was trying to grab onto the truck, a stupid decision, but I'm sure she didn't really think about it, because they were both incredibly emotional, high on adrenaline, and angry. She wasn't hurt, just bruised from the wall, but even when I went out, panicking that she may had been dead, he yelled at me, he was aggressive with me, all because I made my decision that I wanted him to leave. I was too upset to do anything else, so I just went back into the house as the police arrived and everything. After that child protective services had to come the next day and talk to me and my sister, but I never heard from them again. Part of me really wished he would leave, after that, but he didn't. He came into our rooms that night to tell us they would divorce, but they never did.  


Recently, around a few months ago, my father's brother and mother died. Without telling us, without telling my mom, he paid for both their funerals (the costs were $24,000 in total), which for us is a lot of money. I didn't have an issue with him paying for the funerals, and I understood he was grieving, but he never told us that the had paid for both of them. Referencing the fact that my mom never got along with his family, either, and it would be rather awkward for her to show up with him, she simply watched over us as home, and even then he shit-talked her and said she hated his family, and didn't show up to both funerals. Apparently his sister even had the money to pay for one of the funerals, but she didn't, and his family pressured him to pay for both of them out of his own pocket and not tell us.  


There is a lot he has done and I'm not sure what else to say. Just last night they fought again, and we were going to go on a family vacation for a week, but after they argued about the whole ""your sister had the money to pay for one of the funerals just so you know"" and he got very angry over it again, I'm assuming that's cancelled, because now he wants to go with his own side of the family to the beach. I don't feel comfortable going with him, so I suppose my sister and I won't be going with him. It was a trip I was excited for. I thought that they were finally getting along again, but now I just feel unsafe and scared for my family again. I feel like it would be better for them to divorce, but I know that would just make everything even more heated. I don't know what to do. I'm so tired, and with the pandemic going on, I have to live with this throughout the entire day.  


Even a shred of advice would help, no matter what it is. I'm sorry if this is so much, I'm sorry if some of its vague, but I don't feel safe here. I want to live with my mom, alongside my sister, and I just want to be happy and okay. I don't know if everything will be okay here. I don't know if it will get worse.  


Please, just anything, any advice, will do. No matter what it is. Thank you for reading and I hope everything I spilled just made sense. If you have any questions feel free to ask me.  


TLDR: I'm sixteen with an eleven year old sister and our family is falling apart due to money-related issues and the fact that my dad's family hates my mom's guts.",29Jul2020,1
180,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

Please give me advice on how I can be better. Please. I cannot go another week always being the one left out and forgotten by everyone around me.

&amp;#x200B;

To preface, I am a 20-year-old senior in college. I am majoring in Finance and Economics, with a Minor in Business Analytics (relevant at the very end).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't believe I have bad social skills, but clearly that must be the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

To start off, I work as a lifeguard at a public pool and have a few work-friends there, but I fear my managers hate me (to which I have four). During my mid-season evaluation, my managers said how I ""bark orders staff members and am disrespectful towards management."" I honestly cannot think of anything that I have done wrong to give that impression. So I talked to one of my coworkers and asked her what her thoughts were and she said that wasn't correct and how nice I am. Then I went to a work party and one of my other coworkers (who happened to be drunk at the time) randomly said ""you know u/williamwell, I don't think you bark orders at coworkers. I think you are a great guy!"" (which tells me the first coworker talked about my conversation in her circle of friends (doesn't overly bother me)). Then I was talking to a friend who I am a lot closer with about how I wanted to go into management at one of our six facilities in the city we work in, but my last eval will hinder my chances greatly. We talked about it and she, direct quote (I just looked up the text) said ""You're so nice to everyone, you have an amazing sense of humor, and you're always thoughtful of others. You have nothing to worry about. If they don't like you that's 100% their issue."" And lastly - this happened today - a coworker wrote a compliment on a sticky note to every person that worked today and stuck it on the wall. Leaving out the unrelated stuff, she said that I was one of her favorite people to work with (this is out of 43 other staff members). I honestly don't get why management would hate me and put on my eval that I am basically a dick to them and my coworkers.

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to the next thing I am wondering about: why does no one ever ask me to hang-out outside of work?  If I am such a nice guy, why does everyone else get invited into group chats and go get coffee with other coworkers? Why am I always left out of pictures with friends? Why am I a second thought? Everyone says they love me, but after we clock out and go home that is it until the next day. The only notifications I wake up to are that of spam emails. No ""goodnight!"", no ""good morning!"", no ""I hope you have a great day today!"". Nothing. No one wants to spend time with me and it honestly crushes me to know that. It really hit home today when someone I really like was saying how sad she is and will miss everyone since today was her last day working, then said to almost everyone but me ""we should get coffee sometime!"" I would kill to receive a text or call from anyone of my so-called ""friends"" just asking me to grab a coffee or take a walk around the park or whatever else people with friends who care do.

&amp;#x200B;

Then with jobs/internships I never get past the first interview. I read up on the company, I ask thought-provoking questions, I do all everything that is recommended by people who actually have jobs. I believe I have an amazing resume. I am the president of an internationally recognized honors society in business, I will graduate college in high honors at 20-years-old, I have a MOS 77-727 certification, which means I am a certified specialist in Microsoft Excel (which in my major is incredibly beneficial), and I was a shift manager at my shift job. I don't know what else companies are looking for if that isn't it.

&amp;#x200B;

What is so wrong about my personality that my managers hate me, nobody wants to spend time with me, and I can't get a real job?",29Jul2020,1

183,"**Backstory:**

A few days ago, I heard from my sister that, as she was backing up her car to leave her work, she grazed a pickup truck with her side window about two weeks ago. She didn’t know whose it was but, taking responsibility for her actions, reported it to her boss to let the owner of the truck know it was her. Now, just to point out, my sister is very non-confrontational. She gets easily frazzled amid tough situations and this stuff has never happened to her before so she just frantically did what she thought she could do to accommodate her accident.

She left then, having not identified the owner of the truck, and didn’t hear anything about it for a week. It didn’t seem to be a big deal then. All of a sudden, a few days ago (when I found out), the owner of the truck she grazed (let’s call her Jen) began making a huge fuzz about it. Everyone at her work knew and began asking my sister about it. Of course, considering the week of silence, this caught my sister by surprise, but she and Jen talked about handling it on the phone. My sister offered to pay for the damages she caused and so Jen went to the autobody shop to calculate the estimate for the repair (we were out of town when all this went down).

They also sent a picture of the damage and my sister seemed surprised (to me at least) at the size of the damage. Again, she was frazzled when all of this went down so her memory of it was all fuzzy and she didn’t think about taking a picture. It turned out to be around $1600 for the damages. Of course, we went livid, I got my car for just a little over that price and theirs is just as old. 

**Problem:**

Regardless, my sister remained gracious about it and remained in contact with them to deal with it, even going forth with her paying for it. They managed to lower the price down to $700. The problem is, I’m starting to question the logistics of the damages.

First off, my sister’s side mirrors are round and the damages in the picture seemed to have been caused by a sharp object. The dent is way too deep to have been caused by a side mirror just driving by.

Then, the paint in the truck is just gone where the dent is at, while the paint in my sister’s side mirror is only scratched.

And I’m still wondering why it took them a week to say something about it. It seems like they amplified the damages so they can repair their truck while taking advantage of my sister’s money. Jen even mentioned to my sister that her husband had been planning on selling the car.

I might be looking too deeply into this, but I can’t stop but find this whole situation suspicious. Please offer me some advice. Thanks for reading.

Tl;dr My sister scratched a car and the owner may have amplified the damages to make her pay much more than she needs to.",29Jul2020,1

I have been in the construction industry (Commercial drywall and framing) since I was 18 and earn a fairly decent wage on paper when work is available. Usually, I find myself unemployed for months at a time until a big job comes up. As I get older I find myself dreading my job. Like, completely sick to my stomach thinking about going back to a crappy, dusty, sweaty, dangerous mess of a job. It feels as though I am stuck, by the time I save up some money I am unemployed again and have to dip into my savings. I am constantly working myself out of a job.

Recently, I tore my MCL while drywalling under a staircase. It made me think again about my career choice and what I should be doing with my life. School isn’t for me, I have no experience with anything other than construction, most business ideas I had are seasonal and don’t really work during a winter or during COVID. I’d like to be able to provide for my family and give them the life they deserve, without wearing out my body before I get a chance to enjoy life with them.

I’m looking for advice or suggestions for possible careers paths that may be suitable but not labour intensive. Salary expectations are negligible. If anyone else is in this situation or something similar id love to hear from you.

189,"So I (F21) moved to GA about 10 months ago because my daughters father (M21) insisted on us moving to GA so his parents could help us.. I genuinely think he didn’t want the responsibility, after he kept pushing it for months &amp; even suggesting we send her to his mom on her own when she wouldn’t stop crying. I’ve been here, going to school, I got a shitty job and would cry in the bathroom because my GM treated me like shit but I didn’t quit because I obviously needed the money and I was pregnant. I just had my baby boy who is now one month old. I miss AZ, I miss my mom and my friends &amp; I miss not feeling alone .. I feel so alone here, my baby dads parents are so kind and amazing and his aunt and uncles and the rest of his family lives close by and they’re great, they truly love my kids and I appreciate that so much. 

I think if I moved back to AZ they’d be heartbroken, which is why I don’t know what to do. My daughter LOVES her grandmother, she follows her around &amp; waits for her at the door and I don’t want to take that from her .. I don’t want to be selfish. That’s why I don’t know what to do. But I’m so depressed here, I’ve stopped eating, I eat one tiny meal a day, sometimes I don’t even eat, I cry by myself at night when no one can hear. If I move back to AZ my old job will rehire me and I miss working there so much.. I loved my job and it paid pretty well and it wasn’t draining.. I don’t want to hurt anyone, so if moving back isn’t the answer, how do I stop feeling so depressed? 

Also, I went to AZ to visit about 3 weeks ago, after that I was happy for the first week being back home in GA and now I’m back to being depressed and not eating..

so my sister has always kinda had my parents do things for her. my mom always cleans her room, she never picks up after herself, she doesn’t make any of her own food. hell, she has a hedgehog that my mom cleans up after too. my mom’s also a bit of a pushover when it comes to her - if my sister wants takeout, my mom will almost 100% say yes. and my mom never yells at my sister either for leaving stuff out, which annoys me SO much since it was always “i’m not your maid,” when she picked something of mine up. once i handed my sister a stack of her stuff that i picked up, and she kinda looked at it, rolled her eyes, and left it there for another week. 

my sister’s always also been kinda babied too. she still sleeps in my moms bed every single night. my dad doesn’t really say anything. i mean he’ll make an offhand comment, but nothing that actually changes anything. 

my sister also doesn’t have any chores. i mean she doesn’t do _anything._ and that’s the difference, when i was in 6th grade i had to do dishes, i couldn’t even reach the top shelf lol. and then in 7th i started doing cat litter and becoming more of a neat person ig. 

but i’ve always been a bit closed off. my sister has a gluten intolerance, so she was sick a lot and my parents had to focus on her more. i get why they had to, especially since they didn’t know what it was, but i kinda just wished they payed maybe a lil more attention to me, especially since that was a time where i was super depressed. 

another thing is too, i’m kinda jealous of my sister ig, because she’s always been _so_ skinny, even before she got a gluten intolerance. i have an ed in addition to depression, so i thinks that’s where it stems from. but i feel so awful saying that, i mean how pathetic is that? “i’m jealous of a 12 year old because she’s thinner than me” jesus christ.

but i guess it all boils down to me being really mean and bitchy to my sister. i guess i just project onto her because she has things that i never got/don’t have. i don’t know, it’s really pathetic, and i hate that i do it, but i don’t know how to fix it. any advice on how to stop it?",29Jul2020,1
195,"Ok so I have a mom who gave me up when I was born. My dad and his mom raised me and my mom was in and out a handful of times. I live in a different state than her and our relationship is rocky in general because of her unchecked mental health. So four things are going on at the same time here and I think it’s all too much for me to understand. Avoiding and repressing are creating symptoms in my body so it’s clear I need to do something just don’t know what.

1. My sisters boyfriend died of an OD so she is living w my mom and step dad. My sister claims my step dad recently tried to kiss her and now she is blackmailing him. My mom was raised by a Woodstock hippy and her mom would sleep with her boyfriends or pimp her out. So this is big to me because my sister and step dad are both creating something wildly painful for my already abused and sick mom. 

2. My mom hasn’t been great by any means but I do still care about her wellness wether I’m in or out of her life. I have serious medical stuff I was born with and I require a special and difficult to obtain team of doctors. I found out at the same time that ten years ago my mom secretly threw away two opportunities for me to receive help after I was hospitalized with a complication because I was on her insurance. She canceled the insurance in the middle of a semester that my dad was paying for and she said “why don’t you get a job and stop excepting everyone to take care of you” but it turns out she didn’t want to pay for the doctor bill for the surgery only she knew I needed. I’ve almost died twice since and just got the care I needed this year when the truth ultimately came to light, ten years later. So I basically feel like this woman has never and will never love me and I’m just basically something she entertains out of guilt. I have a lot of feelings about her and this tbh. 

3. The sister I mentioned is also a drug addict and since moving in with my mom they have both become drug users together. Last year my mom attempted suicide but it just came to light that she and my sister faked it together so they could get 3000 from my step dad to keep my sister out of jail essentially. I was the one talking to my mom the day she “ate a bottle of pills” and my sister even got on the phone and participated in letting me believe my mom tried to kill herself....

4. I guess I also should mention my step dad has verbally abused and controlled my mom for 15 years almost and he’s why she’s so hollow now / she is just as responsible / but if I confront this, and probably most importantly, I definitely intend to address this.

So yeah I’m just out here feeling like ???",29Jul2020,1

197,"So I've been friends with this person for almost 10 years I think, since middle school, but our friendship has been on the decline for years due to how she treats her pets.

This person has 2 dogs, 1 small and 1 large, and three cats and they live in a fairly small house so it's fairly cramped and choatic. Formerly she had three dogs, but I adopted one since her small dog was bullying him and he was just ""too much work"".

I'm not really sure how to explain all the issues I have with her animal care so I'm just going to list it in bullets;

-They almost never clean the litter boxes, they're so constantly filthy that the cats just shit and piss around them. The house smells like ammonia and I had to stop sleeping over there awhile ago since I'd get bad respiratory infections.

-They never take their dogs out, they have a fenced in yard so all they have to do is open the door. Yet she only lets them out maybe twice a day, the dogs usually have accidents all over the house which she doesn't even bother to clean up, sometimes it'll take her days to pick up one turd off the ground. 

-Somedays she'll forget to feed her animals until nightime. Her dogs have thrown up just because they had empty tummies or they're just tired since they're hungry.

-One of her dogs, the large rough collie, at one point was so skinny that his spine was jutting out and I could feel his ribs. I confront her about that almost immediately and she said her vet said he was a perfect weight for the breed, but that doesn't sit right with me. I asked how much she was feeding him and she'd been feeding him the same amount he ate as a 5 month puppy- he's almost 2 now, since she ""didn't want him to get fat."". I should also note his coat doesn't look very healthy for the breed.

-Doesnt bother to vaccinate her animals, her animals all got vaccines as puppies and only because I asked her about it everytime we talked until she finally made appointments. Now when I ask they say they don't have the money, but around us there are shelters that offer cheaper shots or even free for pet owners that can't afford it and I always refer her to those. On the same note none of her dogs are registered in the county, I know it's not super illegal or warrants getting your pet taken away, but it'll get you a fine.

Last is the puppy I got from her, he's about 5 months old and by the way she talked about him it almost seemed like she hated him. The puppy was depressed, nervous- walked with his tail between his legs for awhile, and cried and got upset when he had a accident. It sorta makes me feel like she might have been abusing him in some way, none of that felt like normal dog behavior and I've had dogs my entire life n never gave seen that behavior in such a young dog. 

I am slightly scared of reporting her since I feel like they might find out I reported them and they'd try to take my puppy away. I've considered talking to my vet and seeing if they will help me with reporting them, but I'm unsure if that's ok to put on the vet? 

I feel a bit stumped on the situation and could use some input.


Tldr; friend neglects her animals and lets them live in filth.",29Jul2020,1
198,So I'm a 13 year old (sorry if I'm young but I really need some advice) and I was born female but I'm starting to feel confused. I don't necessarily hate my gender or feel uncomfortable in it but whenever I picture a perfect reality I picture myself as a male. I'm not sure if that means I am transgender or what because most places I looked said that transgender people tend to feel uncomfortable in their bodies and I don't necessarily feel uncomfortable. I prefer to wear baggy clothes to hide my breasts and sometimes I wear clothes to make my butt smaller. I am considering cutting my hair short but I am scared about public backlash. I haven't told my mom about this because I am afraid she'll just brush it off like she does with most things.

199,"I’ve got this DVD that came in a big series set and it had codes to play these movies by a digital copy. I bought them years before I actually used the codes and retrieved the digital copies (they stream on VuDu). However... one of the 5 codes didn’t work. I emailed support about it and they want a huge list of things from me to verify purchase before they give me a solution... They want a receipt, date of purchase, a bunch of biographic info, whatever that I’m not down to share or that I just don’t have anymore. 

My big PC has an optical drive that I installed when I built it (I finally got to use it over this situation, so yay me). My new laptop does not. Is there a way to put the movie on a USB or in a drive or something and watch it on my laptop? Like a true Zoomer, I don’t have much experience with DVDs aside from popping them in and pressing play.

204,"So to start with a bit of context, my parents love camping and always take me (15) and my brother (13) with them when they go. It can be nice but often it’s exhausting and I personally don’t always love it although it’s ok. My parents often end up “forcing” me and my brother to go with them, or guilting us into going anyway.

Long story short we ended up discussing our approaching camping trip with my parents (mostly my mom cause my dad usually stays silent), and I began bringing up reasons why I don’t like camping. My mom argued and said that after 15 years of doing so much for me I couldn’t even be bothered to spend time with her. Basically that she just wants to spend time with her family and is sick of being inside the house all year. And honestly she was right. I should spend time with my family, but I just don’t find camping with my family nearly as exciting as it might be with say, some friends.

I’m not very proud of this, but I ended up saying that it’s hard to have a good time when she’s always so mean and yelling, and always arguing with my dad.

While this isn’t always the case, it’s certainly not an overstatement. Over the years I’ve noticed she has a strong tendency to call out my dad on every little thing he doesn’t do right, and I’ve been yelled at by her, or heard her yelling at my brother or dad more times than I can count. (Id also like to note I don’t idolize my dad or anything, I just see that he’s often the victim of her attacks) (It might be a different topic, and I’m not a psychologist, but I think her tendency to quarrel stems from the inability to accept that she’s wrong, she always finds problems with other people, and finds ways to blame me and my brother or my dad even when it’s nobody’s fault)

I left and came back down later. We somewhat talked it out and I agreed to go camping cause they were right and I really have nothing better to do since it’s quarantine and summer. So I left again.

I went back downstairs a final time to let my cat in a little bit ago, and I said goodnight to my mom as she was still there, and I apologized for being rude earlier. She said not to apologize which was fine, but what alarmed me was that she said something along the lines of “I’m sorry I can’t be exciting enough for you or not have a good relationship with your father or be good enough for everyone.”

I’m really frustrated because I just don’t know what to do or if I even have a role in this situation. 

In a way I’m mad at her because she’s a grown adult and she’s acting like my younger brother, playing the victim card to her child.

But also, I feel really bad because I understand that she’s just a human who probably did try her best and wasn’t taught that she’s not always right. I think she might feel really bad about herself.

I really don’t know how to feel or what to do, she might be depressed and think that people don’t like her. I know she isn’t the perfect mom and hasn’t always been kind or respected me as an individual, but she has been very caring for me throughout my whole life and I very much appreciate her for that, it’s just hard to show her any affection or even be reasonable with her when she’s yelling at me or being hostile.

I guess I’m asking if I should be playing a role in making her feel better and accommodating her in life just because I’m her child, and if I even can help someone in the same state of mind as she is, or if this is out of my hands.

Sorry if this doesn’t make a lot of sense, I’m tired and kind of confused myself, I can answer questions to help clarify the situation.

208,"Warning: contains rape related content


I dont really know how to process what happened, but last night I was watching a movie with my friend when we ended up having sex. It was consensual and I'm okay with it happening.


But it was really late so I stayed over so that I didnt have to drive home. Then I woke up in the middle of the night with him making me touch him and at first I didnt know what to do but pulled away saying not right now. He then grabbed my hand again and made me continue, I then told him in these exact words ""you need to stop"" and he said he wasnt going to.


At this point i started to roll over to the other side of the bed to get some space hoping he'd get the hint when he came over and grabbed me by my neck really hard and covered my mouth, aggressively pushing himself against me... at this point I've just shut down but whenever he would attempt to pull my pants down I'd stop him. This went on for who knows how long. I was silent and motionless and basically trying to figure out why this was happening when I think he realised that I was really not okay with what was happening, I think I was tearing up and saying no but I dont know if it was out loud or in my head. He then stopped and asked if I was okay, hugging me really tight and apologizing and eventually giving me space...


I just laid there trying not to cry and trying to figure out how I feel and what almost happened... I still dont really know how I feel.. but I'm honestly not sure if I should tell someone what happened or talk with him about it. We didnt talk about it today and I dont know what to do. He didnt rape me, but i still feel like I might just fall apart at any moment. I'm definitely not okay...

211,"Okay so a little more backstory...

A coworker was looking to move out from living with his GF, I was looking to move out from my situation at the time so we got a place the two of us could rent. There was no talk about a 3rd person ever moving in. As well if we did have a 3rd move in we would have to update our lease agreement. 

Over the last year and a half my housemates ex who he moves away from would periodically come over to visit. Within that 18 months she probbably left our front door unlocked on 3 occasions. Each time just commenting to my roommate about it. Not her. 

I am unsure when but my housemate and her are now dating again. She came over to stay this weekend and our of the 4 days so far she has left the front door unlocked all night long 2 of the 4 days. I'm talking she unlocks it at some point in the day then the next morning I get up at 6-8am and find the front door isnt locked.

We dont live in a great area. We live in a retirement town that likes to claim it is a beautiful place but from what Ive seen the last year; meth is a huge issue and there are breaks in all the time, be it homes or cars.

On Sunday morning I saw the front door had been left unlocked. When my housemate gets up I tell him the front door has been unlocked. I try to say it super nonchalant because Im not trying to be a parent here but holy fuck why cant people lock a door after they walk in through it?!

He says it must have been his gf. I assume hes going to say something but she gets up, they start playing video games. He says nothing. So I mention it to her. First time ive said something but now probably the 4th time she has left our front door unlocked. 

Last night she did it again. I wake up in the morning to find the front door unlocked. This is now 5 times... she left it unlocked again literally 2 days after I told her she left it unlocked on Saturday. 

What do I do? Do I just say it again and pretend like its not a big deal still? Ive already had a conversation with my roommate about if he got cat, which were not allowed to have, and it breaks something I have on display... would he pay for it? He said basically no. So I already know if she leaves the front door unlocked and someone gets in... he wont replace anything of mine that goes missing. 

Do I tell her she isnt allowed over anymore? 

I plan to move out in 6 months. That is when our lease is up. But since they are now together I imagine she is going to be over every other weekend for the next 6 months... or as long as they are still together.

What do I do? Trying to sit down with him to explain how ""important locked doors are"" wont matter. He's a child and the only thing he wants to do is sit around and game for 12 hours a day between work shifts. 

He doesnt really care about anything and that being said the only thing anyone could steal from him is his TV and xbox. Where as I collect shit have have money in collections that could easily be taken and flipped.",29Jul2020,1

216,"Im M17 and honestly throughout all of secondary school I’ve been quiet and shy, due to both anxiety and past trauma that I won’t get into here. I never allowed myself to experience new things or put myself out there out of fear of failure and because I didn’t think I deserved happiness for pretty much all my life. 

I’ve made some friends but I’ve never pursued relationships, it’s usually them coming to me or we just get put in a room together for years and become friends lol. I’ve been thro uh h a few friendgroups but this one now feels pretty solid. There’s five of us, 3 girls, 2 guys. 

Ever since I was 12 my cousin always told me I had a lot in common with a boy in our year, let’s call him Jake. He said how Jake and I at every similar and should talk sometime. The first time I spoke to Jake was this year. We were put a table together and although I noticed he had a similar reserved attitude he had a good amount of friends and was able to talk to people well but he’d rarely initiate anything. 

He spoke to me sometimes but me being me, idk what’s wrong with me lol when put on the spot I feel like I’m just choking on my words. So I rarely made a good conversation with him. 

I’m just now wondering if I should try to pursue this. It’s been months since we last spoke and it’s always just been a casual “hey” and “what’s up” or asking for a hand with work. He seems like a genuinely nice guy, and for me, becoming friends with and liking guys is much harder than with girls because I’m bisexual and from experience any Male friend I told this has either left me or acted differently around me. Or threaten to kill me lol. So to avoid that I avoid speaking to guys even though I want more male friends idk. 

Anyways back to the point. Should I get over my anxiety and talk to a guy in my year more. Last time/anytime we spoke he’d put the most effort in and I feel like he might’ve lost interest in me as he’s stopped trying which I get, I didn’t give him much back.

I’ve been doing 2shifts of 48h hours so I only go to that area two times a month (this was an arrangement I had with my supervisor and she was okay with)
The thing is rn in this city there is no public transportation and no gasoline to fill the tank of your own cars due to that going to work or doing anything outside your home is complicated. 

My problem is she just emailed the shifts of august and to my surprise I found that she put me 2shitfs of 48 and 1 shift of 24H that means I will have to go 3 times and honestly I don’t know how I’m gonna go
It’s been already frustrating dealing with only two shifts past month so now one more. 
I always remembered her our arrangement, once in a while and she was like “yeah yeah let me see”
I feel like she could be a little more considerate or thoughtful with my situation (I am the only one of the staff that does not live near the facility)

That’s why I’m just tired of asking this and I’m a little bit embarrassed about it. 
I’m so mad it’s something that I can not control and with the problems about gasoline, transportation Idk what to do. Resign? 

Well, I’ve just emailed her if she could make a change and just let me do 2shifts no 3.
I guess I could try that at least and see what is she gonna say.

I’m sorry is this is annoying. 
Do you have any advice for me?",29Jul2020,1
224,"WARNING: mentions sexual assault,

I (F17)struggle with mental illness such as depression and anxiety and was diagnosed late 2019 and have been working on pushing myself out my comfort zone. My friend (F18) let’s call her Nina, asked me to go along to a drama thing for the all boys “brother school” to our all girls school. It was just two of us as they needed girl actors. I’ve never done drama and find it really uncomfortable, I said no but after she kept asking I said yes. Recently a guy from the school who was a close friend of mine, I’ll call him matt, kissed me multiple times (3) while I was drunk at a party, I didn’t remember this and only found out when my friends told me later on. When I asked him about it he lied and said it was once on the cheek, I believed him until a video showed him kissing me while I was on a sofa clearly drunk, everyone who knows us knows I would never have let him kiss me if I was sober. I ended up blocking him after he told me he lied to me. Some people have said I’m over reacting and it was just a kiss I didn’t need to block him or get so upset. I also recently found out he was talking to his friends about it and saying how he was the victim and I “took advantage” and then played the victim 

However my mental illness issues stem from a violent sexual assault that happened to me when I was 13 from someone who was my boyfriend at the time, everyone said I was over reacting then too as we were dating at the time. Nina does somewhat know about this event however not the details, now I no longer want to participate in the drama event as it makes me uncomfortable to go to the school for practises and also because 2 of matts friends are in the performance. Would I be the asshole for bailing on my friend and the performance as I know she will be mad at me for bailing the performance is about 5 weeks away. I don’t want to make her mad for ditching her. I don’t know how to tell her either and don’t want to lie but I feel like she won’t think my reasons valid.",29Jul2020,1

227,"On mobile- excuse any formatting errors. 

I (20F) met this guy (20M) on Tinder. He lives in a different town about an hour away. Before we met I was a little hesitant because he was very invested without even meeting me. The first date went fine but he was insanely mushy and romantic. I brushed it off since it was our first time meeting, and thought it was just nerves or excitement. I find out he has told his entire family and friends about me which also weirded me out but I figured he was just really excited. 

Second date, he wants me to meet his family. I find that strange but since he was living at home I figured he was probably around his family a lot and close with them, and he did come to my place first so I ought to go to his place this time. He asks me to be my girlfriend in front of his family and I stupidly say yes (I panicked- I did not want to say “no, I’m not sure if we’re a great match yet and I want to go slower” in front of his family). Again, he was insanely romantic and mushy, saying I was perfect and his baby and everything he wanted. At this point I just didn’t know how to react. 

Third date we’re back at my place....and he tells me he LOVES me. At this point I freaked out. He started asking me if I felt the same way because I didn’t say anything at first. I just told him I liked him but wasn’t ready for love yet. He apologizes but still says things very similar to someone in love and I didn’t really say anything back. 

He constantly says I’m “perfect” and “everything he wants in a girl” and I’m like dude you barely know me?! He had very intense feelings and I believe that if I were to cut it off he would be DEEPLY upset. Right now he’s back in his home town while I am in my town, and he won’t be back in town until school starts in a few weeks. I don’t want to lead him on and I feel so fake replying back to him because I don’t feel the same genuine emotions towards him as he does me. 

I feel like breaking up over the phone is a shitty move, especially for him.....it would really hurt him and come as a shock I think. But, I also don’t want to wait until he comes back to town, because then I’d just be leading him on the next few weeks. I feel awful because at first I genuinely did like him, but the more we got to know each other I realized it wasn’t going to be a great match, and that the “fastness” was not just a ‘first date nervous’ type of thing.   

TLDR; Him saying he is in love with me on the third date is a major turn off that makes me incredibly uncomfortable. I should not have agreed to be his girlfriend on date 2. He is very emotionally invested so I want to let him down easy. Please give me some advice.",29Jul2020,1

With my Medicaid taking forever to go through and waiting a whole 2 months for my food stamp card ( still haven’t gotten it yet ) I have had no money or support for sustaining any type of life. I have lost 20 pounds since I’ve been up here because I haven’t been able to really eat or leave the house, I can’t afford my medication, and I also won’t be able to pay my phone bill coming up or for gas to get to and from my doctors appointments. If anyone could point me in the direction of assistance I would seriously appreciate it because I’m so low at this point sometimes I don’t even wanna be alive.

231,"I’m still pretty young (in middle school, i know that this is an site for 13+ but i need help on this) and this situation happened two years ago.
I got into a big fight with my best friend in 5th grade and we haven’t been friends for a while. We got into fights pretty often but that only made us even better friends when we became friends again after a fight. At my old elementary school, we had this thing called AR (accelerated reader) and we took tests on a book and it gave us points. Around the middle of the year, we switched accounts for AR and took tests for the books we read for each other so we would try more points, but then got into a fight a week or so later, cause I felt guilty about the AR Test things, and I wanted to tell the teacher to fix it, but she didn’t, do then we stopped talking to each other. After another week I told the teacher about it and then my friend got pissed, and then we had an even BIGGER fight. After a month or so though, we texted a bit but then stopped, and now after 2 years i’m sure everything has cooled down, but i don’t really know if I should try to become friends with her again, since i’m in a really amazing friend group right now, but that doesn’t mean i can’t hang out with other people.

232,"I don’t have a good relationship with my dad. I don’t hate him, but being near him makes me uncomfortable. For example, whenever I need to run to the store (a three minute walk away), he watches me from the driveway. I understand that he wants to make sure his daughter stays safe, but it’s over the top. I can’t go out with friends without him giving me a talk about how dangerous drugs are. The last time I invited my friends over (a year ago) we walked to a graveyard that you can see from my house, and when we got back my dad said he had been watching us to make sure we were safe. My friends told me that made them uncomfortable, and I haven’t invited them over since then. It made me upset as well. Now my father wonders why I never have friends over.

Because of instances like this, I don’t feel safe telling my dad about my personal life. He tells me that I can tell him anything, and I know he’s trying to be a good parent, but the way he does it isn’t okay. I’m a senior in high school and I’m not allowed to walk around town by myself. (I live in a very safe town). I have kept so many secrets from my dad because of this and it’s become super stressful. I dread going to my father’s house. For context, my parents are divorced. I trust my mother with everything (except for asking how to confront my dad). My father is remarried and I do trust my stepmom, but I’m scared that she’d out me to my dad if I told her anything. Another reason why I’ve been so hesitant telling my dad about my life is because he tends to get angry whenever things don’t go his way.

 I am a white male and grew up poor in an affluent area of mostly white and Asian households. I am about every human getting a fair shake at life. Any color, race, sex, orientation, et cetera. My experiences in seeing racism first hand are limited. I don't feel like I was on the receiving end except once overhearing a black lady say ""not bad for a white boy."" Which honestly was kind of a turn on. Anyway.

Backstory:
About a decade ago I had a female coworker and she was Dominican with darker skin. We were talking about random things that I really don't remember, except at some point she mentioned her boyfriend (black) sees a lot of racism. I ask her if she did as well. She said ""no, I am Domincan"". 

Question:
Is there a difference to racists if someone's ancestors stopped off in the Caribbean for a few hundred years before coming to America, versus going straight from Africa to America? Do dark skinned people from Latin America receive  an equal amount of prejudice?

239,"So a month ago I got my first job (M 16) at a berry farm. My boss will smoke right in front of me, make me work 8a.m. - 5 p.m. with one 30 minute break, and work in 35°C weather with no remorse. I'm fine with it because hard labor is teaching me how to run a good work ethic. Anyways my friend has asked me after my first day how it went and naturally I complained for a little while, after a while he told me to stop complaining as I'm getting paid (he didn't get hired at two jobs he applied for, so he's annoyed). I stopped and that was that.

Now (4 weeks later) he's just finished his first day at Tim Hortons, which he told me was a training day so he just say around watching work videos. I said that sounds very easy and that it's awesome to have a job so much easier than my own (even though I'm doing mine willingly I wish I could have it easier sometimes). Everything is well and good until his older sister comes in. She told him his job will get much harder as did hers at time Hortons after a while, and half jokingly I said to my friend (not knowing his sister on could hear me over our call) that her and his job is significantly easier than mine and she couldn't last a day at mine. VERY STUPID OF ME and I apologized as soon as I realized how that may have sounded.

She absolutely lost it and started swearing at me and calling me many offensive names and insulting who I am as a person, saying I'm lazy, that she would be 10x the worker I am, and that I'm a bitch and I should tell her in person (threatening me). I very calmly asked for my friend to let me talk to her now realizing I just opened a can of worms. In a very gentle manor I insisted I didn't mean to imply she's a bad or weak worker and that I was very sorry for offending her. She ignored me and told me to grow up and to go fuck myself and a bunch more stuff. I went more into detail saying that she could work fine at my job and that I obviously didn't mean what I said and she just wasn't having any of it. 

About 10 minutes after my big mistake his whole family is woken up by his sister smashing walls and breaking things in their house (allegedly). I'm no longer allowed over and he seems to be defending her even thought I am deeply sorry and even though I literally took all the shit she said to me and just accepted me mistake. Am I the one who is the real problem or is she over reacting? 

TL;DR 
Friends sister got really offended and started cursing at me alot because I semi jokingly said she couldn't last a day where I work because it's way harder than her job.

241,"Hello everyone, thank you for taking the time to read this, and thank you for taking the time to hopefully understand this.

Let me start this off with a question: why do you think we as a species always find a way to hurt and hate each other? We are the most advanced and most intellectually stable species on the planet, but we constantly judge and divide against one another. Why is that? Now the reason I am asking these questions is that recently I have been around two of my closest friends; one is bisexual and the other is transgender. I will not give names for privacy reasons. Each went through a lot of prejudice throughout their lives, and that is something I will never understand.

Now, as usual, everyone is entitled to their own opinion; people dislike people that are different. It’s for some reason natural for our species. We divide race, gender, sexual orientation, and even social status. With the recent social issues around the United States, I have begun to realize something; we always find a reason to hate. Why must we hate others for being themselves? Why must we hate?

Some people back up their bias’ against homosexual people by saying it is against their faith. Why is that? Why do we still judge and harm other people due to a religion that may or may not even be true? I am not against religion; I often enjoy researching them in my spare time. But you should not harm someone due to a religious belief. I am not saying that because I am against religion. I am saying that because I am against harming another human because you assume you are doing the right thing. What god would want their creations hating one another.

Personally I would not want to be a creation of a God that judges people for attempting to be happy. Why would a god create humans and give them hormones determining their sexuality, and then after they determine that sexuality, he just gets angry and sends them to hell? I cannot accept that God would do this; I will not accept it.

The reason I am making this essay is to spread awareness about this issue. People hurt others all the time, intentionally or not. Why must we hurt our brethren? Why must we hurt one another because of our personal beliefs? Why must we divide by race? Why must we hate one another? I apologize if I have made anyone upset, but I am no longer willing to sit by and watch my friends get judged, hurt, and made fun of.

My friends have been hurt, my family has been hurt, and all of you people that judge and hate because of something they cannot control I simply cannot understand why you would feel that way. How could you look at your own son and get angry with them about something they cannot control? How can you look at your friend and leave them because they finally come out to you? They trusted you and you hurt them because you didn’t like what you saw.

Why would you hurt your own blood due to their sexuality? Why would you hurt a fellow human because they are of separate skin color? Why must you hate others when they cannot change what they are? Why must you look down on others with disgust because they just tried to be happy? They finally tried to become themselves, and all you did was turn your back on them.

I am writing from a place of pain for me. As a child, I was never accepted by my fellow classmates. I do not understand the pain of a transgender, anyone of a skin color other than white, or even the opposite gender. I’m a straight white male, yet I will never judge anyone for something they cannot control. I know what it’s like to be an outcast, so whenever I see people judge others because they wanted to finally be themselves, it makes me uncontrollably angry.

I beg of you all who read this, please help one another. Please do not outcast others; they just want to be loved like all of you. Please do not hurt people when all they want is happiness. Please do not leave someone who is in need of a helping hand. Please do not break someone’s trust because they weren’t who you thought. Please love one another again.

To those who read this and change their ways, you are in my eyes a changed person, and I admire you for accepting others. Please spread the word and make this world a better place. Remember to love others and to help those in need.

To all the people out there who judge one another due to sexuality, race, gender, or any other uncontrollable factor hear me when I say this. There is no difference between us; we are all human, we are all capable of love, and we are all beautiful. Please do not judge others and please do not hurt anyone ever again. I beg of you as a nearly broken man, please love one another again… please.

So fast forward to the present, I get drunk calls from this girl  and we talk a lot on over the phone about everything... since we still have the same friend group I invited then to a party and she wanted to get alone with me and we did and I went in for the kiss ya know and she backed up im like ok cool whatever... then she forced me into saying goodbye to her alone and I leaned in during a hug and pecked her cheek. Afterwards we agree to hangout sometime and she canceled and said she was talking to someone and didnt wanna hangout alone with me... we are going to another prty together with our freind groups soon.

246,"I live in a condo rental (thank god I don't own this place) and while I love most everything about being here, including affordable rent, the neighbor is driving me insane. 

She has some sort of obvious mental impairment/disability and she has told me that her family has bought the place for her to live. Truly, I don't think she should be living alone but that's not my call to make of course. She has ZERO boundaries however and infinite time and it gives me such anxiety in the summer. 

Because she has no job, she just lurks around and waits to hear me open my door before she zooms out to ""say hi"". One time she was only partially dressed, she was so frantic to get out to catch me. I have a little backyard that I like to let my dog out to use the bathroom and just to enjoy the space (it's one of the perks of living here, in theory), but this summer I basically haven't been using it at all because she is so much of a vulture. It's gotten to the point where I asked my brother to stop by to mow the yard for me because I just couldn't stand to be cornered again. And of course, as soon as she heard the mower, she was out there in a flash. 

She not only rants on and on but she always has some favor to ask. Can I sweep her yard, can I help her pull weeds, can I go pick up shopping for her..... She never takes a gentle hint either. 

It's hard because she's also very unstable and vindictive, she thinks she ""runs the neighborhood"" even though there isn't an HOA and each place is privately owned. I've seen firsthand with other neighbors, if you tick her off she'll make your life hell. 

I'd rather have her as a 'friend' than an enemy, and she is nice to me since she likes me. She is just insanely obnoxious though and  holy shit is she giving me major anxiety.

“Hanging out” at her office is still really fun. We play therapy games and do things like that.

The company gave me a week’s notice about an option to defer my start date until August 2021 which would include a $15,000 stipend payed in full this month and pay for the CFA, CFP, and CPA accreditations. I thankfully have no student loan debt and graduated with a bachelors in finance. I do enjoy finance and think I will enjoy my job considering it will lead to a sales role after two years of underwriting, but I feel as though this year is an opportunity to find passions/jobs/hobbys/travel that I did not know of before. The problem is that we are in the middle of a pandemic and travel is not much of an option and part time jobs are limited (because that’s what I would do on top of studying for CFA). I’m in my early 20’s, just graduated this May. I’m worried about not being on track with work, yet at the same time I don’t want to pass up this opportunity I’ve been granted.

251,"Im 16.  Me and my mom talk story a lot, about every day.  Random things like about covid 19 and our governor and stuff.  But my mom is a racist and also has a lot of opinions I don’t agree with.  She tells me and my siblings that “Black babies come out the ass” and she calls Black people the N word and she says things about indians and filipinos and says that they are all “rubbish” and she says “japanese are way higher class than them, they are rubbish people look at them.” and I used to argue with her and tell her that is wrong but after countless arguments I cannot change her opinions so I stopped, and instead I asked her to just mind me and please not talk about that stuff by me.  But she still does, all the time.  I tell her every time that I don’t like it but she doesn’t pay thay any mind at all.  Now today what happened was, we were talking about these weird tik tok people, and my sister said “you know that song that goes I hate everything about you, they made it a tik tok song and it ruined it for me”  and my mom says “i hate that song” and then says “men are weak, men are weak minded ass creatures” and said another offensive thing that I can’t remember about men with my literally sitting right there.  So I say “what!?!? men make this world go round!! what is dad doing right now?!?!  he is out working lifting shit and painting to make money for us!!! men are so weak huh”  and my mom completely brushed that off and just repeats herself and tells me “men are so weak” so I go “really?!?!  you gonna do that with me right here?!?!  im not weak!!”  then my mom calls me bipolar and i tell her “well you shouldn’t do that, what if i were to start saying stuff about women right now?” she says “ahh shutup bipolar ass” and then she started talking to my sister and outed me from the conversation.  So I walked away and went upstairs and then yells from upstairs “how about when dad gets home you tell him men are weak and see if he gets offended or not!”  and left it at that.  normally i never get the last word in but this time i made an exception lol.

I found someone's wallet in the house I am staying in (I’m in an Air BnB in SE Oklahoma). It's not the owners and me being the nosy person I am I went through the wallet. It has a ID, a debit card and someone's social security card and a few other things.

258,"First, I don't like the word 'subordinates', but english is not my native language and I don't know any synonyms...

I'll try to describe my problem the best that I can:

I am 3rd engineer aboard a drilling ship, since may of this year. In my country, there are two ways to reach this role on a marine vessel:
- start from a lower ranking and gradually being promoted (from a wiper, then a oiler, and then a fitter), depending on how long they work on that role. It takes around 10y to become an engineer; or
- taking a nationwide test (with 60 candidates for a spot) to enter a college, and graduate as a engineer after 4y.

I made it the second way. Before starting as an engineer I worked as an intern in 3 other ships, and the lower-ranked workers always had some trouble understanding the machinery; their ability and occupation was the mechanical support. I was comfortable and excited about looking into problems with them.

But on this ship, the oilers and fitters are fixed. Most of them embark there for over 5y. They don't understand completely the equipment, but they repaired then SO many times that they already know the causes and consequences of each failure.

As a 3rd engineer, there're the Chief and 2nd engineer above me, that plan the bigger maintenances, but I'm accountable for the planning and assigning tasks of the smaller maintenances. So, finally:

How can I order a fitter or an oiler that is clearly far more experienced than I am? I don't want to ask them for advice, as I don't want to lose authority, but if I order something that is wrong I lose it anyway...

What I know for sure is that I want to get a masters degree In history, (I have yet to decide a specific time/region but that’s beside the point), but I’m also extremely interested in archeology, which I’ve noticed also requires a master to get any good positions in the field. I wanted to look for a dual degree in History &amp; Archeology, see if I can get a job in the archeological field and have the history degree to fall back on/help me in the archeological field. But I’ve been reading up a lot on how hard, and how much work dual degrees can be on people. I don’t know if it’s worth it. I was also trying to find schools that offered a dual degree program like that and I could only find 3 maybe 4 (keep in mind I still don’t fully understand how the dual degree program works, like do I need to find a specific program or can I just choose 2 and do the extra work?). Also what are some collages that have good programs in those fields?

265,"I'm in college and still don't know what to do. As of right now im taking general studies to at the very least get the basics out of the way. 
I had many thoughts as to what to be. A game Warden, a park ranger, animal cruelty investigator, and more stuff but I always back down due to a certain fear. With all the jobs I mentioned either has to have police background or something. Heck, even without the police background you would still need to kinda act like one. I cant. I'm not assertive enough and avoided conflict like the plague. Sometimes I tear up when getting yelled at for crying put loud! I mainly wanted these jobs because I'm outside or working with animals (and no I don't want to be a veterinarian) 

I thought of being a truck driver because I enjoy driving and traveling. However I'm not aggressive with my driving enough. When on the highway I stay on the right lane going the speed limit. I hate being in the middle and don't usually pass people unless they are driving slowly. I'm too passive. Also I'm afraid that I may mess up and cause a wreck. I know they teach you, but even then I have low confidence in my ability. 

There are other jobs I thought of but those are a couple of examples. I just always thought that I should build confidence first before deciding what to do because I feel like low confidence is holding me back. I had built it up a bit from high school but even today I'm still on the lower end of things and I feel like I'm at a stopping point. What can I do?

268,"So I wrote something similar to this a few days ago, I got some good advice, I’d like some more advice, and some advice that’ll preferably work sooner than later.

I’ve been a musician my entire life, I don’t remember not being one. I’m 14 now, I’ve been playing the piano since I was 4, singing since I was 5, I’ve been teaching myself dance since I was in fifth grade (Michael Jackson’s style), and I’ve been learning and improving my producing since I was in the 7th grade.

A little about my family background is my great, great, great uncle was a popular blues singer who’s worked with Ray Charles and BB King, my grandfather collected music, my grandmother was a church singer, my dad is a professional musician who ALMOST made it into the industry, and my uncle is an ameteur producer. We all live around the Houston area.

Music is one thing I love and one thing I’m good at. I often go online and sing for people, and they actually love it, they say I can have a chance in the industry, but I know how difficult it is to get in, and I want some more guidance on how to successfully get in.

My sound is a mix between 90’s R&amp;B, 90’s Hip-Hop, some early 2000’s variants of those styles, and I throw in some jazz chords and stuff to make it more interesting to the ear. R. Kelly is a huge inspiration (vocally) and producers like Babyface, Teddy Riley, and Dr. Dre are huge inspirations for my production. I’ve noticed that singing is coming back in favor, and I think if I don’t mess up, I maybe will have a chance.

I have a YouTube channel, but I haven’t uploaded in forever, I have stuff I’m working on but I almost never finish it. Early today, I went online and took a medical exam for OCD, Idk how accurate it is but it said I show strong signs which might be why I hesitate so much on posting things that people I’m close with head and like but I always notice something that might not even matter. Whenever I do something, it’s always something I wish I could do differently, when I put stuff out I want it to be perfect since I’ll have a lot of competition in the music world. It bugs me to put stuff out if it isn’t completely finished, it feels like it gives a reason for me to be ignored if it isn’t perfect.

Just in case you were wondering, my backup plan if I don’t make it into the industry is a computer science/engineering degree, I still plan on going to college. I also wanna get into acting some more.

But please help with this, it feels like this is my purpose, especially when my whole family is really music oriented. I’ve written songs before, I started on my first song when I was in fifth grade, I can write rap songs too (90’s inspired.) I wanna know what I can do, how to get record executives to notice me, kind of how Billie Eilish was noticed on SoundCloud, but I don’t already have anyone in the industry in my family. Who can I talk to, what can I do? Please leave advice I’m the comments. If something I said makes absolutely no sense, it’s because I’m kind of sleepy, but please help me out.

90’s styled music and singing is making a comeback and I wanna ride on the wave. I’d like to be noticed soon so I can grow while I perform and get bigger, kind of how Michael Jackson got better over time while performing a lot. I know there are two kids in my area big in music (locally) but they do an entire different genre than I do. They do more of a modern rap, I do mostly R&amp;B and whenever I do something rap related, it’s more lyrical than rap is today. The dude I know that’s somewhat in right now (his most popular song on YouTube has 4.7K views) is way more street than I am, he posts himself doing shit I’d never do, like smoking &amp; drinking is something I’d never do because of how much it can fuck up your voice and other shit. The girl I know that’s in it is high maintenance, she probably wouldn’t wanna talk to me, she has 53.5K followers on Instagram, but she hangs with people like the other kid I mentioned. And I suck at talking to females anyway so I’d probably say some dumb shit tbh. 

But anyway, my question is how do I get noticed, preferably before the age of 18? I say before 18 because there’s a lot of other things I gotta do when I’m 18, so it’ll be easier before. How do I get someone like Billie Eilish to notice what I’m doing? I have a lot to offer at my age and I can grow a lot over time from this.

275,"So I have this friend (lets call him Seth) who is 21 and he has autism. I honestly don't mind that he has autism as I have had other friends with the same thing and we got along fine, but Seth on the other hand has mostly high functioning autism (im pretty sure, i just looked both high functioning and low functioning and he has some on both sides of the spectrum). We became friends back in 2017 when we were in school and we used to hang out and go to each others houses to play video games, go trick or treating together (even though we were to old), go to haunted houses, hang out at six flags, hang out my other friends house (who im going to call Rick and he also has autism but its not bad at all compared to Seth. His autism is only noticeable when it comes to trains, old classic cars, and...furries). 

 Anyway, in the past I'm not sure if I even cared as much that he was annoying or even noticed it or mabye I did and just brushed it off, but recently it's became even more of an issue for me and my friend Rick. He has the mind of a child but at the same time has a dark sense of humor, likes edgy memes, death metal, rick and morty, my little pony, and wears jeans (even in the summer when its hot as hell outside), death metal shirts, my little pony shirts, or a shirt with star vs the forces of evil on it, a mask that has a skull on it that even post covid he would wear all the time over his face, painted fingernails, and long dyed red hair that he says he will never ever cut for some reason. Whenever he comes over to my house he always want to play on my xbox and never gets off of it, we usually take turns on GTA everytime we die but he always ends up going into a lobby midway into his turn and starts doing missions and I'm just left on my phone or laptop for the remainder of the time hes there. And if were not on the xbox or if I say I don't want to go on the xbox he whines like a 6 year old not getting his way and says ""why not!"" and ""come on please!"" and ""we'll take turns!"". 

 Recently we've been playing a new game on my laptop which he really likes a lot called ""The Torture Game"" and ""Happy Room"" (happy room is basically the torture game for those who dont know) and he forgot all about the xbox but sometimes forgets to give the laptop back to me when hes playing the games on my laptop. Another issue is whenever he talks he talks about a subject and i know im gonna sound like a complete dickhead but, he never. shuts. up. about what hes talking about. I always end up resorting to saying ""yeah"", ""cool"", ""same"", and ""mhm"" whenever he starts going on and on about whatever hes talking about whether it be a meme, the game were playing, something he wants us to roleplay about the game were playing, anime, music, etc, but he never picks up on the fact that im bored and uninterested. Sometimes ill get the question ""why arent you laughing?"" or if im trying to ignore him so he'll get the hint that im not interested in talking at the moment he'll say my name over and over and over again until I finally talk. Another thing he does is whenever I get into an argument or altercation or whatever you wanna call it with my parents he tries to act like hes the adult and says ""yeah you should really listen to your mom"" or ""you really shouldnt do that"" and stuff like that. 


 I am honestly to the point where I just wanna block his number and ghost him altogether but he has my address, his mom knows my mom, were going to the same college in august (though ill be on the 6th floor and he'll be on the 2nd which is good but he might just end up showing up to my room uninvited whenever he wants), me seth and rick have all been having a guys day every saturday and last saturday we didnt want him to come to where we were going but he came anyway. Another thing is Rick dosent even like him, he also thinks hes very annoying and gets on his nerves A LOT. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I feel like I have no other choice than to be friends with him. I've tried to drop the hint that I didn't want to be friends anymore but he always is like ""no your just kidding"" and ""nooo were best friends"" and stuff like that. I don't want to just straight up tell him I dont want to be friends anymore because 1. he'll think its a joke and 2. i will feel like a huge asshole. Can someone help me solve this issue please?

278,"I've loved musical theatre for as long as I can remember and like most schools with a theater group we do a musical every year. It's a great way to involve the chorus, band, and art club in a single project. I would say 50% of the people at my school are Asian and yet all the White kids get lead or supporting roles while all the Asians get cast as the extras. It just makes me upset because I've seen Asians at my school who have the same or better skillset than a White person and the White person gets the role because they ""look more like the character"" I get that appearance matters but it just makes me feel like I can never get a lead role no matter how good my singing or acting is because I don't look like a character. Broadway musicals like Mean Girls or Hamilton are so accepting of different races in their cast and don't care about whether you look like the character but if you can perform the character.

I feel like if you can perform the character it's much more important than if you look like the character. I almost feel like quitting theatre and singing because I know I'm not going to get the role anyways. I know it sounds so conceded to think ""I know I'm better than this person so why didn't I get the role"" but it's so frustrating because you can't ""prove"" that you have a better skill set than someone. My school once did Mulan the Musical Jr. as the musical for the year and I cannot tell you how excited all the Asians were when they announced this even if they weren't Chinese. All the Asians were ecstatic that they finally had a chance to get a lead role because they finally ""looked like the character"" 

 I remember sitting in the auditorium listening to everyone audition thinking how even if I didn't get a lead role another Asian can get casted as Mulan and how happy I would be to finally see an Asian in a leading role. A week later when the results came out I was so excited to see who got casted as Mulan because I knew that is was going to be an Asian. My disappointment was immeasurable when I saw a white kid got casted as Mulan then I kept going down the list. Every single lead and supporting role belonged to a white person and the Asians were, of course, the extras again. Theatre wanted us to look like the characters and when we finally did they had to take it away from us. I just don't understand, no matter how hard we work or how good we are we're never going to get the role simply because we're Asian. I know I sound very racist in this post but this is honestly how I feel. I love musical theatre but why try if I'm going to get rejected because of something I cant change?",29Jul2020,1

282,"I couldn't find a better way to phrase it.

I (26) guess I should open with I'm a happily(?) closeted trans woman? Puberty ended up making me a 6'8 monster with a huge frame and to be frank I don't think I could ever pass or be the person I want to be so I'm begrudgingly content to just exist as male.

When I was about 14 I was struggling with feelings of gender identity and made the poor decision to seek advice and help from my mom (57 now). She hit me, broke my things, and humiliated me (thankfully none of the hitting left any permanent marks and I protected my more important things with my body since she tried to break my computer in her rage).

After she kind of got it out of her system I put it behind us and never brought it up again. I ~~pretend~~ present as female on my main social media accounts under a fake name and it's really the only place I feel whole but frankly nothing distinguishes me from a catfishing ""GIRL"" (Guy In Real Life) asides from my feelings of dysphoria.

Anyways, I just felt that was important background. As far as my mom knows, we put the issue of my gender identity behind us (hell, she probably doesn't even remember hitting me that time, she was very moody and physical after her divorce). So I have an... okay relationship with her now because I'm closeted and it's in the past, but I feel like I can't forgive her. 

Which I try really hard to forgive her. On one hand I think she was right because I think I'd be more miserable trying to transition and failing miserably than I would being a guy and living with the dysphoria. But it's like... she did the wrong things (hitting me) for the wrong reasons (she was ashamed of me being trans) but it kinda worked out? It makes me feel like I should forgive her.

She has her own emotional vulnerabilities after her divorce and she lives alone but I come stay with her on the rare occasion, but she's needy and codependent and I'm not sure if she thinks she's being ""cute"" but she acts like she doesn't respect me. She asks me to watch television with her, go out to dinner with her, and do other things. Which is nice of her, but it feels like it's solely to abate her own loneliness.

I know I kinda fed you a one-sided sob story, but I tried to be as mild and vague as I could without getting overly emotional. 

Should I forgive her? Am I being cruel by not reciprocating her desire to socialize with me as she gets older?",29Jul2020,1

286,"Hello everyone, I’m asking for advice. 
So I’m living with 3 other people and we all have long hair. I’ve been staying at this apartment for an entire month straight, me personally not going out at all. My roommates usually go out (separate from each other). 

Today marks an entire month and a week that I return to my parent’s house and my mom discovers some white dots in my hair. She knows it’s nits from lice and so then I go and tell my roomates. 

My roommates take it OK at first (normal reactions to finding out someone you live with has lice), get their shampoos and combs, but decide to NOT use the lice shampoo because they “couldn’t find any lice”. I asked them to thoroughly check for nits, and they said they only found “1 or 2” on one person, and decided not to use the shampoo. I argue against this because it’s a preventative measure, but unfortunately for whatever reason they don’t want to do it. 

I’m a young college student. These people are my friends. I know they’re also going to talk shit about me but I’ve made it very clear to them (and they know because I’m literally always home) that I’ve been nowhere in the past month and suddenly I have lice. I don’t want to lose my friends so here’s where the need for advice comes in. I have the option to stay home, but what happens when I have to move back? Hopefully they’re right and don’t have anything wrong. But if they’re not, and this happens all over again, that would suck for me. Should I stay with my parents for a week or two?",29Jul2020,1

288,"if it wasn’t obvious from my post history, this is a new alt account. 
Around this time last year I became close friends with a boy who has various mental health issues.  While we were friends, he would hit me with spoons, rocks, and sometimes his hand. I don’t have any proof of it because I thought it was normal for best friends to be rough with each other I guess. 
The main issue comes when one night he kept pressuring me to “explore” (he’s gay) and I said no. We kept talking but then he laid down and bit my thigh. I kept telling him to get off, but he didn’t. In later months he would continue to bite my fingers, arms, and hair. 
But when school started, I confronted him about it and he claimed nothing to have ever happened, and now I’m left at a loss. All my friends are also his, and they’ve taken his side. I tried going to administration and they did basically nothing, but I still think of him every day. He still talks to my friends, and keeps trying to distance them from me. I’ve blocked him everywhere, but I still feel so dirty and used. Is there anyway to maybe get rid of the feeling surrounding him?",29Jul2020,1
289,"I am on the verge of panic and tears as I’m writing this. 
I went to see a dermatologist a couple of months ago for hair loss and acne concerns. She told me the only way to know if my birth control pill is the cause of my hair loss was to quit it and wait 6 months, she also prescribed me an anti-fungal shampoo and an acne medication called tazarotine which is a retinol. 

She did not inform me of all the birth defects this acne medication can cause and actually suggested quitting my BC, which I did. I am in a 4 year relationship so I didn’t think it was a big deal as I’m going to spend the rest of my life with this person. 
I have been using my retinol for about two months, and also quit my pill. So now I am awaiting my period.

Something clicked in my brain to read the warnings of the retinol medication as my skin has gone a little dry from it..... and I was shocked. Birth defects??? Premature birth? I am so torn up inside as I could very well be pregnant right now. I am terrified and scared. I cannot believe this doctor is a doctor! She did not inform me of any of this.

290,"Hey there, folks.

I was walking my cat on his leash and harness after dark in our apartment complex and one of the tenants took a picture of me through their window without my permission. I think they were trying to be sneaky, but their flash was on and I saw it. The window was open, so I looked up and said ""hello"" very nicely. They didn't respond, but I heard the lady (there were two people) laugh. 

I felt a bit violated and considered it to be pretty rude. Not illegal, but certainly rude.

Personally, I'm not satisfied with letting it go, and have gone through my usual trains of thought of a revenge plot or writing a strongly-worded letter and sticking it to their door. I'm generally very nonconfrontational, so the idea of either is pretty stressful.

I'm not good at this sort of thing, so I'm just looking for some advice on how to handle the situation. Even if it's best to just leave it be, that's perfectly good advice.

291,"&amp;#x200B;

So I signed up to go on a Christian mission trip in the USA this time last year from Europe. Basically how it works is you raise money to commit to a whole academic year in a random region of the US and you go to training and get placed on a team. One of the rules you agree to when you sign up is to not date or pursue a relationship during the time you spend as a missionary. The first day of training, I saw this girl who was insanely attractive. I'd try to avoid her so I wouldn't get distracted but it was obvious to me that I singled her out from the other hundreds of people there. I hoped that the attraction I had would go away so I avoided sitting at the table she sat at or her friend group. I thought at the time we would part ways when we got picked on different teams.

Then *boom* I remember the night before we get placed on teams I had hoped she wouldn't be on my team because the year would be so long but against the odds she was placed on the same team as me. We as a group spent a lot of time getting to know each other at first, and during this time me and her developed a good relationship. I was 99% certain she was perfect for me around then, but I had to wait and focus on the year I committed to. I was sure that after I would find a way.

Anyway as the months go on, I subtly try to show her my interest by making her laugh a lot, carrying her stuff... I felt that I had to compete against the other guys on the team by being a simp. There was one guy who from the start I didn't like at all, in fact none of the guys liked him, he was in charge of the team and was the definition of a d1ckhead who I will call Dillon, he was cunning and very manipulative but was in charge and experienced and was the ""example"" for us to follow. My relationship with him soured a lot. It got to a point where I was finding it hard to stay there but at about the right time I had to return home to Europe for a few weeks.

During my time at home I spent a lot of time thinking of how things would go when I got back, I was frustrated because she wasn't contacting me, I felt like I deserved like a ""hows it going?"" after all I was doing for her all those months. I was annoyed and wanted to become less of a simp next time around and maybe then she'll be more attracted idk.

So I went back and straight away I noticed things were different between us, I sort of ignored her for like the first week because I was annoyed and it seemed obvious but she just seemed like she didn't notice and gave no attention to it. I spent time around other girls to see if she would be jealous, I didn't make eye contact when she was talking... It was obvious that I wasn't going to get her to budge and I wanted her attention badly so I just gave up and resorted back to trying to make her laugh and do things for her. I felt like such a simp but this time I felt she had no interest in me and Dillon who I spoke of earlier was becoming the center of attention.

One of the worst days I can recall was when I was doing volunteer work with other teammates at a large event and we were treated to dinner after our hard work. I was at a table eating and chatting with the hosts and I glanced around the room and noticed she wasn't there. I waited for a break in the conversation so I could walk into the lobby and as soon as I walked out the door, her and Dillon were very close against a wall, she looked very infatuated with him and I went to the bathroom filled with anger and frustration because he was a d1ck to her as much as anyone else yet I treated her like an angel.

Keep in mind we were on a strict no-dating/relationships rule and I was sticking with that. Dillon knew I liked this girl and pushed it even further, tackling her on the beach and smirking at me, carrying her, complimenting her and some far more inappropriate things I won't mention here all of which was very much against the rules he was there to enforce. 

I hated his guts and hated her too internally, but on the outside I played it cool and everything was fine. Luckily for me, COVID-19 forced us all to be sent home. Around this time my family emigrate to the US permanently. She decided to fly on the same flight as me to a connecting airport, I spent 4 hours talking to her, bought her stuff and saw her off to the exit. 

Turns out Dillon committed some serious sexual misconduct and is permanently banned and all the team have blocked him and are disturbed at his behavior, which kind of gives me the last laugh. When she left I missed her a lot. I contacted her the next day and called for a while, after that contact was sporadic but fast forward a few months and she's tells me she's attending the same university that I am going to and this is what I need help with...

What should I do from here?

As you can tell, she very likely isn't interested in me that way, I'm frustrated with how she treated me but don't want to show it. Sometimes I feel strongly for her still and think I should just ask her out since she's the most attractive girl I've seen... 

If you took the time to read this and give me your take, please know I appreciate it more than you know. It's hard for me to write this up but it's been in my head constantly and any take on this will help direct the next chapter of my life.

I then posted on a random subreddit, then a guy texted me. We both love foods and such. We do have a lot in common, so I didn’t bother to reply to his message request. We had a lot of fun at first.

Things escalated quickly. We stopped exchanging texts and pics, midnight calls, and others. I sent him a message a few hours ago and he texted back with a cold reply. I felt extremely sad for the past few weeks to the point that I’m crying myself to sleep. I’m pretty sure he’s not that lonely since he has a girlfriend to talk to. But the point is why would he “ghost” me in such ways? And why do guys find another girl to talk to if they already have it?

Dear Mom, 

I love you very much, but I feel like our relationship could be better. Over the past few years our family has gone through some rough patches. I feel that we would benefit from therapy. When we first moved in with Uncle Jeff, the two of us argued frequently and it was tough on all of us. Things didn’t get much better when we moved into Grandma’s house and after that you moved on and moved back in with Dad. This period of moving around and arguing has affected me. I have not moved on yet. Mom, I love you and think that therapy would be the best option for both of us. We both have things to improve on and counseling would help a great deal. I understand that this may be hard to read but these are my feelings. I hope we can discuss this in further detail later.

My parents weren’t getting along and my mom cheated on my dad, which I felt caused him to develop a drinking problem. Since sheltering in place started, his drinking has become bad. My little brother and I used to go to his house every other week, but now my mother doesn’t allow us because he can’t take care of us and how he treats us. I used to visit my father on my own, but I would always find him extremely drunk or passed out on the couch. He would also be either really annoying or a complete dick. If he was in an angry mood, he would call me names, call my mom names, start fights with me. I’ve stopped visiting him because of these reasons and he truly does scare me. I also feel extremely bad for not visiting him anymore because he’s all alone. My mom doesn’t want us to see him and his family is not talking to him right now because of what an asshole drunk he is. I’m really worried about him and I don’t know what to do. Before his drinking, he was a great father and a great role model. He used to do everything with me and my little brother. He was thoughtful, caring, loving, wise, fun, happy and now he is a whole different person. I don’t recognize my father anymore. It’s almost like he died, but his body is here on earth with a drunken asshole inside of it. He drunk texts me constantly asking me why I haven’t been over and why I don’t love him. I’m only a kid and I don’t know how to help him. I just want my father back, but I feel like it will never happen, especially with covid going on right now. He currently doesn’t go to work because he is a teacher and I’m worried he will never stop drinking and lose his job when he is able to teach again. He loves his job, but I’m afraid he loves alcohol more than anything else in his life. It destroys me seeing him like this. I spend countless nights crying myself to sleep because I feel like my father is gone.

Snapchatting every day and we’ve hung out as friends probably twice since then. I didn’t have any desire to get back together with her, have sex with her, or anything since we broke up. I’ve been a lot happier since we broke up. I even started dating a new girl and we lasted for about a month before she broke up with me in June. That breakup has been really painful and hard to get through. I’m still healing from it even though it was only a month, it was just really rough.

Anyways, even through this breakup I haven’t had any romantic feelings towards my ex (the one I broke up with in January), until yesterday morning I woke up from a dream about having sex with her, and I couldn’t shake off that feeling. It made me happy and I started to want that. I figured I was just horny and in need of intimacy, so I ignored it and went on with my day.

I try to not get sucked in and participate in her rants but I’m afraid that not agreeing with her and sometimes prompting questions or statements to suggest a different perspective seems to have given her the idea that I think I’m better than her. 

I can only try my best to be my best self but I’m still human with feelings and baggages and my own fragile ego too and it really irks me when she directs her negativity towards me. 

On an instance, she jokingly accused me of being difficult and snobby when I asked a shop assistant for a specific item, an item she considered a novelty, and the petty and unnecessary remark really threw me off. 

I have tendencies to internalise conflicts and am not always good at dealing with it in the moment nor standing up for myself in a constructive way, especially when my feelings are hurt. I was really confused and felt badly after a couple of negative interactions with her and have been wondering how I could’ve better dealt with the situations?

I cried myself to sleep hearing what they really think

You're fat you’re sad and your brain is really wack

How can I go on? How can I move on?

When all they ever see is what I hate to think?

I just want to hide I just want to leave cause there’s no place for me

Someday you'll move up

You'll meet someone new

You’ll do what you love

How can I think that 

How can you know that 

When we are here today 

Living day by day

Here’s what I know

Here’s what I think

I'm here today 

Hurting for fate

What if i'm alone

What if i'm poor

What happens when i'm living behind a store

My world is in shambles 

My life is a wave

That crashes on rocks 

Sometimes it's nice

Other times it’s a slice

Cuts through my life 

Like a knife 

(Course)

This is my last

There’s nothing left

Except for my dept

To my regret

I have to move on 

I have to tear on

Like a climber I climb 

To the tip of the cliff

I see what I've done 

And I see that I've moved on

I see that I've grown up

I’ve made a new job

And met new people

Today's been a blast

And tomorrow will too

Cause I know what to do

To speak the truth

Life sometimes sucks 

into and out of

But the more that you move

And The less that you rue

The better you do",29Jul2020,1
313,I keep getting recommendations on Instagram for people who I know are old friends of mine from elementary school (I’m in high school now). Would it be weird to request to follow them after not seeing them for years?,29Jul2020,1
314,"I've been overweight since elementary school, and ever since then it has made everything difficult. From being ridiculed, to having no self confidence or control. I'm 17 now and I can't take it anymore. Plane seats suck, amusement parks suck, certain types of chairs suck. I'm almost 300lbs and there's nothing more I want in life than to lose this weight. Unfortunately I've done permanent damage, I have many stretch marks all over my body and I'm extremely self conscious about it. Wherever I go I have to wear a shirt. I've tried losing weight damn near 10 times now. I just want to be comfortable in my own skin again. I'm too embarrassed to reach out to anyone I know so I figured reddit would be best. How can I help myself before there's no turning point?",29Jul2020,1
315,"My life is stable now, but I’m not happy at all. I want to change my job and place to live, but I’m scared of doing so, especially during this pandemic. I feel lost and don’t know what to do. I want to make changes but I’m scared to take risks.",29Jul2020,1
316,"Hey everyone! So, I’m just gonna jump right into this. I’m a 20 year old rising college senior, soon to be 21. I started off as a Physics major, quickly changed to a Computer Science major, and now have seemingly settled in as a Math major with Comp Sci minor. I still live with my parents, as I commute to my college which is only 20 minutes away (or at least I used to before corona). I’m unemployed and most of my income comes from occasionally selling stuff online or doing the odd DoorDash type job every once in a while.

As is the case with many people in college nowadays, I have no idea what I’m doing. I don’t know why I’m spending all of this time getting a degree in something I may or may not actually enjoy. It feels like I’m just floating down this river that was laid out for me by others and I’m slowly approaching a waterfall that I’ve only just now realized is there.

Again, as is the case for many of us, I was simply expected to go to college and it seemed like the easiest option, so I went with it because, why not? Sure I questioned it, and honestly even thought that it wouldn’t get me anywhere, but I thought that since it has gotten so many people somewhere, then I was probably wrong.

But now, I’m reaching a breaking point. And more than that, I feel extremely guilty, lazy, and selfish for taking so much time thinking about this and not taking action. My girlfriend is in a much more difficult situation right now. She’s stuck at home with her mentally abusive parents who are gonna kick her out if she’s not moved out by November. And while that may seem totally understandable to some of you considering she’s 20 years old, her 24 year old brother still lives at home as well and her parents don’t seem to care when he moves out. They’re awful people and I want to do as much as I can to get her out of that situation. She’s able to spend the night at my house sometimes, buts that’s not a viable long-term solution. She has a part-time job (not in college and never went to college) and is struggling to save up money, especially since her parents don’t provide food or really any basic necessities for her either.

I feel like I’m being selfish and lazy mainly because I haven’t had an internship, I don’t know what I want to do with this degree, and I can’t even bring myself to get a part time job. I worked at an ice cream shop for about 6 years, from 8th grade to my freshman year of college, and it completely consumed my life. No matter how hard I try, I can’t bring myself to get another retail job, or really any job where I can’t be my own boss. I can’t stand having to interact with people all day and rely on coworkers in order to get everything done. I don’t know where to go from here.

We need to get an apartment by November or else she’s probably going to have to move to Colorado to live with her grandparents. The apartment we have been looking at for quite some time costs $1,400-$1,600 per month, which is below average where I live. We’ll probably split the cost evenly, unless one of us makes a lot more money than the other, which means about $750 per month. Let’s round that up to $900 per month for groceries, subscriptions, savings, etc. That means I need to start making at least $225 per week very soon, as does she. And we really only have 2 months because I think we need to put a deposit down for the apartment a month before moving in.

Now that we have all the main information out of the way, what I’ve really come here to ask for is some advice on what my options are here. I really cannot see myself being happy having a retail job again, or really any job where I’m not my own boss. Are there any realistic options by which I can be my own boss, or at least do things on my own and on my own schedule, and still make the amount of money I listed above pretty much right away? Or is my only option here really just to get a retail job or paid internship? Or, is there another option that I'm missing?

I know this is an easy decision for most people: just get a retail job. But I think that if I do that, it is going to completely consume my life like it did in the past and I’m not going to be able to really enjoy anything. That’s not worth it to me. I know that I probably sound like a lazy, spoiled brat here, but i just don’t know what to do. I should be grateful that I even have the opportunities that I have, but I don’t want to end up living a miserable life.

Anyways, I’ll stop rambling on now. If anyone has any advice whatsoever, I would greatly appreciate it.

TL/DR: I’m a college student and I need to move out with my girlfriend by November. Apartment cost is $1400-$1600 per month. I’ve worked at retail for years, and it consumes my life, so I don’t know if I can do that again. Does anyone know of a job that allows me to be my own boss, or at least have control over my own schedule and not have to work with/around other people, that I would be able to start making at least \~$225 per week right away? Or is my only option to suck it up and get a retail job or internship? Or is there another option I'm not thinking of?",29Jul2020,1
317,So my work closed due to current events. I am considering opening my own business doing what i did before but for home. What i do takes a very unique skill set that is difficult for some people to understand. My apprentice from my old jobs is also out of work. It would really be nice to hire someone I don’t have to start from scratch with in training. The only bad thing is she obviously has a crush on me. My wife is actually good friends with her and knows she has a crush on me and is ok with me bringing her into the company. I just don’t do well with awkwardness and I don’t know how well the 3 of us being stuck in a small building for 8 hours a day will go. And i know the business will do well enough to warrant hiring another person because just from our inner circle from work i have enough jobs pre booked that it would take me 2 months to fill.,29Jul2020,1

321,"I live with a loving family, and we moved to California in 2012. I was at first normal, until I was just as stubborn in the 10th grade as I was in first. I failed my classes, cheated for a GED, and got myself hooked on more than I care to admit. I got myself deep into trouble in this town, stealing and evading police. I have been messing up so much. I really hate myself for it and want to stop, but don’t know where to start. I’m applying for a musical college, music being the only thing I’m truly good at. This is currently my only motivation to strive, as well as my mother still being alive. Otherwise, I just feel so drained. Im so susceptible to physical pain, work has always been hard.

324,"Feel free to direct me to the best subreddit if this isn’t allowed here, but I just need some general advice on this.

I’ve been babysitting a kid of a friend of my parents for the past couple of weeks because of his family situation. I always saw him as a little cousin, so I could always look after him if asked. He’s super into Minecraft including fanmade songs, likes these vlogs that are in this Mr. Beast/SlowMoGuys mashup, and in general anything that will involve a lot of action and a lot of loud noises. He usually brings his own devices to play video games or watch YouTube on his own.

I mention all of this because there is one thing that’s been bothering me for some time. He had autism and I have ADHD, so we both have things that can stimulate us positively and negatively. A lot of the things I mention have overstimulated me to the point where I need to step aside and calm down. The loud covers he likes are in a style of music I generally try to avoid for these reasons, the slow mo effect generally has a similar effect, and I absolutely cannot get myself to calm down if there’s a lot of noises coming from around. Sometimes his commentary on things that I’m doing can unintentionally overstimulate me, even though I know that’s not his intentions. I’ve tried to explain that I get overstimulated by certain things, but I know it might be difficult for him to comprehend that what he might like may be hard for others to enjoy. If I ask him to turn his sound down because of the loud volume, he would turn it down for three minutes before bringing it back up to where he likes it.

On the other hand, there are things that I like that understimulates or overstimulates him. I won’t get into specific details about what bothers him, but he generally thinks the music, the type of videos, and the games I like to be lacking and some other things that I normally do can be too overstimulating for him to deal with. I try to avoid the overstimulating things for him and instead try to focus on finding solutions that’s good for the both of us. 

I think he’s a good kid and I know that as the adult in the situation, I should have the answers to figuring out how to handle these things. I brought up headphones for him to use as a compromise but he told me that he doesn’t have any and I’m not sure if the Bluetooth ones I have will be good enough for him since I generally had to charge them frequently. This whole year has been stressful for both of us and I’m positive that it’s the reason why I’ve been easily overstimulated lately. I don’t want him to think that it’s his fault that I can’t enjoy some of the things that he likes. Any advice would be much appreciated.",29Jul2020,1

To top it all off, my partner is a healthcare worker who has exposure to covid on a regular basis, and while I would wear a mask they are not encouraging others to do the same at the wedding and I fear the worst.

334,"I  have a friend who projects a lot of criticism and judgement  towards people in her life including the ones she’s outwardly friendly with, and I try to not get sucked in and participate in her rants but am  afraid that not agreeing with her and sometimes prompting questions or making statements to suggest a different perspective seems to have given her the idea that I think I’m better than her.

I  can only try my best to be my best self but I’m only human with feelings and baggages and my own fragile ego too and it really irks me when she directs her negativity towards me.

On an instance she jokingly accused me of being difficult and snobby when I asked a shop assistant for a specific item, an item she considered a novelty, and the petty and unnecessary remark really threw me off.

I  have tendencies to internalise conflicts and am not always good at dealing with it in the moment nor standing up for myself in a constructive way, especially when my feelings are hurt.

336,"At my job I am the supervisor to the cashiers and one of the two “primary key holders.” My coworker is the inventory manager. Although she is TECHNICALLY above me, we both answer to the same direct manager and our job paths are on two different branches. I’ll call her Becky for identity purposes. 

Becky can be nice but she is definitely two-faced. Especially towards me. At my work there are only 6 of us. So we are a pretty small team and most of us have equal shifts together. There’s another key holder and cashier manager named Mary at my work. We are both equal in terms of job position but Becky and Mary have more of a history. Here’s where I feel like I’m being singled out: if there are any managerial notices that go out, Mary is usually informed before me, no matter what she’s doing, how free i am, how urgent it is. If Becky is the one receiving the info she will call Mary to the office where she’ll tell her the info first then they’ll sit back there for a while, meanwhile I’m up front watching the store, helping customers and ringing people up. Becky will be in opposite ends of the store and call Mary over to her so they can chat and do minor busy work in that area to seem productive. Then randomly Becky will come at me and with a two-faced, passive aggressive tome she’ll ask me about work she assigned me and if I don’t tell her “it’s all done” she snaps and says “well then work on it!” And will proceed to walk through aisles looking at me from a distance until I do it. She only does this to me.

Other minor things she does is if Mary and I say bye to her at the end of the day she will respond only to Mary. If I say hi or bye to her, she will say so back but she’ll say it in a mumble or with annoyed hesitation. She tries to make it look like I’m lazy and don’t do anything, but sometimes I feel like that’s just me talking. Today she made a new daily checklist for everyone in the store to sign off on when they finish a task on that list. I feel like she made that daily task lost in part to keep track of me when that isn’t her job and i feel like she’s partially out of line doing that BUT since she was on the phone with our boss idk if he approved it or not. If i talk to him it could lead to him talking to both of them and them realizing i went to him and then both of them singling me out or simply not being as friendly anymore. Idc about Becky, but Mary and I have the most overlapping shifts together and that would be awkward and take away a lot of the positive vibes away from our work environment. Idk how to approach my boss about this.

She texted me after she got back and said she was sorry she didn't see my message that I sent before she left until today since she didn't have any phone service and also mentioned if I could go swimming on X day. She realized she didn't couldn't go that day because she forget her roommate/my friend (gay) wasn't able to do that day. She doesn't drive nor do I so it makes it easier if he can come.

I sent a text with my schedule but she wasn't able to view it since the photo didn't go though so I sent it again and I also said ""if (friend name) can't make it, we can still go swimming"" and I also sent her a URL of my schedule. She didn't get back to me.

When she wasn't able to view the schedule she also used  😭 at the end of it, and that was the last I head from her, it's been about 27 hours since then.

I today called her but she didn't pick up so I left a voice message and a text since I don't know if she listens to her voice messages. She is really bad with getting back to people via text and her roommate/my friend, and her as admitted to me also.

I am gonna try calling her again tomorrow and if she doesn't pick up I will leave a voice message and a text message just incase she doesn't listen to the voice messages.

Loved it, it was fun, but I recently went six weeks without contributing and have been considering leaving. The group has a time commitment (about five hours a week), but we are able to take time off, hence the six weeks.

I still enjoy the topic of the group (though not as much as I used to), but am definitely not as good at the job itself as I once was. And the fact that I went six weeks without contributing at all (for the sole reason that I wanted time away from the group) should count for something.

I'm terrible at making decisions such as this one and I don't want to do something I will regret. I don't want to leave because I'd hate to regret it a week later and want my position back, and I just hate goodbyes in general, but I've been wanting to branch out to other hobbies lately and cannot do that as easily while in this group.

Why I think this is possible: 1) a while ago we were talking as a group me him and some other friends and he mentioned that the only person he had a big crush on he was friends with and he kinda glanced at me quickly. 2) every time I text him he responds immediately and according to all my other friends he is awful at responding 3) anytime we hang out just the two of us (not as often as we used to) he always tells me how smart and funny I am (I am often the butt of the jokes because I can laugh along and not be hurt) while he doesn’t always make an effort to hang out he ALWAYS agrees to hang out and seems to enjoy spending time together. 4)I have heard that guys and girls can’t just be friends because one of them will catch feelings unless there’s some lgbtq in the mix. I’m not sure if this is true. 

I really am not sure what I would do if I found out he liked me more than a friend. I don’t see us together.  And I don’t want to ruin this relationship it’s been the most stable thing I’ve had in my entire life. He is just someone I can talk to and someone that can talk to me. Am I overthinking these things or is there possibly something going on?",29Jul2020,1

Whoever im getting acrossed with talking it always start the same with that we are chilling talking and getting close but then its like they just want to keep me as a friend and flirt with me on the side - cus the more ive tlaked to guys the more guys have said im a really cool girl, fun to hang around and really nice to talk too.  Then it just never becomes more than this. 

It feels kinda weird in my eyes that theyre trying to flirt and still just see me as a friend but how can i make sure that its not happening to much?

Everything went fine and we set up a time tomorrow for a test drive. Hours go by and she suddenly texts me telling me that she can’t meetup at our designated time because she has to work last minute. She also gives me her number to text her so we can reschedule. But what has me weirded out was that she changed her name to Selena, and changed her profile pic to a black image. She also told me that she can’t let me know if we can meetup after she gets off of work because she needs to get her schedule, then she’ll get back to me.

350,"Can't believe I seriously need to ask this question. Prepare for long story. As the title suggest. I have a hard time with friends. I'm defining friend simply as someone I talk to regularly and we enjoy it.

Out of my 19 years on this earth I have had four friendships. Two in elementary school (which both ended after I moved in the fourth grade), and two last year. Between these two periods of brief friendships I talked to no one who wasnt my parents or sisters. I was effectively a mute in school, only talk when I needed to. Sat alone. And when not in school the only time I left the house was when I was forced to by my parents. Yeah. I know. Exciting life. 

Let me make it clear, this wasn't my parents doing. My older and younger sisters both had many friends and regularly went out with them during our childhood.

The two friends I had last year, one I met via my mother (her employer's son) and the other I met on trevorspace (social networking site for LGBTQ kids which I had joined out of loneliness). I got really close to them, we talked daily, we hung out, they forced me outside and to do things and talk to others. Was the happiest I'd been my entire life. Then 2020 happened. 

Long story short, a LOT of bad things hit me and my family all at once. I had a mild mental break that made me turn utterly numb to all feelings expect anger and sadness (I'm on a waiting list to get a therapist, probably will be a while). I ended up destroying my friendships by ghosting them and when they reached out I was snippy. Been a few months since I've last spoken to them and I've went back to only having my sisters to talk to. And since im graduated I dont even have school to force me to see and interact with people my age. I've realized this makes me incredibly depressed and my mental state has been doing down quickly and I realzie I need to actually socialize with people.

Issue is: I don't know how to find or keep a friend. The two last year were luck. Unsure if I'd get it again. Honestly, I'm really scared of people and fearfully opening up to anyone. The few times I tried making friends over my lifetime I always ended up getting scared and ghosting them. 

I cant go out and meet people due to covid and social anxiety (I befriended the other two by talking online until I felt comfortable enough to meet them). But I don't know how to find anyone to talk to. This is a highly pathetic question to ask, but I guess I need to? So, help?",29Jul2020,1

356,"Hello all! I will try to sum this up as best as I can. Basically in the past I broke up with my ex because she was very rude, manipulative, and toxic to me. After about three months of no contact at all she hit me back up again, saying she has changed a lot. She got with another guy almost immediately after we broke up with and claimed that, that relationship changed her a lot. I accepted on the terms of no romanticism and I really did not want to get too close with her. But after a while she starts flirting with me, giving me compliments, and texting/calling all the time. I grow closer and closer to her, wary, but she is nice. After about three weeks of this she wants to date again. I am hesitant because I havent known her long enough so I flip flop. I say I want to take things slow... The negative starts popping up again, she berates me about two times so I back out and say there isn't a chance. She berates me again because of it but I feel pressure to date her. So I flip flop the idea with dating her, when she is super sweet to me I tell her we should, then she becomes mean and I back out. I do this three times and eventually it turns all toxic. She says I am retarded and everyone around her agrees. I'm a dumb boy who can't make up his own mind, I will never find anything like her again and I will regret it. She starts talking about how she is going to ditch me, whenever she feels like it, and will not tell me. So out of fear I block her first, I know its a dumb move but I couldn't handle it anymore. But now I feel this guilt, I feel so guilty, I run through memories with her all the time in my head and I can't help but feel I overreacted.

361,"I am 30 y.o female and have a 34 y/o sister, also female. For my whole life my mom has always used me and my sister as outlets to complain to about each other. She also used to talk extremely poorly about my dad growing up, she still does today but not to the extent she used to.  If my mom and sister get into a disagreement, then I am the one she turns to to vent about it. My mom takes things very personally, is very sensitive, assumes, expects, has a lot of anger that she doesn't acknowledge, and she doesn't necessarily allow room for other people to express their feelings. If I were to say to her ""When you said this, it made me feel \_\_\_\_"" she would get very defensive and take it as an attack. I was reflecting on it today after my mom was telling me about how nasty my sister is (although the disagreement really had nothing to do about my mom, and more so a difference in opinions and comfort level with taking her kids to church, yet my mom took it personally), and whenever my mom talks about my sister it is always negative. It is so rare she says anything nice about her... or anyone for that matter. She complains a lot. 

Me and my sister don't have the most open relationship and communication, but that has started to shift. My sister opened up and told me that she doesn't feel open to the things I do or totally see's me or accepts me because my mom is always comparing us and pinning us against each other, such as by talking poorly about the other, or comparing my sister to me in weight, height, etc. This makes me really sad, because I feel like a lot of our tension revolves around the way my mom has talked about me to her.

365,"Hello Reddit,

I’m not sure where to ask for advice on handling this, but this sub seemed like this best place to go.

To preface: I am a girl staying home with my mom during covid. Neither of us deal, and I haven’t even had pot since coming back home 😔

Last week during the afternoon, I was in a Zoom lecture and I heard the doorbell, I ignored it thinking it was Amazon, and then there was a knock. I answered the door and there was a guys (teens/20s?) who said something along the lines of: “I’m here for the stuff. My buddy will be coming over later.”

So, kind of taken aback by the situation, told him: “Sorry, wrong house.” I expected that to be the end of it, but he seemed very adamant on this being the right place. He almost tried to convince me it was..? I hope that makes sense... It seemed like he didn’t want to leave, he looked around, and then left and I closed the door. Now, I wish I would have been a bit more proactive, looking at his car or trying to pry information, but I didn’t think too much of it, aside from being a little flustered. I mean, shit happens.

This experience really got to me when my mom described a similar scenario happening two days later, in the morning. He apparently asked for “an eighth” (I’m assuming pot? Hopefully it’s just pot 😅) and he apparently nearly argued with her about this being the right place. She was also quite taken aback by it and she also didn’t really pay attention to his features, car, etc.

We’ve contacted the police (to stay on the safe side, in case it’s a setup or something worse).

So anyway, I want to ask: Does this seem like a prank, or something more? Should we be worried? What would you do in this situation?

The only thing that gets to me is both of them (we have determined that it is two separate guys) tried to convince us that a dealer lived here.. It made the situation go from “haha, funny... Kid got the wrong house” to “Why won’t this man leave? I’m nervous.”

TLDR; Two separate druggies mistake our house for a dealer’s house, then try to convince us that a dealer lives here, which is an impossible scenario.",29Jul2020,1

369,"THIS IS A LONG READ, BUT PLEASE BEAR WITH ME AND HELP ME PLEASE. IDK WHAT TO DO. :(

I think it all started when I was in 3rd grade and I saw my cousin crying her heart out after breaking up with her boyfriend. I had this thought where I felt 'superior' when I thought of how I'm NEVER letting a man break my heart and how I would have everything under control when I enter a relationship. I thought that being 15 or 16 would mean you're gonna have to enter a relationship with someone so I was looking forward to it.

I also think that seeing my mom crying over my dad affected my way of thinking too, I would always tell my mom that I would never marry a cheater and a man who thinks he can get away after inflicting physical and mental pain on me. I really am looking forward to my future relationship and be in complete control over my emotions and relationship where my future s/o and I can be in a happy and non-toxic relationship.

Since I was in 4th grade, I've had many suitors and people confessing to me that they like me. I'm capable of having those giddy crushes, but I don't really entertain suitors since I felt like I wasn't ready yet to enter any relationship and also because I made a deal with my parents wherein if I graduated from high school without any history of having boyfriends (even secret ones).

Even though I never had any boyfriend, I did have lots of those 'Mutual Understanding' relationships, which didn't last longer than a year. My strings of MU started when I was in 5th grade. Every year, I would have different 'M.U.' or crushes, since I usually cower and break it off when my MU tells me that they'd like to take our relationship to the next level, where they'd officially ask me to be their girlfriend, or to be introduced to my parents as my suitor. I would explain to them that I have a deal with my parents and I don't think I'm ready to commit myself to anyone yet since I'm still young and ignorant about how healthy relationships work, but then they would always tell me that they're ready to wait for me even if it would take years until we're in college. I would reluctantly let them, but after a few months, I would start crumbling down and feeling immense pressure, I would tell them to stop waiting for me, for us to break things off since I'm afraid I can't give them what they want and that it's just too much for me to bear their expectations. Even if they try to convince me otherwise and tell me it's okay, that their feelings are stronger than any doubt they have, it makes me feel scared that I won't be able to do the same and just push them away and forcefully decide to end what we have, no buts.

As I got older and experienced different 'MU' relationships with guys, I finally realized how I seem to enter these types of relationship just because I want to have someone who'll always stay by my side, like some person to fill the space that's always empty when my bestfriends leave me for their boyfriends. It's like my 'like' for them is always based on superficial things, and when I stay in an unofficial relationship with these guys, I am CONSTANTLY trying to find reasons to break it off with them, like a flaw that they have or a mannerism that annoys me. It feels like all I've ever wanted was for someone to not leave me and for me to have that one person who will treasure me as their important person just as I would to them.

However, I also realized that I really don't know what it feels like being truly in love. All I've felt for the boys I supposedly 'like' was giddy crushes which faded over time. I never felt any signs of love before, and I was very apathetic with my previous partners. When they would tell me that their 'like' for me has progressed to the point where they would say 'i love you' with sincerity, I would simply thank them as I don't want to say 'i love you' to someone without actually meaning it. I only want to say I love you to the person I'm sure I'm actually in love with, because I didn't want to raise their hopes up and hurt them even deeper when I want to break things off and have to tell them that my 'I love you' wasn't really true at all.

Also, I've read and seen how people in love constantly think of the person they love and like, can't resist not to talk to their SO everyday. However, I never felt the need for that. With all the boys I've been with, I'm always irritated when they feel the need to be updated of everything I'm doing, and to talk to me by chat or video call every single minute of my day. I told myself and my friends how I wanted someone more mature, who spends his time doing other things too than just constantly messaging me, and making me feel like I have a diary or a supervisor for a partner. 

After unintentionally hurting someone really kind because of my insincerity of entering MU relationships and having them fall in love with me only to find out I don't feel the same way, I decided to abstain from anything love or crush related to avoid hurting people anymore and fix my problems first.

Problem #1: 

Basically, I never had my first kiss and am still a virgin. I only let one guy hold my hand for ONE TIME, as I don't really feel comfortable with boys I'm M.U. with touch me. Idk how to fix this, my repulsiveness/extreme shyness towards physical contact with the person I'm involved with. I want to fix this bc i'm not getting any younger and bc I want to enter a relationship eventually in the future.

Problem #2:

I still am confused about love and relationships and how it works. How do you know when you're in love? Why have I never felt it during these past years? How do you commit yourself to another person and build a future with him/her? Aren't you afraid of entering a relationship only to meet someone else you feel a strong connection to in the future, but can't pursue a rs with them because of your current one? What should I do to determine whether I am truly ready to commit? How do you get in a relationship and prevent yourself from focusing or finding their flaws and use it to break up with them?

Problem #3:

Based on what I told you about my history, can you be honest and tell me what's the problem with me and your advice on how I should fix it? I really want to resolve this and stop hurting people. Other people I've talked to told me how it's unfair of me to be smart academically and have high emotional quotient too, but I frankly see my behavior as problematic as it prevents me from having an actual relationship with anyone.

Also, my deal with my parents is already done since I've already graduated high school without having any boyfriends so this is just me trying to fix my problems before deeming myself qualified to enter a serious relationship should I want to in the future.

I like interacting with kids and think kids are adorable. I do play with my nieces or nephews when I see them. But lately, I have come to the realization that kids are a lot of work, not only the money that goes into them, but the aftereffects of pregnancy or the possibility that a kid could end up having a serious illness. I have friends who are mummies so I have been getting these reality lessons over the years. In addition, I have aged parents, one has Parkinson's and is deteriorating while the other one is more stable, just recovering from a hip replacement surgery. I do have older sibling who helps out so that is good.

We have two kids together both in their teens. Recently i've been seeing a new girl a bit younger than me she's 33. We've been going steady since November. Everythings been smooth until last week I found out she's my ex wives daughter. She was showing me a picture on her facebook I saw my ex in the background. I said Oh you know Donna? She goes Yeah! that's my Mom I was tellin you about. Course I didn't believe her, thought she knew nd was fucking with me. She knew I had an ex wife but i never told her much. Imagine its not hard to figure out anyway right? Thinkin about it now they look a lot alike. Anyways we got into a big argument shes been staying with one of her girl friends while we figure it out. Not surprised my ex had a kid I don't know about, she kept lots of secrets. Actually told me one day when I was picking up the kids, was asking her how she was and she said she got in touch with long lost family. Same day my new girl told me she was reconnecting with her mother. Told me before how her mom walked out on her when she was a girl but she was excited so didn't think nothing of it.  Gets worse, my ex wife is back with this girls father. Why this man would take her back after she walked outs beyond me . Id be pissed if she did that to my kids then tried to come back like none of it went on. No idea what to do.

Currently I got into a “problem” with someone &amp; here’s my thoughts, “That motherfucker thinks he can get away with this, I’m going to fucking put him in his place”.

So obviously I’m not happy with my current situation. I actually shave everywhere except my eyebrows and of course head. Getting rid of facial hair for good would be one less problem, but if I had it my way all my facial hair would be permanently gone I’m not rich though. So that wouldn’t be an option.

388,"I(21F) have since I was 10-12 years old been suicidal. I can't remember when it started. When I was 11 I dicided to keep track of bad days vs good days. This means I am today certain I haven't had a good day since. When I moved away from home, I found suicide letters I wrote when I was 8 and 9. I don't remember writing those but dates doesn't lie.

I wake up every day, disappointed. Im tired of life. Almost every aspect of it. Everyday is a fight and I don't want to struggle for another 60-70 years. 

In school a psychiatrist tried to help me by telling me to lower my standards. I don't think I have too high standards for a good day. Wake up fresh, nobody talking down to me, nobody trying to hurt/harm me, respect from everyone in in contact with and no bad flashbacks. How can I lower that? It's not like i only get one or 2 of these ""rule breaks"" in one day, I get maybe 20. 

It didn't help to change school. It didn't help to get a hobby, move out, gratulate, ask for help, attend a boarding school, get a job, exricise/fitness, have a sleep schedule, boycott the internet, keep a positive journal (over 2 weeks only 5 days had 3 good things in them), igore the suicide thoughts, attempting suicide, getting out every day, talking with friends, reading, trying self improvement, watching my diet, meditate, etc.

The only thing I have tried do far that kind of Works is ekssive drinking. But that doesn't lead to enternal happiness. It just frees the mind for a while. 

The only things I won't try is forgiveness and therapy. I'm not gonna forgive anyone for treating me the way people do. ""I'm sorry I'm upset because you bullied me"" ""im sorry I don't like being used."" No. No forgives no extra chances. And therapy? Why should I pay for a problem others gave me? If someone hits my car, I won't pay for the damages to be repaired. They should. 

I don't want to hear more about ""don't kill yourself. You will make your family sad"" if they really cared, they would have treated me with respect and helped me when I asked for it instead of calling me a liar. (When a 14 yr old complains about being attacked by imiganary Wolfs and people, you should take it seriously. Just like when she tells you she is getting bullied) but on the other hand, I have papers that I'm dyslexic and my mother is ashamed when I mention it. Being dyslexic doesn't mean you can't write.

391,"I'm currently a 23 year old college student on his last semester of college. Here's the gist of my situation:

Before knowing whether I would attend in person, I signed up and paid the 250 dollar nonrefundable fee to have my housing application processed, with the idea being that most likely I would be attending in-person for the fall semester. Now that I have picked all of my classes, they are all online. Since they are online, this completely negates the whole reason for me moving into the dorm in the first place. However, my roommate has already been selected and I would feel bad if I stuck him with no roommate if they couldn't find a suitable replacement in time. I had that happen to me and it sucked. In addition, one of my IRL friends who I see a couple times a week is most likely returning and this would also be his final semester, and I'm not sure how our friendship would cope with me not being there. I could drive down to see him at school or go to lunch or whatever else, but I don't know if he'd wanna hang out outside of that. The drive is also a couple hours a week both ways, so I wouldn't really wanna do it more than once or twice a week if possible. My parents are very supportive and wouldn't mind me living at their place for the semester, so that would save several thousand on dormitory bills. It would also save me the hassle of moving all my shit out at the beginning of the semester and moving it back in at the end of the semester. Finally, once I withdraw my application if I choose to do so, I cannot reapply, so I need to be really committed one way or the other.

I only know about this recently because it told me I was nearing my limit (didn't get a warning May for some reason) and now I'm pretty pissed. I pay for the internet and share it among 2 (used to be 3 people) and going past this limit will cost a great deal of extra money. Anyway, this prompted me to check the data usage from my Computer... 150.23 fucking GB has been used by me... That's 846.77 GB used by TWO OTHER PEOPLE. It baffles my mind to the nth degree, I game, I watch a ton of YouTube, I've downloaded a ton of mods for Skyrim, Minecraft, and redownloaded FO 76... All within 150 GBs. Idk if my data tracker isn't keeping track correctly (it's through cable since that's faster) and I'm genuinely curious and mad if my two roommates are practically hording the wifi.

&amp;#x200B;

A little insight for the two; NetFlix is a BIG thing for them. I know that's a good chunk of it right there, I'm sure they watch it in 4k (I'm exaggerating but I'm sure it's max settings), sometimes one of the roommates will leave a show on when she sleeps but seeing how NetFlix prevents autoplaying after a certain time I'm not worrying about that. Said roommate is a telecomer and works from home, Idk how much internet that needs but I can't see it going past any significant need seeing as how she only works about 5 hours a day, 1\~3 days a week.  


The other roommate doesn't use much internet to my knowledge since she has two jobs and she's gone for 70\~80% of the day. Her off days vary, from 1-3 each week.

395,"I had a group of friends growing up that were kind of a mishmash. One was a year ahead and I met her freshmen year, so she was 13 when I was 14. Another was a senior who had to retake, so he was 19. At one point, the 13 year old was dating the 19 year old. 

I don’t know why we didn’t see this as odd, but we didn’t. We thought he was alittle weird, but that was more of a running joke. 

We’re still all friends, and keep in contact every now and then. I think it’s kind of faded from our memories, but I recently realized because we decided to keep in better contact over quarantine that the girl doesn’t talk to the guy. They’re the only two that don’t follow eachother on social media. If he gets into a group video chat, she leaves very shortly after. She’s also made vague comments about being traumatized by older men as a child.

I don’t know how to ask her (or even if I should) if he makes her uncomfortable. I’m concerned I’m reading into it. If it came down to it I wouldn’t mind dropping the older guy.

398,"My (24F) aunt, uncle, and cousin have never taken care of themselves. The rest of my family has constantly footed the bill, bought them groceries, lent them money, picked them up and dropped them off, let them borrow things, etc. My uncle is the sole breadwinner, but refuses to use the money he makes to support the family (I know it’s just baffling, like I don’t understand). My cousin is homeschooled, which means my aunt has to stay home to watch her. My aunt is complacent in this whole situation, always standing by my uncle and going with what he wants and doing things the way he wants to do things. And yes I do realize that my family (particularly my grandmother) was enabling them. 

They are completely reliant on the family and I watched it growing up. Then when I was old enough, suddenly picking them up and dropping them off became my responsibility. I ended up doing that for 5+ years but recently I’ve just been tired of doing it. There are times when I feel like I’m being taken advantage of. They don’t do anything to change their situation and it’s very clear that they are reliant on me to pick them up and drop them off whenever we meet. The thing is they have a car (they actually have 2 but my uncle isn’t fixing the other one and my aunt isn’t doing anything about it). My aunt just doesn’t make an effort to figure out a schedule with my uncle, so she just relies on us. But, whenever her church needs her to be there or do something for them, she is immediately there. So why doesn’t she give us the same courtesy? I know we’re family but she should still be respectful of other people. 

We’ve never taken everything we done for her and rubbed it in her face. But whenever we need help with something she makes it very clear that she doesn’t want to help us. 

I grew up with my cousin and growing up I had to share everything with her. She would constantly break things, use things in the way they were not intended, did not value my/other people’s things, and just threw things on the floor for other people to clean up. Seriously, every time she came over she would never clean up after herself and she would just leave. Whenever she broke stuff or did things that were destructive, we would bring it up with my aunt and she would just be like ‘it’s ok’ and leave. My aunt has no respect for other people’s things or time. Which is why I have trust issues with letting her borrow my things,  (and I have been yelled at by my aunt and uncle for not sharing with her). It’s not entirely my cousin’s fault, she was never disciplined properly.

I told him about the open apartment my mother bought and joked about living there. He did take it serious and told me about the consequences of living alone and living next to my stepfather (which is fine since he is worried) but he will agree if I want to but he also said : “ To be honest, I’m a little mad since everything always works out for your mother.

How do you guys accept these bad news emotionally, especially those who turn out to be “false hope” like a vaccine or lowered infection rates? How do you brush it off without realizing that this affects your future/those you love? What runs in your mind? How do you handle the emotional wave you feel (if any)? How could you not feel dissapointed or angry or scared, but just move on and do things? It seems that it’s just downright impossible to isolate myself completely and I just have to face it, but how?

Every since I moved into this apartment things have been calm till his daughter moved in. My roommate told me that they fought and that is the reason as to why the daughter left. One night we all were drinking and this ties in later, he tried to kiss me knowing I have a boyfriend. The old roommate came over and said to me that she as well had problems with his daughter. Well that night he was telling me that she is a terrible vile girl and all sorts of things before the incident. Lately she had been touching my things repeatedly and I asked her 14 year old brother to ask her to stop. He said he understood, but I still went to her and asked her very nicely not to touch my things. She has thrown away my food and belongings already. 

Her father then came knocking on my door the next day and asked to speak with me. She stood next to him the whole time, He told me not to leave me stuff on the microwave and to clean up after myself and the bathroom. I said I understand and would really appreciate it if his daughter wasn’t touching my things. They are spanish speaking and I understand more than I can speak. My boyfriend is fluent so I called him to explain what was going on. My boyfriend translated exactly what I said, “I am not responsible for your daughters hair or mess. She has been touching my stuff and putting it on the microwave and I had already addressed her, but she does not stop. I feel as if she is making me out to seem a problem and I would appreciate it if you understand that just like everyone else at time I don’t want to do my dishes right away, but when she did it I did not complain and gave her the benefit of the doubt” well she was visibly upset that night and came to the kitchen while I did dishes saying stuff under her breath to which her brother asked her to relax. She then walked away and I asked him if there was a problem. 

He said there wasn’t and the next day (today) I had my best friend over. She knew vaguely of the situation and was over because she had just adopted a kitten. We went to target and came back at 6. Around 8 we went to the kitchen and I put a pot of water and started boiling potatoes. I asked his daughter to please move so I could use the sink and she moved over slightly. Staying deliberately in the way. So she stands behind me on the phone saying to someone that she was pissed and was gonna tell them after. Once my friend and I were in the bathroom we both heard her calling us fat bitches and complaining about me. I texted her father at 9 and asked to speak with him. He said yes so I knocked on his door and she came out to which I asked when her father would be home. She then stood by my door and spoke to her brother and my friend opened the door to the little girl grilling her and looking her up and down. This kept happening each time we went to the bathroom. 

Once her father came my friend expressed how she felt as I did. I called my boyfriend and her father said, “she told me that you came out at 7 to cook exactly when she did” it was just a back of forth where he came up with every excuse he could for her. He told my that my friend needed to shut up because he didn’t care what she said and that I had to stay in my room till his daughter finished cooking. She finished at 11 and I sent him a message asking him as to when I could cook if it already is 11. My boyfriend stood up for me and told the man multiple times that he wasn’t listening and needed to understand that his daughter was the issue. 

Well, we went out for beers and came back to the dad asking me if I left my underwear in the bathroom. I responded no sir and he made it seem as if I had an attitude, yet his daughter was in the room and did not ask her. I told my boyfriend that I refuse to take an L with this because I know for certain he’s acting this way because I didn’t kiss him back. Basically now I have to wait 2 days to speak to him so things cool off, but I think it’s completely unfair that I have to stay out of the kitchen till she’s done if now she’ll obviously stay in there on purpose. I truly have no idea what to do because although I’m young, I am not this mans child to be told when I can use the kitchen yet I pay rent. We told him multiple times that I am the one paying and he refused to address her behavior throughout all of this. He said he’d speak with her, yet it obviously seemed like bullshit as she was walking around laughing all night and staying in the kitchen. I’m very upset and I want justice throughout all this, but I genuinely don’t understand why he feels as if he can tell me that I can’t even walk into the kitchen if she’s there. It’s very out of line and she is clearly lying. I plan to show him that the text was sent at 9 and she should’ve been done max by 9:30. It is so inconsiderate because he did not care if I ate so late, which makes me more upset.",29Jul2020,1

408,"All this started after spend one week after a little vacation with some friends house. The vacantions where a strugle first of all cause basically me and her had to do almost everything, being a little stressfull to us. After point, for some reason, she start to see girls on Insta/TikTok with a friend. So far, nothing special. Boy i was wrong. She now is 24/7 scrolling down looking for bodies parts to share with that friend. Tbh is being destructive and toxic to me and else, she say things as ""if i could f***"" to fking underage girls. 

Now we re suposse to spend this weekend on the beach with more 5 friends. Since one of them have a car and all of them lives on the city or in the way to the beach, we don't need to pick up no one and just go to the meeting point. She was constantly saying we could give a ride. I asked gently ""if they are 5, why doesn't all of them go on the same car?"", She reply: ""what? You don't want to pick them up? Fine, i take my car and is done"". I didn't even know what to say. Just said your choice. 

This is making me sad and tired cause this all comes from her easy attachement to people. I don't even know if she's being real or just ""someone"" to please a  friendship and i can't fucking talk to her without her always defending herself by pointing to others.",29Jul2020,1
409,"Tried posting this in relationship_advice but only got one response and I’m desperate for help 

Some background: I have a brother a year older than me and a brother who is 15. My dad died 10 years ago and my mom has never been the same since. Like lots of anger issues and we don’t have a close relationship. She hangs out with rich people who are probably closer to age with me than her, and she goes on weird vacation with them. For example my brother overheard her on the phone when she got back from a trip in Mexico saying she was super high from shrooms. Also, she has a new boyfriend who have been dating for about a month but they are really close and he comes over a lot.

My mom and brothers have all left to be out of the house for a few days. I got bored and decided to look through my mom’s closet cause she steals my clothes sometimes. I opened this chest and found a plastic grocery bag lined with bubble wrap. I took it out and found four ziploc sandwich bags that each had an equal amount of this off-white colored powder. Now I don’t know how to tell what it is, but i can’t think of any rational explanation for a bunch of bags of powder wrapped up in her closet that doesn’t involve drugs.

Right away I sent a pic to my brothers. My older brother wants to call the police but I don’t know if this is a good idea. If she went to jail I would have no idea what would happen to our house, how I would pay for college, or where I would live, or what would happen to my younger brother since he’s a minor. We are also thinking of confronting her all together but she will probably avoid it and turn it around on me for going through her things. Please give me any advice on what to do.",29Jul2020,1
410,"First I'd like to preface this by saying this happened 7 months ago, and I am currently recieving treatment, and my life has never been better!

So.. one day, about 7 months ago, I had a major mental breakdown because of my bipolar 2 disorder. I was extremely suicidal because of the depressive state I was in, as well as the events that transpired that day. 
I got into a bar fight, and punched a guy in the face, than ran away. I started feeling guilty, even more worthless, and suicidal after that. When I reached out to my brother who I loved very much for support, he told me to just do it, and get it over with. I was floored, shocked, and about to break. It felt like my world was falling apart. I was beginning to reach the decision to end it all. 
In a last ditch effort to save myself, 
I decided that I would put faith into the healthcare system and check myself into a  hospital. But first I wanted to tell the girl I was in love with at the time, how I was feeling, what my plan was, and that I'd be going away, so do not worry.

After calling her crying, and explaining to her how I was feeling, I expressed that I wanted to check myself into the hospital, she responded by telling me I shouldn't because I won't get the treatment I need there, and it will only waste my time. 

She said just go home, go to sleep and to call her tomorrow and she will be there for me, I decided not to do anything rash, and walk home. I begged her to give me some music to listen to to keep my mind away from negative thoughts, which she did. I got home went to bed, and woke up the next day feeling down, but a little better than the day before. Eventually I called her and she told me she didn't wish to speak to me anymore because I was leaving on her to heavily, and she was starting to feel uncomfortable.

While she wasn't wrong, I was perhaps leaning on her to heavily lately, I snapped. 
Not because she dumped me romantically, but rather because, 
It infuriated me that she would advise me against medical treatment, than abandon me right after. 

While I was no longer suicidal, I felt that it was completely wrong for her to do such a thing, because my last hope in the world was medical treatment from professionals, and she persuaded me to put my last hope in her instead, only to server the ties during such a critical moment. Whereas if I recieved medical treatment from a hospital they would not be so quick to abandon me.

I thought about how she's, polyamourus, and speaks too multiple guys, 
multiple of which she has confessed to me have mental illness. And it made me angry that she could possibly do something like this to other people. 

I explained all this to her, as well as she would be partially responsible for someone's death if this situation ever occurred again in the future and she needed to think about the morality of her actions. to which she replied she would not be responsible, because someone's suicide is there own actions. And she can't be held responsible for someone's own actions. To which I replied that I would agree with that fact if she haven't persuaded me to disregard medical treatment and put all my faith in her only for her to not through with what she was apparently not capable of handling, which is why be she should have encouraged me to go the hospital where I can get treatment from people who can handle it instead. Therefore, I felt she would have been partially responsible if I decided to off myself after she abandoned me.

413,"My mom has been like this for years but I think  I’ve only noticed it in the last year or so? In summer she’s somewhat happy and mostly normal but every winter she gets these delusions that the government is out to get her and she’s a “adopted Nazi trained soldier” and the government wants her to go to war with China (literally never had any military training or ever associated with a Nazi in her life so it’s clearly untrue). She then, for months, will act like a god and become a conspiracy nut and believe that anyone who disagrees with her is a “liberal fucktard” and a traitor. she pulled my younger brother out of school about 10 weeks ago because apparently the school is a “pedophile grooming school” and while he’s been offered a place at a new school, she’s still finding excuses not to send him there. I worry for him as he’s still too young to know that she’s in the wrong (as I was at that age) and in turn he’s started believing her lies. She constantly bullies me and tries to sabotage my schooling, work and has told me to kill myself. I know she’s got issues so this isn’t exactly the end of the world but it becomes worse when my brother starts spitting the same words she says at me. The only other person that can see she’s got problems in the house is my dad, and she treats him the same way. This woman is an abuser to both my dad and me. I am still a few years away from being able to move out which makes everything really hard. The actual advice I’m asking for is; How do I get my mother help if she refuses it? Or how do I get away from her abusive behaviour if that’s not an option?",29Jul2020,1

416,"She’s a long couple paragraphs so there’s a tldr at the bottom

They’ve been together for a year and a half. This focuses on her. I’ve known him for a while but I’d describe him more as a “friend of a friend” I’m not close with him at all, all I know is as far as xbox convos when we’re in a group. I don’t ever talk to him just 1 on 1. I met his girlfriend via her joining the xbox party like 2 months ago and we’ve become what I’d consider good friends.

So in their relationship, it’s very one sided. She puts in all the effort to make plans and do shit for him and with him. He makes no effort to make plans with her, or even talk to her when she’s upset. He brushes it off. This relationship is quickly coming to an end and we can all see it except him and somewhat her.

She’s hanging on because she doesn’t want to him and his family to vanish out of her life. But she needs to get out of there, she cries every night because of him and myself and 2 others are the ones that are there for her talking her through it all and giving advice. 

Thing is, I like her. I like her taste in music, I think she’s funny, pretty, the whole package. Not important to get into all that. 

We have similar views and just seem like a good fit. One night we were in a group party asking each other questions to get to know each other better and when asked what she looks for in a guy she said they need to be funny, then like 2 questions later we were told to describe ourselves in one word and she cut in during my turn and said she’d describe me as funny. Not sure if that means something but I’m not looking too far into it, I just know 100% she really likes me as a friend maybe there’s potential for more down the road when she’s single.

Ive been someone for her to rant to, kind of like a shoulder to cry on, not just me though, my other buddy does it too but they’re 100% never going to be anything more than friends .

I’ve been giving her advice like to stop texting him first and stop being the one who always plans things, and see if he actually makes an effort for you. She’ll tell him straight up she doesn’t want to see him because she’s upset at him for shit he does, and he just says “ok” and doesn’t fight for the relationship. This relationship is going to come to an end once she musters up the courage to break things off and stop putting herself through hell. It’s clear as day to me and my other buddy. 

I need advice on what to say to her. The selfish thing I’m gonna say is that I don’t want to do or say anything to friend zone myself and be 100% off the table down the road. But the thing that comes before that is she is legitimately my friend, I care about her and don’t want her to to keep going through this. I don’t want to tell her to break up with him because I don’t want to be that guy that breaks a couple up so he can get with the girl. But I’ve been hinting at the fact that she needs to stop putting herself through this if he doesn’t change (spoiler alert: even though he keeps claiming he will, he hasn’t and he won’t) I keep trying to sound optimistic like things are going to work out and I’m rooting for them, but I’m not. 

Also to add, I have no plans on going for her as soon as they break up. I don’t want to be with someone who isn’t over their ex, I want someone who wants me for me. Who knows if she even will like me in that way, or want to trust another guy. All I know is we would be a great match, and I would treat her a hundred times better.

I also have left out a lot of details of their relationship but she has trust issues with him because he was acting all shady with another girl when they were first together, and just now he can’t even talk to her when she confronts him about anything he just changes subject or makes an awful excuse. Like today after a fight he asked her what she was doing, she sent a pic of herself crying and said “crying and about to watch a show” and he responded with “aww what show” not caring why tf his girlfriend is crying.

TLDR: my friend is in a relationship with a brick wall of a man and shits starting to hit the fan. They aren’t gonna last another month. I like her and could see myself with her so while I want to give her good advice and be there for her, I don’t want to be friend zoned, I want to be with her.",29Jul2020,1
417,"I am using a throw away account because I dont want my friends finding out about this yet. 

So I had a one night stand with this girl, she was on birth control so i didnt use a condom but obviously that was a bad idea. She is already 3 weeks into her pregnancy she just told me yesterday. Now she told me she doesnt know if she should keep if or abort it and asked me what we should do with it, I told her it's up to her. 

I honestly dont know what to do, I'm not good at making important decisions like these, so I told her we should tell our parents and have everyone meet up and see what happens from there. The problem is, I'm scared asf to tell my parents and I am scared to go talk to her parents. If we do keep the baby there will be alot of social stigma since we are not the same race and also diffent religion(I'm not a religious person so it's more if a cultural diffence). If she does keep the baby there is going to be alot of cultural differences between me and her which I feel like will be bad for the kid.

 Though financially I am not too worried for the long term but I am for the short term,I am an apprentice electrician now and in a few years i will have enough to support the kid, she is studying biology and plans to go to medical school and she does has a part time job for now but it's not enough to support a baby. It would be possible to support it for the first few years if majority of my income is spent on the child and I stay with my parents while she studies. 

I am not going to force her to keep it or abort it because I honestly dont know the right decision is and neither does she so we are going to have our parents decide. But I need advice on how to tell my parents, how to talk to her parents, and please feel free to tell me what decision we should make. I am from Canada so if anyone else is from canada please feel free to give some legal advice aswell regarding child support.",29Jul2020,1

420,"I'm 23 and just over this. These are my high school friends and I've realized that they haven't been treating me right. On our group chat recently I had an argument with one of the girls because she was being very nasty/passive aggressive towards me when I couldn't make it to a hangout that they all planned without asking my availability. The argument was pretty bad and most of the other girls were taking her side even though she was being really rude to me. This friend that I had an argument with is very hot tempered and never likes to say that she is in the wrong. We moved past it eventually. I started to not respond much on chats because I didn't feel supported by people who are supposed to be my friends.

Fast forward a week and I decided to slow my communication with them because it really hurt me that they didn't have my back. None of them have messaged me to hangout, but continue to do so with each other and post it on their social media or send it DIRECTLY to me, like children. It just pisses me off because none of them have realized that I've been quiet and it doesn't seem like they care. One of the girls in the group who I am super close with doesn't seem to care either. When I talked to her directly she said that she has other drama in her life and doesn't need more.... so that really hurt because I thought of all people she would support me :/

I just don't seem to understand why I'm being treated this way? Whenever I stand up for myself, which I had to do a lot during our years of friendship they feel that I shouldn't be and should just suppress it like most of them do. They all just have jokes and laugh, but talk shit when someone about each other.

I just hate the feeling of being treated this way. It hurts that they don't care. What should I do? How do I move on?",29Jul2020,1
421,"Hey r/Advice,

I'm posting just for some opinions/perspectives that'll hopefully help me navigate through the next few years of my life, so obligatory backstory.

Am currently enlisted as an E-4 in the United States Air Force. I'm grateful for everything that the service has provided me and I have to admit that I get well compensated for my age (early 20-s male.) The issue I have is it that I feel as though it's an uphill battle for not much in return in regards to progression.

I am not a part of the glorious ""chairforce"" who are able to travel overseas, get TDYs to various locations, and have a wide variety of bases to PCS to - I'm aircraft maintenance and I'm restricted to one base for the entirety of my initial service commitment. Retraining by our CFM is strictly limited into other ""low manned"" careerfields.

I'm contemplating my future a good while in advance so I have a path/goal that I'm set on. I've already acquired my CCAF, I received BTZ and test for E-5 (Staff) next year and am already planning on enrolling in college.

I went and got checked, was told my opening is a bit narrow (after this, I changed my doctor, I read that there is no narrow vagina). Anyway, today I went to another doctor and she told me that no vagina is small and I should just do it all the way, and to let my vagina get used to it. And all that is great, but the problem is I don't have a bf/gf that I would have sex with, and with my anxiety I just don't see myself doing it with a stranger.

TW: mention of suicide 



so the other day i was joking around with my bf that i was mad at him, and he genuinely thought i was being serious. i told him “i have to go but we’ll resume later” and went to go eat dinner with my family. then he proceeded to send me multiple messages of him saying he was going to kill himself.

i sent him a bunch of messages freaking out telling him to text me and that i was just kidding and to not end it. he ended up texting me about an hour later saying how he thought he lost me and that i’m one of the only people he has left.

430,"My parents came to the US in 1999 from Korea and have lived here ever since. They’ve said that they watched Friends and went to adult school to learn English but they almost never use it. My dad is somewhat fluent but his issue is that he can understand what people are saying but can’t really speak the language, and when he does speak his sentences are broken. My mom doesn’t seem to understand the language at all which has caused a lot of problems/mistakes. A few weeks ago she went to the hospital by herself for a routine mammogram and she wrote a bunch of nonsense on the paperwork. She even wrote that she’s had breast cancer for two years. My dad is fine and most people can understand what he’s trying to say. I’m worried mostly about my mom because she might end up facing more serious consequences of not knowing English.

They both say all the time that they want to inprove their English language skills and they usually tell me to help them because I’m good with languages. But whenever I try to help them, they always say that they’re busy or that they’re too old to do so. My brother is leaving the state for military stuff soon, and I’ll be moving out to live in a dorm for college too. We’ve acted as their translators for as long as I can remember.

432,"On Sunday I had a “fight” with an aunt on my mothers side. A year after I graduated college everyone in the family stopped all communication with her. She married young, had 3 kids and eventually marital problems came which lead to a nasty divorce in which she gave up custody of her first 3 children. Before she gave up custody she was physically and verbally abusive to the oldest for almost a year until everything was finalized. When this all happened the kids were quick to call me first, I guess to save them from her. The man who she is currently married too happens to be the same person whom she chose over her first 3 children. I used to stay at her house to help her with the kids, I practically lived with her and made sure the kids got to and from school, did the grocery shopping and watched over them during the weekends while she worked. Things just changed when that man came into her life. 

Anyway, eventually she made her way back to the family they forgave her and I never talked to her about it. Then she got pregnant and a beautiful baby boy was born. I began to talk to her because honestly I thought that was the cutest baby I’ve ever seen and that’s how I began a relationship with her. Eventually, I found out the man she is with and the father of the beautiful baby boy had physically assaulted her, left her with a broken nose, no money and alone in a different state, basically I guess maybe she got some of her karma. Although, physically assault anyone is just plain foul period. He’s not the best from what I’ve witness when it comes to keeping jobs. Eventually, all 3 ended up moving into my moms house where I live. They have been here well over a year and things were good. She recently had her 5th child with the same man. I’ve always helped with the baby boy who is almost 2.5 now. Don’t know what it is about that kid, but I love that kid. I spent a crazy amount of money getting her back home from Cuba after they decided to make a trip out there for the man to see his family right after covid had started. Why she still went is just crazy. I never asked her to pay me back but she eventually did, 3 months later. He even asked if I would co-sign for him to get a car, I said no. I never converse with him because I’ve never cared for him. And the only times I actually talk to her is because of the kid who I love so much. I’ve spend crazy money on him. She’s never asked me too but I do it because I love the kid. Most recently I bought him shoes bc the kid didn’t have any that actually fit him. Then I ordered him more shoes that she picked along with some clothes for his newborn sister. I don’t know call me mean or whatever but I’m just not drawn to the newborn. 

Anyway, she has a heavy hand. And lately, I feel like my baby has been discipline way too harsh. I mean he’s a 2.5 year old, he does not understand and constantly yelling at him and constantly giving him spankings at such young age in my opinion are simply futile. Lately, they have started punishing him by taking him to their room and spanking him. Which brings me to yesterday. While I was eating with my other 14 year old cousin we just heard a really loud hit. I mean it sounded like a person was slapped really hard. It made me so uncomfortable and just typing it brings tears to my eyes. I told my aunt to please check on the man she’s with and my baby cousin, it just didn’t sound right. Long story short she came out the room and when she was questioned and told by my grandma to not beat my baby cousin she became defensive saying that she couldn’t do anything in this house or parent her children because we have a perception of her beating her children. Which, yes we do, because yes you did. I mean you gave up custody of your first 3 children for a payout and a new man. She made a comment along the lines of that’s why I want to leave and don’t want to be here to which I said then leave the door is right there. And then shit hit the fan. She went into the room crying and out comes the man telling me in my own mothers house to tell him whatever my problem is and that I get into people’s business. Me, who never comes out the room, works two jobs just to not be home. Then he had the audacity to call my mom like a little girl. They are both well over 40. Yeah. So anyway, I haven’t spoke to neither of them and today she got a little tough talking smack, I didn’t react. I was too busy working. I’m unfortunately WFH, cause Covid. But what I did do was change the WiFi’s password because I pay for it and I specifically have it for my use. And again she started talking mess. I could careless about her or her man. But I feel for my baby cousin. I hope he is not being mistreated. I don’t know what goes through her mind but I assume being  over 40 living with a man who can’t keep a job and leeching of her sister doesn’t feel the greatest. 

She’s also a dang scammer. Like I want to report her for Medicaid fraud but I hold back because of my baby cousin. Sure my baby cousin is not the best behaved child and he can be naughty but he’s 2.5 years old. I just don’t trust her or him for that matter to not physically harm my baby cousin. I know he can be overly dramatic and screams at anything and everything that isn’t of his liking but walls are paper thin and the majority of the time he’s in their room there’s more crying than a baby boy laughing/giggling. I was once told that if I wasn’t sure there was abuse, that I should report regardless and I’m nearing that point. I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or I just needed to get that out. But dear God, please protect my baby cousin and watch over him, please do not let any harm comes his way.",29Jul2020,1
433,"Please before you be judgemental, read till the end.

I believe I am a good friend. Never had I betrayed my friends trust and had been always loyal to them. Always there when someone wants to talk or needs a service from me. Always answering their texts/calls and ready to talk. In fact, I have friendships that lasted more than 10 years, 8 years, 6 years etc. Some of them are lasting since elementary and middle school till now. When I started college in another country, I started having real bad social anxiety and this extremely affected my social life. I am now a Junior and friends I made here throughout all the three years can be  counted on the fingers of one hand. Anyway, this is not the topic I will get to the point now.

This might be an unpopular opinion, but I am planning to give up on all the long lasting friendships I made simply because I do not see that my friends have changed in any way, I do not see any improvements in the way they think or live their lives. They are still believing in some cultural bullshit that they had been fed for years from their surroundings, they do not search or seek knowledge,  and they're just conforming to social standards, I feel like they are just living and relying on the time to make their lives better for them. Moreover, when I start a conversation with one of them it always comes to the same topic and we would start talking about some bullshit and after hours of talking I will find myself left only with ""Junk information"", nothing is added to my brain not even a single idea. Basically not constructive discussions at all.  Just to stress it here, **I do not feel superior at all and I never made them feel that they are not improving or whatever**. I would give advice and make subtle comments about bad things they do without making them feel bad or lower they self-esteem. 

Why this bothers me is the question. I am 21 years old and I want to improve, make connections with people who have shit to talk about, discuss real life matters, have deep conversations with them, sit in a mannered way and make serious eye contacts when talking about an important topic. Not having a friend who would jump out of nowhere and says a joke that is not even funny and not even furthering the conversation. I will say it clearly here, I am ashamed to even introduce all my male friends to my parents or the few people I made friendship with in the foreign country. This starts to heavily make me feel alone and I do not know if you got the picture of all what I said, but it just sucks... most of the time.

Please do not be judgemental. I am not a bad person, I am in a period of my life where I have to destroy all bases I had since childhood and have to start making real changes, simply because they are not bringing me any good. What should I do? Should I just keep being the good friend and try to enjoy those junk conversations and forget about it? Maybe make new friends that fit with my personality while still being in contact with the others? What will be the good thing to do here?",29Jul2020,1
434,"My work is having an external provider come in to give us some training. I would be willing to go except it is held during a time I have a class, so it's not like I could go even if I wanted to.


I went to a previous training session held 3 months ago, so I asked my manager if I needed to go to this one seeing as I'd already been to the last one, and that's when she informed me this one was a ""refresher"" and it was a requirement for all staff to attend.


I then replied back saying that I had school during that time and therefore wouldn't be able to attend. I also asked in my message if there was an alternative time that I'd be able to come in to complete the training. 


My manager has ignored my text and I think she's waiting for me to call her about this. Which I intend to do tomorrow. Although I don't see why she couldn't just respond over text as that's how she initially informed me I needed to come.


While I understand it may be difficult to find a time for me to do this training as it's from an external provider who has obviously been booked to come at a set time, it's not like I have a choice and am refusing to come out of laziness. I physically cannot attend. 


My manager knows I'm a high school student, yet said ""please make sure you make yourself available"" in her initial text.

436,"So the title says it all, but to sum it up; we were fooling around and he joking threw my bra at me. But the metal clasp on my bra smacked against my face pretty hard and we continued to joke and laugh. I stupidly took it too far and grabbed the towel I was holding, and smacked his thigh with it, but it somehow wrapped around his thigh and whipped his nuts. 

Needless to say he was in a ton of pain and was literally curled up, sobbing into his pillow while I apologized profusely and rubbed my hand on his back. When he was finally able to breathe and say real words, he asked me to just head home so he could be alone, so I apologized again, gave him a kiss and left. 

I felt genuinely sorry and I never laughed because I had instantly realized what had happened. I started crying when I was apologizing because I could see the amount of pain he was in.

When I read things like about Fascist America, racial injustice, and the concentration camps in China, I don’t understand how they came to be or the moving parts behind them. 

I know about some things like income inequality, taxes on the wealth, and police brutality. However, my awareness of these things feels shallow and limited. I would like deeper awareness so I may be better informed because I really want to understand the world around me.

Potential TW for sexual assault**

So I joined a friend group with one of the people being my childhood friend. I moved back to the city so it was nice to have people here. One of them held a party a few weeks back and it was awesome and I got very drunk, blackout drunk. Next thing I know I'm in my car with one of their friends and I can only remember bits of it, but I'm pretty sure he penetrated me. I told my friend about it, and they said that since it was a friend of theirs it's ok and that I have to move forward.  Since I'm new to the group I still feel a little uncomfortable around them and now going through this I feel extra weird. 
We have a trip planned later in August and I recently found out that this guy is coming along. I told my friend about my hesitation but was met with little sympathy. Basically explaining that because he and I got along beforehand, we should be fine on the trip. Even though everything I think about that night or experience a flashback my anxiety spikes and I breakdown. 
I'm stuck, I feel like I know the option of not going and respecting my boundaries, but I also feel guilt. I'm a sexual person and sex work is my career, but I know i didn't want what happened that night. To be on a trip for 5 days with person makes me so uneasy, but I feel like the group will be upset. 
My brain is a frazzled mess, so I apologize for the poor writing. I'm happy to explain more if necessary.

440,"Hi guys. I just created this account so I can ask you all for advice on this situation.

I have a $500 parlay with pelicans -1.5 and lakers +1 at +266

$500 to win $1333 and return with $1833

The current lakers spread is -5

IF the pelicans win, I have 4 options.

Option 1:

Hedge/middle the lakers +1 +266 by betting on the clippers +5 -117 $580 to win $500.

This way I can’t lose with a chance of winning both bets, or pushing 1/winning 1, or worst case senecio, winning 1/losing 1 which would still result in me winning if the lakers cover.

Option 2:

Use arbitrage with a chance at middling.

Bet $986 on the clippers +5 -117 to win $847. In this case, the worst possible outcome would be profit of $343 with a chance of middling lakers +1 and clippers +5 and winning both bets Which would be about $2100 winnings. Worst case I win $343. Also, have the possibility to push 1 and win 1.

Option 3:

Bet $1230 on clippers +9 -205 to win $600.

This would guaranteed me a profit of $100 at the worst case scenario. This option gives me a great chance of middling ($2100 profit) with lakers +1 and clippers +9 with a total of 10 points to work with.

Option 4: Ride the lakers +1 and don’t bet on the clippers. Remember, this all hinges on the pelicans covering.

Any advice is greatly appreciated Thank you",29Jul2020,1

450,"      He is 19 and I am 16 and we are both male. This happened the other night. I was up very late at night, around 3, when my brother started aggressively knocking on my door, and then burst into my room. He had this wild look in his eyes and came right at me. He is about 30 or more pounds than I am, and 5 inches taller. 
      I was able to pin him on my floor since I wrestled one year in high school and always practiced against bigger wrestlers. He never works out anymore so that may have helped me too. While we were on the ground, he wrapped his hands around my neck to choke me before I pinned his arms down. I didn’t even realize he was high until my dad yelled at him about it. This is very out of character for him, but he had asked me to fight him for something I didn’t even do the other day.
      The reason he came at me is because he thought I forgot to let the dog in, which doesn’t make sense, because I wasn’t the last one downstairs. In our family the last one to go upstairs is the one who take care of the dog. 
      The next morning we talked, and he seemed very sincere in his apology. But I still feel very uncomfortable around him. In his apology he offered to buy an Xbox game for me. While I appreciate the offer, I didn’t say anything because I feel as though it isn’t right to accept that money. I don’t know if I should give it back, and the only reason I took it is because he put it on the table right after apologizing. It just feels wrong.
     My older brother used to be my number one person to ask for advice, and I really looked up to him. He was really a good role model in my eyes and helped me get through a breakup which really hurt me. But nowadays I don’t even want to be around him. My dad was furious at first, and he grabbed his keys and told him he wouldn’t be driving again for a long, long time. But only three days later he’s back to driving, with seemingly zero consequences at all. 
      My mom doesn’t know that he was high, because no one has told her. I talked to my mom about the whole situation and she didn’t think it was that serious, and the gist of what she said was “I’m glad you were about to take him down and pin him, it is pretty funny” which I agree with, and “I thought he tried to hurt you because he was drunk, at least he didn’t drive drunk.” But he might have driven home high, and that scares me. 
      I don’t know whether I should snitch on him. I know driving while intoxicated is a serious thing, but I love my brother and I don’t know what to do. I’ve never smoked weed before but I was around an older friend who was smoking. My brother’s eyes looked red all over, way more than my friend’s. He also smelled so much that I had to take a shower afterwards cause I smelled too. This all leads me to believe that he drove home high. 
      
I didn’t think weed made you angry, but he was furious at me for something I don’t even do.


How should I deal with all of this? I wasn’t hurt physically but I feel nervous and uncomfortable about the situation. I’ve been sleeping in the guest room instead of my room. Should I tell him how I really feel, or should I tell my mom that he was high? I don’t she’ll be easy on him, and I don’t want him to hate me. Please help me out here.",29Jul2020,1
451,"So— I had a guy trick me into having sex with him once. It was years ago but something about it sticks in my mind. I said no at least 5 times, and then he convinced me he had feelings for me, he even told me to ask his best friend. This was a soft spot as we went to high school together and I had a crush on him all 4 years, something that was never discussed but he knew. We were both a little drunk. It was also the first time I ever had sex. I’ve dismissed it in my mind, saying it wasn’t like he assaulted me or anything because I was giddy the next morning. But that was because I thought my feelings were finally reciprocated and the sex came from emotion. So it couldn’t have been the r word because I was giddy the next morning right? Was I just manipulated? The next night he made out with a shared friend in front of me at a bar and I left crying, extremely upset. In one way I was glad to have my virginity over with, I mean freshman year of college was kind of late. Within the next year or so I was somewhat cordial toward him again. But he has been removed from my life for a couple of years now. I’ve also dealt with a narcissistic manipulative mother my entire life and I think in some ways it’s normalized this manipulative behavior for me. So.. I just don’t know what to think. But it’s stuck with me for some reason. I don’t think I was assaulted or anything, just tricked, right? What’s the difference? I don’t know.

457,"Hi everyone. I'll try to keep it short.

My whole life my mental health has been a bottomless hole of nothing--I was always depressed, traumatised, suicidal, went through several therapies and am in therapy again right now to try to move forward. Education was always difficult for me, but after dropping out of school three times I graduated, could go to university where I got my BA with only one/two years delay. (Not a lot for me.) Now I'm doing my MA since 2016 and last month I registered my final thesis, which should take 6 months. Deadline is end of December. Even given my general mental health state, I did think I could make it... as always with a lot of pain and torture for me, but I could. So I wanted to try.

Then my partner of eleven years very suddenly left me and I found myself on the street. He was pretty much my only safety net. I didn't and don't really have anyone else. It's terrible for me to be with people, I grew up isolated, so that's a trigger for me, but i try. Thing is I'm going through another trauma right now, due to him breaking up so suddenly and so finally. I try to stay busy and keep going to work (I work by the side, have for years), keep trying to hold myself together (I live with my brother, his wife, and my niece for now). I would have 5 months left to finish my MA thesis.  In theory it's plenty of time, but I've already studied longer for 2 years than one usually does for their MA given my mental state... so I'm entirely out of the loop with regards to my course material, and I can't catch up. I have a topic I halfway could get into, I think, but it would be so damn difficult. Really hard. And as of now I struggle to get through the days and have enough energy to not break down when I'm around other people, because those problems are my own problems and not theirs.

It's idiotic to drop out now, just before the final run. It's really just the thesis left. I know it's idiotic. But I also feel in my bones the uncertainty of having enough energy left. I just have no energy left. I'm tired. I'm truly tired. Everything I ever had to do was a total struggle, but I had my previous partner, who helped me immensely. Now I'm... this... and my bones say I have no energy left. I just want to lay down and sleep. 

My therapist is on summer pause, so I can't talk to him. I'll try to talk to someone I trust later this week if I'm lucky. A good friend of mine whose advice I 90% always support and who mostly thinks like me only said, even before I thought of dropping out at all, ""It's okay if you can't do it. Remember you already have a degree. This is just extra. It's okay if you can't.""

It's idiotic, but I'm tired. I don't know what to do. I don't know who I am anymore, what's going on. If I'm lucky I could have a proper job out of the student job I have right now, even without my MA, but it's unsure yet. But the possibility is there, my boss is supportive and trying to wing it for me, and the pay would be okay. 

I study something that was my only passion in life, even if useless for capitalist society. But since he left I am so adrift I don't even feel it anymore, the passion. It waned over the last years due to my depression.

If I don't hand in the ma thesis, it's done for me. I already registered, so it's compulsory to hand it in now... so it's either this or drop out. 

Part of me would be so relieved to drop out. I could focus on myself, try to find out how to live by myself (I never learned that), focus on what I might want, focus on my recovery. The other part says I struggled for four years because I wanted it so much, it'd be stupid to drop it now... it was always difficult, what's 5 more months.  ( I am so tired.)  Then I'd have it, and then I could do all those things too.

I'm really tired. I vowed to start in August now, but I'm so, so tired. Any advice?",29Jul2020,1
458,"I mean EVERYONE new I meet. I see a guy at the grocery store, we have a nice conversation, and I start thinking about how he would be as a partner. It’s hard for me to form friendships because I think of people romantically until I’ve know them a while. I’ve always had a flirty personality and I really don’t mean to. I feel guilty thinking about people in this way because I’m fully aware that people are more than just potential partners.

It hinders my relationships because I usually fall into relationships with similar people who don’t actually want to be my friend, or just want a partner immediately. I actually had a partner just like me in his weighing of people and couldn’t have any platonic relationships with women. He ended up cheating on me for two years, without me knowing. I don’t cheat, but the principle of being interested in other people while in a relationship is what makes me feel so guilty. No matter how much I love the people I always find myself daydreaming about other people. I’m single now and it’s for the best, but I don’t want to be like this. I don’t want that to be my first thought when meeting new people and I want to form meaning relationships with partners and long term friends. I’m bisexual so it happens with all genders, so I basically have no friends. I always respect my boundaries and never cross them, but the feeling of guilt from having the thoughts in the first place stop me from wanting to make new friends.

It may sound dumb, so if I can get advice from people who’ve been in my shoes or can give me steps to take to prevent this that would be amazing!!

TLDR: I think of every person I meet as a potential partner and can’t form meaningful friendships without flirting. I don’t want to be like this anymore.",29Jul2020,1

464,"This is gonna be a long one so grab a snack

My boyfriend (21) and I (18) have been together for almost two years. Within that time we’ve had a lot of problems and arguments. However, I never really thought that what has happened is abuse until recently.

First, the very first time I can remember him being “abusive” was about 5 months in. Him and I were driving around with one of his friends who he invited. We’re all talking and I laughed at something his friend said. He suddenly said he needed to go home and had to drop his friend off. He kept it together while his friend was still in the car but as soon as he left it went very bad very quick. He said that the whole time I was trying to get with his friend and called me a slut, whore, bitch, liar. I had never seen him act like this so I was pretty confused and just said no I wasn’t we were all just hanging out. We got back to his house and he had been screaming at me the whole way there. I told him I wanted to leave and he punched the car window out and told me he wasn’t taking me home (I didn’t have my license at this time) and that I need to figure it out. He went inside and locked me out. He came back out about 5 minutes later and apologized and then got mad that I had actually contacted someone to come get me. 

Now, more recently, two days ago I was staying over at his house. I woke up in the middle of night and couldn’t get back to sleep so I started scrolling on my phone. He woke up about 2 hours later and I said hi and told him I couldn’t sleep. He was instantly mad at said all I do is just talk to other people on my phone. At first I didn’t realize he was genuinely mad so I stayed on my phone and then things escalated into possibly the scariest fight we’ve ever had. He started screaming at me to just go and saying he couldn’t stand me and wanted me to leave. I started to get all my stuff. I was sitting in the edge of the bed and he was standing in front of me with his hands on my hips. I asked him to please move so I could finish getting my stuff and he refused to move. I grabbed his arms and moved them off of me and he got in my face and started screaming and said “If you want things to get physical we can get fucking physical” and he wouldn’t let me leave the room. I genuinely thought he was going to hit me that night. I continued getting my stuff and told him I was going and didn’t deserve to be treated like this. He said I wasn’t going and that if I wanted to leave so bad I could call the cops. We argued for 2 hours and he eventually said he was sorry and gave some excuses about having issues from his childhood that influence how he acts. 

I’m not totally blind. I know our relationship isn’t how a relationship should be but I can’t figure out if this is abuse or if I’m just overthinking. 

Other red flags, he goes through who I’m friends with on facebook and who I follow on Instagram and who follows me. He had me unfollow and unfriend every guy on both platforms, even childhood friends I’ve known my whole life. He gets mad if I post selfies or try to look good in public or on social media because he says I’m trying to get other people’s attention. Anytime I get a message or any notification he believes it’s from other guys and I’m cheating. I’ve now had the vibration on my phone shut off for a year so he won’t know when I get notifications and yell at me. His jealousy is extreme. On my 18th birthday I went and got my nipples pierced. I asked him to come and we had planned that he would drive back because I knew I’d be in pain and just want to lay down. After the piercing was done he refused to drive and said I was trying to bang the piercer. He made me drive home, yelled at me the whole time and I went home crying, on my birthday. He hasn’t gotten me any gifts since valentine’s day in 2019. Now I know gifts aren’t required in a relationship and that’s not what I’m saying, but for my birthday I got nothing, for christmas I got nothing, for our anniversary I got nothing, for valentine’s day this year I got nothing. He lashes out in anger often. And it’s not just your regular, ole’ frustration or getting a little worked up. He gets SO angry. If someone passing even looks at him he’ll get mad and he doesn’t cause a scene but he’ll talk to me about it and tell me how much he hates people. He has road rage like I’ve never seen. We were on a date one day and someone was going slow, he passed them, and then the person started riding his ass. He got so mad. He slammed on the brakes and the guy passed him. My boyfriend started following him and screaming out the car window at him. He was saying he was going to follow him home and beat him up. I started crying and asked him to please just stop. He said if I didn’t like it I can get out and walk somewhere. He finally stopped following the guy and went and parked somewhere. I was still crying and he said he was sorry but then got mad that I had disagreed with him. We ended up just going home. He gets angry anytime I don’t want to be sexual and he does. Anytime I don’t want to be intimate and he does he says that it’s because I want other people and I don’t like him and makes me feel bad for not being in the mood. He degrades women, he uses racial slurs and anytime I’ve told him that’s not okay he gets mad, he makes fun of the LGBTQ+ community and makes fun of me for being bisexual. I opened up to him about sexual assault from my childhood and he just looked at me and didn’t say anything for an hour while I was crying and then got up and left. 

He has been to jail in the past before we met on a domestic violence charge from his previous relationship. I knew about this before we started dating. He told me it wasn’t true and his ex made it up and she had hit him. At first I never doubted him, but now I don’t know. He also has a child with that ex that he just learned about. 

This is only my second ever relationship. My first relationship was physically abusive and I met my current boyfriend very soon after that ended. 

We’re supposed to be moving in together in a couple months, but I don’t know if that’s the right choice. I think things might just get worse if we live together. I still believe he’s a good person and does love me but I don’t understand why he can’t just stop. I’m not happy in this relationship right now but I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if leaving is the right choice or if this is something that can be fixed and I’m just not trying enough. I’ve tried to do everything he says he wants or fix what he says bothers him and it’s still never enough.

466,"Hey everyone. I have had this issue for about 4 years now. I'm 25, have been working a full time job in my field since graduating college in 2017 and live in the Eastern part of the US. I'm actually writing this now at 4:30am still not being able to sleep.

I don't know what it is, and it's not because I'm not tired either, I lay down ready to sleep, but then nothing. I just start thinking and thinking and I can't stop. This has caused me issues with being late to jobs and events in the past, and I'm tired of this starting to control me and my life. I lay in bed for hours and hours, just here, thinking about random things. I tried melatonin, deep breathing, mind exercises, and just none of that works. I'm awake until the sun comes out, then fall asleep probably because of exhaustion.

I am an extremely motivated person, and as soon as an idea gets into my head, I can't stop thinking about it, and it doesn't go away. From inventions, past/current relationships, people/animals I've lost, and even things I'm embarrassed that happened years ago and are probably forgotten.

I don't know what to do, and who to talk to. But this is turning me into a person that I don't want to become. I'm determined to fix it, but I really don't think I can do it on my own.",29Jul2020,1

468,"A couple months ago I ended a really long and very unhealthy relationship, and I've been having a real bad time struggling with not having this other person around anymore after so many years, it's effected me in such a way that I feel like I can't be around any of my friends, so I've almost completely isolated myself which has not been healthy. 

Towards the end of the relationship I was starting to feel like I was going a little crazy anyway, something happened that broke all the trust in our relationship and I just tried to stay with her even though I no longer trusted her, and I ended up just really messing myself up with that, eventually I walked away from it all but this break up has had an affect on me like no other, I don't mean that in a ""my life is over, it's all hopeless"" kind of way, I mean like it's done something to my brain.

 I haven't went and actually spent time with any of my friends since it happened, every once in a while I'll join our discord and talk to everybody for a minute, but I've noticed that I'm just really awkward now, I'm talking to people that I've known my whole entire life, and for some reason it's just like I'm an anxious kid again talking to a complete stranger, all of my thoughts have felt super rapid as well, I've got ADD and my mind is always racing anyway but lately it's been extra fast and  driving me absolutely crazy with constant negative thoughts about myself.

My friends all know what I'm dealing with and I know that they've been able to tell I've been different because they all seem to be extra careful and nice to me whenever we do speak, but up until a couple days ago I hadn't really told anybody just how much it's affected me, because I'm a very closed off man when it comes to talking about my emotions, I have this weird problem where if I open up to somebody close to me, I just feel incredibly embarrassed the next time I see them, I don't know why, I just have issues being vulnerable in front of people that I'm around a lot I suppose. 

I've slowly been growing even more distant with my friend group as my metal health has deteriorated, and one of the guys in the group that I've always been really close to decided to message me the other day and ask if I was doing okay, and I just absolutely poured my heart out to him, which is very unlike me, I couldn't even help it, it just happened, I explained everything about the current state of my mental health to him, and he just left it on read, it's been a couple days and he still hasn't replied, which doesn't make me mad at him or anything don't get me wrong, I'm sure I'd have no idea how to reply to a message like the one I sent him either, but it did still hurt my feelings more than I care to admit, and just has me feeling incredibly embarrassed about what his reaction must have been. 

I'm going to get myself into therapy as soon as possible, but I've been having trouble doing anything at all lately, I've lost a little bit over 20 pounds since we broke up, I've barely been sleeping, and whenever I do lay down to try and sleep I'm just hit by this feeling of loneliness that just kicks the shit out of me, I miss having another person around to love on and joke with and sleep beside so much, but I can tell that it's snowballed into something much deeper than that too, I just don't know what to do, I can tell that there's something wrong with the way my brain is functioning right now, I've had my battles with depression in the past and have had some success with antidepressants, but whatever's going on with me right now just seems like something completely different and new to me, but I don't want to self diagnose.

So I just don't even know where to begin, I don't even know what the next baby step could be, but if anybody feels like they know what I'm feeling, or even just feels like they have anything to offer here at all, it would be greatly appreciated, all I know is that I need some kind of help.

The responses made me really reflect on my behaviour and made me question how I even got to be so petty and selfish towards my own family. It's really bothered and upset me and it's something I really want to change but I don't know how or where to even start.

There have been instances where I haven't put my family first, the worst, for example, had to be for one of my birthdays I planned a dinner with me and my friends at a nice restaurant and completely didn't even think that I should've maybe booked a restaurant dinner with my family and done something else with my friends on a different day to celebrate. It was such a shitty move on my part, and I can't even believe that it never occurred to me at the time how absolutely selfish I was. It wasn't until after my sister and parents pointed it out that I realised. There have been smaller incidents here and there. I sometimes have put it down to me being independent enough to make my own mind up, or that my family simply don't understand decisions I make, but I don't know how right I am. My family have pointed out to me on occasion that I am selfish and that I only think about myself, but I honestly don't do it intentionally, I would never, and I feel bad afterwards when it occurs to me what I've done. How do I become more mindful about my family and be more generous to them and do right by them?

Also In terms of my short temper, I have been this way for as long as I can remember, my family always have qualms about my temper, and my little brothers are resentful towards me because of it. I hate that, I hate that I'm this person, and I want to change but every time I try, these little, consistent ""aggravations"" keep occurring and I resort to my old self. Since the age of 8 or 9 until now (22) I've had to cook for the family most of the time, clean the house with little to no help, do the laundry etc for a family of 7. I wouldn't mind if everyone pulled their own weight around the house but they don't (except my mum, she's an angel 90% of the time and she gets all the passes because she's amazing :) ). I'll provide examples:

\- My brothers leave their used dishes/cups/tissues/socks/shoes all over the house and never clean up after themselves, I have spent YEARS chasing after them telling them to pick up this, pick up that and I am so tired. I am so exhausted and frustrated. And because I constantly chase after them and get upset as a result, they look at me as the ""mean"", ""rude"" sister. I want them to like me because I like them, but they irritate me so much and they hold grudges about how rude I am to them rather than the nice things I do for them i.e cook for them, clean their mess, help with homework, give occasional fashion advice lol, indulge them by listening to their stupid little jokes, always lend an ear if they need it etc

\- My dad will sit on his ass and watch tv and leave nutshells and tea mugs all over the coffee table, expecting that someone will clean his things for him, and no one can tell him to clean his mess otherwise that's ""disrespectful"". I have a bad relationship with my dad, I haven't spoken to him in over a month and we live in the same house because I asked why he couldn't cook himself breakfast instead of waking me up in the morning to cook it for him instead.

\-They (brothers) leave wet used towels and their old smelly clothes all over the bathroom instead of putting them in the clothes basket, they all leave their beard trimmings all over the sink, squeeze toothpaste from the middle of the tube, leave their toothbrushes on the counter instead of the brush holder, never put things away etc Their ages range from 14-20.

No matter how many times I've told them to not do that it never lasts, this has been going on since they were little toddlers and my mum is tired of them, she's tried to teach them house manners and etiquette to no avail. It's these daily aggravations that just rile me up so much, I try to react calmly and kindly but I can't, I'm so angry and tired. And I need help, any advice is welcome.

So, he had MULTIPLE gf's mostly from far away countries like latvia. Some as young as 11-12 and he used to send porn to her while she was 11-12.

He also has gotten multiple ""illegal"" material that i know off, like he has an erotic photo of a 16 yo, material of a chicken and a boy, material of a 12 anf 15 yo. That are all the things i know off. Idk if he spread any.

Also some illegal material whit humans and animals.

He also has alot of explicit roleplays. This in itself isnt wrong but maybe worth mentioning

476,"So there are two reasons that they want to cut her out. The first reason is because she teases people a lot throughout our friend group. Often even me. Not like bullying, but like micro aggressions. Like if you accidentally spilled something she’d tease you for a second. Im pretty callous to this activity, because i had plenty of friends who behaved this way in high school. so i didn’t really give it much attention until the whole group brought it up.

The second was that she was different from the rest of us. This is the reason I don’t understand. Most of my friend group, including myself, are lgbtq and liberal. She is the only person at this point who is not lgbtq or liberal. She’s not political, but she does believe in a lot of the conservative politics her parents do.

I don’t understand the second reason because ive always been so used to diversity in my friend groups. In a strange way it can be fun to have your views challenged by someone else. I also enjoy the company of this friend minus the smart-aleck remarks.

I just feel strange cutting out another person when our friend group is already so small. What should I do about this? Are they right in cutting her out?

I’m also dating someone new and it’s a genuine breath of fresh air, a complete night and day difference, from my previous relationship. Even with this pandemic I’ve been able to continue my efforts with physical fitness and am even more confident with my body now than I have been in the past year. 

None the less with all these accomplishments I still feel completely lost. I know what I want to do in life and where I want to be within the next 5 years (I know it’s a long time to plan out but I’m just spitballing). I’ve started reconnecting a relationship with my mother that I never really had growing up, I feel extremely liberated having to no longer work for the military, I have even bought a motorcycle. Something I’ve wanted for a few years but didn’t want to deal with having all the course done in the military.  Even then I still find myself struggling to be happy.

I know and obvious factor is that I truly miss all my friends and family that I’ve meet along the way in North Carolina (where I was stationed for 4 years). With that said, I don’t really have a social group where I’m currently living because those relationships from high school have just drifted. I’ve got my immediate family and a few select friends that I still see on occasion but besides that I’ve never felt more lost in my life. To extent where I find myself having anxiety attacks through awkward situations. 

Believe me when I tell you that I’ve been put in some very stressful situations and never have I felt this sick anxiety. 

I’m not sure where to go next with this, I’m just seeking some words of advice. 

Thank you in advance",29Jul2020,1
480,"Ok so I know it's a fairly bad idea but I've been lost since highschool and no matter what I do, I end up spiraling more. I've got a shitty 2 day a week job. No college education (UK not us). I've been directionless for as long as I can remember. I'm thinking about travelling for a long while, maybe even as far as southern France until I figure out what I'm doing or its so shit that it scares me into doing something with my life.


I plan on avoiding cities and large towns, less trouble that way. I've got a little over a grand saved up and plan on staying In a tent most days whilst using campsites and laundromats to shower and clean my clothes.  I've been camping a lot before so I kinda know what I'm doing. I might buy a stove aswell but I don't know how wise that'd be. I'll be honest food is the thing I'm struggling with the most. I'm going to keep money saved for an emergency flight/train home.


Has anyone done anything similar before ? Any advice?",29Jul2020,1
481,"I have a friend (A) who's suicidal and is going to eight grade. She told me this around May. She tells me that she has this ""other side"" of her in her head, cussing her out and making her feel worthless. She tells me that to block her out, she punches herself. She also has this person in her head that she fears. She also told me that last year, she had attempted suicide but a voice in her head told her to think about those that love her, that will miss her. 

When she first told me about her thoughts, her ""other side,"" she said that it would happen every day. However, recently, she had told me that she has been blocking out her thoughts (her other side) mentally, and without the punching. And, these days, she hasn't mentioned anything about her thoughts. 

I am still worried about her, and I want to get her professional help. However, so many things are in the way. This pandemic ofc, and her parents do not regard or care about her mental health. 

I have told my other friend (B) about it, who also is friends with her, and another friend (C), who has been through depression and had attempted suicide. Friend C told me that it's best that she gets professional help. 

I have no idea what to do. I want her to get help but there's so many things blocking her way.

I am a year older than Friend A, btw. I dunno how that will help, but in my position, I feel completely helpless. I told her that she would need help, and she knows. However, we both are aware of the obstacles ahead of getting that help. 

I have also told her to call the hotline, if she really is considering on committing suicide. She said she feels more comfortable talking to friends about it.

Like said before, these days, in fact, a month, she has not been mentioning any dark or suicidal thoughts to me. I know that does not mean that she isn't thinking those thoughts, either.

I am really sorry this is so out-of-place. The point is, I don't know how to act and I feel that I am being too negligent about this issue.",29Jul2020,1

TL;DR at the bottom

So, I (17F) started texting this boy (18M) a couple days ago and tonight he wanted to face time with me. So I called him and we talked for a while before I made an excuse to hang up.

Let me preface this with the fact that I have never had a boyfriend or even kissed a boy before. 

So we’re talking and getting to know each other and he is completely showering me with compliments which is making me slightly uncomfortable. Then throughout the call he is continually talking over me and I feel like I can’t get a word in. This is starting to make me a little bit turned off towards him but then to add to the situation he starts talking about our future and our relationship (which we don’t even have at this point! I barely know him!). He starts talking about what I want to do and where I want to go to college and pressuring me to agree to go to college in his state and live with him! 

Then he starts talking about how great of a cuddler he is and asks if I want to see pictures of his butt because he thinks it is great. I say no but he sends them to me anyway. He then proceeded to tell me how he doesn’t smoke or drink because a bunch of people in his family has alcoholism and drug problems. 

This is only a small piece of our conversation and he said and did some other things that weirded me out but basically all I wanted to ask was is it wrong for me to be super freaked out and want to block him and never talk to him again? 

What do I do?? Help

His social skills were pretty bad in high school but they’ve gotten so much worse since all he does is stay home and in his room. He’s extremely sheltered so his parents don’t expect anything of him and they don’t really talk much either.

however, i have to be out of my parent's house by September so thats a problem. im also worried if i skip first semester this will put me behind a lot socially and academically. is it a normal thing to do? has anyone else done it? could i take summer classes to get back on track for next year?

489,"I want to switch to my dream job which doesn't require a degree, but I am just finishg 4 years of a STEM degree and I'm not sure what to do because if I switch I would waste 4 years of my life. Also this is not in the USA, so the difference in salaries between jobs is a lot smaller.

I don't know if I could even get in the job I want, because it's one of the best jobs that doesn't require college. I always wanted to do it but everyone told me to go to college because I had good grades in highschool. At the beginning the salary is average and after a few years it gets a bit better but there's not much else to achieve, not a lot opportunities to advance. But there is a lot of free time, you work 2 12 hour shifts and then get 2 days off so there's a lot of time to have a side hustle. It's a very respected job and I always saw myself doing it.

In the field I study, the average beginner salary is only a bit better and also after some time it doesn't get a lot better than my dream job, only if you really work hard and climb the ladder and become some kind of manager. After hearing from someone I know, how much he works for promotions and how often he switches companies I got really worried because I know I'm not this ambitious and won't try nearly as hard. I know that because I study just enough to pass exams, I value my free time a lot. Also I always hated the idea of working in an office and having to deal with office politics. Also if I want a better job I would have to move to a different city as there are not a lot of opportunities where I live now, but I love it here, it's beautiful and everyone from the city is always coming here during the weekend and all my friends are here. We have 2 houses so I don't have to pay for anything, if I move I'd have to also pay rent.

My parents who paid for everything during college (education is free, but there's still housing and stuff) are pressuring me to pursue the STEM career, but I'm afaid I won't be fullfilled and will hate my life. Because of how I am I will be stuck in some crappy position in a job I don't like getting paid maybe 10% more than I would be doing my dream job with lots more free time.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. A kind, subdued and accommodating approach as shown in How To Win Friends And influence People by Dale Carnegie.
2. A Masculine, self-Assured, Non-Needy approach as shown in Models by Mark Manson and No More Mr. Nice Guy bu Robert A. Glover

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I know that both methods have their advantages, from experience using both methods on people before coming here i noticed a few things...

1. Guys tend to mainly be okay with both approaches though the 2nd approach mixed with a few tips from the 1st approach seems to garner more likes. But the 2nd approach gives respect.
2. Girls clearly seem to like the 2nd approach which i have observed with some friends who seem to appear that way.
3. This doesn't mean that girls don't like the first approach since the first approach helps to maintain relationships.

Now After reading up to here what do you guys and gals think i should follow.

If you haven't read up on How To Win Friends And Influence People and the other two.

Please ask me the necessary questions and i shall summarise.

It would be best if you could read these books yourself and form your own opinions before discussing...

493,"Hi all, thanks for taking the times to read this. I really appreciate any and all advice.


I've been struggling with my mental health as of late. I have appointments booked with a bulk-billed psychologist (essentially government-funded) but because of the pandemic, a lot more people are accessing these resources (awesome!! Everyone should access resources they need!!) But I'm finding it extremely difficult to cope with the sparse appointments (Its taken nearly a month and a half for me to get this appointment). Now my mental health is at the point of affecting my work ethic at my day job (essential worker, have to still go in 4 days a week).


I need some short-term advice on how to keep my depression at bay, and how to unwind my anxiety so I can work without being so stressed all the time.


Our store is super quiet at the moment, but I feel like I'm not working hard enough or that I'm incompetent (even though I've been working here for 4 years!!) and the constant stress of dealing with customers not following laws and regulations, as well as constant rostering changes because of less customers - it's all a bit too much for me and my autistic brain. I don't cope with change and I don't cope well with aggressive customers. Does anyone have any advice I could utilise until I can start seeing my psychologist a bit more regularly?

495,"This is about how porn is destroying my relationship and I really need advice. This situation has changed and destroyed me that’s why I can’t handle things on my own anymore. 

My boyfriend told me that he was addicted to porn before but was able to minimize his porn habit as we got together. That was until I had to drive to a seminar for a week to a different city. From this point on everything changed. I noticed and felt the rejection. 
People will say that for men it’s only natural to watch porn and it’s totally fine. I used to be this kind of person as well. However, I’m sure you would change your opinion when your partner suddenly stops or minimize the affection he used to show you out of nowhere just to have more time to watch and jerk off to porn. 

Nevertheless I was confident that we could figure things out. My self-esteem was low, I wasn’t the same confident person I used to be and I cried daily. I still supported my boyfriend and after a lot of disputes and lies he finally realized how bad his porn habit was. He stopped. Everything seemed good. I was still affected by his porn addiction and still had a low self-esteem but I supported him without thinking about myself. I wanted to safe the relationship and it worked. Before his first relapse our relationship changed completely. And then he relapsed. I wasn’t even feeling bad. I was so glad that he was honest about it. He said that someone posted a profile of a girl who posts nudes and he clicked on it. We talked about it and how I could help him. It was great to be this open about this topic again. 

But then some weeks later I noticed the same behavior he had while he was addicted to porn. I noticed dubious websites on his phone with headlines that promised pictures of nudes or “hottest women”. I felt shitty but tried to ignore it. I’m sure he was only lying to himself, that he was curious about these articles and only wanted the dopamine rush from the promised pictures. As I predicted it wasn’t taking long from here until he relapsed again. This time it was worse. He went on Pornhub and onlyfans by himself and jerked off three times. After that however, he couldn’t stop. From this point on he would again look at “hot” pictures of women or search for porn on Twitter. His second relapse was four days ago and only because I addressed the topic yesterday he told me that he didn’t stopped relapsing since then. 

I don’t know what to do anymore I’m getting more and more affected by his porn habit. I’m afraid that I’ll never find someone who could just focus on me. It’s natural for me to only be attracted to my boyfriend and to not have the urge to look or check out other men. I wish he would feel the same way...
I love him but I think that the situation is hopeless as long as he isn’t really trying to quit porn completely. I know it’s hard but it should be at least possible to ignore the most obvious triggers and to not click on them every day.

Thank you for reading my post. I would be really glad if someone could give me an advice on whether I should try to help him or leave him even though I do love him a lot.",29Jul2020,1

My opinion was that childhood is not beautiful, life isnt unicorns and rainbows it never is, and they should get hit with reality as soon as possible to save them the overwhelming weight of realism. a mercy reality check if you will. thats what this show helped me with and im grateful. im more of a introvert, misanthrope and conflicted person with a negative outlook on life than i was in my childhood. and im grateful for that. i would happily and excitedly beat the hell out of my younger self for being so childish. also why are you getting offended? oh wait just realized this is 2020, people get offended by anything nowadays.

502,"I (26f) began learning to drive in September 2019.  My instructor was not for me.  Very hypercritical and grouchy, just not the teaching style I needed and my confidence was at level zero.  When we moved house in January 2020 I started with another instructor named Dave, who was brilliant.  My confidence has skyrocketed and I've become a really good driver under his instructiom.  When things began to escalate globally (you know what I mean) I was test ready and unfortunately unable to take one as they had all been cancelled.  After almost a 4-month break I got back into my lessons and was at the same level as where I left off.  Still confident, still safe, still a good driver...I've had 4 lessons since mid -July when they started again.  

Here's the issue: I have been offered a job as a key worker on the condition that I pass my driving test.  This is a job I cannot afford to turn down, and the only employer who has given me an offer without a license.  As everything needs to be contact free, most employers require me to have a license and, due to where I live, it is virtually impossible for me to walk anywhere to get to work.  Key workers are being offered emergency driving tests, so I could book one and have it set up for me in a matter of days.  I'm not in a financial position to turn this job down and as Dave has been telling me for months that I'm A* across the board and with a bit of polishing up could pass a test, I told him I'd like to spend a few weeks doing 2/3 lessons per week working on my manoeuvres, roundabouts etc then book an emergency test while my employers get my references and vetting done. 

Surprisingly, Dave seemed very against the idea and, although he said it was ultimately up to me, began to make it seem very difficult to fit me in for extra lessons.  This is despite telling me that when I could book a test under normal conditions he would fit me in for extra lessons. He also began heavily critiquing me and saying things like ""if you drive like this on a test day, you'll fail..."" even though he normally gives me top marks and tells me how great I am at driving.  At the end of the lesson, he began marking my scores down which makes me feel his previous praise has been entirely dishonest.  He has tried to assure me it's not about the money, saying he doesn't benefit financially from keeping me on but I can't understand this total 180 in the space of an hour.  I can understand wanting to put your students through for tests at 110% readiness but I feel that with a few extra weeks of more intensive lessons I could do it.  At the very least I have to try.  He's also mentioned the location of my test would be different and therefore more difficult, but my logic is you should be able to get in a car and drive anywhere.  Not to mention I did take 18 hours worth of lessons in that location with my first instructor.  Dave advised me to just look for another job with a lower wage &amp; wait until potentially October/November to take a test.  Not only is a lack of license impacting my ability to work, I'm unable to do many other everyday things because of it.  What do I do in this situation?  Do I reject the only job offer I've had in order to continue paying money I'm already scraping together for driving?  Do I go to a new instructor, or stand firm with Dave that I'm going to try at the very least after a few more weeks of intensive lessons if he's willing to fit me in?  Feeling very downtrodden about it all.

If i have to eat, i would eat small dishes like chips and fries. Being unable to eat means i get exhausted easily, which just makes living a little bit harder because by the afternoon, i would feel awful and start feeling like im at the brink of falling at every passing moment.

I don’t know how to rest. On my weekends I’m constantly working towards my goals, when I come home From work I’m learning more about the field I want to go into. Sometimes, I take a break but then my head gets clouded with negative thoughts, failure, loneliness. It’s not healthy.

508,"I (21M) started working this year in an engineering company as a junior business development executive. I have lived alone for the past 3 years. Family (Mo, Br) joined Fa 2 years ago in an ""advanced economy"" country. Br decided to go to Uni. To bear all expenses Mo started working as a carer. Fa works in a Fine Dining restaurant as a manager. Basically, Not a lot of money to throw around. 

Here's the dilemma. Have been staying with everyone since May in the new country due to pandemic and have seen Mo struggle a lot, with her job taking a real physical toll on her. But again, due to pandemic there are no vacancies in business or engineering hence I can't find a job here to support the family. My current job has a nice progressive environment with all colleagues mostly looking to help the newbie.

Should I stay in the new country and leave my current job to take up a job in a store/carer house/restaurant and see the recession period through? Or should I focus on my career first and go back to my home country?

514,"This might be a bit of a downer and a weird question to ask advice for, sorry in advance.

I (23F) have been feeling like I have no place in this world (no suicidal thoughts) because of the state of the world right now.

In my honest opinion life feels like a bad game after I turned 18, it’s all about making money and getting successful. I don’t want to be a part of that, I want my free time, time to focus on being the best version of me that I can be and do what I want to do. 

Right now I have a low paying job which i HATE, So I’m thinking about switching jobs. 
I want to start a study again, so I can get a better and higher payer job, but in order to start a study I have to have atleast some money in the back. 
Any job I can get without a paper is paying way too little to cover all my bills, including school bills.
My country offers a ‘lent’ you can get once you start school and once you finish you have to pay it back. The catch? THEY decide what you will pay them each month and you can’t refuse.

So in short, I’ll go to college, i’ll pay and take a loan and still have to pay them back for a ungodly amount of years.

Honestly, lately it’s been feeling like living is for the rich and anyone else just needs to get by and suffer.
Is money and work all we’re living for?
It is even possible to NOT take part in this goddamn monopoly game without suffering?

515,"Please before you be judgemental, read till the end.

I believe I am a good friend. Never had I betrayed my friends trust and had been always loyal to them. Always there when someone wants to talk or needs a service from me. Always answering their texts/calls and ready to talk. In fact, I have friendships that lasted more than 10 years, 8 years, 6 years etc. Some of them are lasting since elementary and middle school till now. When I started college in another country, I started having real bad social anxiety and this extremely affected my social life. I am now a Junior and friends I made here throughout all the three years can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Anyway, this is not the topic I will get to the point now.

This might be an unpopular opinion, but I am planning to give up on all the long lasting friendships I made simply because I do not see that my friends have changed in any way, I do not see any improvements in the way they think or live their lives. They are still believing in some cultural bullshit that they had been fed for years from their surroundings, they do not search or seek knowledge, and they're just conforming to social standards, I feel like they are just living and relying on the time to make their lives better for them. Moreover, when I start a conversation with one of them it always comes to the same topic and we would start talking about some bullshit and after hours of talking I will find myself left only with ""Junk information"", nothing is added to my brain not even a single idea. Basically not constructive discussions at all. Just to stress it here, **I do not feel superior at all and I never made them feel that they are not improving or whatever**. I would give advice and make subtle comments about bad things they do without making them feel bad or lower they self-esteem.

Why this bothers me is the question. I am 21 years old and I want to improve, make connections with people who have shit to talk about, discuss real life matters, have deep conversations with them, sit in a mannered way and make serious eye contacts when talking about an important topic. Not having a friend who would jump out of nowhere and says a joke that is not even funny and not even furthering the conversation. I will say it clearly here, I am ashamed to even introduce all my male friends to my parents or the few people I made friendship with in the foreign country. This starts to heavily make me feel alone and I do not know if you got the picture of all what I said, but it just sucks... most of the time.

Please do not be judgemental. I am not a bad person, I am in a period of my life where I have to destroy all bases I had since childhood and have to start making real changes, simply because they are not bringing me any good. What should I do? Should I just keep being the good friend and try to enjoy those junk conversations and forget about it? Maybe make new friends that fit with my personality while still being in contact with the others? What will be the good thing to do here?

Edit: I thought about this many times since the beginning of this years. But I always find it hard to come up with a conclusion. Also, I never discussed this with my other friends, because I do not know what people will think of me.",29Jul2020,1

517,"Some background information:  My 2 cats have been staying with my mother for the past few months due to me moving and covid keeping us separated. Last week I finally  got them back and everything has been perfect... with one of them. 

Onto the issue: My older female cat has been completely fine and has had no problems since the move. My younger male cat has done the opposite. He has been urinating throughout the house, on any cords/cables on the floor, any shoes that aren't being put away, on the bookcase etc and yowling randomly during the night.

He has used the litter box, and I am keeping it as clean as possible when I am home, so I don't think that is the issue.

523,"So I’ve had my cat for about 5-6 years now and she’s always had stomach problems. Her name is luna and she’s the goofiest little thing- when we go on walks she’ll follow us without fail to the ends of the earth (don’t worry! We keep her safe and pick her up if crossing roads + she’s an outdoor cat so she’s used to the outside). I dislike getting cats that are pedigree as the animals generally have bad genetics (due to inbreeding) so end up very sick. So i tried to combat this by getting a mix (she’s a ragdoll x maine coon)- keep in mind though that I was pretty young so I didn’t understand that this would not fix the problems of hundreds of generations of inbreeding. Anyway.

When we (my family and I) first got her the seller told us she was normal and healthy, was vaccinated etc etc but every time we fed her she would turbo-eat and vomit either immediately or up to 1 hour afterwards. We’ve tried many various methods to combat this, but the best so far has been to give her small portions of wet/dry food and then make her eat slowly by placing a hand over the food bowl so she’s forced to stop and swallow. 

This worked at first but now even though we use this method she’s continuing to vomit. It’s a really sad situation because the poor cat is suffering with stomach pain and not being able to keep down a meal, and obviously we’re suffering too- finding your duvet covered in cat vomit when you’re just about to go to sleep isn’t the best surprise! The vomiting has gotten more frequent now and her behaviour has changed- she’s usually happy to sit/sleep next to my sister and is really quite energetic/playful most of the time, but lately she’s turned very anxious and flighty, is constantly laying down, meowing at any slight petting etc. To be clear- she’s always been a little bit of an anxious and shy cat, but its become really noticeable now.

Before we take Luna to a vet, I want to try some alternative methods that could soothe her stomach or help her vomit less. The vets where I live are ridiculously expensive and it’s more of a last resort option. So if anyone knows anything about cats, stomach pain, and ways to help, please let me know. She’s a massive part of our family (we love her to bits) and we don’t want her to suffer needlessly. Thanks for reading.

tl;dr   my cat has stomach problems (most likely painful for her)and eats too quickly which causes her to vomit, if you know any methods to help soothe stomach pain/stop vomiting for cats please let me know! Taking her to the vet is a last resort option if the other methods don’t work.",29Jul2020,1
524,"Hi, I’m 16 and currently own a 64GB iPhone 6s. I’ve had it for about 4-5 years already. It works fine and all and I don’t use it for much other than occasionally texting, taking photos or surfing. I have around like just 30 apps on my phone. However, the storage’s gotten full a couple of times alr and a few days ago after I deleted a lot of photos from my gallery, I freed up around 10-15GB so that’s alright for now.

However, I feel that it does get laggy occasionally, and despite replacing the battery, the battery life is quite terrible. And I really ought to be honest: I feel left out being the only one, or one of the only few who own such an outdated model in my school. An unfortunate case of slavery to consumerism but that’s what it is. Everyone owns an iPhone 8 Plus (at the minimum) and most have an iPhone X or a variant. 

Anyway, I thought I would want an upgrade to perhaps iPhone X (or XR/XS?) or better still 11 for my upcoming birthday. I think my parents would be willing to pay up to $400-500ish so 11 is out of the picture. 

What are the pros and cons of upgrading? And which phone should I upgrade to, if I should upgrade at all?

Using my meme account for this for some anonymity but it’s just getting ridiculous at this point. Not trying to elicit pity, just need some genuine advice. The situation: All my grandparents are dead (one before I was born, cancer at 11, cancer at 12, cancer at 13,) my dad died when I was 15 (heart attack,) and one of my best friends just died from a car accident now at 17. I’d consider myself pretty desensitized from most emotions so sadness or depression has pretty much been milked out to feeling nothing at all, but I just feel like trash all the time. I’ve grown to become very pessimistic and nothing seems to really make me happy unless I’m fucking hammered or high as shit. It’s affecting my work and it’s hard to take anything serious. Desensitization is arguably the more serious issue to me. Numbers and words are hard to take serious and have no meaning. No empathy. I can make $10 in a day or $500 and I feel no different at all. Landed a big project that was a huge financial booster and I did not care. Lost a shit ton of money gambling and did not care. On the other side, any words of positivity or negativity mean nothing.

So a couple of days ago I accidentally swore in my room, my mum heard it and decided to revoke my console as punishment. That's fine, harsh, but fine. I moved on and did other stuff for the day like play on my 3ds and switch, play guitar, or just watch youtube

The next day I asked for my controllers back, she said in order to get them I have to make her breakfast. Bit weird and slightly mean but it's fine, I make her breakfast and move on.  


Now last night she came in and suddenly took my controllers from me mid-game. I'm a bit huffy but I give them up and turn the Xbox off and I go do other things like scroll through my phone till I pass out.

Now this morning I asked for my controllers again and she once again replies with, make me breakfast and I'll give them to you. I do it but I also remind her that if she wants me to make breakfast she should just ask. When I bring her breakfast she asks where are the sausages. I feel a bit annoyed because last time I made her breakfast she specifically asked for bacon, eggs, and toast with a cup of milky tea. That's exactly what I made her.  


I asked why she took them and she said that it was to help me sleep. Which is stupid, I take sleeping pills for my bad sleep (I have a really bad anxiety disorder and that can stop me from sleeping. Also suspected ADHD, I'm often hyper throughout the night and if I don't do something that takes a lot of brainpower I don't fall asleep). I find this fishy as hell, if she truly wanted to help me sleep she would have taken all my devices, she knows I take sleeping pills and she knows what helps me sleep and what doesn't. Forcing me to sleep ends up making it worse because now I'm forced to do it and it puts a lot of pressure on me.  


At the back of my mind, I feel like she's doing this for favors. She wants me to make her breakfast which is fine, usually, I cook breakfast for her if I'm already cooking and she asks for it. However lately I stopped eating breakfast and now she has no one to make her breakfast. So now she takes away something of mine so she can get what she wants.

I've done my crying. The person has profusely and sincerely apologized. So I want to be rid of it, I just can't seem to shake it. It's almost like an intrusive thought at this point where I'll be having a normal day at work and I'll just hear the awful words and I have to pretend to be fine.

I(F22) am currently four weeks late for my usually fairly regular period, I have taken two tests four days apart this week and both were negative. I am so scared and stressed. 

I have a total of three weeks left of my degree (which has been incredibly impacted by Covid) and am constantly feeling so stressed I feel ill.

I am so focused on how much I have going on it is starting to impact my relationship, and my poor boyfriend (who lives about 4 hours away) is feeling helpless.

I am going to the doctors tomorrow to talk about all of this, but has anyone ever had anything similar? I know stress can stop periods but it's not like I am getting any less stressed with it not showing up!

544,"I play a game, ark survival evolved. I’m in a pvp server with two of my friends, let’s call them John and Corb. Now before starting this server John and Corb already we’re assholes and disrespected me constantly. Ex. Corb would find things I didn’t like and in courage John to exploit them, Not to mention the fact that they’re both sexist assholes (btw im f13). I have known both of them irl for years and we’re even in the same grade. Now if you have played any pvp on any game you should know what “Blue Tagging” or getting “insided” means. Lemme break it down for you real quick, we have alpha tribe (top tribe on the server) VG who are super chill and we were verbally allied with. You have the Beta tribe (second strongest) who we’ll call Juliet, now John in the game chat would every so often run his mouth by claiming we were beta and could take everyone down (The complete opposite, we were strong but not that strong) now Juliet was told about this and got angry. She was told that John was the one claiming that my tribe, our tribe was beta. She joined the party (Xbox) he was in (we weren’t on yet) and proceeded to pin it on me, not wanting to have Juliet mad at him. Now during the time of all this, we were merging with another tribe we trusted, Wyvern Co. They didn’t want to do the merge (John and Corb). Now before I go any further I want to say this is when they were talking to Juliet and giving details and coordinates to our base so they could grab all of our stuff and run, then have it wiped. Of course we didn’t know this so I negotiated the out with them and they agreed, now in ark when you merge tribes, the person who invites you to the merge now has all of your stuff in their name, which means if you leave you don’t get your stuff (this will be important). Now behind our backs John and Corb decided to sabotage the raid we were getting ready to do (I spent about 50-60 hours on the base) then after they sabotaged it I kicked them from the tribe (minutes before we merged with Wyvern Co.) and merged, now that they had some of the loot they proceeded to go to Juliet and get her and all the tribes below us to raid me, I had back-up but not really much you can do when there’s 15 people attacking at once. Then Juliet proceeded to invite the leader of Wyvern Co. to a party (we’ll call him Dave) Dave joins the party and Juliet explains that in order to not have his own base raided he would have to kick me off the tribe, essentially putting me back at square one. At this point she was almost through to our base. Dave agreed to this deal without consulting his tribe mates, or me. He did not talk to anyone. Keep in mind that I had some of the best loot on that server. After he kicked me he told both my friends/tribe mates to cut contact and to not talk to me. One of them did the other didn’t. I feel betrayed completely, people I trusted and knew very well turned on me just because they didn’t like that I was talking with other people and joining other people, I am completely a person that takes a lot of things seriously, that includes games, so at this point I am extremely pissed of, and hurt. I have absolutely no clue what to do, apart from cut ties with both John and Corb. Any advice?

I have tried to explain this to Juliet, to no avail, she believes John bc she doesn’t know him, he is extremely dishonest, untrustworthy, and just an overall asshole (he’s the type of guy to date a girl to get nudes then break up with her)
Corb isn’t bad when it’s just me and him, but as soon as John joins in its absolute hell, non-stop degrading comments from both of them when I do something they don’t thing is right, or smart. They try to annoy me bc it’s funny to them. Now a lot of you if not all are asking “Why the hell are you friends with them in the first place?” It’s bc I am a very social person when it comes to online and games, they are my only friends and I don’t want to lose them but I’m also tired of the daily shit coming out of their mouth for the last 2 and a half 3 years. That’s all, for now at least. Thanks, F9 Focus on Xbox 


To give you an idea I spent about 175-200 hours in game, 150 of them with Corb and John.

here is my problem,  it's not a problem you people should put over other people's problems but I just want some advice on what to do

my connection with my family is basically non existent apart from paying for my school fees (high schooler) and having food on the plate for meals,  which is fine,  but they choose to ignore me and distance themselves from me so I feel quite lonely at home, ( due to a fight we had a while ago over stupid reasons).  This goes from my dad ignoring me for 6 months ( no contact whatsoever,  no talking,  not even eye contact with me, and is still going on to this day) and my mother creating arguments with me over small reasons to the point where she can be screaming at the top of her lungs calling me ridiculous names and to the point where I just feel so defeated, like we could fight for an hour over literally not going to school because I was sick,  and she thought I was lying ( this was this morning, and coughing,  fever like temperatures and vomiting means that I'm perfectly fine to go to school)  I know this sounds like ""oh it's an every house hold problem"" but I don't think that choosing to directly ignore your child and to scream and put me in a position of just emotional turmoil is I dunno. it just I feel so lonely and I got off topic sorry. 


basically I have friends at school that I regularly chat and laugh and generally do friend things with, through discord,  while playing a game called league of legends. This is through my laptop, if you can even call it that (had it for 6 years) has just died on me,  and will not open. 

oh I can talk to them through text messages and calls right?
they will probably not respond until 11pm-1am due to them playing games and voice chatting. 7 hours a day, 28 for weekends and that's 63 hours of alone time. 

oh make new friends? nope. basically that's literally everyone I know. I have 120 friends that I know on leauge, (my friends from school,  their friends,  etc,  varying from schools and grades) and it's basically a huge deal within my friend group,  so..  dunno. loosing the ability to do that, even to talk with them while their playing the game is just. I don't want that to happen and yet it did and and with the loss of having a device to play on is just.  I feel so alone 

I'm just fucking lonely. is what I wanted to say. lonely at home,  I go out regularly after school with friends and a lot of people know me at school and I can make conversation at school with anyone in my year. 

I'm just fucking lonely at home for 63 hours a week. 
my own family won't talk to me and chooses to go out of their way to ignore me. 
I'm just lost. 

oh just choose a hobby to do,  learn about yourself and do new things hooray. that was my life throughout primary school. I endured that feeling while everyone had social media and access to socialise after school I was alone in my room hitting a ball against the wall for hours,  only for my parents to yell at me for as the wall would crack and the paint will fall off. our house is double brick layers. it is also a relatively new house. sorry off topic again.  

let's just say,  I was the lonely kid in primary,  due to lack of the chances of social exchange after school. Then I could at least ask if they wanted to come over and do something with me, I don't even have that chance anymore,  I don't even get to meet up with someone as I live an hour away from my school 

sports and run around! it's quarantine. 

read books study! 
I have friends who are horribly depressed and have to sometimes call them to make sure their okay as their parents only allow them to study and nothing else,  they too also feel lonely,  and do not have opportunities to socialise with friends after school and they too,  feel fucking lonely after school and at home.

548,"I have a few different things I am looking for advice on. I have been stuck with my ex for seven months now. He was supposed to be out in March, but spent his money on drugs, electronics and who knows what else. 

Oftentimes, he is not able to pay me his portion of the rent and utilities. He owes me about 2-3 months of rent so far. He showed me that he will pay his other bills and then spend the remainder of $900 or so on luxury items instead of rent. He uses far more electricity and cooling than me.

I like my apartment. It's close to a lot of things, more affordable, and in a quiet neighborhood (my last apartment was so much more dangerous). My lease is expiring in November and I went to see if I could get another apartment in the same complex and not renew to escape him, but for the same apartment model, but older, it is $100 more just for the apartment (not including even water, sewage, trash in that) and I don't think I will qualify. I have too much stuff for a 1bd and wanted an office, so I am looking at a 2bd.

I have a new job starting soon that makes more, but it is in a new field and I don't yet know how I will do at the job yet, so I don't want to overextend myself. My fear is that if I renew here and do manage to get him off the lease that he will just stay here and I'll have to go to court to evict him.

549,"So, my bestfriend joined the same Junior college as me and I was THE HAPPIEST. But things didn't go the way I thought it would, Z befriended another girl who was also in our school previously. I didn't have any problem at first, I was okay with that girl as well but Z started changing. They both started hanging out alot more, leaving me behind. Z got a boyfriend and started hiding things from me but she would tell everything to the other girl. Eventually I started feeling unwanted there with them, I remember watching their stories of hanging out with each other and feeling lonely.

Anyway, I started distancing myself from them because of my mental peace and Z didn't even tried to contact me. 
After 3 months, she came to my house and started crying and confessed how her boyfriend tried to control her and told her to stop being my friend because ""I was a bad influence"" ( I'm a mom type and I try to stop my friends from doing something stupid) I anyway believed her and we were back with our friendship, she said that she was done and would break up with her boyfriend which was totally her choice, I had no idea why her bf hated me so much but I didn't care, I had my bestfriend back and I was happy.

But soon after some days I got to know that she is still with her boyfriend plus she lost her virginity to him, which I know is not a big deal but I shared each and everything with her and I expected the same from her, that's how our friendship was from the last 7 years.
I confronted her about her hiding things from me, I was expecting an explanation but she started behaving rude and told me that she thought I would judge her? I questioned her how she was comfortable with fucking around guys but not telling her bestfriend of 7 years and she said that I was slut shaming her now. I was angry so I told that not to contact me ever again as she left me alone when I needed her previously and now she was lying and being rude.

But soon I realized that what I actually said was wrong and tried to contact her but she had blocked me everywhere. It has been a month. Now I got to know through a friend that her brother, mom and grandmother are suffering from covid 19 and are currently in the hospital. I felt very bad and called her but yh I am blocked. I asked about her to her friend and she said Z is doing fine.

555,"\[TRIGGER WARNING: EATING DISORDERS\] Hello Reddit. I'm worried sick about my best friend. She's not doing well, and I can tell she's not doing well. In October 2019, she confessed to me that she was on the verge of an eating disorder, she told me that she vomits her food. She told me she does it very, very rarely (like once every two months) but that it was much more often last year. It breaks my heart that she has been hurting herself like this. I made her promise that she'd never do it again, but ever since october 2019 she has never said a word to me about it ever again. It's almost been a year time, and because we don't live close and only speak online, I have no IDEA if she still does this. And it frightens me to have absolutely zero control, being unable to help, and just - not knowing. I haven't asked about it because she never talks about it and I wouldn't want to trigger her or throw her back into a bad place, if she quit doing this. That's the thing exactly, I don't know if she has quit or not, and I don't know if I should ask. Because on one side, I'm like ""she'll tell me when she feels ready for it"", and on the other side it kills me to not know, and I'm sick worried. 

She came to visit me for 2 weeks during this summer vacation and ate normally, didn't restrict but I also had control over what we/she ate because she was at my house. The thing is, once she's away and on her own, I have no idea what she eats and if she still does harmful things, as she never talks to me about all that. So I'm scared shitless to let her go, because I'm scared that once she's alone, she'll quit taking care of her absolutely amazing, beautiful and kind self. I wish I could find a way to always be there with her, to live with her. This is impossible because we study/live in two different countries. 

Which brings me to my next point I am somewhat desperately seeking advice for: I feel like my well being depends on her well being. She's been sad lately, and has been posting a lot to her private account, saying  things like ""the only passions in life right now are distractions. everything in my life is pretty chill at the moment and yet I feel the need to completely dissociate and forget the entire day. I got high marks at uni, I aced my \[extracuricular activity she loves\] studies, I'm seeing my favorite person TOMORROW, and yet I feel so sad and tired."" 

I can't be okay when I know she's not. This gets to the point of not being able to get off my phone until I finally get a reply from her. I hate the fact that all I can do is offer puny words of affirmation, which don't do shit. She needs help, and I wish I could give it to her. I can't, all I can do is read her posts, text her how much I love her and try to help like this, and then cry. I don't care about my hobbies, about my studies, about anything, when I know she's not doing well. I feel like I'm starting to depend on her well being. I wish she was okay. I worry so much about her, and can't be okay if she's not. I have neglected the other people in my life because I've been so focused on her well being, and seeing all of her sad posts make me cry every time and all i feel like doing is lay in bed.

So conclusion: question 1) Do I ask her about her eating disorder, even though she hasn't spoken to me about it for a year, or do I wait for her to tell me herself at some point? 

question 2) How can I find my own happiness and still concentrate on other things/people I love when I know she's not doing well? I can't be happy if she's not. 

Thank you so much if you've read all of this. Peace.",29Jul2020,1

my mum is planning to leave my dad once my younger sister 11.5 is 18. my dad can also be unpredictable and shout at you for no reason. but he can also be a very nice person as well but with that i also get scared when he gets too happy because i know he is going to get really angry for no reason. also i am surprised my mum is going to try and stay this long. and my dad is also the reason why i am doing my A levels and at 18 joining the RAF and moving out but i did sort of want to join anyway.

The part i need help with:

so the people in the storey are my mum, my dad and me(15f and bisexual) possibly my brother and sister but i have no clue if i will mention them too much.

the reason why my mum is planning on splitting up once my sister is 18 and not sooner is so that my sister can have her mum and dad together whilst she is a child. whenever my parents ""argue"" or my dad shouts at my mum for half an hour they almost always do it in the kitchen (under my room) or in their room (next to my room) so i can normally hear everything so i normally just put my music on loud or if it lasts longer than i can cope with  i go into town and have a bit of kfc or i look around a shop. the problem i have is that my sister and dad dont know which is understandable. but i have started to think about this almost daily and it has started to have a negative effect on my mental health about 1 or 2 months ago. then a month ago i came out as bisexual to my parents and they both said they where fin e with it and my mum seems fine but my dad hasnt been quite the same towards me ever since. i havent mentioned this to him because i dont want my dad to get annoyed at me or for an argument to start. this has also not helped with my mental health either. my mental health hasnt been that ""stable"" for the past 4 years but normally i can cope but i have also had times over the 4 years i have had a few mental breakdowns but enough that my dad hasn't seen. the biggest problem with my mental health is that my dads opinion is that ""mental health isn't real and it is just a lie that people tell to get attention"". my mum knows so she helps me but small things that my dad does starts me off but i dont tell him because i dont want him to get annoyed. at the minnute i have no clue what to do because i cant see my friends easily or give them a hug. i really needed to talk to someone and get advise but i have no clue what to do. this is also a throwaway account so if any of my family sees this then they wont realise its me hopefully.",29Jul2020,1

It's full of stuff to learn in your lifetime, it's frustrating and I don't like it. I have a background of programming a little bit for example creating programs for myself to make my life easier or to learn new things. I created graphical user interface program that allows me to download music from YouTube and convert the downloaded format to mp3 and my next plan is to create a bank project with real database behind it to learn a little bit about database and how to interact with it. Then a next project would be a client-server that allows client to connect to the server and talk to other users aka (Chatbox project). I never learned programming basics. I just jumped in to it and started writing code and Google what I needed. Aside my plans I don't know what to do. Im planning to apply for jobs outside my field where companies are willing to train you to do the job but the probability of me getting the job is low because there might be other candidates who know more than me which means they rather take the one who knows more than me because it will cost less for them for example less time used on training me, etc..

That 1/10 is newest to the team and has explicitly said they are not likely to eat anything on the menu at the one or two places that has been suggested. Called themselves a picky eater and gave an example as to what they like (some place that has a schnitzel... )

They have said NO to an Italian menu. Which has pasta and pizza on the menu. And NO to fusion Asian eatery. Also not keen on middle Eastern.

We are at a bit of a loss. her tastes are very.. safe. Everyone else is in the mind of going somewhere fancy and funky esp if we are not paying for it. 

Do we scourge the whole city for a place that can accommodate our big group, has fun and exciting food AND caters to her very small and specific food preferences (she does not have an allergy. Just picky. Her words) ? Or should majority rule?

568,"My partner and I would like your opinions please!

My partner (33M) and I (30F) have been together for 3 years. We have a beautiful LO (&lt;1yo).

I had/have a friend (30M) 'ABC'. We slept together at the age of 18, we didnt ""work out"" as a ""couple"", and we decided we were better as friends. We were best friends for over a decade, each of us going in and out of our own relationships, never sleeping together ever again.

I havent seen him in a few years and we have gone our separate ways.

My partner had to go somewhere, that somewhere being where ABC works. I casually said, 'oh, if you see ABC, can you say hi for me"". But he refused because he is not speaking to someone I have had ""sexual relations"" with. I understand where he is coming from, but it isn't like ABC was an ex BF, he was a dear friend to me, that as teenagers we made a stupid mistake to sleep with each other (as teenagers do).

Like I said above, we havent seen each other in a few years. I have never thought of ABC as being in the 'ex category', but my partner said that he is and that it is weird and wrong for me to say hi to him/talk to him/get him to say hi for me. (Partner brought up if I was to see him, in say, a shopping centre, I am to ignore him or just say hi and walk away), which I don't understand, because we had a decade of friendship. I understand where my partner is coming from, especially in regards to actual ex's, but ABC isnt an ex.

Am I in the wrong?? Are people unable to be civil to others regardless of a 'past'?

I hate it, and it's starting to take a toll on my relationships; including my relationship with my partner who I live with. I got myself back into therapy recently but I haven't talked to my therapist about this yet, I plan on doing it at my session tomorrow. 

I'm never like this...but it's been getting worse in the past several weeks and now it's making me depressed. Whenever I feel depressed, I feel more angry. When I feel angry and lash out like I have been, I get more depressed afterwards. It's starting to become a vicious cycle, and I don't know what to do.

570,"Last night I had some fun with my grandpas and their friends... I stayed up until midnight, although I've told myself that I need to sleep before 10 pm in order to wake up at 6 and study for university. 

Because I didn't sleep early last night, I woke up late. After that happened I locked into the mindset: This day is gone... Screw it even more as much as you can, watch youtube and procrastinate all day long...It's lost anyway. 

I woke up at 8:30, which is not that bad ( I recently tried to fix my sleep cycle and as it seems that helped me wake up earlier naturally) and now it is 3:30 p.m and I still haven't managed to open a single book. I just can't do it. My mind forbids me from doing it.

I face this problem a lot and I don't wanna depend on whether I ""feel like it"" or not in order to study. 

Also, I don't want small and not so important things to be a large factor about how I progress in life, in general. When I scratched my guitar just a little bit or my laptop, I said to myself: ""Oh great, now it's useless"".

How can I escape this mindset? Maybe it's because I overthink in general? Maybe I'm just lazy or not smart enough and all of this is just an excuse? 

The only thing that helps me is taking a shower. It ""resets"" my mind and makes me feel like making a new start. However, I won't be able to just ""take a bath"" anywhere I am. I don't wanna depend on that to feel fresh.

I am currently creating a free mobile app on productivity (especially for those who struggle to focus for long periods of time) and I'm looking for a way to promote it. 

It includes three main functionalities - music for focus, meditation (proven to increase cognitive abilities; can motivate &amp; inspire you, or help you get calm) and breathing exercises (lowering stress &amp; anxiety levels in stressful moments like before exams or job interviews)

so my situation is this: I finished my Bachelor's programme in Middle Eastern Studies (yeah, I've accomplished something in life) and enrolled in a Master's programme in Economics and Political Economics. I'm now at the end of my second semester, but so far, I didn't take any exams or write any assignments. In my first semester, I was under a lot of pressure due to problems in my relationship and financial struggles, and in my second semester, I started taking some classes, but didn't finish them. I was supposed to write an essay and hold a presentation about it before, but I just couldn't. I felt and still feel the anxiety to even pick it up. It's like I become paralysed the moment I think about it.

575,"so, let me give some back story:
in january of 2018, my mum promised me a gaming pc, which would have been bought around valentines day. the pc was never purchased and instead my mum allowed me to occasionally use her pc for gaming from 2018 - about a month ago.

about a week ago, my mum said that she entered a sculpting competition (as she is a sculptor) and has a high chance of winning; the amount of money i will not be disclosing as it doesn't effect the story. with this news, my mum gave me a budget for everything the pc will require (keyboard, mouse, pc itself, etc) and i've ended up spending half of my budget.

however, my family's financial situation is uncertain as my mum has stopped taking overtime to focus this time on sculpting and family time, which has left us with less money to spend.

with this in mind, i'm hesitant to spend the extra money on a desk/chair (both of which are cheap, used and are from gumtree, an australian website for buying a variety of used/new stuff) when i already have a desk and a chair in my room, which i could use. 

however my mum doesn't agree with putting it in my room because she sees my room as a place for study rather than gaming (which is a very valid point) and said that she doesn't want me to sit in my room all day on the computer, which is why she wants me to put it in my dad's room, which she feels would bring him and i together more even though it's not necessary; my dad and i eat breakfast and lunch together in his room and play games together on his pc, but i can see what she means where i'd be in my room all day.

however my dad disagrees and says that it's my pc and it should be in my room, both for privacy and simple convenience.

i definitely like dad's idea, as i feel it's more appropriate to keep something like a pc in my room, especially when i already put my phone and laptop in his room to charge overnight as my mum fears that i'll stay up on my electronics.

another issue is that, as the pc, desk and chair are all on gumtree, the pc and the chair are all in different locations, meaning my mum would have to drive around all day, and even then, i'm unsure of whether she'd be able to carry the pc, desk and chair in the car (we have a four-seater toyota with an average trunk)

the final issue with this is that for us to fit the pc into dad's room, we'd have to move the couch that my dad has in his room to make space for it, which would be tedious because we can't move it through the hallway, and instead have to take it out through the window, which means we'd have to take out the mesh (that keeps bugs out), put the couch through the window, clean the mesh because it's dirty atm, and then put the mesh back on, which is really hard to do, and then close up the window, and even then getting rid of the couch after it's outside our house would be hard because the couch has some rips/tears, particularly on the side.

overall, i feel like it is far more convenient to keep the couch in my dad's room as it is very easy for us to gather in his room to watch movies/shows like frasier and becker (which we do almost daily), especially since i could study in the dining room table (it's as big as the desk in my room. even then, i can always study in my dad's room with him, which is what i currently do because of corona (it's really bad in my state, almost 500 cases)

i'm hesitant to bring this up with her because i love her a lot and i don't want to upset her. i want to reach a middle ground where everyone's happy but i really want my pc to be in my room.",29Jul2020,1
576,"15 f, sorry for formatting im on mobile, also, currently in the previously mentioned back pain so its a bit distracting

so i have health issues, my knees dislocated 4 times in the past 2 years, im hyperflexible, i had a patellar realignment surgery in febuary, ideopathic toe walking, not to mention my mental health issues :(. so its been kinda a lot. after my surgery my surgeon had me referred to a neurologist. some testing and a spinal MRI later, they *think* i *might* have a tethered spinal cord, theres signs that point to it and signs that its all normal, and at the time i didnt havesome of the other symptoms so they said come back if i did.

lo and behold, more symptoms. and my back pain has gotten so, so so much worse. im crying just thinking about how bad it is. i work in my dads restaurant and all i ahve to do is take frozen frnech fries, weigh them to 5oz, put them in 5oz bags, put the bags in metal trays and into the freezer. It takes me an infredibly long time and i still havent been able to finish an entire case. why does it take so long? my horrible, awful back pain.

Its agony. ive been in a lot of physical pain in my life due to the previously msntioned health issues, snd this is *agony*. Its horrible, it makes me feel queasy. i can stand for 5 min with no pain. 10, sore but if i distract myself its fine. anything after that it just worsens. the longest ive been able to go without a break is 30 fucking miniutes and i immediately went and sobbed in the bathroom because of how much my back hurt. 

my dad thinks its because ididnt do physical yherapy after surgery. my *knee* surgery. on my knee. not my back, like, at all. my sister agrees but she always agrees with him

my therapist thinks its because i dont exercise enough. she tells me to take walks and yeah, would if i could! im already using a cane, i dont like walking more them i have to and i just dont like walking period

i dont know what to do. my dad finally made a doctors appt for me but he fucking forgot about it whenni asked him a month ago so its in august now. i dont know how to manage until then. it all hurts so bad and nobody believes me

ironically, my mom believes me, but she (custody reasons) has zero control over any of my medical care so she cant help me. 

i just want to stop being in pain. I’m 15, i should be able to stand upright in place for 10 fucking minutes. This is way too young to have this kind of pain and have it only be because im not exercising. any advice is appreciated",29Jul2020,1
577,"I'm almost done co-oping at a company this Summer and during this entire time I've been quite disappointing with a lot of aspects around this temporary job I found. The work they've been giving me is that of the surrounding stigma of a co-op, basically writing papers and fetching parts and setting up tests for other engineers without doing any of the actual engineering work. This has also upset me quite a bit and I plan to speak to my manager about this later but there is a bigger issue I'm struggling with. Besides the work the stigma of a co-op is also expressed verbally mainly by poking fun at us or cracking jokes which isn't all too bad honestly, I can take jokes. 

I'm having an issue with the president of the company, aka my boss boss. I'm not sure where it went downhill or even why, but he'd make very condescending comments to me while I was working on different projects or just even working alone on something. For example, I left a part of a project I was working on on a desk bench by accident, he comes over to my tiny cubicle and asks me if my car was unlocked. I said ""Uh no why?"" and he responded by saying ""Here, put this in your car and take it home to your mother because I don't clean up after you, please clean up around here"". I was astounded by the amount of pettiness he went through to basically tell me to not forget my stuff. 

Another example, which was even worse, was when I went to use a piece of equipment nobody was using on one of the benches. I was going to use it when he sat down behind me at another bench and asked if I was using it. Of course I wasn't right at that moment, I said ""No not quite now"" and he then said abruptly that he wanted it back. And I said ""Okay"" and unplugged the equipment and set it on his desk, and while sitting he said to me ""I expect that you plug it in and turn it on for me"", I said ""Okay"". He then says this ""You make it seem like I'm supposed to be working for you whereas you're supposed to be working for me, you'd think you'd help out your boss huh?"".

That's where I got really upset and didn't respond, I basically said sorry under my breath as to keep myself from saying anything stupid, but I was very upset and honestly just disappointed that this is how my Summer co-op went. 

I will have a review meeting with my manager soon along with, get this, the boss's daughter who's an engineer as well. I'm wondering if I should just bite my tongue and not say anything about my boss and the work I received or if I should say something about my experience.

I've lived in my flat for nearly 2 years. I have neighbours attached to every wall in my building (Upstairs + downstairs, Left + Right). Fortunately, everyone besides my upstairs neighbour is decent. We've all interacted with each other so I know they're friendly people.

However my upstairs neighbour is a pain.

I've tapped the ceiling many many times. I've knocked on his door and asked him to turn  his music down but to my dismay he started threatening to beat me up. The police have arrested him several times for antisocial behaviour and domestic violence. I have also contacted my landlord with audio and video recordings (to prove where the loud disturbances are coming from) and they said they would ring him but nothing's changed.

I had a cat, Stella, that was 17 years old that had to be put down last September. I've had her all her life, she was important to me and it was very traumatic. We went to the veterinarian after she had a seizure. 

The veterinarian did her absolute best trying to come up with other solutions but me and my partner already knew as soon as she said that Stella would need daily pills and regular vet visits that it would be selfish of us to try and keep her alive(I tried to deworm her once and even that was a struggle and stressed her out immensely). At this point, the veterinarian hadn't even found the cause of the seizure, only some other underlying issues. Basically, the veterinarian did nothing wrong and handled it as well as I can imagine an imperfect human would but it was still quite traumatic and I feel immense guilt for not trying harder to keep her alive or realising something was wrong with her earlier.

I have two other cats who have been to this veterinarian every other time they've needed seeing to and checkups and it feels selfish to change just because of my feelings but I can't imagine going back there yet.

She is the middle child and I feel she is a bit overlooked by her parents and interchangeable with her elder sister while she has her own personality. As a godparent, I feel I should create a special bond with her.

I have two problems to take into account which makes the choice of the gift difficult for me:

\-Due to my work, I am often (if not always) out of the country and so I am not physically present.

\-Her parents are not really great at following-up on gifts/cards/phone calls I may send. Basically, I have 0 feedback on what she may like or not. For example, I subscribed to a children's magazine and to monthly crafting kits for a duration of a 1 year and it took me several phone calls to know 1) if they had actually received it and if 2) my goddaugher liked it or not. My last idea was to put up a special saving account for my goddaughter where I put monthly a fixed sum so she could have a comfortable sum when she turns 18, but my sister was pretty dismissive of the idea.

594,"I say I don't want kids she replies with ""You're just pretending, of course you want them"". Someone talks about marriage so I say that I'd like to get married in a black dress and she freaks out ""Stop saying that, that's ridiculous!""
I want to travel the world and she goes ""If I were your mother you wouldn't travel anywhere."" 

It may seem like that she hates me but she is always demanding my attention and complaining we're not close like her sister and her granddaughter - I told her three personal things on separate occasions and she told everyone on the family, I actually got bullied in school for it some years ago. The other two things I made sure to tell her it'd be best to remain just between us and what did she do? Told everyone again. I'm not extraverted as I was as a child and as she wants me to be again. I tell her ""this is my personality"" and she refuses to believe it. I should talk more, tell her everything. 

 She can't be alone, always involved in some family drama and presenting herself as the victim. 

I tell her no, she asks a thousand times more to make me change my mind. She doesn't accept boundaries - I tell her I don't want to take pictures but she still takes them. I tell her I don't like to be touched and she always touches me. My mom says she can only see what's in front of her but never defends me from her. 

I want to understand her motivations but I also want to assert myself - I was taught to always be polite and sometimes it's hard to be anything other than that.",29Jul2020,1
595,"So problem #1;
Two days ago I found out that the $300 order I placed on Ulta's app two weeks ago somehow was delivered to my address from four years ago. Never ordered through them before, and definitely would never put in that address for anything. I messaged them and they said unless the merchandise is returned to them, there is nothing they can do.
Problem #2;
I stupidly placed an order on Etsy at the beginning of the month(the 3rd to be exact) for what I thought was a believable price for two Nintendo Switches (one for my brother and one for a friend so that they could play with me) and I ended up being wrong. I thought I was in the clear though because I used PayPal. Wrong. Today they sent me an email stating my claim was denied because the seller provided tracking information. Said tracking information says that they were delivered on the 1st and the package weighed .5 lbs. If it was the real package it would have had to weighed at least 8 lbs let alone not have been able to be delivered before I even ordered it.

To top it all off, I lost my job last week. If anyone has any advice as to what else I could do to get even one of these two problems solved that would be tremendous(I have the job part under control, I hope). Or else I'll just be out $800  and I can't really afford that. I wouldn't care being out the money if I had gotten these things but not having any of it is kind of a punch in the gut.",29Jul2020,1

598,"A few months ago in March, we had a worldwide pandemic which we are still going through today. I (18F) was about to finish up my senior year in high school when they ordered us to stay home in quarentine. I was devastated because I also played a sport as well so I knew I wouldn’t have a spring season. While in quarentine some guy texts me on snap because I added him off of his brothers post  (which I didn’t know was his brother at the time) on his birthday (March 15) and he adds and texts me (March 17). He blatantly says his birthday was just that March 15 and that’s how he added me back. He creates conversation asking me to send him pictures of how I look, nothing crazy. He sends some back and he’s not appealing at all. Of course he gasses me up and says the utmost shit every other guy says to indeed get what he wants. He’s actually quite ugly but me, I’m always trying to see the good in people so I wanted to see his personality first. 

He asks for my number, he calls me and we just get to know each other better especially since we play the same sport, so he seemed very intrigued. He tries to ask my age, mind you I asked first and he wanted me to answer first so bad. So I did say my real age, 18. He immediately says 19 disregarding the fact that he already said he was a junior in college.... yet that didn’t strike my mind I was like maybe he graduated hs early.. lol so naive. The conversation of him having a girl came up and nothing was brought up about one. 

We talk about birthdays and he literally says his birthday is October 19 or 9 I don’t remember, yet how he added me back was from somebody POSTING HIM ON HIS BIRTHDAY MARCH 15. But you know me so damn gullible, I didn’t realize until after this situation. He says he wants to buy dinner during this pandemic so I’m thinking hey let me just go get free Wendy’s. I literally haven’t known the dude for more than 12 hours and I was already linking him. Risking my life for free food. I snuck out around 11 while every one was home, sleeping. I didn’t even know if this guy was a murderer, a weirdo, had COVID himself, whatever the case may be. The only smart thing I did was give him the address 2 blocks over instead of my real one. Wow. 

I get in his car and I’m nervous because I didn’t want him to take me out of town considering he lived 40 minutes out from me and he was currently on campus  housing still. Yet he still took me out of town. He creates convo per usual and eventually lets me play my music. Not even up to 20 minutes in the car he puts his hand on my thigh and begins squeezing it. This triggered me into silent mode as if I couldn’t even speak up for myself. This has never in my life happened to me, this whole situation, sneaking out, nothing so I was definitely scared af. I’m not an awkward person at all but I started acting very awkward. It’s like I couldn’t tell him to move and I wish my throat let me speak at the time. 

We got to the house he was staying at, immediately shoved me in his room I guess cuz other people were in the house and he didn’t want me to be seen. I’m scared shitless for my life knowing I’m not even supposed to be out and my mom is strict af. I had no intentions of having sex whatsoever. I really just wanted my free Wendy’s. 

He starts talking about his 4 skinny piece of shit medals on the wall along with this flanky piece of shit paper he got from his sport. He eventually asks for a real hug since I never gave him one and I begin stalling because I just knew the atmosphere was not right in there at all. So I ask about his DJ career which I guess he’s some fake DJ and he brings his whole stereo and speaker in his room and begins playing music so I guess other people in the house wouldn’t hear my voice. He then asks for a hug again and doesn’t give me a chance to respond, just pulls me in and hugs me, tight af. At this point he’s trying to kiss me and I’m honestly about to cry because I knew I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I’m the type of person, when I’m nervous, sad, awkward, scared shitless, I will start laughing hysterically and that’s exactly what I was doing. 

I ask to go to Wendy’s since he didn’t even take me. We went and I got nothing but a chocolate frosty because I didn’t even want to eat, I wanted to go home. 

We get back to his house and he does the same as before, shoves me in the house. I ask why he keeps doing that and he playfully says he’s just playing with me. He doesn’t even eat his food, yet comes on to me and I’m stiff af. I say I didn’t prepare for none of that stuff and he states he promises nothing will happen he just wants a kiss. He forces himself on to me and I’m so stiff and awkward. Eventually touching my body trying to massage me and what not. He starts taking off my hoodie and I keep saying please I didn’t come here for that I didn’t prepare for anything. He looks in my eyes and promises again that nothing will happen yet proceeds to take off my clothes. He eventually forces himself into me and I’m staring at the wall shedding tears. My voice just wasn’t working the way I wanted it to. I couldn’t scream, I couldn’t say more than “I didn’t come here for that” or “I didn’t prepare for this”. He literally just forces himself into me. 

After an hour of me laying there lifeless he says he wants to take me home. We stop at a gas station and I am emotionless. I don’t even feel anything and my vibe was off. He asks me what’s wrong smiling in my face knowing he got what he wanted. Even on the way dropping me off he still grabs my thigh and makes me uncomfortable but I didn’t have an energy to react anymore, I just felt lifeless. I never said yes to anything and tried many times to get out of that situation but he still forced his way into me. 
I get home and I immediately feel off. I couldn’t even sleep that night. 

He tries to continue talking to me for 4 more days and I eventually find out that he is in fact 22 years old, and has a girlfriend of 2 years. I found this out from his brother, who was my friend, who posted him on his birthday, and which was where I added him from. I felt disgusted and nasty. I immediately told him what I found out and blocked him. I believed his brother but just today I literally saw pictures of him and his girlfriend today and now I know who she is. I’m not sure if I should tell her or not. That’s something big. He literally cheated on his own girlfriend of 2 years for a naive girl he doesn’t even know who he met that same  day and basically forced himself into her and raped her. Who knows if I was the first or if I was just one of many. I don’t even know if I should press charges or whatever the case may be. I feel like no one will believe me that’s why I never speak up about stuff like this. 

I have proof of being with him and video evidence just in case I got killed or something. (I always record everywhere I go or who I am with just in case.) I also have text messages in my old phone and snap messages but he unadded me so I’m not sure I can get into those messages.

In conclusion to this long story, should I tell the girlfriend or not? Should I bring this to the authorities? 
I’m scared about the outcome but this is something I have to live with and I’ll never forgive myself for being so naive and weak minded and letting that happen to me.",29Jul2020,1

601,"So I severely struggle to process emotions on a daily basis for instance, being unable to understand even the simple ones like happiness. It bothers me consistently however it's something that I've had to forget as best I can. I am brutally honest without compassion and I have little sense of what is socially right and wrong.

My biggest issue is that it is affecting the people around me. I struggle to connect with anyone including my own family and friends. On the very few rare occasions I have expressed myself and opened up, I feel that those around me have been dismissive about it all.

I am unable to have relationships because I never truly can express the appropriate feelings and it is unfair on them. My longest relationship was 5 years and I never truly felt a connection with them and at the end it was very easy to just walk away. Deep down I know how much that hurt my ex and it isn't nice to know that they was heartbroken and lost when I don't even believe in love because it's something I've never felt. They knew my issues and always tried to stick by me but I still feel as if I wasted 5 years of their life.

I want to have real unforced friendships and relationships but I'm not sure I can? I want to settle down, have a family and a social life but does the person I am stop that from being a realistic wish?

Being a minority myself I think it's the most hypocrite thing to do and reinforces a new stereotype that being a minority means that you are automatically hurt so because of that you get a ""You shouldn't shit on me, but I'll happily shit on you"".

619,"Got engaged May 30. Currently have plans for an immediate family only ceremony in June 2021 with a reception with extended family and friends October 2021. 

What I am torn on is the reception. 

My parents are very generously paying for our wedding and have stated that anything we don’t spend we can have as a wedding gift. So with a budget of $10k for the ceremony (it is a destination wedding ceremony, so travel costs and such are involved), we have $20k leftover for a reception. 

My issue is this. When I think about planning the ceremony, I am excited and love every minute of it. When I think about the reception (which a wedding planner is assisting with), I have a lot of anxiety about spending so much money on one night. Even though it is my parents money, it could be our money if we didn’t spend it. I think of our three options as follows.

A. Ceremony (10k), reception (20k), honeymoon (our own $$).

B. Ceremony (10k), reception (10k), honeymoon (10k).

C. Ceremony (10k), honeymoon (10k), savings (10k).

I feel like option C is the most responsible, but I worry about regretting not having both our families together for this once in a lifetime event. I like option B, but I don’t know how to do a reception to our specifications for 10k for 100 people (the venue we are about to select is $4800, leaving $5200 for food/drinks/decor/entertainment).

So my family and I (25F) have been dealing with my aunt, uncle, and cousin all my life (and even before I was born). We have constantly footed the bill, bought them groceries, lent them money, picked them up and dropped them off, let them borrow things, etc. My uncle is the sole breadwinner but doesn’t use the money to support their family, he keeps it to himself (I know, it’s just baffling). He forces my cousin to homeschool, which means that my aunt has to be home to watch her. My aunt is complacent in all this, just going with my uncle’s ideas or doing what he wants to do. She realizes that there’s a problem but refuses to do anything about it. We’ve tried to talk to her about this a few times but she just gets defensive. And yes I do realize that our family (particularly my grandmother) was enabling them.

They ended up moving in with us for a year and a half (originally it was only supposed to be a few weeks). And I just got so tired of just dealing with them and I didn’t treat them very well. I was civil but quite cold and distant. 

When I was old enough, chauffeuring them around suddenly became my responsibility. I did that for at least 5 years and I just got to the point where I didn’t want to do it anymore. It was very clear that they weren’t going to change their situation and were just relying on my to help them when we meet. The thing is, they have a car (the actually have 2 but one is broken and my uncle has yet to fix it). My aunt doesn’t put in any effort to schedule things with my uncle and is not considerate of others things or time. But whenever her church needs her to be there or do something for them, she’s there immediately. I feel like I’m being taken advantage of. 

I have trust issues with my cousin, because for years she would borrow my things and break them, use them in the way that they were not intended, didn’t value them, and would never clean up after herself. Like seriously, EVERY TIME they came over she would leave a mess and leave. Every time we bring this up with my aunt, she’ll just say ‘it’s ok.’ It’s not entirely her fault though, her parents never disciplined her properly. If I don’t let her borrow my things, I would get yelled at and called selfish (this has happened with my aunt and uncle and with my other family members when we were younger). I know they’re just material things, but it’s hard to want to let her borrow stuff. 

We have never taken what we’ve done for them and rubbed it in their face. But whenever we ask them for help, they make it clear that they don’t want to help us. 

So my question is, am I being selfish for not wanting to help them and not wanting to share things? I feel guilty sometimes if I don’t do something for them.",29Jul2020,1
625,"It all started when I opened up for the first time to a guy I begun to truly love, thought he cared about me too.

Only to find out from him that he convinced me of that on purpose in order to use and abuse me, it didn't last long until he revealed his game because of guilt from what he sais. I still maintain a distanced friendship because I care about him and he's suicidal

Things that happened and that he said:
He doesn't think he genuinely cares about me, but wants the best for me (yeah, right)

He uses me and only wants his needs met by me, that's why I'm usefull

He wants us to get close again because he needs that love

Tells me he would be dead without me

Has weird moods in which he ""breaks"" and tells me to get away from him because it is all a big game still going on and that i'm not safe because it's gonna get much worse and that he'll never forgive himself for it

I realise this connection doesn't work and I can't help him so I say goodbye to him

He asks me if he overwhelmed me and sais ""Why is it that when I finally find the love, the other doesn't want it. This keeps happening. Christ. Okay, I guess I'll throw it away then"", asks me if he can send me love messages from time to time to which i obviously say no and at the end appologises for what he did, thanks me for everything and ends with ""Please, please, please be okay from this""

For real, does this make sense to anyone? And the sad part, I still feel love for him and in the same time this extreme red flag that I need to get away from him as far as possible, I literally felt spied on my thoughts at some point and everything felt dark

And now I wonder, how did he trick me. It seemed genuine, I felt it. Was it all maicious and mal intended from the begining, was he just waiting for an opportunity, I opened up with a lot of stuff since we met 2 years ago, I thought I had a genuine caring friend

Please, just be careful who you end up giving your trust to these days. It is a lesson learned for me but it could have got to be way worse",29Jul2020,1
626,"How do I change my mindset from “I need to do this” to “I want to do this”?

Example 1- I love exercising and I love seeing my results, however I consider exercising a chore instead of something that I want to do. It wasn’t always like this, but recently I’ve noticed this happening.

Example 2- I want to start reading books, mainly business/financial books, but I consider it more of something that I have to force myself to do because it’s hard for me to always retain what I read.

627,"(25 F) When I was 18, I graduated college and went to dental hygiene school because it was a 2-year program and they make good money right off the bat and have a flexible schedule. That did not workout for me. I was treated so poorly by the instructors that my patients would ask me if the instructors always talked to the students this way. Long story short, me being a beat down mess, I quit. After all that I did finish my associate’s degree anyways, I just changed my degree path and did a general studies degree, which feels useless if I’m being honest. SO now I am at university taking classes and I have NO idea what to study. I am lost AF. I have zero interested in anything I’ve done before I have had 2 decent jobs one at a school district and the other at a prison, both paid 50-60 cents over minimum wage but I had weekends and afternoons off. I don’t like the idea of working in a school because I was basically sick the entire time I worked there (kindergartners, YUCK!). The prison isn’t bad although I am in an office with no windows for 8 hours a day which is making me depressed. I have no idea what I WANT to do or what to do. Should I stop taking classes until I figure it out or should I just get a degree because ANY degree is better than NO degree? If so, what degree is the most versatile? And not a waste of time and money? How do I figure out what I like and what I want to do for the rest of my life?",29Jul2020,1

Hello, I'm a teacher in Texas and I’m looking for some advice. 

My current school is starting in person on August 12th, something I'm super nervous about because the community I live in is NOT taking COVID seriously at all. This is my third year at this school and now I'm very ingrained in the community. I'm on the prom committee, I'm a class sponsor, I'm a mentor to new teachers, and now I'm going to be the UIL director of the school. I give that information just so you know that I'm deep in the school environment here. 

Now, my mom teaches in a nearby district that is starting online and seems to take COVID much more seriously. Also, the district pays a good 10k more a year. The principal of the biggest high school just posted that they are in desperate need of an English teacher and my mom replied to her. The principal responded immediately and asked for my resume. Tomorrow is my first meeting with my mentee for this year and I'm super conflicted. 

I haven't gotten the new job yet or anything, but there has not been any other interest in the post as of yesterday. Should I leave my current district and try for the new district? Thank you for any advice.",29Jul2020,1
629,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about one year- we have been in a LDR for half of it. I  love him very much, I can imagine us being together in the future; travelling, living together, owning dogs etc. Overall we have a very loving and happy relationship. 

a few weeks into the covid-19 lockdown/pandemic my boyfriend started to show signs of depression which led him to move back into his childhood home with family. After he told me about his depression I’ve been trying to get a grasp of what depression is, trying to understand what feelings and emotions he is going through. I’ve been educating myself and talking to some close family friends who have gone through similar situations.  While I am trying to be as patient, understanding, and loving as possible there have been times where I feel like I just want to leave. I love him very much, he is someone I want to spend my days with- I’ve never met anyone like him in my life but at this point I don’t feel as happy as I once was. I really respect his space and never push him, but a few things have changed. For example our communication is almost non-existent. It can be difficult to get a conversation going between us, he always leaves my messages opened- even important ones. I rarely talk to him, if I ever feel sad/down I never talk about it either because I don’t want to bring up anything negative. I feel awful admitting this but there are moments where I feel like I am not in a relationship with him- I understand depression can do this to people and it’s so awful for everyone involved.  There are times I think to myself “what’s the point?”. At the same time I know it’s time’s like these where he needs my support and love. 


I am currently studying med so I am very fixated on that, and I do have a life out of my relationship and do things with friends, family, myself etc.I’ve tried my hardest to remain supportive, patient and loving but I am also feeling hurt and helpless. I would like to talk to him about how I feel but I don’t want to seem selfish and also hurt his feelings. I’m just really unsure of what to do? I want do want to be with him but at times I feel unhappy.",29Jul2020,1

Over the course of this month, I think I’ve discovered that I have mild anxiety. Yet what I get anxious about are little things that won’t have an impact in the long run but I get anxiety anyway. 

Just to showcase how small these things are, recently I got anxiety over accidentally unsubscribing to a mailing list that can not be resubscribed to, literally out of all things to get anxiety about when there’s a pandemic going on. It seems I dwell on how I could have stopped these things from happening, like in this case, not hitting the stupid “Unsubscribe” button. 

This is complicated for me because I’ve never really had serious anxiety like this. I mean I did go through a phase when I was in late elementary/early middle school where I was nervous that my parents were not gonna come home or that my babysitter wouldn’t pick me up from school which is reasonable at that age. But something like this, no. And I always thought of myself as a positive person. To be fair, I don’t think I have it as bad as other people, it comes and goes but I don’t think it’s healthy to keep on feeling like this. Any advice on how to get over such anxiety?",29Jul2020,1

I also really dislike being touched anywhere on my body, especially without my consent, I also dislike loud noises especially if they're repetitive. Eye contact makes me really uncomfortable even if I'm just looking at a picture of someone, to the point where my body almost physically stops me from looking at other people. Also maybe the weirdest thing is that I really don't seem to have a lot of emotions in me, my face almost always stays the same with no emotion showing and I actually noticed recently that I mostly just copy other peoples feelings and how they act because I feel like I don't actually have a personality of my own. I heard stuff like that's often referred to as ""masking"".

I was never romantically attracted to her but I she was my only friend then and I was very scared of losing that. Before this point I had never really opened up to anyone before and it made me extremely vulnerable. I guess she realised I didn't have anyone else to fall back on if our friendship went south so she started taking advantage of it. 

Without me even realising it she manipulated me into destroying relationships with any other people I was acquainted with to isolate me even more I presume and eventually shed start playing mind games with me. Like I said I was very emotionally weak at that point in my life, so she started getting angry at seemingly nothing on purpose to make me feel bad, she'd start ignoring me with no incentive why and a week or so later shed be back like nothing happened it started to really fuck with my head. I couldn't believe she'd taken control of me like that.

So eventually I realised what she was doing and when she played mad at something no sane person would actually get mad at I started ignoring it. She kept trying to play with my feelings and I was sick of it.

Previously he was living with his mother for a couple of years but was kicked out and then living with his brother's family, which was a toxic environment.  His mother told him he could come back once he got a job.  His brother was charging him a ridiculous amount of rent capitalizing on his desperate situation.  We offered to take him for the time being.  He kicks in money for groceries and helps with chores.

He has a long history of clinical depression and has been unemployed for the better part of 10 years after he was laid off from his last job.  He received some inheritance when his father died and has been living off of that, but now it's running out.

We want to help him, but we don't know how.  His mental health is one of the problems of which he is not seeking help.  He's tried counseling and medications in the past to no avail.  The only thing that helps him is exercise... and he does that intensely.  

The other problem is that he's been out of work for 10 years!  10 YEARS!  How do you move forward with that? He says he's been looking for a job and had one right before the pandemic hit, but that job got pulled.  I don't know if I believe it though.  He was in a technical field, but now he doesn't have any fresh skills, so what to do?  I have contacts, but it's all for really advanced work so I'm not sure how to help him with networking.

I’m not going to give to much details here but about 2 years ago a friend of mine was murdered. The young man who murdered him was not found guilty(ruled self defense).

The young man said something to my friend along lines of “I’ve just been wanting to hurt people lately” and showed him the large knife he stabbed my friend with later in the night.

I believe I have a lot of knowledge on the situation that was never disclosed. I wouldn’t say it’s “evidence” because it just things I have witnessed from him over the years, violent behavior, threats to others etc. I know he used to beat on his sister and harm animals.

That if he ever moved in and something happened, he’d have to move back in with his parents), broke up with her over it when she decided she’s buying it anyways, slept with someone 2 days after the breakup then blamed it on the fact that he saw guys liking her photos on FB, and makes a scene at her grandfather's funeral.

Anyways she secretly starts to sleep with him again and even bailed on me for him when I needed her (she apologized for it later). I talked to her about everything: my opinions and concerns on it and she said that it was probably going to end because he was going to the military. Then she essentially pinned her hope on the fact that the military ‘breaks you down and rebuilds you’ (her words, not mine) as her reason to why there could be something more again… they got back together in March (he hadn’t even finished boot camp at the time soo change where?) . I heard he even has a ring already and wants to propose.

Since that day I have pulled away, unfollowed her on FB, stopped responding to our group snaps, stopped responding to our group messages even though when she texted me that they had been back together for a little bit but kept it a secret 2 hours before it went live on FB she said she needed me as part of her support system. I feel like I’m an asshole because we’ve been friends for 10+ years, we’ve had each other’s back through it all, but I feel like this is too much. Am I any kind of good friend if I support this toxic relationship of hers? Am I being toxic to myself if I stay in a friendship where his toxicity bleeds through to us?  She looks so damned happy right now despite everything he did so I'm scared that it's momentary. I obviously love her and don’t want to hurt her/or see her get hurt but I can’t see/talk to her without remembering that her version of happy includes a boy (because a man he is not) that is naturally so selfish, one who seems like he doesn’t want the best for her, one who would rather clip her wings instead of encourage her to progress and learn more about herself and the world. I feel like if I brought this up again with her after everything she’d just shut down and say something like “well I won’t say anything about him then” which is also bad for her. She’d suffer in silence. It also seems like I'm the only friend who opposed them getting back together and they all can act/be normal around her. Advise on how I can ‘get over it’ and be the friend she says she wants/needs. Any other thoughts and opinions welcome.",29Jul2020,1

There's an addition certification that CAN open up doors for me. There's the possibility of getting good contracts for good money. But it's never a guarantee. 

This course has 6 classes. I was able to transfer two credits from my previous course. I'm in a slightly tough financial situation. So I'm trying to decide if I should go for it.

Currently I'm not waking up until 3pm (I don't sleep until 7am; circadian rhythm issues due to executive dysfunction) and it can take me hours just to get ready so by the time I leave the house the days gone. 

Prior to the pandemic I at least had some volunteer work and as they paid my travel it meant after work I'd go to town for wander around shops, I could walk to the next town over to sit in the coffee shop a bit or walk through the park ending with the cafe or petting zoo, I'd find free local events to go to, hell even just shopping for groceries was different (now masks and following social distancing causes anxiety). 

Now with the pandemic these things aren't options, I can't really go anywhere as there's no open bathrooms or just because there's nothing to actually *do* once I get there. I'm in the north of England so sunshine is a rarity, I feel like I should be trying to enjoy it while I can but I stay in the house. 

My options for leaving the house basically seem reduced to aimlessly wandering around my neighbourhood, which isn't picturesque. It's hard for me to motivate myself to do that, it feels pointless and isn't fun, because I've spent most of the pandemic in the house I'm even less fit so walking tends to tire me out too...but if I don't go out I get even more unfit, no fresh air or vitamin d.",29Jul2020,1

I'm not really sure how to explain this to you but I feel sick every time someone touches me. 
(Usually when a man touches me) And just to be clear: I am talking about friendly shoulder touches, hand holding, hugs... even stupid hugs.
How did this happen? I have no fucking idea what might have triggered this. For as long as I remember, I was always so eager for contact but now it fucking hurts. I feel physical pain, like I'm about to throw up Every. Single. Time. 

What it feels like? Every touch is vaguely familiar, like someone has done it before - touched my shoulder or my hand. (But I don't have an image of a person because if I ever feel someone crossing the line I directly tell them) But why does it make me flinch? I feel dirty, like I shouldn't let this happen.(And I'm still talking about simple casual touches) I feel objectified. Everything in me screams, begs to stop this.

673,"Long rant sorry.
So last year I was driving in slow traffic (around 4 to5km/h) and the guy infront of me stopped too quickly for me to react in time and by the time I stopped I had just tapped the bumper infront of me. In hindsight I should have been farther back but I will take responsibility for that. I was driving a stock mazda 3 and the person was in a Chevy Silverado work truck. 
We get out and look at the damage to notice that there was none, so the other person just said everythings fine we didnt get hurt just give me your cell number just in case my boss wants the bumper fixed with cash and let's leave it at that. Being the young dumb kid I am i agreed and that's what I did as there was no damage and theres no way you could get hurt like that,  I took his number down and he took mine and we went on our merry way.
Fast forward a few days I get a call from the ever so notoriously known and corrupt icbc saying the man claimed that he had a headache after but to not worry until the claim was completed. 
Fast forward 8 months I renew my insurance on said mazda at the same cost and thought I was all in the clear. Last Friday I get a new car and put my insurance on it to find that I have to pay 630$ per month instead of the 200 something from previous as I had an "" accident with injury"" on my name with a 5500$ premium to return to my original monthly rate. I ask how that is even possible and was told that a doctor had signed off on it. (side note: everyone knows that any doctor on this planet is willing to write a bogus injury report to help someone get time off work and get insurance money) I called my insurance adjuster amd presented the facts about the incident and even stated that I had pictures of his perfectly clean bumper and my old looking but also perfectly not broken car except for a crack on the license plate holder. I was just told the typical lie about you can get injured in a small accident, doesn't matter if you're a perfectly healthy middle aged tradesman in a HD pickup. I was also told that I didn't have the right to dispute a doctor's decision unless I can get a lawyer to prove that the man was committing fraud. Everyone I know just told me to accept it because nobody will care as it happens every day to people and it's just a way of life in Vancouver, everyone has seen people fake injuries after accidents before and it's just accepted as normal.
I cant afford to pay either of my two options icbc has given me and I need my vehicle for work. I am also not the kind of person to be taken advantage of but I'm afraid they have me by the balls here and I dont know what to do.

The trailer is old and it shows. The plumbing would need to be replaced, it has no washer/dryer, it likely needs a new stove, parts of the floor are slightly weak, especially around vents, the underneath of the trailer needs to be cleaned and it's siding redone to keep out critters. The trailer also has two additions built on, a front porch and a smaller back porch, both of which are rather old and likely need replaced. Otherwise it's rather nice, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a nicely sized kitchen/living area, and uses well water, I normally drink bottled water/water jugs anyway.

I decided to leave a voicemail and they still did not respond back to me. I have also sent several emails and there was been no reply. I went to the leasing office last Friday (7/24) and asked them about it and they told me that the people would be moving out by that Sunday (7/26) and after they inspected the place and cleaned it, I’d be able to move in (which is also a bit weird because in the early move in wavier, it states that they are no longer required to clean the place if I decide to move in early.)

Once Tuesday (yesterday) rolls around, I decide to drive to the leasing office which is 2 hours away and explain my situation once again. They tell me the same thing, and have stated that the previous tenants have moved out this past Sunday and the place would be inspected this week and I could move in (still no specific date.)

I grew up in England, born in US by luck. My partner is from the US and i met him 3yrs ago on Discord. I moved in with him 5 months ago. Thought if be happier than in europe.

Little did i know, his aunt is a bipolar manic delusional toxic human being with the most unbearable personality to be around. Almost never in a good mood, makes life miserable for herself, her mother and her daughter, all of which i live with. 

She steals her mothers paychecks (even though her mom works in a hospital during covid), she threatened to hit me and my partner for complaining about her leaving kittens in our room to shit/piss everywhere, on our bed,and thats after we got home from work.. granted she is unemployed and gets fat checks from the government, so at this point she has no idea how hard working life is. 

She complains we dont do anything yet we do so much and she makes all the messes that need to be cleaned anyways, and we do things inbetween daily 3pm-12am shifts strenuous fast food shifts. 

She takes up the bathroom for hours, the kitchen too and its always before our work time which is the only time we can eat so we often get nothing to eat before work. We come home, same thing. Always taken right when we need it. She eats the food we buy often too.

Cant talk to her because shes truly a delusional  nutcase. We get 2 days off a week. Cant go anywhere cause we dont have a car. So we are stuck inside all day. 

I have no energy, no life, it all feels so painful. I cry often, and ive never been much of a crier. My partner is the world to me but i havent even been able to cook a healthy meal in months. Ever since i came to the US ive been nothing but unwell and sick and nauseous, with stomach problems and digestion problems and colds and all sorts of issues. Previously i was pretty much entirely healthy. Little to no problems.

This is what Mum suggests I do, at home. PS, I hated my 2 years, although this next course should be much better.

Here comes gf (17F) of a year and a half. I live in a completely rural village, and she did too, until about 8 months into our relationship. We knew the move was coming when we started dating, though it has been hard on us both. We jokingly said that I should move up, and I was hesitant at first, I don't have a lot of money and am generally pessimistic, so of course I'm still a bit fresh to my entire trust. Her family are great, and I would be moving in with her and her dad. Rent would be roughly the same for me, and it's a much bigger place with tonnes more opportunities.

He was asking about how the move went, college talk, music etc. I grew up going to this mans house and had spent weeks there so I knew that he was a pretty lonely guy. I just thought he needed someone to talk to now that his daughters were out of the house, or perhaps he genuinely cared as I had moved very far away.

It was only when he told me he was in love with me did I stop all communication.

691,"Hello, redditors,

I am (23F) jobless for a couple months now. I lost my job because of COVID-19 but all my life I had problems with them: I've changed 7 jobs, 3 times I was fired. I didn't like any of them. And I wasn't good at any job I had.

The last 2 years I worked as a content writer/copywriter (not in english, that is not my native language, so sorry for my mistakes). While I was studying in university, I worked as a freelance writer for a year (this is the longest job I had). After graduation I started working in the office (also as a writer) and now I got fired. 

The thing is I don't trust my writing skills. I will rate them as bad or just an average. And I don't even know do I really like writing. Actually, I have no idea what kind of job I want and there I can get good at it. 

All my job experience makes me feel like a total loser, because I always fail, even though I try my best. It seems like I can't do anything right, always just making mistakes, always sressed out (like every single minute at the work is stress for me). 

Also most of my life I was struggling with low self-esteem and feeling that I am not good at anything. My mind is constantly saying that I am worthless, stupid, ugly and no matter what I will do and how much I try - I will never be able to reach anything and will always suffer from jobs that I hate.

I go to therapy for a year now, but still can get better. Meditation, yoga, diary writing - also not very helpful. 

To be honest, sometimes I don't want to work at all but that's not how the world works and I have to. All I like to do is reading books, scrolling, sleeping and meeting my bf or bff. Also I want to move out from my parents home (I feel shame that I still live with them) to live with my love, but because of my job situation I can't. 

What should I do? How I can overcome the thoughts that I am worthless and total loser than I am constantly failing? Is it even possible to find a job that you like??? How is it done than you suck at everything no matter how much you try???

She said she was, even though she don't really like the idea of me being around my sister's mom. We kept drinking and chatting after my sister's call and I went to sleep a little drunk. I woke up an hour after that to my mom yelling at me for (???????), saying I was late to see my sister and her mom or something. I was still drunk, so I don't really remember all the details. All I remember is yelling back, then her screaming even louder and then I was getting out of there angry as fuck. After that I stayed at my dad's for a while before we sorted things out.

While I was at my dad's place, we also had an argument that was pretty bad. He said something I didn't like, I said some shit I shouldn've said too, and, well, I ended up with a cutted foot and a few bruises. I was also drunk when it happend, so that explains my injuries.

Then, back to mom's house, I had the AMAZING idea of having a beer with her. Can you imagine what happened? I started talking to her about how I couldn't let things go that easily ('cause she seemed to have forgotten our fight, like it never happened, and I just can't do that) and how I was still hurt because of the stuff she said to me and all. It went downhill at some point, I got angry at something and we started arguing again. The thing is that, this time, she hit and broke my phone.

The thing is: I feel like all of this is because of me. My dad said so himself, that my fights with my mom were my fault. So, if someone who causes all of this isn't toxic, I don't know what they are.

Well, what should I do to change that? To know if it's really my fault? To sort thing out with my family?

694,"I applied for a promotion and was told lots of people applied (in the double digits). When speaking to ONE of my  managers (there are 5) who is supposed to support me, they kept reinforcing that there are a lot of people. They then asked if I wanted to continue with the interview process and felt confident. Then, kept putting emphasis on how “excited” they were for “everyone” to apply (no emphasis on me). So to me it sounds like either I’m not in the running at all, or someone already got picked, am I wrong? 

P.S. I’m not bad at my job by any means, and the head manager and a few others referred me to it. However, this manager is in charge of assisting me in preparing for interviews, schedules etc, so if anything they would be the ones supporting me rather than pushing me down",29Jul2020,1

696,"Im a 21M, who has never gotten drunk.

 I used to be very anti-social in terms of going out, I always said no because I didn't want to get drunk, and also my family had inculcated that I shouldn't get drunk.

I started working at a bar when I was 16, under my families ex-restaurant, and everytime I had someone drunk it was either, super deppresive, overly sexual and sometimes funny drunkards who would dance or tried cheesy jokes.

My issue is not that I hate drunkards, but I always thought getting drunk was just being miserable, once I started socialising more, and asked my mates what it felt like, it made me doubt If I was just being too safe.

What I fear about drunk people, wether is friend or partner, is that they loose common sense and do something regrettable, and for me it's something that has bothered me in previous relationships.

But now, I feel like I might be overreacting, and just see the bad side of something that can be fun.

I feel like If I didnt mind get drunk, I prob have more friends, because Id go out and be like them and have fun.

Im now on a mixed bag of opinions, I know my boundries, and Im not influenced, If I do something is because I want to, pretty good quality I like to think.

What's your views on it guys &amp; gals? Should I be more laid back on it? 

PS: I dont stop being friends, or trying to be friends with someone because they get drunk, most of my friends are, and some arent; In a relationship, it pulls me out more because I feel like something could happen but again, this is my grandads views that I grew up with.",29Jul2020,1
697,"I’ve developed a habit of looking at my phone the whole time I’m in the restaurant eating with friends or even when we are walking aroung the mall. 

I’m not even addicted to social media as much as I used to be, I only open Instagram like once to twice a week. 

I usually just browse reddit or look at news, and it just sucks so much for me. I can feel my anxiety creeping up and thinking, “Oh no, this person I’m out with probably thinks I am being disrespectful.” But I swear to God, I do try my best to make conversation sometimes. I panic all the time though, I don’t know what to talk about and I don’t know what to say.

And the thing is they start using their phones too, which makes it even harder for me to start a conversation because I feel like I’m disrupting them from looking at their phones. 

I genuinely enjoy my time with people and I do like having funny or intellectual conversations. But I just struggle to start one. 

My love language and the way I show that I care is through quality time, but the fact that I’m always looking at my phone is making my statement ironic.

698,"I don’t know where to start. It’s about a guy— a fling I would say. We live in the same city but different universities, we’d often meet during weekends partying at a club because we had mutual friends. When drinks were downed we’d made out (and a little extra, if you catch my drift) and that happened for 4 weekends. He’d try to hit me up on social media but i’m dry as fuck and have to personality when sober (he’s the popular one and i’m a potato) I didn’t want to admit that I was beginning to have feelings for him because I know well enough that it would just be in a moment of weakness and I was just lonely. I am smarter than that, or atleast i’d like to think. 

Long story short I kinda got cold, he became uninterested and got another girl. He was just someone I was gonna fantasize having a relationship but never actually get together with and that’s fine with me, we don’t even go to the same university. BUT THEN i heard from a friend he is going to transfer to my Uni and the thought of seeing him again makes me feel all the emotions I couldn’t even name before. I want him but i don’t have the confidence. There are way more other pretty girls he can go for and just thinking about it makes me sad. Please help. I feel like I’m drowning",29Jul2020,1
699,"I moved in with my current roommate July 1st of 2019. Prior to Covid, I was travelling nearly 100%, Monday through Thursday evening. We resigned for a year in late April.

It was a great setup - I'd come back home and we'd have a rambunctious weekend doing our own thing and sometimes hanging out. But, following Covid, I'm working from home (30% of the time from my girlfriend's place).

I've started to get frustrated with a few things following this massive change, mostly regarding my roommate: - He drinks/smokes and stays up until 2am, wakes up at noon, nearly every day - He got a puppy who isn't trained well - He isn't careful about Covid, and hangs out with many different groups of people, putting me and my gf (who have been depressingly isolated in order to be safe) at risk - He's pretty messy

Overall, if I'm not avoiding him because of Covid, I'm frustrated with him. I didn't know I'd be working from home for ~8+ months. We can break our lease with no penalties if we find replacements.

Would I be a jerk to tell him I'd like to move out, and give him enough time to a) find another roommate he wants or b) move out together and find replacements

702,"Hi, so I made a throwaway just to post this. I have been lying to my family for about 6 years now. In my first year I didn't pay my uni fees for the 2nd semester. Since then I have been a semester behind in my fees. Since then due to interest and such, I now owe my school a large sum of money (I am an international student, so fees are quite high). I never told my parents I didn't pay my fees my 2nd semester, I always intended to eventually pay them, but my dumbass spent it instead without really noticing what I was doing. I finished school now and need to ask my parents for this money, I do not know how to even approach this subject. I am extremely scared of disappointing them and it drives me crazy at this point. I really don't know what to do. I am afraid asking them for money will unravel a bunch of other things, and I am also scared they'll abandon me.

704,"This is going to be long im sorry

I dont have an actual memory of it i think? I was abused physically by my dad so when i look up the symptoms for being molested i have all of them probably because they all fit for kids who were abused. 

I feel like many other parts of my life i have possibly suppressed the memory
Heres why ( ill give some memories that i have to show you how i came up with this idea)

Ahem I forgot about this for a while but from the time i was like 3-4 i would have sleep paralysis every night and there was a monster called the tickle monster who wiuld come and molest me. 

So sleep paralysis is a dream and dreams reanact your fears and things that happen in your life so you can process them. Why was my 3 year old self dreaming of that? I doubt thats normal

Anyways um it reminded me of my dad in like mannerisms because we would play a game where he would chase after us and then tickle us ( not creepily)

I hated when adults tickled me and i just let it happen because i couldn’t say no to anyone 

When i was 7 i remember being in the woods with my cousin ad being like the tickle monster and the broccoli lady are always watching the Broccoli used to come before the tickle monster but now she just watches ummm yup 

Ok so now im talking about my grandma.i was mabey 2 and my brother any i had to spend the night over at her house apoerently we spent the night jumping on the bed but all i remember is saying grandma no and she like idk like left me in my crib um when my dad came back he asked me how it went and looked very nervous and hopeful i guess that i had a good time 

I remember trying ti never go to sleep like grabing toys to play with on my floor so i wouldnt catch some zees

My last memory is i was 4? i was going to quietly stuff my socks under my door in hopes of deterring him idk and i was disassociating while doing so and my mom came in like why are you still awake and i said i have to do it so he cant get in and she said go to sleep

I feel scared thinking about the bed that i had at the time and some if the things i had like a butterfly mobile idk

The conversation has gone to the topics of gender and being transgender as well. I don't feel like I am really explaining it to them in the most constructive way, because I don't know everything myself. My basic explaination is that people are able to choose how they live and that it is normal to question/change your gender/sexuality.

716,"I have a friend in his late 20s that i am genuinely concerned about. We have been close our entire lives and I have seen a really concerning shift in his mentality and thought patterns. He has gotten much more negative and hostile in situations. He’s always fighting or trying to fight someone when we go out or are around people he doesn’t care for. And he is just delusional on so many levels. He has a huge ego but at the same time seems so fragile, like saying one wrong thing will cause a breakdown. 

It seemed to start when he started having interest in one of our mutual friends girlfriends friends. He claims there’s a connection between them but it seems one sided as she is recently engaged. I feel like he is having serious delusions about this situation because he is constantly saying he knows what she’s thinking and what her parents are thinking and constantly having  “intuitions” about the situation. This has been going on for over a year. It’s seemed to have branched off into his overall life and these delusions seem to happen everywhere now. Whenever we get together he talks about her or himself. When he talks about himself he always says how he is much more in tune with his emotions and he is a unique personality and what not. It’s really odd and frustrating because every time I give him advice, “I don’t understand” or he’s so in tune with things and I’m not. He treats everyone like they are an idiot.

717,"This happened years and year ago (I think I was like 13)but I want to hear other people’s opinion. So I had this friend and we were super close all through junior high. However, she would do anything she wanted and was very controlling. If you did something she didn’t like she would ignore you for days. So it was Halloween night and I was matching with her. I really wanted to trick or treat in my area cuz we had done her area for the past like 5 years. She was reluctant and finally just gave in. As we were trick or treating we wouldn’t go to all the houses because she said they weren’t kid friendly or some shit. But I realized she was slowly making her way to her house region. I literally told her “why are you doing that? We are supposed to be trick or treating in my house region” and she pulled out the this areas boring and I might as well go trick or treating with someone else (she was talking about her other best friend). Like I said she gets mad over pretty much everything. So I’m a senior in high school and I’ve never really thought about that night again. I ran home crying that night. I was going through such hard times and she literally had the perfect family and lifestyle. So that night I texted her and said “hey this really made me upset... can we talk” and she replied with a list of things that she’s jealous of over me. They included the stupidest things like you do a better cartwheel and your mom drives you everywhere. I replied with why she shouldn’t be jealous of those things. Like my mom drives me everywhere because I only have her to drive me. My dad was in jail and my sister wasn’t old enough to drive. I guess this made me a little irritated because I replied with I list of what I was jealous of. This included having non divorced parents and how she was in all ap classes and how she was better than me in every sport. Just to clarify, I was super depressed when I was 13 because of my dad and my friendships. Also, we no longer hang out because this night separated us completely. We still see each other and I text her from time to time but it’s not the same as it used to be. Was this friendship toxic? I just want to hear your guys opinions on the whole story.

I invited this one girl; we were very close years before and were still on good terms, but we hadn’t spoken for a while before the party. Everything was great, but the girl seemed to take over and make everything about her for the attention, even though it was my party. I had a lot of fun, but it was kinda annoying. 

A few weeks later, this girl comes and starts an argument with me out of nowhere. I’m annoyed, but I let it go. We had some tension and small arguments in the past, so it was nothing new. We talk it out and make up. I try to reach out a few weeks later, and she claims that we aren’t friends anymore because I took her off my private story (I didn’t, because that’s petty and childish??). I let it go, and didn’t talk to her. I felt bad about how our friendship ended, so I spoke to her again and we made amends. We catch each other up on our lives and go on with our friendship. Until she tells one of my friends (who she met at the party) a secret that I told her in the middle of the night, and it starts getting spread to the school. It was nothing bad, it was just super upsetting because I had trusted the girl when I shouldn’t have. The cycle starts again...I forgive her and we go on with our lives. We go to hangout for the first time in months, and she gets so mad because I spend my time focused on another friend who was invited (who she told me to invite!) because I didn’t want the person to feel left out. We argue and we haven’t spoken since. I realize now that this girl is incredibly toxic and was constantly using me for boys to date and to get closer to my friends, she didn’t care about our friendship like I did.

For the past few weeks, my best friend in the whole world, who I trust with everything, has gotten close with her. They’ve been hanging out, posting on Snap together- everything. I feel like it’s toxic for me to be upset that they’re hanging out, but it’s literally tearing me apart because it’s so upsetting. I told my friend when they first hung out that it made me uncomfortable and very upset, and she apologized, but continued to hangout with her. I don’t want to tell her who she can and can’t hangout with, but I don’t want to sit and witness her get closer with this girl who has hurt me countless time. We’ve drifted because of it and we’ve literally never had any problems in our two years of friendship.

720,"Hello, this is my first time posting on redditt even though I have use reddit many time before on different accounts. So if this sounds like I'm getting off track, bare with me. Also these are multiple problems. 

Problem #1:
I have a severe problem where I rather prefer my imagination rather than real life but now I think I gave it a little to much ""power"". I would daydream all the time when I have just been too quite or just doing nothing at all (like just sitting in my thoughts) and my imagination would just slide in to make me stay. I'm not gonna lie but I love my imagination but sometimes it can scare me. I've had made up characters pop into real life where I could see them sitting or just doing the same thing as me. The wired part is that they look a little different (twisted smiles, stress face, and red gains popping out of their eyes. I pushed it off the first few times because it wasn't scary and they  just wanted to talk but then it started to happen often and more things would slip out. My nightmares we're a problem too. I would have very detailed ways to kill and hide people's bodies. I've read many reddit post and articles about this saying how often this happens and thought that I'm normal but at the same time I don't. 

My dream is that I'm not actually inside of my body, I'm kinda spectating it but I can still see and hear the thoughts. So my body is just sitting on a chair so deeply into thought and it's just planning a way to torture, muderder and hide the body then go and do it. I wouldn't even know the person most of the time. 

Problem #2:
I forget things way to often to the point where when you tell me something, I forget two seconds later. I also have a great amount of memories that I am missing. It's like my mind resets because every time I wake uo, I don't remember yesterday I can only remember my imagination. The worst part is my family tells me all the time that they had important things to tell me (which I was responding to ""weirdly"")  And won't remember the conversation. I don't know if it's me just forgetting stuff way to easily or if I have a second personality. But what do I know?

723,"So, my brother \[26/M\] started dating this awful girl \[25/F\] after I \[23/F\] helped them hitch up (at her request). Prior to them dating, she made effort to become friends with me but once they got going, she made absolutely no effort at all. This included not inviting me to events anymore or making any effort to catch up once she secured my Brother. I felt pretty hurt and used by her.

Fast-forward to COVID. My Mom is high-risk (she has an auto-immune disease) and the girl (let’s call her Bianca) came over 4 nights a week, knowingly endangering my Mom. Bianca works at a hospital (super dangerous) but showed no care for her actions. She would never ask permission to come over and my Mom even told my Brother that she’s banned but she persisted.

We lived in a very small house and when she came over, you could hear her moan even if you were on the other side of the house (yuck). This was even at early hours like 7pm. There was no respect for the fact that we were in lockdown and couldn’t go anywhere.

Around this time, Bianca and I were both 1 of 5 people being interviewed for this prestigious job. Before my interview, my Brother yelled at me saying I couldn’t do the job and I wouldn’t get it anyway. Meanwhile, he wrote Bianca’s cover letter and coached her for the interview. As Murphy’s law would have it, she got the job and I didn’t (not that she deserved it though).

This caused a huge rift in my family. My Mom hasn’t spoken to my brother in about 3 months. I haven’t spoken to him in 4. My brother refuses to call up our grandmother who’s dying of leukaemia. He’s also treating our Grandpa like crap. His relationship with Bianca has basically torn my whole family apart.

From then on out, I ignored her every time I saw her. Luckily, my Mom and I were able to move out. With that, I removed Bianca from all social media and never wanted to see her again.

Bianca, however, took this as ammunition to gossip about me to all her friends. Her and her friends planned to laugh / ‘cackle’ at me when they saw me next. And she started influencing people’s opinion about me, resulting in a few of her friends removing me from social media. She’s also pried heavily into what I’m doing, asking others how my relationship is with my brother / whether I’ve spoken about her.

I get home really upset one night because I feel super targeted and I tell my Mom everything that’s happened. The next day, my Mom confronts Bianca. My Mom said that if she hears Bianca say another whisper about me, Bianca’s banned from entering the house my Brother lives in (which my Mom owns). Bianca starts crying and getting super emotional. She claims she’s never talked about me / gossiped. My Mom feels bad for confronting her.

What should I do? Her crying made me feel guilty, but her actions disgust me beyond belief.",29Jul2020,1

732,"I’m a 17 y/o guy and I’ve always been pretty big my whole life. End of November I decided I was tired of it and decided to start dieting and exercising. When I first started I was 5’7” and 260. I looked like a ball. From November to March I saw my muscle mass increase by about 10 lbs and my body fat % go from 42 to around 34-35 (40ish pounds of fat lost).

COVID hit, and I saw it as an opportunity to take a “little” break. I think you all know where this is going, but if you don’t that’s ok. I ended up going from 1-2 times a day at the gym and perfect diet to couch potato eating chips. I lost basically all the muscle I had gained those 4 months and my fat % is around 38 now. I’m still at a net weight loss of 50 lbs, but almost 10 of that is muscle.

How do I go about starting back up again? Going from eating anything I find and being lazy to going back to cooking and exercising a lot isn’t all that easy, and I need some help getting back into. Thanks in advance.",29Jul2020,1
733,"My (m,24) parents are from Eritrea but I was born and raised in a small town in rural Germany. There was a small local community of Eritreans in the region but in everyday life we were basically just a handful of black people in the entire town. 

Growing up there would be the occasional racist comment but all in all I never thought much about being different as a child. It wasn't until the age of 10 that I was hit with an avalanche of racial abuse by my classmates, who would refer to me as the ""shit n\*gger"" and call me every racist slur or joke they could think of. That would go on for years and there was little help from parents or teachers. 

As a 13/14yo I would develop severe depression and social anxiety, which I'm grappling with to this day. At this point after 5 years of medical treatment, some therapy and a stint at a mental hospital I've pretty much accepted that my struggle with mental illness is gonna be a lifelong one. The bullying eventually fizzled out but my mental health never recovered. 

Ever since that time I'm hyperaware of my race every second of the day, wherever I go. I can't get it out of my head. I'm constantly uncomfortable pondering about all the people staring at me, wondering what they're thinking, if they're scared of me, what stereotypes they might be projecting onto me.   Here in my rural 99,9% white home town I go out and I stick out like a sore thumb as the only black face in the entire building. Even though I was born and raised here I will never be considered a ""real German"", no matter how progressive &amp; multicultural society purports to be. Unlike traditional immigration countries in the new world and melting pots like America, Germany is a very homogeneous place where ethnic and national identity are historically intertwined. 

What can I do when I don't feel at home in my home country? I feel like living in a more diverse place with a sizable population of people that look like me, would make life so much easier but I can't just up and leave the country.",29Jul2020,1

This is kind of peculiar to ask, but I have problems with a certain teacher and I need advice on how to fix that. I’m not trying to be narcissistic but I would consider myself a good student : I work hard, I enjoy learning (most things), and I actively participate. My human psyc teacher strongly dislikes my independent and creative thinking though.

(A couple examples )

1-She barked at me and shamed me in front of the whole class for wearing light mascara I forgot to wash off from Sunday since I went to bed late and woke up late accidentally.

2- For my 9th grade science independent study project I did an in-depth study of how personality type affects memory instead of which bottle rocket gos the fastest like most people and she shrugged my study off and told my mom during parent teacher conferences that it was good that one section of my project failed because I needed to learn failure...?

3- During Covid she saw me hanging out at a park with my boy best friend (in other class) and made a slight not so nice comment on our live class.... ( don’t y’all come for me with the social distancing shit his parents are close friends with my parents so they’re in our social bubble but trust me we all wear masks in public we are good people don’t come at me)

I mainly mad that he’s cheating on me, but the situation is so unique I don’t know how to approach it with him. I don’t really care about the trans aspect of everything, I just want to make sure I approach him in a way where he knows I’m angry at the cheating but not to embarrass him about the trans escort. I really just want him to be happy and see if there’s anything in our relationship that I can provide that he’s missing or if this is something he needs to be happy. I don’t want both of us to wake up in five years with children and married and he is unhappy and I am betrayed. 

He is a Hispanic male and his family is homophobic and I know they wouldn’t accept this aspect of him and I think that’s why he hides it. But he doesn’t need to hide it from me because it doesn’t bother me. So I want to know how I can bring up his “secret“ so that he feels comfortable admitting it to me and doesn’t feel attacked or defensive. 

I did bring up to him the fact that I saw messages of him texting people to hook up but I didn’t specify all of the details that I knew. He didn’t come clean and he denied everything even with the proof of the messages.

740,"Backstory: I am a very shy person and don't make friends easily. The same goes for romantic relationships. However, I managed to have a boyfriend at some point- problem is, everytime we would do something sexual, he drank and more or less forced me to do so as well. I suddenly lost all inhibitions and I liked it. He liked me more too- I was more interesting, and, more importantly, I would do everything he wanted. In another relationship I had, the guy had the same attitude towards alcohol and only showed real interest in me when I was drunk. So this kind of fucked me up. I met another guy and started drinking compulsively when I was with him, just to make him like me. He did. We were in a relationship and throughout it I would drink everytime I felt the need to be liked a little bit more. I would go on actual benders sometimes. However, this last guy didn't forced me to do anything. I did it to myself. I now sincerely believe that I cannot have a healthy relationship and that sober me is simply not desirable.

I'm 21M and I've been *online* friends with (let's call her) Alice (22) for 3 years. We're from different countries but our lives has a lot common and that made a bound between us. We've been in contact almost every day since we met. We know almost everything about each other and each other's lives. She means a lot to me. She's been there for me when NOBODY else was. I love her dearly like  a sibling and a friend. she feels the same about me. 

It was her birthday about a month ago. As usual, i made her a gift. I had written poems for her birthdays in the past years and this year, i wrote her a song. Since her birthday, she's been going through some pain with her periods. It won't let her do much. I've been worried about her and i feel SO BAD for not being there FOR her to take care of her. I feel bad that she goes through that kind of pain and i wish I could handle a bit of it for her.

The distance between us has always made me sad, now more than ever. We always talk about meeting and living together as roommates one day. We had a little misunderstanding about a week ago where she thought i was lying to her about sth and got overwhelmed by her emotions.

Since all of that, I've been worrying about her a lot. I feel like i shouldn't let anything make her sad. This very day, she was talking about her past a little bit and i felt extremely bad and sad and i wished i could be there to hug her. I've discussed this with my psychologist and she says that this isn't healthy at all. That I'd be devastated if anything happens to her.

I've been getting overwhelmed by my emotions for her. I've been EVEN feeling like I've fallen in love with her but none of this existed before! She's an amazing girl but she's asexual and I can't be with her.

Besides that, she never seems to approve anything I do and yet, demands my time and attention:

1) I once said jokingly I'd marry in a black dress, and she got furious and said that was ridiculous. I mentioned wanted to travel the world, she said she'd never let me. I passed the college admission test and she went ""everyone does that"". I am not a native english speaker but can understand very it well but she says I can't, I must be lying. And she always says in a condescending, sweet tone and acts like a victim when called out.

2) I love to know about the future and things like synthetic organs, aliens and mars colonization but I can't mention it because ""none of these things are in the bible"", ""they are sinful"", ""the apocalypse is coming"" (my parents also believe this so I approach this carefully). I had band posters on my wall but ripped it off out of guilty when I was religious because of her. 

She is always complaining about my personality and that I should be the same as when I was ten years ago, problem being that ten years ago I just talked more; I still wasn't the person she wants me to be: I disliked the nicknames she gave me, hated and was grossed out by her need to be touching and kissing me all the time (that became a joke in our family! But nobody ever stopped her)

Now I've learned to assert myself better so I told I dislike physical touch and yet it seems that if I make a wrong move, she'll begin smothering me again. I also hate taking pictures so she used to hide away in order to take them, she's stopped now, thank god.

I’m not trying to blame my diet on my dad, I’m simply trying  and failing to eat healthy in a house full of unhealthy home cooked comfort food.   
  
I’m 23, a recent college graduate, and living at home.     
  
I’ve told my dad multiple times over the past few years I want to eat healthier and he always cooks or buys more unhealthy foods when I say that. An example being last year when I said I wanted to eat less fast food he brought fast food home for lunch multiple times a week. (Sometimes he takes his lunch at home). It was literally like the same week I told him that, and he doesn’t ask if people want anything he just brings home enough for everyone.   
  
But besides that, my dad likes to cook, he cooks a lot. Between leftovers and ingredients, our small apartment fridge is full.      
  
Like right now, our fridge is full, but it’s all raw meat, cheese, leftover pork, left over pie, condiments, and beverages.   

  
I also grew up eating his cooking, so I’m not even familiar with other foods. He makes a lot of burgers and steaks, and other foods like pancakes, waffles, deserts, breads. It’s all great food but it’s not healthy or slimming. We do eat salads sometimes but usually as a side.

I was physically and emotionally abused from the time i was 4-19y/o. Living with a narcissist was tough because my entire childhood revolved around making him happy so i wouldn't get hurt.  Fast forward to now, I'm 23 years old living on my own with a pretty great life. I left home with not a dollar to my name and now I'm extremely blessed. I go to therapy, take care of myself, and never will need anyone in my life. 

I'm a straight woman (gross i know), petite, and not gonna lie, pretty attractive. I'm no instagram model but I'm up there. When it comes to dating, I've realized that men fall in love with me way too easily. I'm talking first date or second date here, they don't always tell me but I know, they end up telling me later. No matter how hard a guy thinks he is, he really doesn't stand a chance up of being a fuck boy when he's up against me. And of course that's a great thing! I've never been cheated on, never intentionally hurt by a guy. They always make me feel loved and go above and beyond for me. And I do too! I'm very affectionate and emotionally healthy in relationships. I'm understanding and not jealous and I feel like that energy rubs off on them too. I have the best relationships with men now. 

The issue I keep running into is that they never work out. And that's neither my fault or there's. Whether it be timing, moving on, or whatever the case may be, it's okay!! At the end of the day I'm only 23 right? I always end things extremely amicably. I have so much love for all my past lovers and truly wish them the best. But then it always turns into them sort of never moving on. They tell me I'm the best thing that's ever happened to them and it breaks my heart. I don't want to know that people are hurt over me. It makes me feel extremely guilty because I love them and I want them to move on and enjoy life. With one ex it got so bad that I had to file a restraining order after 6 months of nonstop stalking. 

I find it hard to talk about this with people because I know it could come off as braggy in a weird way but I'm not trying to brag!! I don't know what it is about me that makes men feel this way and I don't know how to not feel so sh\*tty all the time knowing people are in pain over me when I really shouldn't feel bad because I didn't do anything wrong.

757,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

TL;DR May have to disclose complex but managed x and y disabilities to gossipy but irreplaceable HR due to COVID; disclosure may result in removal of physical job tasks due to fragility of others (not me) with unmanaged x and y disabilities.

Background: I work in the United States. I should state that my employer during COVID has been protective of me - so much so that I’ve been feeling disconnected from my work because I’m one of the few employees not allowed to be in the building. I am considered an essential employee and if they do not have someone in my position, they will get shut down. They consider me high risk because I had cancer less than five years ago. No chemo or anything, my health has never been better, but according to their state forms, cancer is cancer.

What my employer does not know is that I have two rare genetic disabilities that on paper are considered quite severe. Over the last ten years I have worked very, very hard to manage those disabilities. I have fought against receiving disability - according to the disability folks I should have been on 100% disability my entire life. X and y do not impact my work whatsoever. I am very fortunate compared to most people who have these disabilities. In the past when I have disclosed to other employers it was used against me. There are some work tasks I love very much and am perfectly capable of doing that may be taken away from me.

We have forms from the state requiring us to track any COVID symptoms along with a daily temperature check. My body temperature hovers around 96-97; this is caused by my disabilities but shouldn’t warrant an explanation. Some people just run lower temps.

I also vomit 1-3 times a week at night. This is caused by my disabilities but otherwise doesn’t hurt anything. On our forms for July, vomiting was not a reportable symptom. The state is requiring we report vomiting starting in August.

It looks like my choices are:

1. Report vomiting. Let them think it’s a COVID symptom. Be self-isolated from even my friends at work and continually tested for COVID.

2. Report vomiting. Tell HR in the notes field that the vomiting is caused by x and y disability. HR, by the way - I love her but her approach to confidentiality is not great. Other than that she is a great HR person and we have maybe two qualified HR people in our whole county (and the other one is awful), so she’s irreplaceable too. HR person is likely to look up x and y disability, consult with state HR, freak out, and bar me from the physical work I enjoy doing because *everybody else* with x and y is either dead or can’t tie their own shoes without bleeding out. I didn’t mind when everyone knew about the cancer but I am so sick of explaining x and y, and x and y are very complicated.

3. Report vomiting but get a note from my doctor (who is new and doesn’t know anything about x and y) that the vomiting is not COVID related, which will cause HR (and by gossip, everyone else) to think I have an eating disorder, which would disqualify me for some athletic tasks I’ve been training for. These tasks are VERY important to my career.

4. Don’t report it unless the vomiting is different from the usual because it’s none of their beeswax. The vomiting does have characteristics that are different from illness-related vomiting. There is no risk to anyone else.

I get why reporting symptoms is important. This just makes me uncomfortable enough that I could use input from others.",29Jul2020,1
758,"I fell ill in December 2019 and ended up partially paralyzed and needing brain surgery in February this year. I was off work until I fought my surgeons to let me go back in April. I am still struggling health wise and they wanted to take me back off work for a long time but ended up letting me continue at 4 hours max a day and ONLY from home. My work has been extremely understanding and have allowed me to keep working from home. 

I work for a local school district and do 100% of my work from a computer with no student contact so working from home works great. That being said, when COVID ended, I stopped getting the extra “COVID pay” that bumped me up to my full checks. They also informed me AFTER I came back that I needed to pay back the employee portion of health care coverage which totaled almost 5K. I’m paying it back 100 at a time since I’m also paying a TON of medical bills too. So not only am I only able to work 4 hours a day but I’m also paying 100 extra back to them each check. They JUST told me that since COVID ended, I now only count as “part time” so I have to start paying the employer portion of my insurance as well. 

I’m literally going to end up OWING my job money rather than getting paid. 

I know, leave or quit. The only problem is that I LOVE my job. Not to toot my own horn but I’m also good at my job.

760,"so there's this girl I work with that's in her late teens.... she's a very sweet person and isn't manipulative at all...

she has a significant other, and her and i have been talking all year, like genuine good conversations... 

she knows this isn't a run-of-the-mill coworker relationship, but that I actually appreciate her and want to keep in touch... I'm also recently friends with her brother, whom she is very close with...

I also asked her to get coffee earlier this year and she denied me...

anyways I backed away because she wasn't appreciating me... and lately she has really gone out of her way to show me that she appreciates me...her whole demeanor and all that has changed, and she's much more focused on showing appreciation and asking questions etc..

anyways, today we were talking outside
on break and she asked what color car I have and I said blue; and jokingly said i obviously like blue because I always wear colors like blue, green, purple..
and she said ""yeah, and it makes your eyes pop...""

... she had never made a comment like this, and it seems like she may be attracted to me.... the way she had been talking to me lately and never mentioning her SO anymore led me to maybe think that they broke up,

but when she left work she left with some flowers she bought which last time she did that, it was for her SO, and that's what I thought this time...

and then the very next time we worked, we were talking at work and she was looking at some baby products and said ""awww... do you want to have kids?"", and i said probably.

she's not a tease, so it's perplexing for her to be flirty like this when she's NOT that type of girl; she's meek and somewhat shy... what's going on?",29Jul2020,1

765,"Lately I've been thinking about this experience I had and want to hear if this is weird to anyone else.

I did Colorguard in high school for a well known school. We had several coaches most of which came from the program. When I was 15 I became close, like friends, with my coach (f) who was 23 at the time. 

One time we were at a Colorguard party that the head coach threw together for team building. My friend coach pulled me aside into another room and told me how she's been texting this guy and he sent her a picture of his dick. She proceeded to explain how big it was and pulled out her phone and showed me. Then described the feelings she gets when she looks at it.

I had viewed pornography prior to that, but had never had a dick pic sent to me. Let alone seen a dick of a grown man (not in pornography). I also hadn't been sexually active and come from a culture where sex was very taboo. It was really shocking to me and made me a little sick to my stomach. I guess I tried to forget it because I recently remembered that experience and thought about how weird it was for my coach to show me, a minor, a picture like that. 

Is this a little off to anyone else? Was this a normal experience for other people?",29Jul2020,1

Sometimes I’ll choose a film to watch, a band to listen to, a tv show to start, whilst subconsciously thinking I need to so people are impressed/ don’t judge me. 
But recently I’ve started to realise how ingrained and far reaching this really is. I’ve always said I’m attracted to funny people, and people who are talented (who stick to a hobby or passion and are good at it) and I think part of that is so people like them, and by extension, me for being with them? It’s so deep rooted and I have no idea where it came from. It’s making me wonder if I even really know myself, if all I am is fragments of what I think everyone around me wants me to be.

Besides that, she never seems to approve anything I do and yet, demands my time and attention:

1) I once said jokingly I'd marry in a black dress, and she got furious and said that was ridiculous. I mentioned wanted to travel the world, she said she'd never let me. I passed the college admission test and she went ""everyone does that"". I am not a native english speaker but can understand very it well but she says I can't, I must be lying. And she always says in a condescending, sweet tone and acts like a victim when called out.

I had band posters on my wall but ripped it off out of guilty when I was religious because of her. 

She is always complaining about my personality and that I should be the same as when I was ten years ago, problem being that ten years ago I just talked more; I still wasn't the person she wants me to be: I disliked the nicknames she gave me, hated and was grossed out by her need to be touching and kissing me all the time (that became a joke in our family! But nobody ever stopped her)

Now I've learned to assert myself better so I told I dislike physical touch and yet it seems that if I make a wrong move, she'll begin smothering me again. I also hate taking pictures so she used to hide away in order to take them, she's stopped now, thank god.

778,"Hi guys, this is gonna be a long one. A tl;dr will be at the bottom.

So I’m gonna start with some background information as it will make sense later. My boyfriend’s little brother Taylor has been in a relationship with Vanessa for four years and are high school sweethearts. They’ve always fought and had issues. In the beginning of their relationship she was texting with some of his friends from a different state and they were flirting, she also kissed a guy on the cheek that she worked with. He was able to forgive her for those things, but it did leave a slight bad taste in all of his families mouths when we found out. My boyfriend and I met her shortly after that and she was just cold and didn’t seem interested in getting to know us. My boyfriend and I just chalked it up to her being young and she probably wouldn’t stick around anyways. As there relationship progressed, Vanessa got very clingy to Taylor. He’d come stay the weekend with us, and be on his phone the whole time with her or she’d freak out. We’d often go to dinner with my boyfriend’s family and she would tag along, and they’d always just be to themselves, and we could hear them whisper fighting. Just weird, but again they were young so we ignored it. 

Fast forward after he graduated, he moved in with my boyfriend and I because there are much better jobs in our town. She would drive down every weekend to visit him. My boyfriend and I really tried to get to know her at that point and give her a chance. She seemed fine, but one day they were fighting on the couch and it put us in an awkward position. My boyfriend made a funny face at me and I laugh. Vanessa assumed I was laughing at her and stormed out of my house. When Taylor came back, he told us she was pissed at us and that she would never step foot back in our house again. I honestly was shocked, as she didn’t know I had just laughed at my boyfriends funny face. I tried telling him that, and he understood but she wasn’t having it. She then proceeded to block me on all social media, so I just forget it. 

Not to anyone’s surprise, she still came over every single weekend and avoided my boyfriend and I. Taylor would tell us she doesn’t feel like we like her, and I let him know if she wanted to talk and fix things we can, but he never brought it up again. We would hear them fight in his room, or he would tell us about fights later on. When we’d ask if he was happy or why he stays if they always fight, his excuse was always “we had a talk, and she’s changing, she’s so much more mature now” and within two weeks we’d hear another stupid fight. 

They ended up moving out into a place of their own together. When Taylor moved we never really saw him, and my boyfriend would only talk to him when they were playing video games together. While playing video games together my boyfriend would sometimes hear them fight over discord until Taylor muted it. We would still meet up and go to dinner with their family, and it was the same where they’d just stay by themselves and not engage with anyone else. Taylor never really told us what was going on with them anymore so we assumed things were fine. 

Taylor got a job working with my boyfriend, and the secrets started coming out. Every weekend they would fight. Usually because Vanessa wants to do something, and Taylor just wants to relax. He says he usually gives in just so they don’t fight. He has said that he’s unhappy with her, would rather be at work than be at home, he feels like shit every day when he knows she’s in her way home, doesn’t enjoy sex with her anymore, and doesn’t find her attractive anymore. He also said they do really petty things to each other like she unplugging his computer in the middle of games and they both messed with each other’s phones. 

He came over last weekend because they were fighting and he just wanted to talk. He let us know that she has said she doesn’t care about his family but expects him to always be around hers. When he doesn’t want to go with her to see her family, she’ll say things like “what will my family think of you if you don’t come.” That she threatened to take back everything she’s ever bought him. Just crazy stuff. He had told us he was done with her. He went home and talked and said they were just gonna take some space from each other but he didn’t wanna break up. 

A few hours later, he got a text from an old coworker with screenshots of Vanessa’s tinder account. He says he went to ask her about the tinder and they wrestled for her phone and she wouldn’t give it to him until she went pee alone, and when she was done she handed her phone right over. She was quick to come up with excuses saying it was probably her tinder from the first time they broke up three years ago. But that didn’t add up because the profile picture was one that she took in April of this year. Then she said she was being catfished. Which I’m not buying either since she’s very average looking and doesn’t have a lot of friends. He told her he was done and came over to our house. 

For the past four days he has been staying with us, but has seen her twice to talk about breaking their lease and is seeing her again to finally figure it out. She still is saying it’s not her account and would find him proof. Now from his coworkers job to where they live, the mileage away it shows on tinder is accurate. She yesterday made a fake guys tinder and somehow found this fake tinder of her of sent him screenshots. Problems with that is the mileage said 1 mile away, and the first picture on tinder was a different picture. The next day after he found out about the tinder, he made an account and couldn’t find the fake page, I also made a fake guys account to try to find it with no luck, but she managed to do it quickly yesterday. It’s just not adding up to me. 

Now for what I need advice on. I care about Taylor very much and just want him to be happy, but nobody in his family likes his girlfriend from the things she’s done to him, even before we knew about the tinder. He seemed done with her, but after he talks to her he seems hopeful there’s still a chance. The first night after they talked he told us well what if she is telling the truth and I’m gonna throw it all away, he doesn’t want to start over, she makes him happy and he misses her. He told us he was thinking about trying again with her is she promises to change. I had a long talk with him about how he deserves better, he deserves to be treated better and just some sappy stuff about how I haven’t honestly seen him happy since he first moved in with us. He agreed and changed his tone and said he was gonna he done with her. Yesterday he talked in the phone with her after she sent the screen shots. Again his changed his mind, why would she be trying so hard if she wasn’t going to change? And she promised she would fix relationships with everyone in his family. So I had a talk with him again, more sappy stuff about he’s allowed to grieve her and their relationship, but he needs to move on kind of talk. He seemed better and like he wasn’t going to go back. 

Taylor is going to talk to her again after work today and try to set in stone their plan to break the lease. I told him this should be the last time they really talk so he can start to heal. But since he’s already flip flopped so much, I’m afraid his tone is going to change again and he’ll be thinking of going back. Under normal circumstances I would stay out of it because it is his life, but I’m also really tired of how she treats him as it just seems toxic and not healthy. But I also don’t know what else I can say to him, or how to help him get over this break up. 

I know this was extremely long, any advice for me to pass on to him or how I can help him more would be greatly appreciated. 

Tl;dr
My boyfriends little brother has been in a roller coaster of a relationship for four years. They fought a lot, and towards the end he was unhappy with her.

779,"It's honestly jarring how I've been going through this loop of ""masturbate, waste time, promise myself to stop wasting time masturbating, sleep, wake up, masturbate, be late to work"", for almost a year now and it doesn't seem to go away, so I'm probably approaching this wrong.

I tried everything. I blocked my browsers from searching up porn, put a porn blocker on my phone to block me from accessing porn, but I just keep finding how to cheat the system.

Apparently, a VPN browser completely overrides a blocker that uses VPN, so lo and behold, now I waste time by finding how to watch porn with a blocker, and by watching porn.

It's also not possible to block internet explorer, so when on the PC, I just use that. In extreme situations, I skip the phone altogether and turn on my PC before work in the morning, and do the deed right there, which can take about 10-20 minutes.

780,"I’ve been into classic menswear since I was in Highschool, but through college I really refined my style and discovered a fascination with the rugged elegance of the American and English Edwardian/Late Victorian Era. 

I wear the styles all the time when I go out. Mostly High-backed denim trousers and popover work shirts this time of year, but if I’m going to an estate sale, auction, or shopping I might throw on a white linen suit just for kicks. I just love the aesthetic of the era: the clothes, the architecture, the stoic but optimistic general mindset of the time, it’s all just wonderful.

The 1890s might not be for you, but if another era or aesthetic is, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot. It might not happen all at once. I’ve been collecting for years and I’m still finding new things to try. But if you want to try out a new style, just go for it. 

However, as someone who has met other folks who consider themselves eccentric or uniquely styled, you will never have control over how people react to your style or way of doing. Some people with unique styles have a sort of fantasy about how they’d like folks to react to them. They want to be seen as fascinating, sophisticated, dark, edgy, or some other adjective. If you go through life thinking like this, you’re always going to be disappointed, and sometimes hurt.

I don’t wear a straw boater hat and a seersucker suit so people will tell me how antiquated I look, or ask me where I got my clothes. I wear it because I like how I look, and I take pride in putting a tasteful vintage outfit together. If folks want to ignore, compliment or deride, that is up to them. I’ll never shy away from a compliment, but I’m not going to let some bro telling me how I need to look more “GQ.” 

Be as unique as you’d like, but let your eccentricities make you stronger, not more fragile.

785,"Tl;dr: Rising junior thinking of taking fall semester off for personal reasons. Not sure if it's worth losing connection with peers at school or career/recruitment abnormalities.

Hey y'all.

I'm strongly considering taking a leave of absence from my school for this upcoming fall semester. Between Covid effects and personal reasons, it feels like I might get more out of staying home a bit longer than going back next week. The idea does have me super apprehensive though, and I'm trying at the moment to talk myself out of it somehow. I'd really appreciate any outside input on the validity of each option, as I honestly keep swinging back and forth with no commitment. 

So to start on drawbacks, I'm a rising junior so this isn't exactly the most conventional time for it. Taking a semester off right now is kind of cutting my college experience in half, and means I'll be pretty disconnected with the class of kids I've known for 2 years. This is sort of ok though, as I've been falling out and lost contact with all my old friends from school since Covid anyway. I'm mostly just worried this will mean I can't connect with anyone new when I come back in Spring (or fall since my study abroad is in spring), stuck between my class and the next without any kind of belonging. Missing the traditional graduation would suck not being able to experience it with friends, and also in a sense of just not being normal--having to explain the rest of my life why my twin sister graduated a semester earlier than me or have everyone I know wondering why I'm not up there. Then there's the employment issue where the whole recruiting cycle for my major (marketing) would be thrown off to an extent, and I'd likely need to wait an additional semester after graduation for most jobs to start--that makes me wonder if maybe committing to the whole year might be a better plan. I don't know. Mainly my biggest worry here is that I'm severing my connection to the school, and kind of giving up on any standard college experience or friends and that I'd be missing this historic (albeit inconvenient) time of school that all of my peers will share together. That bugs me, in a ""can't see the forest for the trees"" type way.

But I'm not raving about all this for nothing. I've thought about the idea of a gap even before Covid, seeing how being at such a rigorous school with pressure to network and always be on my game had really hit my mental health like nothing else. I'd been really self-sabotaging my relationiships, pretty directionless with career, and feeling incredibly beat down all of the time. This gap felt like it could give some much needed agency back to my life away from all of the externals. My parents are mandating I get a full time job, which I understand, but I also feel like I'll have the chance to slow down my life during off days, to take big hiking trips for the woo woo aspects, and to maybe grow into some dreams and motivation for when I come back to school. 

That's the hope, it could go terribly and I'd just deliver pizzas for 4 more months. In reality, my biggest fear is just severing connection with my peers, friends or not, and any concerns with COVID or career stuff is secondary. I'm just not sure if my melodramatics are worth all of it together, especially considering it would only be 3 months back at school before I'd be going abroad on what's basically a gap semester in its own right. I just want to make whichever choice I don't regret in 10 years, and I really appreciate any help here. What do y'all think?",29Jul2020,1

I would genuinely end up having panic attacks because of me thinking I was experiencing the same as the character. I felt like I was becoming the character.

788,My grandfather that basically raised me had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and has been given an estimated 6 months to live. I can’t even visit him because I know I’ll break down and make him feel bad. Our entire family was always saying how he was in such good health that he’d live to be almost 100. He’s only 70 and I’m only 16. I work 40 hours a week so there isn’t much time for me to even visit him. I just can’t imagine what’s going to happen later. I spent every day with him when I was a kid and now just like that he has 6 months. We can’t even visit him in the hospital because of the fucking coronavirus. I just need help getting though this. I don’t know what to do and feel hopeless.,29Jul2020,1
790,"I'm a 23 year old female and my boyfriend (23) is graduating from university this fall. I asked him what to get him (im very into big expensive gifts and parties) and he told me its not a big deal and I shouldn't get him anything. Now the thing is, his parents don't really care about his graduation because they are both extremly sucessful (a judge and a doctor) and he chose a degree in art and film and they both call his career ""an useless hobby"" or ""a painting summer school"" and i think he just doesn't wanna be reminded of that so he doesn't wanna celebrate. I'm also worried that it has gotten to him and he genuinely doesn't feel like it's a big deal even tho he loves what he is doing and is passionate about it and I absolutely know he is crushed about his parents not caring. I ofc didn't wanna make him uncomfortable so I agreed about not having a party but he gave in at the gift, however he set me a limit of 20-50$ which is way less than I was planing so I guess I am absolutely lost and need some ideas if any of you know any special (preferably not materialistic) things I could get. I feel extremly bad for him because ultimately I know he just wants his parents to show interest but idk how to make that happen so I wanna do something special.

She tried to ask them to take it down but they blocked her instead. She doesn’t remember the name of the account or anything so she can’t find it. I was hoping to find it to try to get them to take it down somehow but obviously cannot find it. I tried a reverse image search but that came up with nothing.

793,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 7 months. We haven't seen each other much this past few months because of lock down, so we're on the phone together for hours and hours every single day. 

Well when we're on the phone for 3 hours, every time I ask her what she's doing (which I do a lot to continue the conversation), her answer is always that she's texting. All of her friends are guys, she only has 2 female friends but she doesn't talk to them that much so it's always guys that she's texting. 5 of these guys are her exes (nothing serious, short 1-2 month relationships). But still, throughout the day she's just constantly texting and snapchatting back and forth with a bunch of guys. They also call her beautiful and flirt with her every single day. My girlfriend is very attractive and she says that if she had to stop being friends with every guy that complimented/flirted with her, she would have 0 friends. She says as long as she isn't doing it back it shouldn't be a problem. Furthermore, she only snaps pics of her face when she has makeup on. She's not allowed to leave her house but she still puts on make up like 3 times a week. I understand she wants to feel pretty since she's locked inside, but any day where she puts on make up, she facetimes all of her guy friends to talk to them. She never facetimes or snaps her face when she doesn't have make up on. 

Overall, she's talking to other guys and her exes 24/7. These guys are constantly flirting with her and calling her beautiful 24/7. On days where she randomly puts on make up, she facetimes all of these guys to talk. She also sends probably a million snapchats of her very obviously trying to look good to them. I know this because she has sent me videos/pics of herself that she saved while she was sending it to them. 

To me, it makes me feel like I'm not enough. Seems like she constantly needs all of this attention from all of these other guys. On the other hand, I have complete trust in her. She's always been extremely loyal and she can't lie to me. She is honest with me about everything and I have no doubt in it. You may be thinking 'What if you  just don't know some things' but I guarantee I know everything. She's the most caring, thoughtful, and loyal person that I've ever met in my entire life which is why I'm even putting up with all of this. But I just want to know everybody elses thoughts? Her reasoning is that she doesn't get along with other girls because they're filled with drama and gossip but guys are simple. But still, she's constantly talking to them, letting them flirt with her, and sometimes while we're talking she won't be paying attention to what I'm saying because she's too busy texting them.",29Jul2020,1
794,"I didn't used to believe that technology from an early age ruins kids. I (f19) didn't wanna believe it to be honest, but I'm sure that's what's happened to my sister. From a young age (10 or so) my younger sister (now 14) has had access to the internet and to her smart phone. I was a junior in high school before I got my first smart phone which I had to buy myself, and I didn't have internet on it until I was in college. 

My sister has stolen the wifi password from the home router and is constantly taking tiktoks of herself and posting them. Maybe it's my mother's paranoia getting to me, but we have a last name that is so uncommon, the only people that seem to have it are directly related to us. If someone finds her last name (she's had it on her profile before) they could find us incredibly easily by just googling us. 

To make matters worse, she's 14 but keeps posting more and more videos where she hikes her shirt way up, pulls her shorts way up, and does wildly inappropriate dances to sexual songs. Then puts them on the internet. She got caught with the internet once before and the password was changed but they didn't see her tiktok. 

I don't know what to do because, since people are following her she believes she's famous and can ""do what she wants"" which includes posting herself on the internet; my parents have specifically said this is something they don't want us doing but she never seems to listen. With her posting more and more suggestive stuff, I'm worried someone will take an interest and she'll put not only herself in danger, but her younger siblings as well. I've tried talking to her but it's like talking to, well, a child. Just eye rolling, and whatevers, and you don't tell me what to do's.  Please give me advice, I'm not sure what to do.",29Jul2020,1
795,"Using a throwaway for this. 

So i've been working at a daycare for about a year and a half now and i currently lead a 3 year old classroom (important- this was NOT my class pre- closing.) Due to the current situation we have new protocols in place in which the parents are not allowed in the building so i have never met any of the parents in my current class. 

About 30 minutes ago while patting the back of a little girl i felt a sensation on my arm and got spooked and jerked my arm out...accidentally whacking her in the arm and stomach 😭. At the time i was so surprised by what happened that all i could say was ""omg im so sorry"" and rubbed her arm and asked if she was ok. The girl coming in to give me my lunch break walked in right then and all she heard was my apology and i explained what happened in a very ""omg i feel so bad"" way and we both just laughed about it because it was so unexpected. The little girl did not say anything at all during this (she nodded her head yes when i asked if she was ok but other wise didn't say anything.)

As a teacher and the adult that was there i know it was just a funny accident but it occured to me as im sitting here on my break, if she goes home and tells her parents ""ms. daycarethrowaway9595 hit me""....they may not find it so funny. She wasn't hurt- mostly just confused as to why her teacher randomly whacked her but I'm torn between just leaving the situation alone or mentioning it to my director NOW just in case it does become something. 

Because of the new protocols- i've never met her parents personally. They know of me strictly through whatever their daughter tells them about me and what i put on her report home (just little notes about when she's had a challenging day or when she's been awesome and i want to praise her haha.) 

I'm a natural worrywart and don't want to make a mountain out of a mole hill and my room has cameras so it'll show that my dululu self was staring into space one minute and then the next i jerk out, out of nowhere and then rub her arm immediately afterwards so i'm not worried that i'll be accused of abusing her or anything but i just don't know what i should do NOW basically. 

Any advice please? 😭",29Jul2020,1

800,"Basically I’m type one diabetic and I’ve been working at this warehouse for a couple months and yesterday I had to leave to get something to drink to raise my blood sugar. I sat down for maybe 15min to let it go back up and the manager threatened to take my break away because of it. I’ve had many problems with this guy before and so have a lot of people. So I simply went back to talk to HR about it and they apologized and gave me my break back and said they’ll have me talk to the boss about this and they understand the manager has communication issues and they’ll have me talk about it tomorrow(now today). Today the boss came up to me and I knew we were going to talk so I said can we go back to the office so it’s so it’s more private and he said no and said we will talk here which was frustrating but then out of nowhere said I’m gonna make this real easy for u and then let me go. I was kinda shocked and asked, why did they not tell you what happened? he responded by basically saying it was my fault for not communicating this better so the manager didn’t know I had to go deal with my blood sugar. I explained it was an emergency and I didn’t even leave the building and he still was saying it’s my fault. I proceeded to try and talk it out with him and he said I don’t need you anymore and then said I have to fix my payroll anyway and that’s way more important than any of you.

I'm stressed. I'm afraid of catching HIV. I don't know whether my partner had it or not.

She:

\-is 30.

\-Had a lot of partners

\- Is from a country where 2% of population has HIV.

\-Was a drug addict for a little while. Now addicted to alcohol.

\-Never got tested on any disease and says never had any problems with health.

We both live in a country where 0.25% of population has HIV.  
We had sex once. Only vaginal(I'm male).

Are the chances of her being HIV-Positive high? And what are the chances of catching HIV if she was HIV-Positive?

806,"So I have this friend (lets call him Seth) who is 21 and he has autism. I honestly don't mind that he has autism as I have had other friends with the same thing and we got along fine, but Seth on the other hand has mostly high functioning autism (im pretty sure, i just looked both high functioning and low functioning and he has some on both sides of the spectrum). We became friends back in 2017 when we were in school and we used to hang out and go to each others houses to play video games, go trick or treating together (even though we were to old), go to haunted houses, hang out at six flags, hang out my other friends house (who im going to call Rick and he also has autism but its not bad at all compared to Seth. His autism is only noticeable when it comes to trains, old classic cars, and...furries).
Anyway, in the past I'm not sure if I even cared as much that he was annoying or even noticed it or mabye I did and just brushed it off, but recently it's became even more of an issue for me and my friend Rick. He has the mind of a child but at the same time has a dark sense of humor, likes edgy memes, death metal, rick and morty, my little pony, and wears jeans (even in the summer when its hot as hell outside), death metal shirts, my little pony shirts, or a shirt with star vs the forces of evil on it, a mask that has a skull on it that even post covid he would wear all the time over his face, painted fingernails, and long dyed red hair that he says he will never ever cut for some reason. Whenever he comes over to my house he always want to play on my xbox and never gets off of it, we usually take turns on GTA everytime we die but he always ends up going into a lobby midway into his turn and starts doing missions and I'm just left on my phone or laptop for the remainder of the time hes there. And if were not on the xbox or if I say I don't want to go on the xbox he whines like a 6 year old not getting his way and says ""why not!"" and ""come on please!"" and ""we'll take turns!"".
Recently we've been playing a new game on my laptop which he really likes a lot called ""The Torture Game"" and ""Happy Room"" (happy room is basically the torture game for those who dont know) and he forgot all about the xbox but sometimes forgets to give the laptop back to me when hes playing the games on my laptop. Another issue is whenever he talks he talks about a subject and i know im gonna sound like a complete dickhead but, he never. shuts. up. about what hes talking about. I always end up resorting to saying ""yeah"", ""cool"", ""same"", and ""mhm"" whenever he starts going on and on about whatever hes talking about whether it be a meme, the game were playing, something he wants us to roleplay about the game were playing, anime, music, etc, but he never picks up on the fact that im bored and uninterested. Sometimes ill get the question ""why arent you laughing?"" or if im trying to ignore him so he'll get the hint that im not interested in talking at the moment he'll say my name over and over and over again until I finally talk. Another thing he does is whenever I get into an argument or altercation or whatever you wanna call it with my parents he tries to act like hes the adult and says ""yeah you should really listen to your mom"" or ""you really shouldnt do that"" and stuff like that.
I am honestly to the point where I just wanna block his number and ghost him altogether but he has my address, his mom knows my mom, were going to the same college in august (though ill be on the 6th floor and he'll be on the 2nd which is good but he might just end up showing up to my room uninvited whenever he wants), me seth and rick have all been having a guys day every saturday and last saturday we didnt want him to come to where we were going but he came anyway. Another thing is Rick dosent even like him, he also thinks hes very annoying and gets on his nerves A LOT. I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I feel like I have no other choice than to be friends with him. I've tried to drop the hint that I didn't want to be friends anymore but he always is like ""no your just kidding"" and ""nooo were best friends"" and stuff like that. I don't want to just straight up tell him I dont want to be friends anymore because 1. he'll think its a joke and 2. i will feel like a huge asshole. Can someone help me solve this issue please?

808,"So, when I was a senior in high school and we were waiting in gym for whatever I don’t really remember, there was this guy, and he had this long tattoo that had a heart with a string or something around it with this date on it. I asked him what his tattoo meant and he said, “It doesn’t matter.” and shrugged it off like it was nothing. This confused me because aren’t most people who get tattoos and have them open to telling people what they mean? If he lost someone he didn’t even have to go into specifics, but why get a tattoo that meaningful if you’re not even going to talk about it? It kinda seemed like he put himself in that situation, and now anyone who sees that tattoo is going to ask that question. I just don’t understand the point of tattooing something that important on your arm if you’re not even going to tell people what it means or what it’s about. You can even just say, “I like bees/apples/starfish, etc.” I’ve had plenty of people tell me their reason as to why they got a tattoo. Some lost friends or family to cancer. Some celebrated being clean. Some wanted to remember someone or something really important to them, and so on. And that’s a reasonable answer, but “it doesn’t matter”? I just don’t get it. I really hope he removed it at some point if he didn’t want to talk about it. He could’ve gotten it on a dare, but I really don’t know.

I know that I have a problem, especially considering how I've drained my last cart within three days. 

&amp;#x200B;

For some context, my parents have a very unhealthy dynamic. My mom is 20 years younger than my dad, and he has all the monetary power in the household. We've been kicked out multiple times after my mom and dad get into a fight. A couple months ago, my parents and I got into a huge fight while I was in the shower. My mom heard me crying, made me turn off the shower (where I was then just naked and wet) and got my dad when I locked myself into the bathroom. My dad in turn started screaming at me and ending up partially breaking my door. Very unfun. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this being a couple months ago now, I've been having a ton of mood swings, and I struggle to even be slightly contradictory to my mom (and epecially my dad) without breaking down afterwards. Weed is literally the only thing that stabilizes my mood. Today is my first day in a while that I haven't been able to take a hit when I felt anxious, and it was very unfun. Theres an extra shower that I've been using since the incident with my parents, and its the only place that I feel comfortable. I meditate and shit in there, but the only problem is that sometimes being naked showering in a locked bathroom brings stuff back.

810,"Does depression and anxiety make you question your relationship?

So I’m 23 years old &amp; my boyfriend is 24 years old. He has made me feel things that no one has in my entire life. I’m a picky person I feel like sometimes I expect too much but I reciprocate what I want so I expect the same. I never thought anyone would meet my expectations but my boyfriend has(mostly). but I feel like sometimes my depression and anxiety make me question our relationship and I want to know if that’s normal. Or if it’s even my illnesses or just me not being honest with how I feel? i’ve read that no matter what’s wrong with you— insecurities mentall illness and all— you really love someone you love them and you just know, no questions asked. But sometimes I ask myself if I really do love him or if he’s just so incredible and loves me so much that I’m just going with the flow? I believe he’s my twin flame I’m extremely spiritual person and I wouldn’t just throw that around but I truly feel like he is. And then other times I am feeling the complete opposite it’s like a roller coaster and it’s not fair for me or him. Like for example yes he has met most of my expectations and he’s wonderful but there’s things about him that I don’t like and I wonder if that’s just me trying to look for something to complain about. 

For example, due to his life situation when he was younger and the death of his dad, he dropped out of high school. He’s obviously not in college, he’s had stupid car situations since he was like 18, he can be quite messy sometimes &amp; he has ADD so if you know what ADD is about you know the way people with ADD can be. He’s an extremely hard worker, pays his bills,  plans on getting his GED and we’re both working towards figuring out our lives and what we want to do career wise, we’re planning getting our own place together in the next year......so it’s not like he’s a bum or anything but sometimes those things really bother me about him. oh and the fact that he still lives at home. I mean after his dad‘s death, his mom has been broken ever since so I feel like a part of him is still home bc of her but..... still that’s something that kind of bothered me. 

Also, this is going to sound quite shallow &amp; I’m aware of it but I need to know if anyone has felt this way. So he’s genuinely a beautiful man. But in my head I point out things I don’t like. Like, his teeth not being perfect...... or when he’s not as buff and looks more flabby if we haven’t been working out. LIKE WHATS WRONG WITH ME? I feel like bc i’m insecure i project onto him, bc he’s a good looking guy, i’m attracted to him... so why do I post these things out? 
Also there’s something else I’m iffy about. So he’s a rider, meaning he rides bmx bikes, scooter, &amp; skateboards. He has competed professionally with BMX bikes &amp; scooters &amp; has traveled the world &amp; gotten paid time &amp; time again for it. It’s real cool because I’m skater guys but I kind of don’t like that he scooters. I kind of see it as a child’s toy &amp; even though he’s extremely extremely talented &amp; he’s probably one of the best in the game, I still don’t like it. I would never say this to him I would never discourage him I would never make him stop, but I feel so messed up for not loving his hobby. It’s just.... he’s such a big strong man and seeing him on a scooter it’s just so weird to me lol. 

So to circle back.... I really love this man as a person, he’s awesome, we connect on a level that I’ve never experienced before mentally spiritually and physically....he’s loving, cool,  adventurous, talented yet I find all these things that I don’t like about him or judge him for and it makes me think do I really love him? is it my mental illness? or is it just me and my feelings?

My boss said nothing, and I tried fighting back but he just told me it's true and I should leave the topic alone. Since then, I haven't been talking to him unless absolutely necessary, and planned to quit after the Harvest.

Fast forward to a month later, talking about COVID-19 he made a dumb remark along the lines of ""if they want to come to the event, they will. They're not scared of the Black man"". Apparently that is a saying in German. I held my breath and just thought, not today. Within 20 minutes of that stupid remark, my racist co worker used the term ""I'm drunk like a Sioux."" I asked him why he says that, and he said that statistically most Sioux's are alcoholics so that's why it's ok. I told him why that is a bad stereotype and why he shouldn't say that, as well as bringing up the Black man comments and why that's not ok. He then told me that I need to stop pushing my communist marxist agenda on the country, and that no one here wants to hear this ""bullshit"". He also said I should go back where I came from if I want to keep sticking up for the ""criminals"". I had to keep working with him for a few more hours, but there was so much going on we didn't have to speak.

I gave my letter of resignation and have to work there for 3 more months. When the next racist remarks come from him, which they will, do I not say anything and just go to the boss? Or do I still stand up for what's obviously right and deal with him getting aggressive and aggravated? My boss is very passive and usually doesn't stand up to his nephew, even if he's out of line. And because he is taking over the company soon, I have a feeling talking to the boss will not do anything and it will only make the next 3 months worse for me.

Do you have advice for me?",29Jul2020,1

816,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about two years and are complete opposites when it comes to politics. She's conservative and I'm liberal but for the most part we always find a middle ground with each other.

Today she shared a video from Fogcitymidge (conservative journalist) post on her social media saying how Hydroxychloriquine is a proven cure for COVID-19 (referring to White Coat Summit sponsored by conservative groups) and how doctors are saying that face masks are unnecessary and don't really protect against the coronavirus. This is infuriating to me because masks are such a small thing everyone can do to help combat the coronavirus. Even if they prevented it by .00001% I'd still wear it.

But, I always want to give my girlfriend the benefit of the doubt. After watching the videos and doing some research I called her on the phone and told her that I thought the video was wrong and how it was unethical for these doctors to push a drug that has not been proven yet. I also said it was wrong of her to be sharing these kinds of posts when there's not enough evidence. To be fair, I did come off pretty passionate about how wrong I thought the Fogcitymidge video was. I would love for these doctors to be right and for hydroxychloriquine to be the cure for COVID-19 but there's just not enough research to support it yet.

When I asked about her opinion on all this she cut it short and said she had to go to a work meeting. About 20 minutes later I receive really long texts from her saying that I'm acting like I want to break up and telling me to go F myself and that she's going to drop all my stuff off from her place later today. I replied to her saying I legitimately wanted to see things from perspective because she's my girlfriend and someone I support and trust. She's somewhat changed my views on issues like immigration and some gun regulations so I thought this would also be something worth discussing. But instead she's just saying how I'm now forcing my opinion onto her and also bringing up how my relationship with my parents is the reason why I'm like this.

Just wanted to get other people's opinions on all this. Thanks!",29Jul2020,1

820,"So Im a female and I'm very scared of men and relationships or sex. I've never been sexually abused or raped. I am however, a very overly trusting person and often find myself being taken advantage of. When I was younger several years ago I met a guy (we'll call him J) on social media. I thought he was my friend, blah blah blah and he asked me to send picture of myself or he would tell my dad, he used my dad's actual name (which I didn't tell him). So I told my mom rather than sending pictures (thank God) and it was fine. I find myself in those situations on social media alot, but I never learn. I never had a good father figure, growing up my dad was physically and mentally abusive and was always at the bar all day. He still holds his standards too high and lately is slipping back to his old habits. Anyways,  I was an early bloomer so the constant objectification of my body is exausting and scary, my friends always talk about my big breasts and it makes me uncomfortable. When I go to the store creepy men will stare at me (they make it so obvious too) and one guy tried to follow me when I left my group (I only left my group when we hungout downtown, as our town is very small and known for being safe). I'm a short and a small girl so it made me an easy target. Luckily, my best friend is always close by and she looks out for me (she's a tall and strong girl). Safe to say, I don't leave my group anymore. And when I'm out with my mom, I can't be alone in public at all, she lives in a bigger city and when I get lost from her in the store I will literally hide and cry and have panic attacks until she can find me, it scares her too when I get lost because she knows how vulnerable I am to this kind of stuff and how scary it is for me. Also, Ive had a couple of dreams where I literally got raped in them, my dreams are always so vivid, they feel real so it's quite terrifying. I can't get in a relationship because I feel like every guy will hurt me at some point. I've literally only been close to one guy who hasn't ended up hurting me. I know that there are really amazing men out there and I want so badly to find love, but it's hard. And it's scary.",29Jul2020,2

829,"My mom(44F) just yelled at me(14M) and shrieked, an overreaction worthy of a cartoon character, for missing music class because I was never told the confusing ass schedule by the school and I missed one psychologist apointment. I acknowledge it is my fault but damn do I hate her reactions to me failing. She shrieks and acts like I’m a wild animal and whenever I bring up her treatment to me she says “bUt I nEVeR InSUlTEd yOU”. That’s the trick, be a dick but never say you insulted anyone. Either way, I cannot seem to convice her that she’s wrong on anything so she just commands my dad to talk to me and actually be a decent fucking person (he’s a great dad, but a diehard simp for her). She’s always acting like she’s ahead of the curve and a library of knowledge that shall not be questioned, when she’s just a good con artist in reality. So good in fact, she believes her esoteric magic bullshit. She does weird esoteric shit like getting another woman to draw a uterus with her blood and never questions the ethics and morals of her actions. She always acts like she’s an empowered, sexy and strong woman when in reality she’s just a bossy, decent looking 40 year old woman with too much power on her hands.   
I once overheard her say “yeah I’m a super perfectionist” yet I’ve never heard her unsatisfied with what she does and she’s never questioning any of her actions. I’ve only ever seen her ask for advice ONCE.   
The worst part is that she justifies it with phrases like “I’m the mother he needs” (why would you reject self improvement to intentionally make your son’s life worse???) or shit about her childhood being worse and her parents divorcing when she was young. While she did have a shit early life, I don’t deserve to suffer like she did. Her bad memories don’t justify giving others bad memories.   
So anyways, she always commands my dad like a fucking soldier to solve her problems and she never faces her issues head on or try new methods. She’s probably dissapointed on my depressing existential world views because I’m her son and of course I can choose a different carrer path, but I have to be the same fucking person because I’m her son and she’s the greates fucking woman to ever grace this beautiful non suffering earth... right???      
I’m no psychologist, but she really gives me the narcissist vibes.  
    
What can I do to get her to shut up and reconsider? Right now I’ve considered acting like she doesn’t exist, acting like the perfect robot she wants and then tell her it was an act I put up for her to love me and probably the best one, suicide. She’s the cause I want to just point a gun to my head and blow my brains out.

831,"I want to start off by saying I deeply, deeply love my husband and we have a lot of respect for each other. We have been together for six years and met while we were still teenagers. We've been married for almost two years.

I have suspected that he might have some emotional abuser tendencies for a few years, but have chalked it up to his own history with abuse or me overreacting. He reacts like a child would with angry outbursts and has a very hard time communicating. What worries me most is when I try to talk about a difficult or controversial topic or something that hurt me, he acts in a pattern. He internalizes it to be an insult directed at him, and then will build his anger until he's either shouting at me or speaking quickly in rapid outbursts insulting me and not stopping even if I'm sobbing or clearly heading towards a panic attack. I spend a lot of time working on communication skills and went through therapy for a number of years. I am not perfect by any means, but I am willing to apologize and take responsibility for my actions and change my actions. He is not. He will only apologize after the fact and after I've been shit on and yelled at or isolated. 

He has a hard time empathizing but he is truly a very kind, loving person. I know how this sounds, like I'm making excuses for him, but I cannot stress enough what a good person he is. Which is why I don't know how to handle this situation. There are other personal details (I'm in grad school, neither of us have steady incomes, living situation, etc.) that make this situation even more challenging to address. He is also extremely close with my mother and other family members, which is why I am going to the internet for advice instead of through them. 

I love my husband. I just cannot handle the way he's treating me and how it's a clear pattern. I would really appreciate advice on this. I know I can't change him, but I must be able to offer him the tools to change. I don't want to live my life in a situation like this but I also don't want to live my life without him.

I don't know what to do right now.

I just found out his username and decided to pay his profile a visit. (Who wouldn't want to know what their sibling is doing online? I'm not close to him myself so i took this as an opportunity to learn more about him and see what he's been up to). 

I was scrolling and everything was going alright. He was tweeting like a normal guy, but then I stumbled upon something I didn't expect to see. He had stated on one of his tweets that he was pansexual and he was taken (by a guy i don't know).

This obviously shocked me.. he never really struck me as that type of person. I began to panic and even now I'm still anxious about it. It's literally 2am right now and I'm crying under the blankets. I have alot of secrets to hide myself, I didn't know my brother would hide deeper ones.

My senior class is having a meet-up dinner for a few hours as our “last get together” before we all leave for college (I have a small graduating class of 14 people, so the event will likely be around 20 people with the hosts’ family and extra guests). Luckily, the event is outside. However, no one will be wearing masks. With that, a lot of people haven’t been wearing masks when meeting with other groups of people and/or traveling unless they are required by an institution to do so. People will be eating, dancing, talking without distancing at all or make wearing and it’s making me nervous in what to do.   

On one hand, this is probably the last time we’ll all be together like this. I’ve known some of these people for 12 years. Like it would suck to be that one person in this friend group who didn’t go as they post pictures and videos and homages to their friends on social media, I would be sad if I missed out when there wasn’t a super high chance of covid spread. 

On the other hand, covid is rising fairly fast where I live. There’s 60 people in the ICU with covid, so if the true number of cases is 5-10 non-hospitalized/asymptomatic cases for every 1 severely sick, that’s not a comforting number for my county. Further, our percent positive cases has nearly doubled to 5%, which I’ve heard indicates true community spread rather than just an increase in testing. I don’t want to put my parents at risk, which my mom has one or two risk favorites and both parents are doctors, my father who actually goes into work everyday. And, I’m moving into a college dorm on Wednesday, so if I get infected at this party, I’m also exposing my roommate and possibly everyone at the dorm/university.

I think I can say that we both enjoyed spending time together. However, since February, it's been really... different. Barely responding (not picking up the phone to chat but rather chatting when picking up the phone - once per hour or so, it doesn't feel like chatting anymore, really bland too, no interest), they're not really bringing anything up anymore, nor asking anything about me, nor asking anything, now that I think about it. I'm always the one keeping the chat going. Since then, besides being ignored, I've been insulted (which never happened before) and guilt tripped.

850,"So, I am a person who is kind of questioning their sexual and romantic orientation and as a part of this, I was wondering how romance actually feels like.

I have never been in a relationship before and I really what to know from you guys who have been in relationships and experienced romance, how does it feel like.

To me, though I have never had any crushes on anyone, I sometimes tend to feel lonely and stuff ( although that may stem from my lack of friends in general) and I feel like if I ever want a relationship it probably is for that. 

Also, whenever it comes to actual relationships and stuff, the idea of being with someone is attractive to me, like having someone who you can tell everything, and that you can cuddle with and stuff, that sounds real nice to me.

Somehow, I can never picture myself as to being in a relationship and experiencing that. I always see myself as if "" When I do get into a relationship, I will take care of my partner and love them because that is my duty as their partner and stuff. Like, I care for my partner because they are my partner.""

She left me because her ""feelings changed"" which is fair enough; I think lockdown took its toll on our relationship and I would never want her to hide her feelings from me so I'm glad she was honest. I've always been a very content guy, I'm extremely lucky and a broken heart is nothing compared to what some people are going through, but I think I've come across genuine sadness. I keep busy and we aren't in contact anymore-infact she is in a different country at the moment for 3 weeks- and I see my friends. My thoughts always eventually come back to her as when we were together I looked forward to seeing her so much as we saw each other basically everyday at school for two years. We had a lot of fun and happy times, we went abroad together etc etc. 

In order to keep things short, life just hasn't felt the same since. I've always been very happy like I said, I do feel happy when I see my very supportive friends and family but I always always always crash down to square one again, feeling hollow and a bit lost. Even if I'm just sad for 5 minutes, its a stark reminder of her absence. I don't feel the slightest bit interested in any other girl, instead the thought of anything like that makes me feel sick. 

I don't really want attention or any ""I'm so sorry"" comments but I just want to know, do any of you still have feelings for your very first true love? Not your first relationship, but for the person that made you feel homesick when they went somewhere.",29Jul2020,1
853,"I gave too many damns in my life. About others.

* how do they think about me?
* what would they think if I say so?
* why did he scold me?
* Why didn't he wish me?
* Why did he tell like that?

etc etc.

So I have read a couple of websites regarding this &amp; looked into some other Reddit posts too. But it didn't help.

I do agree &amp; it all makes sense that giving a fuck about others is time waste and not the worth. I do agree and all the points I can see in these sources make sense to me. But it just not helping me to not to give a fuck. That means, practically I don't know how to get rid of it. Those websites tell a lot about why I shouldn't give a fuck but they are not telling how to not give a fuck. My question is how to practically get rid of giving a fuck? Are there any books that deal with the psychological perspective of it? How to adopt them &amp; get good results from them? Does it really come from practice?

TLDR: How to not give a fuck &amp; apply those theoretical suggestions in a practical way? What are some good books about it?",29Jul2020,2
855,"I’m 19f and my best friend of 3 years is 18f. I recently moved in with her 8 months ago. Since then, we’ve shared everything and I mean everything. Shoes, clothes, undies, makeup, ect. It was really fun at first, no worries and just having fun. But we are fairly different people when it comes to hygiene, and upkeep with things. I like to be very clean, organized and considerate with the things I own and I like to keep the apartment clean. The problem is, she’s exactly the opposite. And while I don’t mind this about her, I do mind when it comes down to using my things that I bought with my own money and with our shared spaces. She has little to no regard about this and thinks of everything as no big deal. She spills things on my clothes, uses my makeup and doesn’t put the caps back on, and just generally has no regard for cleanliness around the house with the dishes, laundry, or trash. I know she doesn’t do it to be rude, or disrespectful, I understand she’s younger and less mature than I am about things. She also struggles with depression but I feel like I have to do everything myself. I’ve had multiple easy conversations about this with her, asking her for more help when cleaning and trying to make it easier for her, like saying “I loaded the dishwasher, can you unload it?” and she will, the problem is it isn’t consistent and I know that if I don’t ask her, or don’t do it myself, it won’t get done. It’s all very frustrating and I deal with severe mental health issues as well and it’s causing quite the strain on me. My question is, how do I have another conversation with her about this? I’m unsure of what the right things are to say at this point :(",29Jul2020,1
856,"my friend really wants me to come over but the government and my parents still says not to. both my parents work front line jobs and have coworkers who have tested positive for covid19. My friend also works with my mom but he works a different job that is less out with the public. He said his parents are fine with me coming over but i really don't think they understand how at likely my parents are to get covid19 and how likely i am to get it from them or how bad it is.  i am pretty introverted and i am not sure how to tell him that there is not way i can come over and that i shouldn't go over.

&amp;#x200B;

here is our latest conversation

friend: 

ok well just let me know I don't have anything planned tonight

me:

i can not come over my mom explained why she said that she works in the front end and my dad works on a bus and they are at way more of a risk than you and she does not want me to give it to you  but if you want we can hangout out side

friend:

Ok if you want we can play online some more tonight. I guess that means no work and no school for you this year if that's her rationale

Also why is your mom making decisions based on assuming our risk. My parents are very much ok with you coming over they are even letting me work alongside your mom with all of the same risks. Do your parents think my parents are old and vulnerable or something lol. I am at more risk than you are by working 

You can wear a mask and my parents will stay away from you we will even sanitize your area after you leave if we felt that was necessary but we don't really think that's necessary unless that will allow to come over

857,"So I've (M16) been talking to this girl (F16). I think things were going pretty well, but not so much now.
Backstory 
I meet this girl through my cousin, they're best friends, and after a while we started talking. We've hung out a few times.
Also, my cousin is in 4H and shows sheep.
Mainstory 
So this week their is something called the CCJLA shows where all of the 4H kids in this county show their animals before the auction on Thursday. The girl that I'm talking to went to help my cousin in helping set up the pens for the shows. The girl had mentioned to me that she was going to help (I didn't know that the shows were this week) I asked what shows she was talking about and she told me. This was yesterday.
Skip foward to this morning, I asked the girl if she wanted to go get lunch and she said that she was going to the shows (I thought I knew what she was talking about, but I thought she was only helping set up) me wanting to make sure I knew what she was talking about, I asked ""What show?"". She then said that if I wasn't going to pay attention to what she said, to not even talk to her at all. We said some other things then I asked something like ""The CCJLA shows?"" She then said to leave her alone about it so I said, ""Okay, I'm sorry, I'll leave you alone""
That was about an hour ago and we haven't talk since, I know I fucked up by asking about it, I just want to know if I should text her again to apologize or not.",29Jul2020,1

861,"Hi everyone, 

I would like to ask for an advice, but i also do not need any moral policing.

I am an immigrant from North Africa to a European country. I also am an engineer. Female.

I joined a new company 3 months ago and i very much love the project and the area.

I have this colleague who started making jokes about my being different and basically telling me every stereotype known to mankind about where i'm from. Which i'm completely used to. I have been in this country for quite some time now. I've seen it all and heard it all and i try not to take personally. 

Some examples include ""my"" diet preferences, ""my"" religious beliefs, ""my"" skin colour, and ""my"" socio-economic situation.

\- Why don't you eat pork. Oh you don't even eat pork.

\- You drink alcohol, you're definitely going to hell.

\- Why are you claiming to be sensitive to sun exposure, you're not Swedish if you've noticed.

\- You ""religious group"" are ""insert joke""

\- You don't live in a studio appartment. Wow, you're rich!

\- When will you treat us to some ""insert typical ethnic food""

He flirts with me a lot too.

Etc...

My problem is it's been 3 months and this is not even closed to finished. 

My ego is reacting to these stories because i too have issues with my country, family, and beliefs. I do carry some conditioning which makes me believe that i am inferior to white people and that people who look like me are inferior (in infrastructure, intelligence, civility, etc) and i am working through it. 

I also have some attachment/abandonment issues in regards to my parents, which i believe to be the reason why i keep them at a distance and choose to live very very far away. But these are my own issues and it takes time to integrate childhood trauma. I do have my own beliefs which by my language you might or might not recognize. But i do not think i owe it to anyone to explain my views on metaphysics. I have been in therapy for quite some time now, and i am working through my own healing. I do not expect people to be aware of my story. But i am aware of my ego's stories. And i kind of pick up and these kind of things in other people, and psychoanalyze them (which a huge asshole move).

This man did almost die. He had an illness which left a lot of damage. I am aware that coming to terms with this irrepearable damage is very hard. So he over-compensates with a very extraverted personality and lack of sensitivity, because what's worse than death? A child with a psychological disorder, and his jokes on women and their bodies might lead one to feel a lack of sexual expression with his wife. 

He also didn't go to university or engineering school, so he might feel like he should over-compensate for that too, as most of our colleagues have similar degrees.

It's an asshole move for me to make the previous judgements and assuptions about this man's life. And i am an asshole. But i want to be strategic and pragmatic and make this work. I just know that if this goes on for too long, it will be on the detriment of my own psychological limitations. I do believe i am inferior and not civil because of where my physical body was born. And that is a healing that will take a lifetime for me to achieve. But in the meanwhile, girl's gotta pay the rent!

Compassion is not enough, and i do try very hard. 

He is confused about his ego stories:

\- ALL ""ethnic group"" are ""X"". She says otherwise. I am confused. I will make jokes to test my beliefs

\- I almost died. I'm not even sure i exist. So i will use provocation to validate that i do exist.

\- She has more years of education than me (thus proportional salary) so i will draw attention to her sexuality instead to prove that i am still a superior man.

So, my question for you is: How do i use his limitations to get him to shut up without being actively mean. Through subtle manipulation.

Do you have some NLP techniques i can do?  No direct communication please, I shant.

I know this is a weird request

Thanks",29Jul2020,1

   My game plan for school is, “Shut up, don‘t say a word, listen, and keep your head low. Don’t try to make too many friends in too little time. If it has so much drama you can’t handle it, act shy, if you have no choice.” As harsh as that sounds. 

   My parents are shoving potential after-school activities ideas down my throat, like, five times a day, and I don’t know what to say to their requests. Usually things I don’t really want to do. Some activities I may actually do, but most of them I’m not even interested in.

   I have so little time to do everything I want to, and even less time to animate. My parents don’t want me to stay up too late, but I actually have no choice...

865,"This is a mess, okay, here we go. 

I have a neighbor ""linda"" who a few days ago offered me a job where she works. The deal was, i had to take care of a disabled veteran ""leroy"" mon-fri 6am-8am and every other weekend I'd have to get him up in the morning, two hours, go home, come back and bring him lunch and dinner, and then get him into bed at night, 2 hours. Pay was up to $210 a week, under the table. 

I took it initially because i wanted some extra disposable income anyway, liked that kind of caregiving work, and it didn't seem all that difficult, except for the weekends, i really didn't care all that much for the weekends setup. 

Anyway, i worked this last weekend for him and learned a lot about the ""situation"", situation being that he is in love with his main caregiver ""laura"" who financially abuses him who has a daughter ""sarah"" who also works for him. Who i replaced because she wasn't answering his calls. 

So i worked the weekend and then sunday night he fires me telling me that sarah has more claim to the job because she's worked there for ten years and he's going to give her another chance. Linda told me that Laura told him that if he didn't fire me and let sarah come back that shed quit too, and of course he couldn't have that, so. 

Linda just called me and told me that leroy is trying to get ahold of me to offer me my job back because sarah didn't show up for work and he fired her. 

I don't know whether i should take the job again. It kinda feels like a whole can of worms I'm not sure i wanna deal with. But leroy doesn't have a lot of people who care for him and i want him to have a nurturing caregiver that's not going to abuse him or take all of his money. On the other hand, leroy is VERY conservative, and i am like, as close as it comes to not conservative that it gets. I'd pretty much have to lie about my entire life in order to work for him. 

I also don't want to disappoint Linda, since i took the job the first time, but that was before i found out about all of this.

868,"Please before you be judgemental, read till the end.

I believe I am a good friend. Never had I betrayed my friends trust and had been always loyal to them. Always there when someone wants to talk or needs a service from me. Always answering their texts/calls and ready to talk. In fact, I have friendships that lasted more than 10 years, 8 years, 6 years etc. Some of them are lasting since elementary and middle school till now. When I started college in another country, I started having real bad social anxiety and this extremely affected my social life. I am now a Junior and friends I made here throughout all the three years can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Anyway, this is not the topic I will get to the point now.

This might be an unpopular opinion, but I am planning to give up on all the long lasting friendships I made simply because I do not see that my friends have changed in any way, I do not see any improvements in the way they think or live their lives. They are still believing in some cultural bullshit that they had been fed for years from their surroundings, they do not search or seek knowledge, and they're just conforming to social standards, I feel like they are just living and relying on the time to make their lives better for them. Moreover, when I start a conversation with one of them it always comes to the same topic and we would start talking about some bullshit and after hours of talking I will find myself left only with ""Junk information"", nothing is added to my brain not even a single idea. Basically not constructive discussions at all. Just to stress it here, **I do not feel superior at all and I never made them feel that they are not improving or whatever**. I would give advice and make subtle comments about bad things they do without making them feel bad or lower they self-esteem.

Why this bothers me is the question. I am 21 years old and I want to improve, make connections with people who have shit to talk about, discuss real life matters, have deep conversations with them, sit in a mannered way and make serious eye contacts when talking about an important topic. Not having a friend who would jump out of nowhere and says a joke that is not even funny and not even furthering the conversation. I will say it clearly here, I am ashamed to even introduce all my male friends to my parents or the few people I made friendship with in the foreign country. This starts to heavily make me feel alone and I do not know if you got the picture of all what I said, but it just sucks... most of the time.

Please do not be judgemental. I am not a bad person, I am in a period of my life where I have to destroy all bases I had since childhood and have to start making real changes, simply because they are not bringing me any good. What should I do? Should I just keep being the good friend and try to enjoy those junk conversations and forget about it? Maybe make new friends that fit with my personality while still being in contact with the others? What will be the good thing to do here?

I majored in CS in college, worked a couple different IT support jobs while in college, my job real-world job was a developer, and now I'm more or less an IT business analyst.  I'm realizing that the IT world in general is not something I want to do long term.  I don't care about learning about all the new technologies that are coming out, I don't care about getting certifications, and I'm tired of figuring out people's IT problems for them.

My wife is planning on graduating from her PhD program (neuroscience) in the autumn of 2021 and after that we plan on moving out of the state my current job is in.  I've been successfully working from home since March due to COVID, so I’d be lobbying to take this job remotely to wherever we move to.  At this point, I just tolerate my job while my wife finishes her PhD and gets her career going.  If she gets a pretty good job and our finances allow it in the next 2-3 years, I'd plan on leaving my job for something simpler.  Of course every job is going to have its own difficulties, but I want something conceptually simpler than working with and troubleshooting software and programming.

Animals and wildlife are one of my biggest passions, so I want to work somewhere related to that, like a zoo, wildlife sanctuary, government department of wildlife resources, etc…just doing administrative work or clerical work, or even better, working directly with animals (unfortunately I don't have the opportunity to go back to school for wildlife biology or ecology or something).  It’s just something I care about more and I realized that if I want to be satisfied and fulfilled long term, I need to be involved with something I actually care about.

So...

**1.** My manager and I have 1-on-1 meetings every so often to go how work's going, what I need help with, what my career goals are, etc.  I have a pretty good relationship with him.  How safe is it to be 100% honest with him as I'm being with you guys now?  I wouldn't want to risk losing my job too soon because I basically tell them that I'm out in 2-3 years.

**2.** If/when I do start interviewing the kind of jobs I do want and they inevitably ask something along the lines of ""Why do you want this job?"", how do I explain that **I just wanted to take a step back in my career and do something less stressful with an organization that does something I actually care about** without sounding like I'm saying ""I'm lazy and wanted an easier job.""",29Jul2020,1

I find it had to say no straight away and will usually sacrifice my own commitments just to go to a cafe or a party with them - even though I never look forward to doing so or enjoy it as much as I do other things I do on my own.

877,"I decided that I was gonna move 5 hours away to a brand new state and start a new job. My friend got me the job and we “work” together. I got a place of my own for the first time in a long time. On paper things seemed good... but then it all went down hill. 

For starters from interview to starting the job takes 4 days max, the management here managed to stretch that out to 25 days... I got my place 3 weeks ago because they told me I could start 2 weeks ago (side note I sell cars for a living) so the job left me with 5 days to make rent on my new place ($1250) I started Monday of this week and it’s been a disorganized mess. The GM won’t even let me sell cars yet even though I’ve got experience and he know my situation with needing to make rent. I’m starting doordash tomorrow just to be able to eat and try to pay my insurance. My friend agreed to cover rent for me this month cause he knows that once I have the money I’ll pay him back but I still gotta cover my insurance and my best friend is paying my phone bill till I can pay it. 

So that’s my job situation now onto my car. I have awful credit so buying pos cars is all I can do. My bestfriend gave me her Jeep because she bought a new car and this thing has so many freaking problems I’m surprised it’s still driving. On top of that I live 30 mins away from the job and it eats gas so I’m struggling for gas money. 

The friend that got me the job, well me and him have been friends for 2 years and he promised me this job and swore up and down I could make 3-5k a month and I know I’ve only been here 3 days but I don’t like the people I work with and this friend that got the job is acting just different. Idk if I’m being paranoid but I feel like he doesn’t want me here even though we talked about this for almost 2 years. 

Now onto my bestfriend. I’ve been in love with this woman for 10 years. She has a daughter (2) and even though I’m not her bio dad I still play the role. Her and I were staying with her mom for the last 8 months and I decided to move up here to start the job and have a house for our little family. Side note we aren’t dating just really close (she friend zoned me haaaard) she’s moving up here and quitting her management job in September. 

Now the house, I like it, it’s cozy. It’s waaay to big for one person and unfortunately internet was gonna take 5 weeks to get set up (fiber line) I’ve got 2 weeks to go. I have no cell service at the house so I order to talk to my bestfriend I have to drive into town (13 mins away) which eats up more gas. 

I have $3.47 I don’t get paid until the 7th and that’ll only be $600 and it’s considered draw which means I owe the dealership that money back. On top of owing my friend $1250. I’m lonely, I’m stressed, I can’t get my anxiety under control. I feel like I’m loosing it. I can’t just give up and go back to her moms house. That isn’t an option. So I’m stuck. I feel like I’m suffocating. I just don’t think I can go on much longer like this. Time feels like it’s moving so slow. It took me only 10 mins to type this but it felt like 30... someone please help me figure out what to do and how to survive.",29Jul2020,1
878,"Quarantine has been really difficult for me, just like it has been for pretty much everyone. 

I’ve been struggling hard with my mental health about a month into it, around the same time the country was moving towards long term quarantining plans. Due to my boyfriend’s living situation and his parents’ feelings, I have been unable to be within 6 feet of him since mid-March. As per rules imposed by his parents, I can’t be indoors with him or them either - so 99% of when we see each other is outside or I’m in my car. This has put a strain on our relationship and the only way to fix this is for him to move out. He’s currently been in the process of doing so and just made an offer on a place, but every time he finds a place, someone else ends up closing on it. 

On top of this, we’ve had fights that resulted in me feeling unheard or unsupported. He has been struggling hard with his mental health too, so I know it’s hard for him to support and listen to me. I do my best to listen and support him. After a conversation we had about 6 weeks ago, I felt myself completely close off. First, the conversation was about how deeply I love him and it made him feel “flattered but I don’t feel that strongly about you right now”. Then it devolved into how I’ve been really stressing him out because I’m not okay right now.

After that conversation, I just felt myself close off. I don’t feel comfortable telling him how I feel. I’ve been re-evaluating my feelings towards him. I feel hurt by some of the things he said, even though they were true. Even though I’m still deeply in love with him, I’m starting to feel a similar way I did in previous relationship: not hopeful, emotionally closed off, low expectations of promises and intentions, to name a few. I also don’t feel as strongly about him as I did before and I’m concerned that I’m feeling this way. 

The nail in the coffin on me really feeling this way was when he went back on a promise he made me about a week or so ago. He promised me that when he moves out, he promised that I would move in with him if/when a Covid second wave hit. He backed down from it because of all the time we spent apart and he wants to feel more comfortable again. I don’t have an issue with that in a vacuum (because honestly I need to feel more comfortable myself), but because he made such a promise and just broke it without a second thought. I have a huge issue with people promising me things and not following through. I always clarify a person’s promise to make sure my expectations are valid and I’m understanding the promise. Even though I’m feeling uncomfortable too, he just broke the promise without even having a conversation about it and it just hurt. I feel like if there was a conversation about it, we would have both realized we were both feeling the same way and worked on it together instead of him just backing out and making me feel bad.

With all of this going on in my life, I don’t feel comfortable reaching out to anyone. I don’t feel motivated to talk to friends or my family. During quarantine, I’ve barely talked or spent time with anyone and have just been experiencing this apathy about everything going on. I’m starting to feel overwhelmed whenever my boyfriend is stressed out. I don’t feel comfortable expressing how I’m feeling anymore in fear of being misunderstood or being invalidated. 

I’ve been working out these issues and my own problems with a therapist. 

I posted to see if anyone had any insight on the situation or advice on how I can maybe overcome this. Maybe I’m overreacting. Maybe I need to work more on this with my therapist. I really don’t know at this point. I’m just really lost.",29Jul2020,1

so her mom isn’t prioritizing her future or her education, and is spending money on unnecessary things (they just moved into their current house like 2 years ago, and she keeps buying extra home appliances). my friend can’t get a job because they only have one car and their new house is in the middle of nowhere. she’s brought up to her mom in the past that her loans need to be paid off or else her credit is going to get bad, but they have a close relationship (like best friends), and my friend really doesn’t see the harm in her situation and how much of an issue this can become in the future. she won’t put her foot down with her mom, her dad is completely out of the picture. 
we have a few family friends who have offered to help her find a job, or give her a part time where they work. she doesn’t want to accept the help, and even if she did, she would have no means of getting to work. she won’t move out of the house because she would feel bad leaving her mom on her own (she prob thinks this way because her mom is manipulative and immature)

887,"Hey all - this is 50% venting, and 50% looking for advice.

  
I got an email address for one of my fav all time rappers off of his verified Instagram page. I reached out to him, introduced myself, let him know a few things about me (worked with a few dif platinum &amp; Grammy nominated artists, produced tracks for some Netflix movies, charted a couple different albums on iTunes, etc), and sent him a track I wanted him to hop on.

  
The next day he emailed back saying that he loved the song and gave me a price for a verse. I got his CashApp name and sent him 60% down. He accepted it and has been completely unresponsive in the two months since. I've sent him an email checking in every couple weeks, and a couple texts - always super positive and friendly.

  
I've had similar arrangements with other relatively well-known artists before and have never had any issues.

  
I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt, so I haven't called him out or gotten aggressive about getting the verse or getting my money back because first and foremost I want to do a track with him and upsetting him doesn't seem like a good way to accomplish that. He's perfect for the song, and I think it would turn into a smash.

  
As I see it, I have the following options:

  
A) Take the L  
B) Reach out to some people we've both worked with before and ask about him? Would probably be a little embarrassing for him, assuming he's not a sociopath.  
C) Small Claims?  
D) Give him some time and hope he's just busy.  
E) Spread the word (doesn't seem productive, but if I'm really getting ghosted, then eff the guy)

888,"I know its unrealistic of me to just pack up my things and move. Especially during a pandemic and me not having a job. But I just cannot take my family anymore, I want to move out. My dad is bi-polar and has a lot of anger issues. He gets irrationally angry all the time and always takes it out on my mom and I. He’s never laid a hand on me or my mom (he just smashes things and punches walls), but hes very verbally abusive. I hate the feeling of always walking on eggshells around him. 


Hes also super controlling. I’m not allowed to close my door, or have any privacy. I just recently got the “privilege” of having my own room. I used to sleep in the same bed as my mom (so she can keep a close eye on me). I am not allowed to get a job or talk to any boys. My parents listen in on my phone calls to make sure I’m not talking to any boys. I can’t have friends of different races or have my own opinion on anything.

891,"So in total we have 6 cats in our home. 2 belong to me and my bf. 3 to our roommates. And 1 is their foster. Our roommates also have 3 dogs, 2 of which they keep outside, one of those I  wanna add is a beautiful purebred fawn Doberman. We live in their house so we don’t have a say in much that goes on around here. We’ve never had problem with our cats, they’ve always been healthy. but recently both my bf and I and our roommates kids have all gotten ringworms all over us. I’m training to be a vet tech so I did a basic physical examination on all the cats to try to figure out where these came from. We’re figuring the foster they brought it brought it with him and has infected all of our cats who have infected us. The worst of the bunch is the youngest kitten. He’s probably about 2-3 months old, He’s completely covered in ringworms especially on his stomach and face. When I brought it up to our roommate that we all have ringworms and the cats are just as bad and we need to take all the cats to the vet to get checked and get medications, and told her she needs to get a special cream for her kids so they’re not passing it around, she straight up just said “they’ll go away on their own it’s fine”. this to me is neglectful as a pet owner and a parent because as a mother myself I would never say that about my child and would do absolutely anything to help him feel better. my bf and I want to get rid of these ringworms completely as not only are we uncomfortable but so are our cats but we can’t if she doesn’t treat her cats and kids. We’ve contemplated calling the shelter she fosters for and where we all got all of our cats from and reporting her but we’re concerned that if we do get these animals taken away and her foster license taken away, they’ll take our cats, which would be unfair as we make sure all of our cats are always taken care of. They get regular check ups, up to date on all their shots, they’re fixed, and they have appointments next week to get checked by their vet and get the medication they need to get rid of the ringworms. Is there anything We can do to   Help these cat and make sure she can’t ever foster or adopt again? She’s not a good pet owner at all and it upsets me more than anything. 

TLDR my roommate is essentially neglecting her cats and it’s starting to effect our cats and even us but we don’t want to have our fur babies taken away because of her neglect. Any advice on what to do?",29Jul2020,1

893,"I am writing this from a throwaway account because I am incredibly paranoid right now. I have never used Reddit before but I feel like this is a useful place to ask for help. Today I was checking my email when I noticed I had a voicemail sent to my Gmail account from a few days ago. I clicked on it assuming it would be nothing, but I was shocked when I was met with two 3-minute long voicemails of someone obviously jerking off. The voicemail started with unintelligible grunting, almost as if they were purposely speaking unclearly, and then after that they proceeded to send 5 and a half minutes of them... doing it. There was a consistent beeping sound in the background as well throughout the voicemail. I would post a recording of it but I just feel weird right now and I am already incredibly on edge so I really don't want to. I tried looking up the phone number online, but the only thing that came up was that it was from my area which I could already tell based on the area code. I don't have any way to trace the number. My friends looked through their contacts and did not recognize the number either. After trying to reverse search it, I looked through my recent calls and apparently the number called my phone twice as well on the same day. I don't know how someone has my phone number and email but I am incredibly on edge now. I know that it might just be someone I know messing with me in an incredibly sick way. I know that I know of people who might do something like that. But I don't care. I just feel so sick to my stomach and want to do something about it. I am afraid I am being stalked, which is also a possibility, and I am upset.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I am writing this is because I am completely unsure of what to do. I feel like I am in danger. I don't know if that is something you should take to the police or not. I know they could probably trace the number at least, but the problem is my parents. I am 18. I just graduated high school. I live with my family. I am essentially a child. I don't want them to know about this. They already worry about my safety constantly, and if they thought I was being stalked then they would be more afraid than I am. Thankfully I am going to college next month so I will be out of the area if that is really the case. I just don't understand how they got my personal email address as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

In a moment of panic and shock I almost wanted to \*67 or call from someone else's phone just to see who picks up, but I realize that it is probably dangerous and I shouldn't. If this is a dangerous person or a stalker then I don't want to provoke them in any way. There is a part of me that isn't even afraid, though. I just have this have this intense desire to be able to get to the bottom on things and call out/humiliate the sick individual who did this in a Chris Hansen way, but I don't want to get carried away and put myself in danger.

897,"So, it has been over 90 degrees pretty much constantly the last month. Our thermostat is set to 69, but it is consistently 74 degrees inside. With the air conditioner running constantly, it never actually hits the temperature it is set to unless it is super early in the morning or really late at night. 

Our electric bill for August was about $100 more than July, probably because this thing is running constantly and not actually cooling the house.

Is the issue likely to be with the HVAC or is it more likely to be an insulation issue, or the outside temperature? 

If it is just the temperature or insulation, there's no point in bringing it up to our landlord and we should probably just move out when our lease is up and try to find a house where the bills are likely to be lower. We have a ton of windows, so there is never a time when we aren't getting sunlight from one direction or another.

I am an introvert and my social battery seems to run down pretty quickly. I don't really talk to my friends on the phone, except for the friend whom this post is about.

The only reason I talk to her on the phone is honestly because I feel pressured to most of the time and she makes me feel bad if I don't answer her calls. We're both nearly 30 and she's still in the mindset that she has to have constant contact with friends and that validates the friendships for her. She usually always has drama going on and is also just a dramatic person in general, and its been exhausting. I decided I needed a break from the phone so I made the post just to let people know why they won't hear from me for a bit. She definitely saw the post. She waited about a week before she texted me something gossipy and I decided not to reply. Afterwards she feigned concern saying ""I hope ur ok"" but I don't feel that she was genuine, otherwise the concerned text would've come first.

906,"Does anyone else get turned on when your partner is drunk?

Here’s some context. My wife went out for a friend’s bachelorette party last night, and as the hours progressed her texts became increasingly misspelled and incoherent. She called me at midnight to say she’d soon be home and was all emotional as she hiccuped “I love you” into the phone. She snapped me videos of her and her friends taking shots, and I could see her eyes were glassy and she was sporting a very crooked smile. Definitely drunk as hell. 

When she eventually stumbled through the door at 2:30 am, she tried to hide how noticeably trashed she was, but she reeked of booze and was slurring her way through her explanation of the party, often repeating herself and dropping her phone when showing me pictures of the festivities. 

Eventually, she starts getting handsy and trying to messily make out with me with her booze breath. Shockingly, her drunken state was such an unexpected turn on, and we ended up having very sloppy, but great, sex. 

Is anyone else into this kind of thing? I don’t know, but I find that there’s something naughty and sexy about a girl who lets loose and gets a bit lit every now and then. I wish my wife would imbibe more often.

His wife is friends with mine and our kids are all near same ages and friends. We do differ on some political aspects - I’m a liberal democratic and he considers himself “center-right”.  We do agree on healthcare, police needs reform and many other aspects.  We have agreed that COVID is real and precautions should be taken.

Recently, his wife and daughter (16) have been all over that quack doctor posting about no need for masks and Hydroxychloroquine is the cure all the government is suppressing, and that FB and Twitter are trying to censor them.  This has been upsetting to me since since I wasn’t expecting them to jump on the conspiracy theory train.

I have distanced myself from most of the people that are riding it, but this relationship connects to my whole family.  I feel like it would be a disservice to not discuss it with him, but could hurt things.

Any advise would be appreciated.",29Jul2020,1
910," Hi r/Advice. There's a long post ahead, but I'm hoping someone can give me some advice, even if it's just ""you've made your bed; lie in it""/""suck it up"". I'm aware that I'm not in a unique situation, but I would still appreciate advice. Whatever you suggest, detail is key, because it's become apparent to me that I'm obviously not as smart as I thought I was a kid/teen. Those sayings about fools thinking themselves smart? I'm that fool, and unfortunately proud and stubborn to boot.

I'm a rising college senior studying computer science. My first two years, I was in the liberal arts school of my university -- I didn't know what I wanted to do at all, so they admitted me there. That's standard enough -- go through general stuff, then move onto a different school for a major. So I have all my gen eds done as far as the university is concerned, and I enjoyed them for the most part, especially rhetoric and humanities.

Junior year was hard. First semester, I struggled in one class -- systems programming, but otherwise was fine -- didn't fail, but didn't get the C needed. Slightly lower grades, but still passing overall. This past spring, though, was a disaster, having failed linear algebra and analysis of algorithms. They were hard enough, I didn't like the latter course at all, and I adjusted horribly to the whole COVID-induced remote learning paradigm. Whatever academic motivation and discipline I had was gone. Now, I'm in a pickle as I try to figure out what to do, whether to go back on campus -- most likely right now, and I need to make a decision -- or go remote, which I really don't want to do. At the earliest, I'd graduate in winter 2021, a semester later than originally planned. I may even have to graduate in spring 2022.

I thought at the end of winter semester 2019 that I wanted to do web design because of all the websites I've encountered with difficult UIs -- we've all used at least one. My reasoning, for context, is that sure, flat design is elegant and pretty, and can work if done right, but it's *not* always done right and therefore *not* always easy to use. Obviously it's very complicated and I don't know much about it, but that's my observation. I wanted to do something about the trends we see and make things easier to use. Now, though, I really don't know.

But I have discovered about myself -- and you've probably realized it quickly too -- that I lack anything resembling strong discipline unless it comes to music; I played piano for 10 years, violin for 5 or 6, sang in choir for a few, did some conducting of my classmates, dabbled in composition, and have been self-studying guitar via the free Synyster Gates School website for the last few months. The last one is the strongest show of discipline I have right now, aside from 15 minutes of meditation before bed. Every day, I try to work on things like picking drills and scales and whatnot for at least 10-20 minutes before I let myself work on the material that I find fun, the material that made me pick up a guitar in the first place.

I'm a typical 21-year-old in the suburban US, I suppose. I spend a lot of time listening to music, watching YouTube, playing video games, and helping around the house with cooking and caring for my grandmother. I know in my mind that I need to do something about my life, but I don't have any clue how. I'm clearly lazy and lack discipline, and that's a bad combination. I know that, and yet I fail to wrap my brain around how dangerous that can get. Short of actually having to fend for my life or face death, which are far from ideal, how do I learn these lessons? Or are these lessons only going to sink the hard way?

As far as I can tell, my skills, to varying degrees and marketable or not, are:

* computers/IT
   * CLI usage
      * Essential Unix file-system tools and utilities -- navigation, creating/moving/deleting files, basic user administration; I *don't*, however, know much about computer networking
      * lower-intermediate Bash scripting
      * Vim -- my preferred editor, fairly comfortable
   * Git + GitHub
   * Basic programming knowledge (only standard libraries -- I never know what to do for projects, so I don't have proficiency in any third-party libraries)
      * Python
      * Java
      * HTML, CSS, and JS
      * C
* some amount of musicality, but not enough ability to perform for money
   * Piano
   * Guitar
* Household chores
   * Dishwashing
   * Cooking -- not bad, not great, but I probably could, if forced, survive on basic meals that aren't just ramen, pasta, or takeout/fast food/junk food
   * Cleaning and everyday laundry
   * Caretaking -- grandmother needs a lot of help for most tasks
      * Some amount of patience and empathy -- I need to improve these

Thanks to anyone who gets this far and has anything to say.",29Jul2020,1
911,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

A couple nights ago, I had a major mental breakdown. I don’t know exactly what triggered it, but I was in a bad state. 
For some context, I was added to a group chat by one of my friends who added her mutuals to it as well. We help each other a lot with out issues, and that added to the pain a bit. 

I was crying a lot, so I reached out to the group chat for help. Prior to my breakdown, me and a couple other people were talking so there were still some people active on said social media website. I said some things about myself and my self esteem, and maybe one picture of me crying. I asked them to help me and to not leave me alone with myself. I was really starting to break down at this point. One of the girls liked a couple messages, opened the photo, and left. They didn’t say anything. I decided to go to bed at this point. It was late, and I was tired. I told myself that they were sleeping and they would help me out in the morning. As I mentioned before, it isn’t just me that talks about my issues. We all help each other. I thought that at least one person in the chat would care, but when I woke up they had seen the messages and changed the subject without saying anything. I don’t know how to feel. It hurts me a bit, but I might be overreacting. I just needed to get this off my chest. 

(I see a lot of Instagrammers posting things from this Subreddit a lot. I’d like to ask them to not post this, as this took place on Instagram and I don’t want my friends to see it.)",29Jul2020,1
912,"My biggest problem so far is that I feel like I have no personality. Simple as that.
I know I have some kind of personality cuz everyone does but I just can't pinpoint what I like or dislike, what I believe in, what I feel attached to, etc.

What I hate the most is how I'm kinda a copycat. Everytime I am with friends it's like I am copying their hobbies and their personality and it drives me insane.
For example, I started playing guitar when I met with a family of musicians. But then after we stopped meeting up almost entirely I stopped playing guitar too though I sometimes pick it up again.
And when I met with a guy who is obssesed with motorcycles, I started to like them too.
In the end I am always mad at myself for being like that.
Every single time this happens I feel happy for finally finding out what I want to do in life and then I only feel discouraged and stupid.

I should note that I am a teenager. And please don't tell me that because I am a teen, it should come to me one day and I would figure it all out. Been there. Done that. Doing nothing and waiting for a miracle just makes me feel more messed up. I got no idea who I am and I think I should have by now.

I should also say I lived on a boat ever since I was 9 which I think is basically why I can't figure out myself; we move from place to place and never settle down for more than a couple of months, which doesn't give me the oppurtunity to have friends for a long time or live in the same place.

Even my music is a mess.
I used to like soft rock when I was younger. But then when I met this family of musicians I went towards heavy metal. After we left I found out about Billie Eilish and went towards sad and depressed. Then I started listening to Eminem.
From this I figured out there's something emotional going on. Too emotional.
That's one thing I know about myself for sure; I try not to show it but I frequently feel sad or angry at stupid things. I am sometimes afraid I will become depressed but I can't help feeling the way I do.
I even draw ugly and scary creatures or crying girls, all with black.
I don't know if this is normal or not but once I used to think it cool. Now I am wondering if something is wrong with how I live my life.

Don't get me wrong. I am mostly happy. I have a good family and have seen many beautiful places. But I can't figure out who I am really and if the fact that I am getting drawn to sad and angry music and drawings means something.

It's all a mess and I feel discourage and failure too many times lately.
Please help. I tried figuring it all out by myself but I can't. I tried waiting to see if anything will change but it didn't.

I basically have no idea who am I.",29Jul2020,1

I failed my road test on my birthday and I’ve been so beyond depressed since it happened. And the reason I failed I personally thought was so stupid and so did my driving instructor. I got one single mark off and it was for this, that supposedly is an automatic fail. I had finished the test and he told me to turn back into the DMV parking lot, and I apparently turned into the middle of the entrance of the parking lot, not the right side. There was no line to show separate lanes of the entrance, and there were no other cars in the parking lot or anyone coming out or pulling in. Then he said “The only reason that you failed” was because of this since “it could’ve caused an accident” if there was a car there. I thought it’d be obvious if another car was coming out of the parking lot he knows it’s be obvious it is 2 ways and I’d drive in on the right side, but oh well. He was a really nice guy but i’m pissed. I take it again in 2- 4 weeks but I’m so anxious and worried I’m gonna become someone who takes 10 times and just never passes, like I feel like they’ll find something to fail me for everytime. I had no doubt I would pass and I lost a lot of confidence because of this, just feeling really terrified.

935," 

I need advice if anyone can give any. So here’s some background, I’m an 8th grader, about to turn 14 and had never had a crush before in my life, which is important later on. I never had a crush before, thinking it childish and stupid, but I started to like one of my best friends who I knew since 5th grade around the December of 2019. We were close friends, I had 5/8 classes with were and sat next to her every other day, (my school has a block schedule.) We texted each other constantly and she threw hints at me a lot, such as heart emojis and other things. Me, being the Idiot that I am never got the clues. One day (the day before Valentine’s Day) she started to text me in Chinese using google translate. When I translated it, the translation wasn’t t perfect but it went along the lines of “she wants us to be together” and “she’s sorry she’s not what I wanted.” I was extremely confused and since I didn’t know how to react to that, like I do with most things in life, I tried to change the subject. She took that as i rejected her. She was the first person I ever had a crush on and I have the self confidence of a potato. Later, she stoped texting me all together, and this quarantine started. I didn’t think about that much until my friend did an anonymous ask anything thing where he said he would do therapy and someone said, “ I had a crush on my friend and never told them but I did and they still found a way to reject me and it’s affecting my mental health.” Well, that got me pretty concerned because I knew it was here because she has a very distinct style of speech and it so closely fit the situation I was in. So I put an ask me anything on my story, because I know she the only one who responds to my ask me anything, and she said “losing my mental sanity 😘” I know it was her because I checked and she was the only one who saw my ask me anything. Here’s where I need advice. Should I say anything? She’s been posting a lot lately and I don’t think she’s feeling all to good. If I say something what should I say? Do you think she still, if ever, cared? I’m very confused, as I’m new to all this liking people business and decided to post here becuase last night i fell asleep at 4 am and thought I needed to get some kind of closure. Im not very good looking, chubby, in advanced classes and got straight As from 3 to 6th grade but got my first Bs and Cs in 7th grade, (although to be fair they were 9th grade classes) and im kind of stinky, yet one of the smartest and prettiest girls in the schools I think at least likes me?

937,"I (22m) have a close friend (20f) and I have recently realized I have feelings for them. To be honest I probably have had these feelings for a long time but have been afraid of telling her how important she is to me.  We’ve been internet friends for around 4 years now, frequently playing games online, as well as calling and texting.  We shared so much with each other but we have never really talked about the possibility of our relationship changing.  I think the distance between us (West coast to Midwest) is very intimidating and probably very difficult if she happens to feel the same way and so, we never really talked about this.  I remember once, she mentioned her view on long distance relationships, seeing them as strange and different, yet becoming more common.  We actually met up while she was visiting an area of the Midwest and I drove a few hours so we could finally meet and hangout.  First and foremost I am her friend and I do not want to cause something that damages that.  Besides, we aren’t 13, nor are we in a ROM-COM, we should be able to talk to each other about these things.  However, anytime I think about my life I picture her being a part of it in some way.  I am afraid of how potentially dangerous to our friendship it is to tell her how much she means to me.  I haven’t told anyone this but around 2 years ago I tried to kill myself.  I remember getting a text from her minutes before and everything just stopped.  All I remember after that was going home and crying.  Since then I tried to slow down and to care less about things that would have stressed me out.  She was always there for me and I want to be there for her.  I try not to be dramatic and I’m trying my hardest to find answers to issues rather than let them eat me away.  I am in a much better place now and I wanna say that I am in fact being dramatic.  I’m probably just a friend she made because I was someone with shared interests/ hobbies who didn’t act like a creep, and no matter the outcome, I am sure I will be able to handle it.  I don’t see myself as someone desperately needing affection or a relationship, but I’ve also started to feel different about the way I see my friend this past year.  I am afraid of so many things.  I’m afraid I won’t ever tell her how I feel.I’m afraid that the feelings I have aren’t actually for her, but for the version of her I picture over the internet.  I’m afraid she sees me differently in person as well.  I’m afraid of ruining our friendship.  I’m afraid I am in love with her.  I’m afraid she won’t feel the same way.  I’m even afraid she has feelings for me too.  I’m afraid I probably need therapy (little joke there I def need therapy. laugh…).  I just want somebody to yell at me and tell me I am acting like an idiot.  But I also want them to tell me the reason I am an idiot.

The story is I've been in love with a guy for 3 years but I didn't have the courage to tell him that I love him.

I consoled myself that this feeling of love is temporary and It will fade away eventually but it remained constant in my heart.

I still kept talking with my crush even if he was busy with university and after 2 years he confessed that he loved me since we met anf he still loves me. I could say that I confessed too that I always lobed like and a part of my heart was always for him. When he came back in country, he told me that he came only to see me.

Ever since I was a little kid, I can get angry really quickly at certain things. If I am spending over 10 minutes on a single homework problem, it would drive me nuts, and I didn't know what to do about it.

Eventually, I realized that if I hit myself, I get my anger out and no one else has to deal with it. no harm, no foul. After a while, I began hating it every time since I am always bruised and hurt all over (especially legs and head) after each time. I can't really ever tell what is going to cause me to get this pissed, and I can't make myself stop. After each time, I sit down and I just cry for a while.

I can't even write down the things since I don't always get angry at those things, and it always is random stuff. The other day, I dropped a sandwich I had just made and I woke up the next day with a massive headache and really sore legs from how angry I got.

It's been 7 years, I don't ever want to do it, and everytime, it comes right back. I hate myself for it, but I can't make myself stop. I have a searing headache at the moment from accidentally breaking a part I just 3d printed. I hate myself.",29Jul2020,1

About 4 months ago I met her on the NeedAFriend subreddit where she wanted some advice about stuff. So I reached out to her and we were friends fro the months to come. She really didn't have much interest in talking with me but I liked her mostly because she was the only person I was able to talk about gaming and stuff and she lives in a different country (I'm in India and she is in USA). 

About a few weeks ago she told me not to talk to her because she may have to stay in hospital for a few days for which the first that clicked to my mind is corona and the 27 surgeries she had which freaked me out like hell and I was so scared for her that I am going to lose my vent buddy. Which I replied if she is in hospital right now and if she is okay. 


Apparently she was okay and got discharged the same day. And she also blocked me on both reddit and discord because I was clingy (I don't deny that).

949,"Hello everyone. Throwaway account because this is a very odd question and I feel somewhat uncomfortable asking it. I think I already know the answer, but I need to get this off my chest and see what others have to think about it.

I haven't always been very good at talking to people. When I was a kid it was really bad, I almost never spoke to anyone I didn't know, including other classmates. There was this one girl I always wanted to get to know, but anytime I would get close to speaking to her, I'd freeze up and run away. She eventually went to a different school, and I moved on. Fast forward to now, in the middle of this pandemic.

My mental health is obviously declining, and at a more rapid pace than in past experiences. I feel lonely, angry, scared and empty all at once. And now, I can't stop thinking about her, no matter what I do. I know it's not normal and it's probably not healthy, and I should let her go, but I just can't seem to. I want to send her a message telling her that I'm sorry for never really reaching out to her before, but I don't want to weird her out. We have several mutual friends, but I don't want to put this on them either. I've refrained from talking to anyone I know about these feelings because I honestly think I shouldn't be having them, and have avoided looking her up on social media because it would probably make these urges stronger. At this point I don't know what to do. On the one hand I want to reach out and see if maybe we could at least get to know each other and be friends or something. But on the other hand, I feel like it may just be a better option to not say anything, and continue to try and find ways to deal with this on my own.

How can I handle this in a way that doesn't cause further deterioration of my mental health, and doesn't cause any undue stress on anyone else?",29Jul2020,1

But all my friends I know outside of the bars I hang out at either are too busy for me or don't seem to care anymore.

They're starting families, getting married, making other big moves in their lives, so im trying to be understanding and not take it very personally.

953,"So I (a 14 year old male) just really want to spend the rest of my summer going out and exploring my area. I would also like to go fishing because my dad never really has the time to take me fishing. There is a creek I know of and a lake and multiple stores that are walking/skating distance from here. My mom is at work all the time and my dad works from home so they wouldn’t care that i’m gone, also my town is pretty small so everyone knows everyone so there is no risk of me going out. But here’s the thing, all my friends live pretty far out and I barley get to see them so I don’t really have people to go explore with. I’ve been thinking about going alone but i’m scared of what people think when they see a 14 year old kid alone. Like it’s not that i’m scared i’m going to get kidnapped or anything, i’m just scared of what people would think when they see me alone. Also, there are other kids in the neighborhood, but I feel to awkward to go up and talk to them, like i’ve talked to them before but i’m just to awkward to start a friendship with them unless they do it first.

956,"So here in the U.K. a pretty important date is coming up which is August the 20th. It is the date which pupils will be given their GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) results. These are essentially the grades that determine how well you did in school, these don’t get you into university (that is 17-18 “A Levels” / Btecs) these are everything you have done until you turn 17 basically. The grade which determines the time you are forced to be at school for.

I was at a private school for the majority of this time of my life fortunately enough. I worked really hard and managed to get grades good enough through mocks, exam papers, end of unit tests, effort grades etc.

Unfortunately I was told late last year that this couldn’t continue mostly due to financial reasons (Before Coronavirus but even more important now). So I went around applying for every great school in my local area. I managed to get a conditional offer into one of the best schools in the county and the best in my area.

I didn’t get any offers for other schools ironically, only the best one I wanted but nether the less that is irrelevant to the advice as all great schools in my local area require the same sort of grades from GCSEs to get in and take “A levels”. What worries me about this whole process is that the grades are conditional. If I don’t get the grades from my GCSEs it’s highly unlikely I can join this school, I also can’t go back to my old school for financial reasons and furthermore I can’t go to any other great school in my local area. Not even just a great school, most applications for any school were closed ages ago, maybe a little bit of mishandling on my part for not applying to enough schools as this was the first time I had done anything like this in years. 

Say theoretically, I personally think it’s unlikely that I won’t get the grades I need. I got them in the exams that I took at school. But say theoretically under these time’s and a new system considering we didn’t actually take exams and they are just handing us grades that I didn’t get what I needed.

What do I do?
It’s been messing with me for a while cause I get anxious about these things. I like to always be positive and think everything will work out. But this time I just want to ask fellow humans, who some of you may have been in a similar situation what you did.

957,"So, I recently got into an argument with my ex friend. We'll call her anna. Anna went on and on about me excluding her when I only hung out with different people once. She and another person (call her Lily) whom i considered to be pretty close with would hang out ALL of the time, and post it on snapchat to let everybody know. I hung out with another group of people because both anna and lily were starting to get on my nerve.

She says that she has trust issues because there was a groupchat for my other friend's birthday party. Anna never considered herself to be friends with this person, and even said that she hated her. 

She told me she wanted me to add her on this group chat that hasn't been used for some time, and also I got a new phone so i lost all of my conversations.

Lily scares me, she has done and said stuff no sane person would. She and anna can be kinda manipulative too

Was a being a bad friend, because she called me immature for blowing this out of proportion and said I didn't care about her, which i do still even now.

I apologized to her a couple of months ago, and then a couple of text messages after she started to text me. She apologized after she said some hurtful stuff( and I guess i did too) and said that I was attacking her when I simply said she needs to stop getting hung over the past and focus on the present pretty much.

960,"Hello guys and girls,

I wanted to ask for your advice on this situation that has been going on for about a month now.

I (18 years old), just finished school this year and will be going to university in about 2 months a few hundred kilometers away, as I want to study a subject that is rarely offered here. So, I'll have to move out. My parents have always been very supportive about this, as I am fascinated by the subject since elementary school, and it was my goal for the last few years to study it and work in it one day.

However, for about a month now, my father started behaving really weird. He is often in a bad mood and is really easy to provoke. He gets angry for every little bullshit I do, or if something's not how he likes it. Everything I do is wrong, and if I do it the way he wants it he still seeks some details to rant about. I work at the moment to save up some money, when I come home, he's pissed off. When I told him that I'll be going to donate blood together with my friends, pissed off. I want to spend the day with someone I didn't see since our graduation, you guessed it. It's really frustrating, I've never witnessed this behaviour before, we've always had a great relation. I've tried to stay calm and talk to him about it, but then he gets angry again. My patience is reaching its limit, and it ruins my day.

I have the feeling that he's now realizing I'll be starting my own life soon and he feels like he's losing control or something.

Do you have any tips on how to approach that situation, or how to talk to him about it. Of course, he will eventually have to deal with it, but I don't want to spend my remaining time at home in this shitty atmosphere.",29Jul2020,1

976,"My first memory is of my mother. I don’t have a room of my own at my parents house, so I sleep in the same room as my mom when I’m there. I was four-ish at the time. It’s a blurry memory, but she was yelling about how none of us(dad, brothers, and myself) are enough for her. She screamed about us being awful to her. 

I have many memories similar to that from ages 4-8. I remember my parents getting angry when I was young and I’d ask for candy or a toy because we couldn’t afford food, much less luxuries. I learned very early on that asking for anything meant being yelled at and ridiculed. By the time I was 8, I stopped talking to my parents about my problems because they would always tell me it was my fault. When I was 6, I was getting bullied, physically and emotionally, and my mom told me that it was my fault that I let him. When I was 7, 3 boys who were my age, but twice as big and strong hurt me a lot because I said I wanted to play with them. My parents said that I was a girl, and I shouldn’t have tried to play with the boys. They’ve never hit me, (grandfather and cousin have, but not my parents) so it was only recently that I realized that things like that weren’t normal for every family. 

Now, I’m 15, and they only ever talk to me when I do something wrong. They constantly call me useless and lazy. I don’t know how to explain to them how damaged I am because of them. I desperately want to tell them, but I think they’d probably just tell me I was overreacting. I also want to start going to therapy because I’m not coping at all, but therapy is expensive so I don’t see a point in asking. My mom has bipolar depression, and I feel like if I asked her to put me in therapy, she would turn it all around and ask me how I could possibly call her a bad mother because she’s doing her best. 

I hate that I still love both of my parents. I have nearly no happy memories because of them, but I still crave their attention and approval. I hate that I just let them treat me like this. I love them both so much and it hurts that I don’t know if they love me at all.",29Jul2020,1

979,"I’m at a loss for how to feel about the way my partner presented his emotions to me today.

For some background information, I was previously in a relationship that was horribly, text-book definition toxic, and all though horrible, it taught me a lot about spotting red flags, setting self boundaries, what to tolerate, and what to stand your ground for. 

I’ve been with my partner for almost half a year now, and for context I don’t go out often, at all. I’m very introverted, but a friend of mine from the town I had moved away from was visiting today, and I made the plans to meet up with them and catch up for only about 3 hours, and let my partner know well ahead of time which he initially seemed perfectly fine with. 

So I go, come back perfectly safe like he wanted, and something seemed a bit off, and I asked him if he was okay. He came clean about never wanting me to go out in the first place, but the way it was phrased made me question If the reason why was toxic or something outside of his control.

His exact words were “I don’t want to control everything you do at all, but it gives me this big rush of anxiety that I can’t control, I feel very sick and sweaty and I hate myself for that”

My partner had a rough childhood and lost many friends in his life to violence/ incidents that happened in front of him and left him with some mental damage due to the conditions he grew up in, and part of me is wondering if that’s where that fear is coming from, and not from a place of controlling toxicity.

Essentially, I never want to be in a toxic relationship again or repeat the one I was stuck in prior to this, but I know not wanting your partner to leave or go out is a toxicity sign, in this case I’m just curious if it’s more of a mental health problem than a control issue due to him losing friends to death in the past and not wanting the same thing to happen to me, and in a sense being paranoid. I don’t exactly know how I should approach this and would really enjoy the input of others in this group that may have experienced something similar to my partner.",29Jul2020,1

I was invited to my best friend’s boyfriend’s small birthday party on Monday a few days ago. That ex will attending too. I didn’t think ‘that’ day would be so soon (2-3 years after we broke up).

He can be a little violent, but most of the time something happened before his violent action that I can usually see causing it, like a kid took a toy from him or a teacher pushed him to do something he didn’t want. It doesn’t make it appropriate for him to do - but I feel like I can at least prevent those to a degree.He’s been tested for it all but not diagnosed with anything. His parents are divorced. 
Our teachers are tired and I understand, but he’s also just a kid. I have such a special place in my heart for him and I want to do what I can to help him grow. They seem more frustrated with him than willing at this point, which makes me so sad. What are some things you guys recommend for kids who have these problems? Some different approaches? 
 
I try to remain incredibly calm around him, as I see him getting worked up to acting out even more when someone is frustrated or mad at him. I see him craving attention and I give him lots of love all day long. He adores me, comes in every morning and gives me a giant hug. I work with him on pronouncing words but I really don’t know what I’m doing in that regard. I think he feels safe around me &amp; I’m proud of myself for laying out foundation out, but now I want to try &amp; use that to help him get more out of school.",29Jul2020,1

Its a bit of a stretchy read so...
Sorry about that! 

I'm currently in a state of my life where confusion is my everyday sensation. 
I have the resources and time to do what I WISH to do, but don't know how to approach it. 

I, like the entirety of the world, love money. But I love a specific aspect of money: money growth. Specifically, being able to give advice on how to make more money or how to improve one's financial state. 

I want to pursue a career on this mentality but I have no idea which one that would be! There's literally so many, but I'm so confused as to which would be the right one. 

For some personal context, I took introduction to accounting and the feeling of understand the complexity of it was great. I mean, i had a huge smirk just learning about it and being able to use and understand the language of accounting (granted I am averagely terrible at math). I have done some research on my question and accounting honestly seemed to be it...but...i don't want to pursue accounting. Solely because I felt I would hate it if I was stuck in a corporate environment where it would feel too robotic to be....altruistic(?). 

I want to give advice to people so they can improve their financial state and be able to use the same knowledge myself. So, in an effort to pursue this hope I have of helping that way, what should I think of pursuing reddit?",29Jul2020,1

My daughter got married last summer. When an apartment on base opened up in September, she moved to live with him (as one would expect. )

The rules of on base housing only allow for two cats, so she left her cat with us as her husband has two cats. 

However, her MIL kind of missed the cats (she kept them for over a year while my SIL attended training before the kids got married. ) So my SIL told his mom he was okay with her taking those cats back so my daughter could have her cat.

My husband doesn't want to let the cat go. He says that the cat will miss going outside, he will miss the cat, our granddaughter will miss the cat and the dog will miss the cat.

Here's the rub: the cat was a birthday present for  our daughter. She never intended to leave the cat forever, only until they found a place where she could have the cat. 

And she never wanted the cat outside in the first place. My husband forced the issue,  repeatedly letting him out until he became accustomed to being outside in a neighborhood with foxes,  coyotes  and some weirdo who likes to torture and sacrifice cats. We didn't  get to have input (because I  personally don't think the cat should go out under the circumstances.) Now he uses the ""he loves to be outside "" argument for why we should keep him. 

I am caught in the middle of this. If I  let the cat go,  husband will hold it against me and surely retaliate somehow for me giving ""his"" cat away. If wer must get another cat for pest control,  for instance,  we can never have a litter box (a point  my husband and I have  argued over since the cat arrived.) 

Daughter will cut us off if we keep him. Husband and daughter have not gotten along since we got married and I feel as though the cat is the last point of contention. I just want it over.

 Incidentally,  his daughter used to create all kinds of conflict between us and he's recently started putting boundaries up there and so feels this is an opportunity for me to put up boundaries,  too. But his daughter was stealing from me and  injecting methamphetamine in my bathroom. My daughter just wants her cat.

Should the cat go with my daughter or stay with us? I feel the cat should go because it's not worth alienating my daughter when wer could just go down to the shelter and rescue someone else. 

TL/DR: daughter picking up cat husband wants to keep.",29Jul2020,1
985,"Note that I'm in a 3rd world country so things might be different. 

There is no animal shelter. Street cats are everywhere. I heard crying kittens in the distance for every 1-2 weeks or so. I used to take home very young or very sick kittens/cats but stopped for my health and financial condition (there are 7 cats still living with me, the rest are gone when there is a new cat. Not too worried because they are already adult and neutered). I'm still living in my aunt's house so I can afford to do this (they are living in the yard though, my aunt doesn't like cats). I also feed cats near my aunt's house every night. 


Within the last two months there are five new kittens in my aunt's yard.. I took the first one because it was still very little (4 weeks?). The second and third one I put them outside after I gave them food and water. The latest one was yesterday, someone dumped two kittens at 3AM. They are around 2 weeks with bad eye infection. I feel guilty to my aunt, she has put up with me enough.

What can I do to make it stop? A sign to not dump kitten here? Maybe I am the problem in cat population here because I give them food and sometimes nurse them if they are sick but I don't neuter them (I only neuter cats I ""took home"" because I don't have enough money). If this continue I can stop feeding them and remove cat foods I put in front of my aunt house so people can see I don't want to take care of the cats anymore.

History: Talked for about 3 months with this guy. We were cool with each other then he started demanding things from me and if I don't give in, he gave threats of unfollowing or blocking. He unfollowed several times then re-followed. He's also given ultimatums and wouldn't respond to my messages if he didn't get his demands. I told him I wanted to take it slow. He also triggered my jealousy by mentioning other women. Just figured out now that he was very manipulative and I allowed it.

When he decided to ghost me, I was PMsing and unable to control myself so I ended up chasing and begging him to not go away. This action of mine is done now. I can't go back to it and change what I did. I feel so guilty that I chased an asshole, probably made him think I'm crazy and that he's all that and a bag of chips when in truth, I wouldn't have swiped left if I found him on Tinder. 

So anyway, I ended up chasing with no thought about, I called, I overtexted the asshole. I went to different social media. I was pissed that I was being ghosted by a guy that I thought cared. So he blocked me and couple of weeks later unblocked me ( I don't know wtf that means, can someone explain that as well? ).

995,"My housemate was breaking up with his girlfriend and needed a new place to stay so we got a place and leased it for 2.

In the 18 months since then his ex would visit once every month or two and would on occasion leave the front door unlocked at like 4pm then it stays unlocked all night until I wake up and find it unlocked. I let my housemate know 2 of the 3 times. The first time I meant to say something but forgot.

My housemate and her and now back together. She still lives with her gma though. However she came to visit and stay 4 days this weekend. She came out on Saturday and when she got here she came in the front door since he gave her a key and she forgot to lock it behind her. Next day I wake up and find the front door unlocked. My housemate wakes up later and I let him know the front door was unlocked. Im not blaming anyone I just say ""Hey I woke up and the front door was unlocked."" He said it must have been his gf. That's that.

I wake up thus morning (Wednesday) and find the front door unlocked again. They had just left through the garage, I get up and find the front door unlocked probably since she answered the door to get their food last night.

I send my housemate a text after the front door has been left unlocked 2 days nearly in a row just after me saying it was left unlocked... this is the text exchange...

Me: Front door was left unlocked again last night. Lex needs to lock the front door when she visits. Not cool.

Him: I dont remember her ever going back out the front door? You sure it wasnt you bud?

Me: You guys used it last either to take her car or get a food delivery. I lock the door literally the second I walk back in every single time.

Him: Ah must have been when she ordered her pizza. Sorry man I'm glad no one broke in or r---- you while you were sleeping

Me: I cant really tell your tone iva text but Im going to assume youre not making fun of the situation. Dont let it happen again.

Him: Its not like its ever done on purpose bud. That's what you dont seem to understand. If it were you I wouldnt even say anything because Im an adult.

Me: I dont think its on purpose. But regardless it is scary. Im trying to be an adult about it and just remind you.

Granted... dude is only 26 and I'm 32. So him calling me bud multiple times and insinuating I'm the one not being an adult is fucking asinine. Dude has some serious issues with depression and I believe more. But frankly I cant live in a house where I dont know if the god damn door is locked when Im laying in bed.

At this point I have to check the door before I go to sleep even if I never used it that day but since they will stay up playing video games all night I often go to bed before they do.

1003,"I hate them. Seriously. I hate myself even more. I am about to turn to 17 next week. I am a male. And every choice I do, I just fall in trouble because of them. Whether in general or in the internet I don't know what to do nowadays. I don't understand. I get punished for doing the wrong choices and I always think they are the right choices but in the fucking end, it's the wrong choices and I fall in really deep trouble because of them. I don't understand. It happened several times in my fucking life. Sometimes, my choices are about risk. If I'd ever risk to do something important and fail it, I fall in big trouble no matter what because I think it's the right choice but in the end, it's the wrong.

A few examples of my bad choices

1 - in 2017, I said that toxic people are bad - then, someone commented to me, told me to kill myself for saying this.

2 - 2019 - I was once taking the Psat - I wrote some math equations before I start the math section test - -------- the teacher said in a loud voice ""You aren't suppose to do that, stop doing it now"" I then stopped doing that and then she whispered me ""If you do this again, I will take your test and you will go home good bye""

3 - almost the end of 2016 - I once posted a post to a YouTuber posting videos. I was a fan of him back then. I told him ""Let's talk"" then he told me ""Sorry, mom didn't tell me not to talk with strangers"" I felt so frustrated and I felt like I did the wrong choice.

4. mid 2017 I did a wrong choice - Saying something to a YouTube to not say bad words(Like fuck)(It's my mistake, and I was not smart back then in 2017). In the end, someone responded to me and told me ""So high af right now?""

I  deserved it and I feel like I still remember this comment and the reply and I will say this right now, I wasn't high. I was dumb. I've become even a better person in 2020 and I can take all the responsibilities for everything I've said.

5. Something important between my mom and I that I took the wrong choice that she yelled at me. and it was all my fault

6. 6 years ago, I found a friend in a game called ""Dota 2."" every time he's online, I asked him if I can play with him. every time. he said ""I want to play alone. I don't want to play right now"" and I said ""why let's play together"" he deleted me from his friendlist. He was my first ever friend I saw on the internet and I wanted him to be my best friend but I failed. I always choose to talk with him and wanted to play with him until he got board of me. It was all my fault. I really

7. It even happened today. But I really don't want to say it. I did something I wasn't supposed to do that I thought it's fine to do it. My parents saw me do it, and then I told them ""hi"" and then they left me.

8. -- in grade 5, I was hidding all my bad grades from my mom so that she doesn't feel disappointed. I felt like I was wrong in the middle of the semester so I brought them then my mom was disappointed on me. 

Etc. Just more choices. Just more. I don't want to include more anymore. but it's just more Etcs. I feel like these are enough.

Am I like the worst person to ever make the worst choices? sometimes, I don't even think about my choices and sometimes I do and I don't know if they can be right or not.

Too much Etcs.

Sometimes, if don't do something, I even get in trouble. That stresses me out even more for example:

My choices makes me frustrated and really stressed out. It leaves me under a bad sight and makes me feel like I don't know how to describe it. I Really don't know what to do.

How do I get over my wrong choices? What do I do? I sometimes think it is the right choice but in the end it's the wrong and I get in trouble for this.

I always think that my choices are okay. absolutely okay and feel like nothing's gonna happen. but then, something bad happened, then I feel terrible from me choices that makes everyone angry/sad at me. or maybe e, choices that could make me feel bad about something. Or etc. You know. 

I need help. I don't want to do the worst/most stupid choices of all time without even thinking about them thinking they're fine of the right choice.

We only know each other online and I didn’t want to hop into anything like that until we met. So, for now, we’re just very close (sometimes flirty) companions.

There are days when they’re having a hard time. Life isn’t exactly easy for them; there’s a lot going on. I understand that and really wish I could help with more than just a text. Sometimes, though, it gets to a point where they just shut me out for several days. Or cancel plans without any warning. It’s happened a few times this month already.

Every time they just shut me out or cancel on me, I get really upset. I feel like I shouldn’t; maybe I’m just too attached. It used to be that it made me sad. This time though, it’s just made me annoyed, almost angry. We had plans for today, and out of the nowhere, he decided to go because he was upset.

Or they’ll get angry and blow up on me. It’s almost unpredictable and I can’t handle it.

But, I really hate my wife's dog and could use some advice on how I could be less bitter.  So my wife's dog is a fourteen year old pure breed shih tzu, we'll call her Molly. Molly was my wife's dog when she was a teenager and stayed with my in-laws when we got married 10 years ago. Last year ( about a month after we bought our house ) her parents had noticed that Molly's age was finally catching up to her and figured that she probably didn't have much longer. They thought it would be nice if we took her in so she could spend her last few months with my wife and our kids. I reluctantly agreed on the grounds that my wife had promised that after Molly finally kicked the bucket I could get another Saint Bernard ( mine had passed after 8 years 🥺 ) and after a couple of days of adjusting, it seems like she's gotten 5 extra years added to her life. She runs around and jumps and does everything a younger dog would do. Besides her literal greying coat and her slightly milky eyes you would never guess she's as old as she is.
Since we took her in this dog had been a constant pain in the butt to me. She refuses to eat anything but expensive canned food and table scraps. She won't stay outside longer than what's required to take care of business and has scratched a massive slot into our front door letting us know she wants in. She stands at the ( open ) door for a literal minute when we let her out letting in bugs and the AC on. She's always getting on my lap and shaking like she's having a nervous meltdown. Scratching at the couch cushions trying to bury herself in them. Walking under our feet when we go into the kitchen thinking she's getting something special.

Se's an incredibly sweet dog and is very intelligent. And when she was living with my in laws I loved this dog to death. But now, I can't stand her. It's almost like I resent her being her because she's not MY dog nor did I truly want her. I feel like her being here is keeping me from having the dog I want.

I would also like to say that my wife takes exceptional care of Molly by taking her to the vet and groomer every month.

1013,"How can my boyfriend and I fix each other? 

We've been together for over 3 years, and have known each other for 9 years. I love him more than anything. He has not had an easy life at all. He's been through some really fucked up shit when he was a young child, and I mean like *really fucked up. He is broken. We both are. And to be honest, both of my parents are crackheads so my life experiences are also not so bright.

Recently, life is much better for both of us. We have an apartment, a cat. Our little family unit. We both work and make decent money. We're genuinely excited for the future, but it feels like our pasts are constantly lurking above our heads, and we can't seem to shake it. 

He is an alcoholic, hands down. He drinks every single day. He doesn't get sloppy drunk every day, or even tipsy, but he does drink a lot. On an average night, he will have like 3-4 beers and 1-3 glasses of straight whiskey or vodka. He has such a high tolerance that what would get me drunk barely even affects him. He doesn't get mean or violent or anything, honestly he barely even changes. He also does not eat enough food at all. 

I also have issues of my own with smoking weed every day and also struggling with an eating disorder. 

Basically, we're both fucked up. But tonight he came home from hanging out with a friend and he is completely wasted. He came home, showered, vomited all the alchohol out, and basically cried in my lap saying sorry, and then passed out.

We honestly do not fight often at all. Maybe once per month. I wasn't mad at him when he came home, but more disappointed. I feel like I don't know how to help him. It's hard to watch someone you love hurt themselves, but since I also do similar shit to myself, what am I even going to say? I don't even know how to help myself, let alone help him. 

I love him, he's my partner, we go to each other for everything. I can't see a life without him by my side. I think we need each other and we need to learn how to help each other out with these issues. I want us to be better versions of ourselves. 

We've both talked about therapy (both never tried it) and thought it may be helpful, but idk. Sometimes it just feels like we're both broken. From the outside, it looks like we're just a well off, normal couple. Many of our friends think we're an amazing couple who will be together forever, and part of that is true. We really do care for each other. But we need help. We both struggle every day with battling our own inner demons.

1014,"I hate them. Seriously. I am about to turn to 17 next week. I am a male. And every choice I do, I just fall in trouble because of them. Whether in general or in the internet I don't know what to do nowadays. I don't understand. I get punished for doing the wrong choices and I always think they are the right choices but in the end, it's the wrong choices and I fall in really deep trouble because of them. I don't understand. It happened several times in my life. Sometimes, my choices are about risk. If I'd ever risk to do something important and fail it, I fall in big trouble no matter what because I think it's the right choice but in the end, it's the wrong.

A few examples of my bad choices

1 - in 2017, I said that toxic people are bad - then, someone commented to me, and told me to kill myself for saying this**.** He even told me that ""Toxic people are the serious people who don't want to waste their time on stupid people like you.""

2 - 2019 - I was once taking the Psat - I wrote some math equations before I start the math section test - -------- the teacher said in a loud voice ""You aren't suppose to do that, stop doing it now"" I then stopped doing that and then she whispered me ""If you do this again, I will take your test and you will go home good bye""

3 - almost the end of 2016 - I once posted a post to a YouTuber posting videos. I was a fan of him back then. I told him ""Let's talk"" then he told me ""Sorry, mom didn't tell me not to talk with strangers"" I felt so frustrated and I felt like I did the wrong choice.

4. mid 2017 I did a wrong choice - Saying something to a YouTube to not say bad words(Like fuck)(It's my mistake, and I was not smart back then in 2017). In the end, someone responded to me and told me ""So high af right now?""

I deserved it and I feel like I still remember this comment and the reply and I will say this right now, I wasn't high. I was dumb. I've become even a better person in 2020 and I can take all the responsibilities for everything I've said.

5. Something important between my mom and I that I took the wrong choice that she yelled at me. and it was all my fault

6. 6 years ago, I found a friend in a game called ""Dota 2."" every time he's online, I asked him if I can play with him. every time. he said ""I want to play alone. I don't want to play right now"" and I said ""why let's play together"" he deleted me from his friend list. He was my first ever friend I saw on the internet and I wanted him to be my best friend but I failed. I always choose to talk with him and wanted to play with him until he got board of me. It was all my fault. I really

7. It even happened today. But I really don't want to say it. I did something I wasn't supposed to do that I thought it's fine to do it. My parents saw me do it, and then I told them ""hi"" and then they left me.

8. -- in grade 5, I was hiding all my bad grades from my mom so that she doesn't feel disappointed. I felt like I was wrong in the middle of the semester so I brought them then my mom was disappointed on me.

9. All my reddit replies/posts that got downvoted because I talked about something that is wrong or i am not suppose to talk about or something like that

Etc. Just more choices. Just more. I don't want to include more anymore. but it's just more Etcs. I feel like these are enough.

Am I like the worst person to ever make the worst choices? sometimes, I don't even think about my choices and sometimes I do and I don't know if they can be right or not.

Too much Etcs.

Sometimes, if don't do something, I even get in trouble. That stresses me out even more for example:

My choices makes me frustrated and really stressed out. It leaves me under a bad sight and makes me feel like I don't know how to describe it. I Really don't know what to do.

How do I get over my wrong choices? What do I do? I sometimes think it is the right choice but in the end it's the wrong and I get in trouble for this.

I always think that my choices are okay. absolutely okay and feel like nothing's gonna happen. but then, something bad happened, then I feel terrible from me choices that makes everyone angry/sad at me. or maybe , choices that could make me feel bad about something. Or etc. You know.

I need help. I don't want to do the worst/most stupid choices of all time without even thinking about them thinking they're fine of the right choice.

So I’m in care with carers who I have been with for nearly 2 years. Recently I feel as tho whenever something in the house has been broken or a accident has happened somehow it seems to be me that is doing all of them and on purpose. I don’t intend to damage things because I can, these things have happened by purely an accident, yet I can’t convince my carers that it was genuine even though I have said to them I didn’t do it on purpose. 

So a few nights ago, I was outside having a cigarette in a summerhouse (it recently got built in the front garden) I was on my phone at the time just replying to a text message and because we have cushions in the summerhouse, some of the fag ash had burnt the cushion without me realising. I got a bollocking then from the carers saying I did it on purpose and then there is me trying to explain I genuinely didn’t see it happen as I was on my phone at the time when this incident happened.  

Now I’m not allowed to go in there anywhere because of one small accident. I have tried and tried apologising to them for what happened, but they won’t accept it even when I have offered to pay for a new one for them out of my money.

1032,"Hello 👋 

I’m having a bit of a problem calming down and sleeping well recently as things just seem quite bleak. I’m not suicidal but I feel quite worried and panicked about the future. I don’t have family or friends to fall back on. I’m very alone.

I recently turned 35 and I have very little faith in being financially stable or happy in my future. Everyone I knew is getting married, buying a house and having kids and I’m earning less money than I’ve ever earned before and feel incredibly alone and unstable.

after securing a good job and finishing university/collage I got into what I thought was a good relationship. After 5 years it got incredibly abusive and as a result I had a breakdown. 

This person was in the same industry as me and has poisoned a lot of friendships and business relationships I thought I had. I was signed off of work for a few months and eventually my job (understandably) let me go. I’m gutted I didn’t reach out for help sooner and talk about it but I was incredibly embaresssd I let myself get in that situation and that I let him get so much control over my work and personal life... but life moves on with or without you.

Eventually I’d got out of a long term and abusive relationship , cut ties with my old life and I left where I was living (most expensive city in my country) I used all my savings to break my contract on my apartment and move away. It left me with nothing. 

I paid off my debts with the remainder of my savings and all I had left was enough to cover deposit and three months rent in a shared apartment. I got a job after two months to tide me over but it’s a few grand below what I was on and as I’m in a different city now, my earning potential is much lower. I have been forced to rethink what I want to do career wise at 35 as my previous skill set was very specific and, to be quite honest, I don’t desire to do it anymore after all that happened. I’m open to trying new things. 

I’ve just got nothing. I’m living in a shared apartment with a stranger who works nights so I never see them and they don’t have much interest in changing that dynamic between us to a friendship - and that’s fine. 

I’ve only enough money to put aside a small amount each month in a locked savings scheme and miniscule savings account for rainy days. I’d be screwed if anything major happened and have no assets or a car.

I don’t like my new job but I don’t know what skills to pursue or job to aim for. I haven’t managed to make friends either and finding it incredibly hard to navigate in my mid thirties - I’m lost. 

Buying a house seems so far removed from my life even if I was to move somewhere much cheaper and commute in. My parents were quite old when they had me and sadly both passed when I was in my late twenties And I wasn’t left with anything other than small sentimental items and photos. They rented the house I grew up in.  

The idea of having kids seems so gone now as I cannot to see decent enough  financial stability to raise a child in the next 5 years and I don’t want to do it alone. I’ve gone on a few dates but nothings been concrete and I’m worried I’ll start to seem desperate and given up. I think until I’m happy in myself, I probably shouldn’t try to seek validation from others.

So I feel a bit stuck. I can’t figure out what I want to do as a job. I struggle to make friends of meaning and frightened to try or to get close to them in case I’m a huge burden.

I’d love to go therapy but I cannot afford private and public has a waiting list of two years for a basic consultation in my area. 

Sorry for the long post. I’m just a bit of a mess and some advice from strangers while I’m feeling low seems pretty good.

1034,"Hi... This is my first time posting and I just thought I could get other people's opinions. Also, this might be quite long and I'm sorry for that, but I'm kinda desperate. 

I am a 21 year old female and I've taken a year off from university. The reasons my parents accept is that, whilst I was there I went to the hospital to get checked out cuz I wasn't feeling good or motivated to study anymore, and long story short and after multiple trips to other doctors, it was found that I have an iron deficiency (like on the extremely low side) and hypothyroidism. 

While those are big reasons and contributed to how tired I was all the time too, other reasons are that while I was at university, I was out of my small town and got to know that how I think of things and handle stress isn't all that okay. And therefore, according to therapists I also have severe anxiety that has been diagnosed and I heavily expect that I have mild depression, but I'm kinda scared to tell anyone that. I also just plain hated my engineering degree and I couldn't get in the mindset to even try to pick up those books. 

I know it was irresponsible and I felt terrible for disappointing my parents, but I also felt intense relief for not having to do it anymore.
Now the problem stems from the fact that I am from a certain country where my race doesn't really take mental health seriously. My family already thinks I'm kinda crazy and eccentric and therfore my dad thinks I'm being over dramatic with my mental illnesses. My mom heavily believes that pills that people use for mental illness causes more problems, and so when we got a prescription for anxiety medication, she said I was not going to drink it, and therefore we never bought it. 

So now here I am months later and they still don't get that these mental things are really what's ruining my life and not my medical illnesses.
The second part of the problem is that they expect me to choose a study route right now and I just don't think I can. Not only were we supposed to follow up with the therapist for my anxiety, but she was also gonna help me choose a direction so that I don't just choose whatever looks like it pays the most and what my parents suggest again. My mom heavily encouraged me to come home and figure myself out, but now I feel like every conversation they try to have with me is gonna be about how I should choose a direction and I better do it soon. 

She also says that she would never choose job directions for her kids, but she keeps telling me that the only jobs that are gonna be available in the future and make money  are engineers or teachers and she knows that I have financial anxiety the most. I feel like this is all they've been talking about in the 6-8 months I've been home, and I don't know what to do because I don't want to disappoint them more than I already have. 
I just feel so uncomfortable in my childhood home and I didn't think it would be like this when I came home, and I feel like I'm gonna be a 22 year old failure next year if I don't go study but I honestly think all I'll do is have an actual mental break and waste money if I go back, because I don't even feel like I can broach the topic of me maybe having depression cuz I don't want them to have to spend more money on me and be more worried about me plus they probably won't even take it seriously. 


Also, everytime my parents ask for money I give it to them and most of the money I make from the work that I do goes to my dad because I feel bad because he is in financial distress right now, but when I want to buy things for myself with my money I sometimes get shamed or I feel ashamed myself for using money on myself instead of helping my parents. 

I acknowledge that I'm a lazy child that sleeps a lot so in my mind this is the least I can do for them. But when they shame me for sleeping after I've worked through the night, it makes me feel worse and like I can't do any of the work because then I feel like I'm an inconvenience. Everyday feels like it's getting worse and I've lost interest in almost all of my previous hobbies. 

My parents honestly mean well and just want me to be independant, but I don't think they know how to go about it in an affectionate and productive way. 

Can you guys maybe just give me some perspective on how to handle things?? Maybe tell me about your lives and how you got out of slumps like this?",29Jul2020,1
1035,"I live with my best friend in a cute little apartment in the city. We moved in about 6 six weeks ago. The day I was moving in, a girl in the elevator came up to my family and said ""This isn't a safe place to live. I saw someone get shot out my window. I'm getting out."" We were, as anyone would be, freaked out. We looked it up, and she was right. It was sometime in May. But there's a good amount of crime in any city, and we figured we shouldn't go up to our knees in expenses (it would cost thousands of dollars to buy out the lease) based on one person's opinion. It's a diverse neighborhood, and we couldn't rule out the idea that maybe, she had some racial bias. I'm a white person, and I don't feel inherently uncomfortable living in a predominantly Black neighborhood, but I recognize that some people (perhaps her?) have that bias.

Fast forward about six weeks, to yesterday morning, broad daylight. I hear maybe 15 loud pops and look out my window to see people in the park next door running and diving on the ground. There's adults and kids and even a baby. Two people were shot, although both walked away with non-critical injuries. I saw and heard the whole thing. I walk by that spot almost every time I go out to get groceries. I'd walked by it that morning when I went up the street to get bananas. It could have easily been me or my roommate in the crossfire.

My roommate doesn't want to move, and I don't love the idea of it either. We've got about 10 months left on the lease. We're finally living together (we were both with other roommates previously, who were each less than ideal for varying reasons) and this apartment has really started to feel like a home. We've decorated and cooked and made it our own. But on the other hand, I'm afraid to go outside. We could probably find someone to sublet our unit and walk away with only a new set of moving expenses (non trivial, for sure, but I'd be willing to pay them for all our stuff). There's also some added pressure from my parents who were already psyched out about the elevator incident, and are now extremely on edge. I can't say I blame them, because I'm sure if people were getting shot at outside my kid's door I wouldn't be able to sleep either. I've been looking up crime statistics. There have been 95 violent crimes within 1500 feet of our building within the past year, including 4 homicides. For comparison, the apartment I moved from had 19 violent crimes within 1500 feet in the past year, including 1 homicide. I don't really know how to parse that, but I thought it might be useful to include some sort of data.

My roommate is a wonderful person and is extremely sympathetic. If I say I absolutely can't do it anymore, and the only way I can live happily/not constantly in fear/able to leave my house is if we move to a different place, I know she'll do it. And not only that, but she'll be supportive and kind and won't even complain. But I know she'll hate having to go through the whole moving process again (as will I). And I'll feel so guilty asking her to do that on my behalf. We've decided to give it a few days to process what happened — it was only yesterday, after all — but I'm worried I'll still feel afraid to leave the house.

Am I overreacting? What would you do?",29Jul2020,1

I haven't gone out for maybe 5-6 months, I only go to do groceries with my family and I know if I go out no one is going to bother me nor my family nor the government, even my dad tries to motivate me to go out, but I can't, I don't feel it is the right thing to do at this moment. Ppl says that we should be continuing our lives and I agree but by now I want to wait, but when I see my family going out while I stay at home like a dumbass I get pretty mad and sad, now I don't tell them a shit I, I used to argue with my dad but at the end I was the woman that was mad bc was on her period and I haven't confronted my sis bc when she has a BF she breaths for them do I don't bother bc I know she won't listen to me. I know they don't care and at the end I'm the one who is forcing me to stay at home, but even I'm pretty mad abt it, even jealous, for example my sister goes out and sees that boy or my dad goes to see his friend, while I stay at home, alone just doing nothing or as we say in Mx ""valiendo verga"".

Also I think abt seeing my friends or that guy but everyone is doing quarantine and I know that as my dad and sis go out, if they get sick I'll get sick and I don't want to risk any of my friends or ppl around me.

1038,"These past 2 years have been a bit tough for me (19F) but since my teenage years that I've started having ups and downs with my emotions, wellbeing, life I've been certain for one thing: who I am and who I am not (I was kind, funny, compassionate). Of course  I've been proven wrong about some things (realised shitty behaviour, fixed it, grown etc) but I still had fixed things in my personality . 
  I'm starting to realise, however, that I've changed a lot. In fact I may not be the same person at all. In the past even when I felt depressed I was never a bad person, now I'm making snarky remarks all the time, I dont make efforts to be kind or pleasant and get angry easily. I dont have patience for even my own best friend (I'm ticked off when she does something I feel like it's stupid even tho I keep my mouth shut) and generally I feel toxic traits of myself coming to life.  Most times I dont wanna stay home but i dont really wanna do anything outside of it.
Also I feel like I used to be smart but now I feel, and I'm told, I'm quite dumb. I have developed some minor speech issues too...
Lastly, and I'm sorry this is so long, I feel insecure with my relationship (pls dont tell me to break up) and any time I'm expressing myself and ""whine""/complain to my bf for something I feel really guilty afterwards even if I was mostly right. This affects me greatly since the time we spend together is probably the biggest source of happiness for me right now (and also a source of much sorrow).
I dont have energy (literally feel tired even though I sleep many hours) to do anything and weirdly I dont even feel bad or pessimistic (unless I'm arguing with my partner) about anything... 

Can someone tell me what's going on and how not to be shitty and feel guilty afterwards?

1041,"Has anyone bought a home in the Austin area (Austin, Pflugerville, Round Rock) under these same conditions? If so, do you have any advice on the best course to home ownership? 

Currently renting, and our land lord already mentioned raising the rent again once the lease is over due to his property taxes increasing and him wanting to get closer to break-even (i.e. our rent payment to cover his mortgage/interest and property taxes). It just seems like such a waste of money to be spending that much on rent just to pay off someone else’s mortgage, and have nothing to show for it after the year is up because you’ve gained no equity. 

It seems like sellers don’t want to deal with someone utilizing FHA instead of a conventional loan, or with only 3.5% down rather than a larger sum. 

I’m not sure if we need to be working with a different realtor who will advocate for us better or what. It seems like she just assumes things rather than trying to fight for us. For example, we had put in an offer for a house and the listing agent said it was a good offer to consider. Fast forward to decision time and our realtor says that the listing agent has emailed her that the sellers went with a different offer and that the listing agent “quizzed” her on our fha loan, therefore the other buyers must have had a conventional loan and more “skin in the game”. It just seems highly presumptuous and like she didn’t really try to advocate for us to “win” the house. Which I’ve read reviews for other realtors where the buyer has mentioned that the realtor fought for them and negotiated, etc. 

For added information, credit isn’t an issue, we just don’t have $60K for a down payment because rent prices are already pretty high, which makes it difficult to save large sums of money. But the amount of rent we pay basically already pays for a mortgage and taxes, so monthly, we would be able to afford the payment. Additionally, we have already been preapproved for the fha loan. 

Anyone else struggle with this or does everyone have 20% saved in their back pocket to buy a house?",29Jul2020,1
1043,"I’ve been living in my current apartment for over a year, and just renewed my lease last month. 

Since we moved in, my roommate occasionally got a very faint whiff of cigarettes in our bathrooms, but not enough to bother us. We figured it might just be residual from a previous resident that the bathroom fans stir up from time to time.

However, in the past few weeks, we’ve been getting very strong second-hand smoke throughout our apartment. We assume it’s coming from a neighbor or something, but no idea which. It has increased to the point that it’s sometimes unbearable to be in our kitchen, and on multiple occasions I’ve had to go to bed with my head under the sheets at night. 
 
I emailed the apartment office about it two weeks ago, but haven’t gotten a response; they’re usually very quick to respond to any messages. There’s nothing in the lease about cigarettes or smoke, apart from a potential move-out cleaning fee for smoke stains and smell.

1049,"Sorry if this is a mess. I can't think straight.

In the past I've been very depressed, to the point of attempting suicide. It's slowly gotten better, and progressively I've become more comfortable with doing things that make me feel better. 2020 for me has, controversially, been very good. I've felt fine, and even very well at points. In 2017-2019 being ""fine"" was a good day. Now it's just tuesday. The last few weeks have been very, very good for me. I've been on dates, had plenty of interactions with friends, all that. I even had the best date of my life this monday c: Yesterday and today, though, have been terrible. I've fallen into the same traps I used to years ago, mostly barely eating at all (it's 11pm and I've only eaten breakfast today...) and avoiding everyone socially. 

The thing is, while I've taken steps to make myself feel better, it's only for permanent improvements. I'm trans, and one of the greatest improvements has been to finally, after over a year of being out, getting women's clothes. That's a permanent thing, though (or whatever you'd call it: I'll feel slightly better, most of the time because of it), but when it comes to temporary problems like feeling like utter crap and breaking down crying five times a day I can't even bring myself to ask a few friends if they want to go out and do something, even less invite someone over to sheer me up after admitting to them I feel like shit. 

I feel like I can't put my finger on why I don't look for help. I know I need it, but when I sit down, open my phone and think about writing to someone, I always feel so unwanted. Like, why would they care or want to help? What if I'm not close enough to them and I'm overstepping boundries? Why do I even deserve help? I've gotten myself out of it before, so why should I be a bummer to everyone else around me? They probably have better things to do. I don't know, it's just a lot going through my head of why not to do it, but I know that they care about me (most I've known for almost half a decade), that whoever I'd ask would probably not just be willing to but be able to help me, that I probably won't bring people down with me and that they'd probably even feel good about hanging out if I told them I needed help getting out of a depressive episode. But I'm not sure about that, like, maybe those anxieties are there for a reason, so I don't ask for help. I just sit, alone, distracting myself from me feeling worthless. I don't know why, but I don't know how to stop, either. 

Most of this is just venting. I don't know if someone could help me, but if someone wants to try or share their own experiences I'd be happy to read it.",29Jul2020,1

1054,"I know this sounds strange but here goes. My sister seems to be getting too obsessed with my hair recently. She will never own up to it or admit it, but I know that it comes from how mine is everything hers isn't. Mine is thick and I have a lot of it, meanwhile she has extremely fine, thinning hair and I know this is very upsetting for her. I don't know if jealousy is the best word, but I'm sure you know what I mean. Over lockdown as we have been at home all together a lot more, (I'm 25 and she's 30) she hasn't stopped going on about my hair. If I am working at the table, she will come up behind me and start playing with it, touching it, taking it out of its ponytail. As said, this seems to come from how mine is what hers isn't, and she will go at my hair because it's so thick which she wishes she has. Yes I know, strange but generally harmless. 

Whenever I wash it she will constantly go asking will she plait it for me. Would this be genuinely just trying to be helpful, or with a mixture of the stemmed issue? 

I can cope with and don't mind above. What I do mind however is how she meddles with my washing of it. I usually wash it every 2 or 3 days and every day I hear her say ""There's no need to wash your hair,"" ""Oh please don't wash your hair"". It is not her place to try calling the shots on this. I don't even engage with her on this anymore, hopefully if I keep up the silence she might get the message at some stage, but I really doubt it. I know her and know her well enough to know that she will never ever stop, so I can't assert myself and stand up to her either. 

She came into me in my bedroom one morning and started brushing it. I didn't mind that much, whatever. The worst of all, though is how she sometimes, when I am in the bath showering she will come in to wash her hands and brush her teeth, and will stand there watching as I'm, you guessed it, washing my hair. She will also pass comments on how I am washing it, stuff like that.

It didn't really help, because most of my classmates see me as a ""ticking bomb"" and refuse to see that I've changed. 

I've felt really anxious lately and I have only two friends I feel comfortable talking to. One of them is a beginner artist just like me and asks for a lot of attention towards her art. What I mean is spamming heart emojis and compliments. And I usually do so, because I don't want to offend her, but a few days ago I was really busy and couldn't leave so much feedback. She went offline for two days without warning anyone and when she came back I apologized and said that I was really worried. That was true, but I didn't say anything about being pissed at her for leaving for such a stupid reason. But everyone wants to be alone for some time, I get it.
Anyway, today she sent me messages of her and her friend talking about doing a collab together with me, but the friend was scared of me. The girl said that our anti-socialness was killing her. After all of the re-sent messages she laughed and called me a beast jokingly. I know it was just a joke, but it still hurt me because of the things mentioned above. And I still stayed silent and just sent a meme in response. Should I do something with that?

1061,"I (21F) was not raised by my bio parents. I've never met my bio mom as I was taken from her by CPS as an infant due to her being an abusive drug addict. When I was around 16, I saw a photo of my bio mom on facebook, and she had posted a photo of herself with 2 kids that were apparently hers. I had spoken with her a few times at this point but still never met her in person, she never once ever mentioned these kids. 

The girl is now around 16-17 years old and the boy looks to be around 11 or 12. My maternal aunt reached out to me and confirmed that yes these two kids were my half siblings, and that they too were taken away from our mother by CPS (the dad was also out of the picture), so the kids were sent to some relatives on the dad's side. After 5 years of digging, my aunt found where they were. I was so happy and ready to meet them, though I doubted they even knew I existed. Hell, I wouldn't have even known they existed if not for that photo. 

My aunt reached out to the caretaker, who asked who she was. Once my aunt explained she was family from the kids' mother's side, the caretaker just started ignoring her and stopped responding. So i decided to reach out, as I feel i have the right to know my siblings. I messaged her directly, telling her I was the kids' older sister. No response. I desperately reached out to people on her friends list who often commented on her posts. I ask them ""do you know X?"" They say yes, then I explain who i am and if they can contact her for me. They then shift their stories and say ""oh no wrong person, i dont know her"". They've all done this, and I know they're lying as the caretaker has an unusual name. 

I get that our mom's side of the family is a dumpster fire and i dont have any contact with any of them either except for my aunt who's the only sane one. I feel like this woman is deliberately trying to keep me cut off from them at this point because i'm from their mother's side. It's as though she's told her friends that if i come asking to tell me they dont know her, despite being obviously close friends. I feel like giving up at this point, after all these years i finally found them and now, for absolutely no reason this woman won't let me even talk to them. I feel its both theirs and my right to know each other, and i also wanted them to meet their little nephew.

1062,"This post has also been posted on the disability thread as well.

I’m 21 years old was diagnosed with a rare brain disorder called Chiari Malformation Type 1 in June 2019. Prior to my diagnosis, I was in college and began experiencing random blackouts that would occur for 20-30 seconds at a time, daily migraines, chronic neck pain, issues comprehending and remembering information, and constant brain fog/slurred words. Because of the blackouts, I was labeled as unable to drive. I had surgery in January 2020 to remove a portion of my skull and first vertebrae to help improve my condition, since there is not a cure. Since then, I still have all chronic pain symptoms with exception to the blackouts. Just last Saturday I was triggered to have a painful migraine and light sensitivity from listening to the rain by my bedroom window. No medications have helped as I’ve worked with both a neurologist and primary care doc to help relieve my symptoms but nothing helps unless I sleep. It concerns me as working full time post-college graduation seems impossible if just fluorescent lights, the sounds of rain, and other simple lights/sounds can trigger for me to be incapable of doing anything for the rest of a potential work day. 

Before college, I was granted a highly reputable scholarship designated for the top 40-42 high school students in the state annually. Since then, my symptoms have progressed to the point of my neurosurgeon listing me as “moderately/extremely” disabled within my file depending on the daily activities I participate in. I’m extremely disappointed and honestly just flat out sad that I felt I could help so many people with my “intellectual gifts” and it all seemed to shatter down from 2017 as things become noticeable and then unbearable. I’ve tried to work part time in some industries (retail cashier, food worker, senior caretaker, and data entry desk job). All of them have been difficult to deal with as there is damage from my brain stem that affects my ability to be be on a computer, sitting, standing, and doing even school work now as a college student. I still have my intellect at times and can explain things with good comprehension but once a trigger happens, the whole day goes downhill. I’m really scared that the blackouts could return at any moment since my neurologist knows that they aren’t caused by my brain disorder. I want to work and potentially get a master’s degree, but realistically I believe my symptoms are taking over my life to the point where I can’t even work at a fast-food joint. Any thoughts or support for my situation?? I have no idea if I should attempt to apply for disability or continue to try and find a job/career that relates to my degree (Communication and Fine Art double major) that is accommodating with my disability.

She criticizes screenshots of art and redraws them to show how much better she is, and all behind their backs! She makes fun of them for not improving or having the skill that she has. I'm shocked at what a horrible person she is behind her friendly attitude, and it's making me both sad and angry.

I'm frustrated that all these smaller artists who've worked really hard are being criticized left and right just because they're practicing and don't have the luxury of formal classes paid for them by their parents.

Obviously not all men are like this, but I have this irrational fear of marriage. What if I'm put in the same situation as them? I don't want to be powerless.

How do I get over this fear of marriage? Do you have any tips in being fully independent while married? I know I should keep my bank details separate from my partner and have a sustainable job, but I don't know much else. What are some red flags to look for in someone?

1070,"This is my first time writing something here but it's my best choice right now I think. I'm 17 female and last night I went to a party and a friend and I got a bit drunk. He was groping me and he even pulled my shirt down two times when we were alone. He was way more drunk than I was and even though I wasn't quite sure of what was happening, I remember feeling very weird, confused and upset about it. I pulled myself away when he pulled my shirt and then found my other friends. The issue is that I haven't been able to stop thinking about it and I feel like crying every time. Is it normal or I'm overreacting? I know there are way worse things that could've happened that I don't even want to imagine but even that sort of simple thing just feels so weird and awful.

 I just feel like if I do this I'll fail everyone expectations about me and even thought I have great friends I'm feeling ashamed of telling them the truth.

1081,"I've ducked over a lot of people and I have made mistakes but I genuinely care about repenting and dying with positive *karma*

I live in a decent sized town in Connecticut US. I was adopted at 4 with my brother (21 now) and I'm still in the house with my brother and adoptive mother. (57 in December) unfortunately we just can't be calm with each other.

 I was a typical big brother growing up, and I was a lazy under achiever in my adoptive mothers eyes. In my real mom's (40) eyes, I'm responsible and always focused on success. She doesn't have any problems with me but I have problems with her and how my brother and I were impacted by her decisions. (She was 16 when i was born. Allegedly my grand mother sold my mom to my dad (10 years older than my mom &amp; I always forget hes a part of this) who then allegedly raped him and threatened her life if she aborted me :/ 

I can see why she would have me. But then she has my brother which I dont understand. Then she has 6 more kids by the age of 40. Her youngest, a pair of twins were born this year. She's struggled to this day and she keeps fucking up my siblings with her behavior and choices. ( two 1yos, 6,8,16,18) 

Malnourishment, a ghetto attitude, and no vision of the future are all hitting these kids and it makes me so sad. Sometimes I feel inadequate because I was taken from her. 

Now in 2020/the last few years, they are all so aggressive towards me. My brother yells at me every time he sees me and my adoptive mother only cares about her house and shows little interest in anything besides me leaving. I would lean on my friends but they're not good at being supportive or being helpful. And when I dont need someone, they're just boring. They don't want to do new stuff. 

I just want to stop talking to them because its dragging my mood down. I dont feel like any of them make me better in a significant way. Is it wrong for me to feel this deeply? And second, any advice for executing my plan of separation?

1083,"Hey,

I kinda fucked up with a few people I choose to work together.
A few month ago a friend (A) and me started a project where we needed the help of a few more people (the team) . Everything was fine until we went through some applications and there were someone who's application i didn't like and I would have refused them but one of the persons  in the team (B) held her hand into the fire to get her in that project.
A few days later two of the people started asking questions and when my answers weren't good enough (other people didn't have trouble understanding), they got rude towards me. After a few hours trying to explain them without success, I got extremely frustrated and asked B what the fuck was that deal with the rude person, because it was the one I would have refused (&amp; they are friends). This got very heated and she started bashing me as well.
At this point I really regretted starting this project, even though there were some people reaching out to me not to take the arguments to heart.
The mood in the team was extremely static after that. 
So a few days ago B started contacting a few people with missing information after I asked someone to do that. It's originally the task of A, who I already asked a few days beforehand but probably forgot it. A then got upset and asked B not to do that again.
Just a few minutes later, the same people as last time started spamming with questions directed at B. I got frustrated again because I asked A not to talk to B about it because I KNEW something like that would happen.

Trying to get some of the frustration out I started writing my experiences down somewhere unrelated, ignoring the fact that one of Bs friends could read it. B then called me out on it, which worsened the mood further. 

What can I do to make it a bit more pleasant working with this team again? I was never that good with other people and I haven't ever been in a situation like this.
 I really wish I could just drop this project and turn to dust, but there are already about 50 people involved. You can believe me, if I knew it would turn out like this, I wouldn't have started this in the first place.",29Jul2020,1

1087,"ok, first off, apologies if i dont do this right, im very new to reddit and i really need advice on what to do, also there might be spelling errors since im on mobile, but here goes.

so basically my dad wanted to go on a trip to texas to visit his sister, and apparently he told my sister at the beginning of the summer they were going to texas but failed to inform me. well one day it came up in conversation and she told me about it.

so ofcourse i asked him and he said yes he was planning on going and he asked me if i wanted to go and i said sure. he told me itd be a 12 hr drive which didnt really click at the time since i was tired.

well a few days later i was thinking about it and i realized i really didnt want to go. first off its the middle of a pandemic and we live in the areas where its really bad and travel probably isnt the best idea since my family is anti-mask (please dont judge them for this, i am trying to get them to wear a mask). secondly, i get motion sick. after about an hour or so of non-stop driving my body turns against me and i get miserable. lastly, my parents are divorced, and my dads family is so rude about it. every time i visit they always talk about how awful my mother is in front of me, which is so rude. i dont want to have to listen to that all week.

so, a good two weeks before the trip, which is on friday, i asked my dad if its not too late to back out. he said that was fine and he hadnt even called to tell them we were coming yet so its not too late. i thought that was the end of it until the next morning my sister yelled at me about how i ruin everything and i asked what she meant and she said that no one gets to go on the trip cause im staying and my dad refuses to leave me home ""alone"".

now i am 16 and very much old enough to stay home for a week alone. also my moms house is, i kid you not, right across the street. if me staying home alone was his problem, i could stay w my mom. and i wont even be home alone cause his wife is staying home too. 

so naturally these past few weeks ive had to put up with my sister constantly screeming at me that she took off of work for this, and shes been planning this all summer (i didnt even know abt it till a few weeks ago???) and she keeps telling ppl that im ruining her life and stuff. my dad is so much worse. he yells at me anytime its brought up, saying im faking my motion sickness and that ive never had motion sickness before (i have, and ive told him about it each time but he likes to ignore the things he doesnt like). he says that corona isnt real so i have nothing to worry abt and he likes to tell me im an awful daughter for not letting him see his family (ouch). 

ive asked my dad to get my sister to stop yelling at me and he says he wont cause shes right. theyve done this before too. i say i dont want to do something and they constantly harrass me till i feel like a crap excuse for a human and finally agree to their demands. i refuse to break this time, but its hard when im constantly berated. this has already sent me into a depressive episode and ive resorted to locking myself in my room, but that doesnt stop them.

so please someone, tell me how to get them to stop being so mean? im tired of it and i just need advice on how to make them stop or how to peaceful resolve this conflict?",29Jul2020,1
1088,"I've always had problems making friends, it was okay during school but now after two years of university I've made almost none in this new city.

There are a lot of possible causes. I'm really quiet, work a lot and don't reach out enough to my friends. I've been bullied and exploited for years and am always self conscious about whether people actually like me. I'm unable to make close connections to people, very slow with opening up and fear being with someone alone (as I'm so silent and akward). I've been to a psychologist, but she didn't help me - maybe I will try to again go to one.


Today I've finished my exams. From my only real closer friend here I've heard almost nothing anymore, I fear we are losing touch. Some acquaintances are having a nice evening, they didn't invite me explicitly though. Another group is having a party, I've been invited but only through group chat and I don't feel like they actually want me there. So I'm now sitting at home and sad and probably will be in this position the next few weeks.

I heard lonely people usually isolate themselves further and feel like people don't like them. But literally everyone from university only reaches out when they need help with lectures, often don't thank me and don't answer when I'm asking how they're doing. When I'm doing something with them I usually only sit around.

I don't blame them. I'm just an acquaintance who's really helpful when you need help with homework but otherwise easily overlooked.


So I'm thinking about writing some former friends and ask them how they feel about me. Why they don't answer, when I start a chat and what they think, why we lost contact. To see whether my self-image of being boring is actually true. To see myself though the eye of others. Would this be a good idea? How should I go about that?

My dad and I have always been close despite him being a drug addict sociopath we’ve always been close. He’s all I got.. so sometimes you gotta work with what you got. Also necessary info is that my past few boyfriends have been billionaires/multimillionaires so I completely understand people thinking I’m a gold digger but I’ve never sold myself

Anywhoooo yesterday I’m minding my own business when I get a phone call from my dad and he says In a demanding shitty tone “how do you know coco”? And I’m like wtf? I only know one coco and it’s some girl I went to highschool with who is now a hooker strung out on heroin. I’ve never even talked to her in my life not even in school. HOWEVER I recently had a little fling with one of her longterm ex boyfriends named Jeremy. So i tell my dad that. And he says something along the lines of “well how do you know Eric”? And at this point I’m like wtf is up with the tone and I have no idea who Eric is. Then my dad said Eric is the attorney friend of jeremys. I remember Jeremy always talking about eric the attorney friend so I’m like oh yeah I’ve heard of him. But at this point I’m like how tf does my 65 year old dad know all this? Anyways I tell him I know of Eric and my dad continues to say “ Jeremy told coco and Eric that you were some big time prostitute and that you and him do bondage stuff and a bunch of crazy shit” so now I realize Jeremy cocos ex and Eric’s friend is apparently telling people all this crazy shit to me and because my dads a drug addict he just somehow happened to be in the same crowd as Eric and coco. I’m shocked because I don’t even know coco or Eric. And me and Shane were never very close, I have no idea why he’s saying all this stuff about me. ( should add he texted me a few days ago saying I was his dream girl and paragraphs on paragraphs of just random stuff basically saying he wants to be with me)

Ok so my main problem out of all of this aside from rumors being spread even to my dad that I’m soMe huge whore... is that obviously my dad was trying to get more and more info from these people. Nobody’s gonna just talk shit to someone’s dad about their kid. He had to have been encouraging them to keep talking. Out of everyone in the world my dad is the one person who is supposed to defend my name. He should have stopped them in their tracks. What kind of dad just let’s people talk shit about their kid to them and gives no fucks. When we talked on the phone it anytging his tone was saying he didn’t believe me and that I’m an idiot. My feelings are super hurt.  My dad knows about my ex’s and their social and financial status and didn’t care at all btw. 

On top of all this I get a text last night from my dads meth head friend Jeff. Jeff and I have only met maybe 2 times. He’s only texted me once before and it was saying thAt I’m a bitch for not giving my dad money. This time he said “sucking wrinkly old dick isn’t a job” I defended myself and he claimed “your dad tells everyone all about it, you’re a prostitute and you play for pay.” So I’m like what the actual fuck. This is unrelated to everything above so now I’m thinking my dad was probably encouraging coco and Eric and I’m just some joke and topic for him to gossip about.

Should I cut my dad out of my life? I want to stress that I’m extremely hurt by this. The only thing that really bothers me to my core is that my dad didn’t stand up for me at all apparently. Idk I’m having a hard time really putting what I feel into words.",29Jul2020,1

Earlier today we had what, at first, seemed like a ridiculous argument that quickly escalated.

My husband woke up in the middle of the night because I had stolen all of the blankets off of him in my sleep. I woke up to him rummaging through the closet to find our extra comforter.

1099,"(23 m).  Sorry if this is a bit long, feel free to skip to the tl/dr

**Background**: I graduated from college last May.  I was an overachiever in college (3.9 gpa, won multiple national scholastic honors in my field of study).   I say this not to brag or pat myself on the back, just to establish my qualification level.  I had comparable work experience to most other students coming out my major, and I also was a VP in the major's student org.  Most students in my major made 50-60k straight out of college (literally every single student before me got a salary at least in this range). 

**Where It Went Awry**: Where I screwed up was my senior year of college.  I ran into a financial emergency, so I reluctantly took an entry-level job at my goal company, hoping someone would see my potential and I'd get promoted.  While my classmates waited til graduation and got 50-60k job offers in much higher positions, I was grinding out my days doing data entry, which isn't what I studied, and I'm not very good at.  I look bang average on my team, not someone who's they're clawing at the teeth to promote, but I simply am not a good fit for my current role.

**What I've Tried To Do To Fix It**: over the past year and a half, I've tried to get myself noticed at my company.  I've offered myself up for special projects.  I've always proposed Excel solutions to simplify processes.  I go to networking events.  I make myself a resource to others around me.  A manager at the company was on the panel for a scholarship essay I wrote (while I was still in college), and basically told me they'd offer me a job if they had one open, and that I should be able to find a job elsewhere in the company with my credentials.  I've added to my qualifications by getting a certification and being almost halfway through another one.  Nothing has worked to get my manager or anyone else to see that I have long-term potential. 

The job I want hasn't even opened itself on our job portal in the past year, but that didn't stop someone from my major and school with pretty much the same exact qualifications as me from coming in and getting my goal job (without it ever being posted for applications).  With the job not being posted, and me making no headway in finding a job through my intra-company network, I'm about ready to give up and try to find a new company.  This is my dream company though, and I like all my co-workers.  There isn't really another company in my area this big that has jobs doing what I want to do.

**What's Next**: I'm really at a loss for where I go next.  I know I'm ready for a bigger challenge.  It kills my self-esteem to see literally all of my former classmates surpass me.  The opportunity cost of working this job is 20k a year if I compare it to the average of what others with my same credentials make.  I need change.  

However, I'm concerned the ship may have sailed on getting the type of job my classmates got out of college.  I think I'm being pigeonholed into data entry.  I've applied to another major company in my area and they've ignored my application (depsite hiring someone fresh out of my major just last year).  Another major one rejected me (despite regularly hiring even the least qualified grads out of my major).  

I just can't pinpoint where I'm going wrong, on paper, I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.  

I'm going to be applying more places in the near future (I'm holding out a few weeks because my company is finally starting to hire people again after slowing down for Covid).  If those applications don't get me something new, I don't know what's next.  I can't let the value of my degree continue to go unrealized much longer.  I'm considering just saying fuck it and abandoning this career path entirely for grad school, law school, or a few niche fields I'd need to take exams to pursue.  I don't want to do that hastily though (the career path I'm on pays well and most graduates have been able to make something out of themselves in it, I'm just consistently getting unlucky.  I'm even considering going back to school to finish up a dual-degree (which I'm 7 classes away from), so I can rebrand myself as a new college grad, and get some of the opportunities that so many new grads seem to get that someone pigeonholed as an orderly worker can't.

*Any advice on how to turn my career around and maybe get a promotion in-house (or an opportunity elsewhere)?  If not, do you think it's maybe time I look to other career paths, or go get a dual degree to have more plentiful opportunities that are afforded to new hires?*

**TL/DR: I overachieved in college, but messed up my career prospects by taking a bad entry-level job doing something minimally related to my degree at my dream company (making 15k less than the least qualified of graduates with my degree make).  How can I get myself the type of job all my classmates got out of college, despite now being pigeonholed in a role with far less prospects 15 months out of college?**",29Jul2020,1

I really look up to people like Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman, and I kind of share their enthusiasm about math/science. They went to amazing colleges, and I think part of the reason they were so world-changing is because they went to universities like University of Chicago and MIT. Now, obviously I might not be the next Tesla or anything, but I still want to experience what they did. I want to be surrounded by new ideas, and ground breaking research, and top tier professors. I really wanna make the most out of college.

Even the people I only somewhat admire went to really good schools. Like, all of the bands I listen to met in college; and usually they met in really good colleges, like Berkeley or Tufts.

Obviously academia has changed alot since the 70s of course, or even the 90s. But now I feel like I need to go to a competitive school in order to be successful, or even just be surrounded by like-minded people who celebrate the advancement of human knowledge

1112,"My ex (M23) and I (F23) broke up right after Thanksgiving 2018. I was heartbroken but I picked myself up, dusted myself off and changed my own life. I got my career, developed healthy hobbies and six months later started a new relationship. One month after the breakup I had cut ties with all of his friends and family letting them know that I was trying to make a clean break to avoid drama and help with the healing process. 

Over a year and a half later, I am happily engaged and have not spoken to my ex more than once when he reached out to check on me and my family at the beginning of the pandemic. I haven't reached out to him amd I have had him blocked on all my social media. 

Truth is during the breakup he broke my heart. He had issues with promising in private he wanted to marry me when in public he denied his willingness for commitment. His brother verbally abused me and he did nothing to help me. And yet the whole time I dated him I was told by everyone that I was the toxic one in the relationship. 

The breakup saved my life not that I knew it at the time. I'm finally in a great place in my life and so far I've done well with not unblocking him or reaching out but recently my fiance heard through the grapevine that his ex regreted dumping him. He has been quietly smug. He finally got the satisfaction of knowing someone regrets losing him. I know it's petty but part of my secretly hopes my ex finds out I got engaged. I'm sure I'm being a jerk and holding a grudge.

I also got my first paycheck and it shows my rate as $32/hour. Now, I have the pay rate offer in writing, so I'm fighting him over that issue, but the rest was just told to me, not written.

All of this alone makes me want to move on because this job is quickly proving to not be as advertised. To add to the issue, I had to pay out of pocket to have a medical problem checked out and now need some expensive tests I can't really afford. A friend of mine in the field had an employee quit and is offering me the position and the ability to get health care so I can take care of myself.

Dr.              ,

I am sorry to inform you that due to recent medical testing finding that I have a serious health issue that needs additional expensive tests and treatment, I must give you this letter as my official resignation effective as of Wednesday, August 5th, 2020. 

If I were able, I would have provided you with at least a two week notice, however, I have a friend who is able to offer me a last minute job in a position that begins August 6th, 2020 which offers me the ability to have immediate health care, which is very much needed due to my recent health problem that I’ve been told should not be put off. I cannot afford treatment, however, minus health insurance without financially ruining my husband and myself. I hope you accept my apologies for such short notice, but my husband and I believe this is the best choice for us and that I should not pass it up in the interest of my health. 

Thank you for providing me with this opportunity to gain experience. I have a lot of respect for your skill and manner with your patients. I believe you have a great team who will take excellent care of the clients. 

Please let me know if I can make this transition easier. I will do my best to assist in training a replacement, if possible. I will answer more questions if you have them and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this may cause you.

Sincerely,  
OP""

1120,"To make this simple, 
My dad has been in the military his whole life so that means he wasn’t much in my life as I was growing up. 
Also my mom made it hard for me to be around. ( she’s crazy)
He wasn’t there for birthdays, but would call on holidays- sometimes even be present for holidays. 
Most my teenage years I was in hospitals and he probably visited me once, but would call time to time. 
I was a huge daddy’s girl when I was little. Him coming home to visit was like Christmas for me and my sister. 

A few years ago he got married, nice lady, and now I have a half brother. 
I didn’t take the news too good. I had the idea planted in my head that he always wanted a boy and now he had one so where did that leave me? The daughter in the other state?
Me and my sister were pretty angry at my dad through our teenage years because ,“ he could’ve tried harder to be apart of our lives.” But since he got a son, him and my sister had a talk and he told her he wants to better our relationship so Christian ( my younger brother) will have family in the states when him and his wife, Angie, die. 

I know my dad cares and loves me and my sister, there is no doubt. He’s calm headed and reasonable, he listens to me when I’m emotional about how I feel like a pest in his life- I’ve expressed a few times how I feel, so this isn’t a secret. he always reassures me he loves me and Always talks it through with me, but his reasoning to want to work on our relationship doesn’t help me feel any better about the situation. 

Now to catch up: 

He was suppose to fly me out to visit a month ago, but got canceled because I told my grandma I’d “maybe” drive with her out there.
I wouldn’t have said “ maybe I’ll drive with you 9 hours, grandma!” If I would’ve known he would’ve immediately canceled the idea of just flying me out there... 
I’m not sure if he lied when he said “ I can’t find a flight for you.” Because me just driving would be cheaper for him. 

Which leads me to my next rant, this might make me sound... spoiled ? Idk but you tell me:

My dad has money, for sure. He sends my brother to a private school for starters, nice house, both have $$ballin$$ jobs. 
There was a time in my life I needed help with money because I was Mentally going through hell, quit my job and everything- big mistake. I never had problems with money until then. I know my dad isn’t obligated to help me and I would NEVER have asked him if I wasn’t desperate, but I did call him and explain my situation and if he could help me out. 
His response was reasonable, he didn’t want to give me money when I f*cked up and it was my own responsibility, he didn’t want to enable me. But he gave me 100$ on a card for food. 

This is where my head is: 

I’m not sure if I want to drive 9 hours to see a guy who half asses a relationship with me. 
I know he’s “maybe” excited to have me come down and see Christian and everything. But at the same time if I don’t go it’s just a “ shrug of shoulders “ to him. Maybe a sigh. 
But every time we try and text or call on the phone it’s bland, same thing,” how’re you! Hope you’re okay! Miss you! “ and then maybe hear from him again weeks later. 
If he can spend over 10k a year on my brother why can’t he just spend a couple hundred to fly me out? 
Or even help me the ONE time I ever ask him !? 

I’m not sure if I self sabotage my own relationships and expect to much? 
If someone asked me “ do you think your dad loves you” I’d say yes, but I really do feel like his left behind family while he works hard for his new family. 
I live in IN while he lives in SC

I am 25 and my brother is like, 5 
Maybe I’m over thinking again, I’m just hurt by thinking he could really care less to have anything to do with me. 
I haven’t been able to visit him in YEARS because of money, I would think if he wanted to see me he would offer to fly me out and visit or even help me with the flight. But “ they’re just so busy” or “ stuff is going on” ugh! I don’t know what to think! And I have to decide what to do with the car ride before tonight !",29Jul2020,1

1122,"I have been with my incredible boyfriend for over 2 years and we've been living together for 1+ years. Basically from when we first met he has expressed his desire to go to a music festival with me (EDM to be specific). I am not a big fan of EDM (although he's kind of turning me into one!) so this isn't a big deal for me. But he LOVES it. The first 2 summers of our relationship we were unable to find a good one to go to and get tickets. That was a disappointing, but our goal was to finally go to one this year. We bought tickets early this year to a festival in August. He was insanely excited!!! I was actually excited as well because the line-up was amazing and I actually knew some of the artists. My boyfriend was so excited, he even made a playlist on Spotify of all the artists that would be there and we listened to it every time we drove anywhere. We booked a hotel in the area for that weekend and everything was good to go. 

Unfortunately, that's obviously not happening anymore. The festival has been cancelled for obvious reasons. It's technically been post-poned to next year. I feel so bad because he's been wanting to go to a festival with me for years and he is such a big fan of this genre of music and the line-up is so great. Of course this isn't my fault, but I want to do something to ""make it up to him"". So I came up with the idea of having a virtual music festival in our living room. There have been several virtual EDM festivals online over the past few months and my boyfriend has watched parts of them. 

I know the experience of being there is COMPLETELY different, but I thought I would do something nice for him and maybe have a bit of fun from our living room. This won't be a whole weekend thing since that will be too long for a virtual festival (that would get boring!). So, I am planning to create a 2 hour video of various concert videos put together of the artists that he likes that were suppose to be at this festival. I snuck onto his Spotify (I have his phone password) to see which songs from these artists he likes. You can find live concert tour videos from these artists online. So I downloaded one concert video from each artist and I will ""cut"" the videos to only include the songs that he knows (otherwise, my overall plan will last like 10 hours if I included every song from each artist!). 

I thought this idea was really good at first but now I think it's lame. I have already suggested to him that I am planning something for this weekend lol. I will definitely get us some beers/coolers and I will bake stuff and have fun snacks. However, it will get boring sitting in front of a TV for 2 hours just watching concert videos as we aren't even there. I would even get bored if it was an artist that I REALLY liked! So I want to have something else to do while we have the virtual music festival on the TV in the background. I want to have a couple hours of a lot of fun while we watch this music festival, drink a lot of coolers and... do something else. I just can't figure out what the ""something else"" is and need your help reddit! What else should I have planned for that night? What could be fun to do?

Please don't suggest any sort of drugs. Neither of us are into any drugs. We have tried pot like 3 times total, but even if we wanted to do that we aren't legally allowed to in our condo (and we will not break these rules under any circumstances).",29Jul2020,1

1128,"I started talking to this girl (now my girlfriend) about 2 months ago. I knew she was skinny from looking at her instagram, but i didn’t know how skinny she really was. She’s so small you could put your pinky finger and thumb together, and it would go around her wrist. I want to try and tell her to gain some weight or workout with me but I’m scared of how she’ll react. I really do like her and if she said no it wouldn’t bother me at all. She’s still beautiful in every way, but im worried she might be seriously underweight. Anyone have any advice on I could tell her? Or does anyone know id this will go away once were completely out if puberty (shes 17)",29Jul2020,1
1130,"First time posting here. This past week has been terrifying and I just really want answers right now.

So about a week ago I was exposed to a loud noise (I was outside working directly next to the highway for about 1 hour. The closest lane is basically 1 metre from my head.) I’ve never had any hearing problems in the past, nor been very educated on this type of thing until now so of course I didn’t wear earplugs. At one point a motorcyclist decided to rev his engine while passing the closest lane to me. Easily the loudest thing I’ve ever heard, felt the rumble beneath my feet. 

A few hours later I developed a loud ringing/hissing sound in my left ear, which was facing the motorcycle. It hasn’t let up since then and is causing me a lot of worry and problems. 
 
I’ve noticed some increased sensitivity to sounds already, things that wouldn’t do much before, such as clinking dishes or even running the tap makes me flinch a little. 

I can barely sleep, I’ve been lucky to get more than 2 hours a night this past week, even with white noise. I’m a very quiet person and love about 80% of my day in complete silence, can’t even focus otherwise. And now that’s gone.

I’m also a writer, that’s basically the only thing I enjoy in life and is the only thing that’s been able to help me cope with my mental health issues for the past years. I usually need silence to do that, or else I can’t focus on it. Now that is also gone, so I’ve no way to even cope. It’s like my purpose has essentially been crushed.

I’m an extremely anxious person and always have been, so I’ve been unable to keep my mind off it for more than a couple hours... a couple times I thought it was getting better but then it spikes up again, just as bad as it was at first. 

It may help to know that I have braces which has been moving the position of my jaw to open up my left ear, though this has been going on for a while so I doubt it has anything to do with it...

Last month, my dad was exposed to a clap of thunder outside that caused him permanent tinnitus, so of course I’m more focused on this and worried than ever.

I’ve only ever been to 2 concerts in my life, though I have listened to loud music in my headphones from time to time because I was uneducated about this. I’ve had ear infections in that ear a couple times too, 3 or 4 over the past couple years.

Two days ago I went to a doctor, and he said there’s no sign of hearing loss, eardrum looks healthy, noise damage is most likely. But will this ever go away? He didn’t give a definitive answer and it’s so scary being uncertain of something so pivotal to my existence.

Can one sound really mess me up forever? I’m only 16. I didn’t know any better! I’m terrified. I’ve got my whole life to live! Without being able to write I have no way to cope with the stress, and it’s all a big loop. I’m so scared that this will be permanent. I feel like my dreams are over before they’ve even begun. 

This whole thing just feels so unfair... please, somebody help me. I just need answers. I know a lot of people “habituate” over time but they always say they can still hear it in quiet... and my whole life revolves around quiet. I feel like everything’s been destroyed for me and I’m scared... PLEASE SOMEBODY HELP ME!!",29Jul2020,1
1131,About a month ago I started thinking about death. Since that day every single night I have horrible thoughts about it. Laying on the hospital bed being afraid of what's gonna happen after you're gone. And then you suddenly just can't breath. Now I'm technically atheist but I believe something/someone made this world in one way or another. I'm kinda scared that reincarnation is a thing since this world is already messed up. And I'm also scared that I could disappear forever. The thought of not being able to feel anything it makes my brain want to explode. I know there's nothing I can do about it but just knowing that I'll have to go through this one day is so horribly terrifying... I can't sleep and I'm anxious as heck. I feel like I'm going insane. How do I stop those thoughts?,29Jul2020,1
1132,"When I (16M) was over at my friend’s (16F) house, she was sitting in front of me, on her bed, and I was holding her face in my hands. I gave her forehead a kiss, then her cheek. And then we stayed in that position, with her face in my hands, our forehead and nose touching. She had a really big smile on her face. I went for a kiss at this point, but I don’t think she kissed me back. She immediately buried her head in my lap and wrapped her arms tightly around my waist. I asked her “Why are you doing that?” (in a sweet voice lol) and she said “Cause I love you” (We’ve been saying it as friends for months). And we sat there holding each other for about a minute. 

It’s been 3 days since then and we’ve hung out once again, today. We did our normal stuff, like I kiss her cheek and forehead, she takes my hand and puts it on her leg while stroking my hand with her thumb, we hold hands interlocked, etc. I guess if you saw us you might assume we are a couple. But! There has been no mention of the kiss. Not even on that day, after we held each other. No mention at all. But man I really wanna know how she felt about it. I wanted to ask her today but I never got the courage. I just wanna know where her head/feelings are. I wanted to ask her “hey when I kissed you were you comfy w it? you know I wouldn’t wanna make you feel uncomfortable” but I feel like it’s too late for that. But straight up asking if she liked it or not seems weird/needy to me. How should I have this conversation with her? I’m really not sure how to word it. We might be having a phone call tonight so that’s when it would take place.",29Jul2020,1
1133,"My dad passed away 7 months ago, his birthday was this month.
I asked my friend if we could hang out and she mentioned she was with her boyfriend, I told her it was my dads birthday and it’s a traumatic day for me, and told her that I really needed her there for me.
She said “(my name) I’m with (her boyfriends name) and he doesn’t want anyone coming over because of corona and I’ve tested negative and you haven’t even been tested”
I pleaded with her for a bit mentioning that I’m going through a lot and my aunt had died a week prior,
She stopped replying to my messages, I called her after 20 minutes of being ignored, she cut the call and tested “I’m playing music in the car”
Then went on a tirade saying things like 
“It’s just one day, what’s the big deal?! It’s not even my place, I can’t just invite you over I don’t live here” 
I asked if she could come over to mine, then she said she was just gonna sleep when they got home FROM A FRIENDS PLACE, also it was like 5pm so I know they weren’t gonna sleep.
She always calls me her best friend, I always drop anything and everything when she’s upset and needs someone there, I’m always there for her.
This obviously upset me, three days later she sent me this meme saying something about best friends,
I’m starting to really dislike her because this isn’t the first occurrence, she can’t take criticism and always insults people when they express that she’s hurt them,
When I say she’s hurt my feelings she always says something like “grow up, idk if you’re like this because of your age” (I’m one year younger than her and we’re legitimately ADULTS.
I just want to send her a message to end this friendship, I don’t have the emotional strength to deal with her emotional immaturity.",29Jul2020,1
1134,"Aight so I (F18) am in a bit of a dilemma. 

I’ve always wanted to get my own video game system. My mother was very against video games when I was younger and it’s something I’ve always wanted to have. I’ve been saving for a while, but as I near college, I’m reaching a point where I’m not sure what to do.

On one hand, I want a Nintendo switch a ton. I have for a while now. I’ve been looking at different options and different prices, refurbished and new, discounts on games and switches alike. I was planning to do it as a graduation present type thing to myself (had a lot of trouble mentally I’m high school due to past trauma and graduated and managed to get into a good college, so kind-of was a reward) but each time I go to purchase one, I pause because I’m worried that I’m spending money on something that isn’t necessary and that that money could be very useful to me in college.

The other hand is, I’m supporting myself through college. I’m not getting any support from parents, but am getting a bit from grandparents, and am not sure if buying myself a switch (with money I’ve earned from working) is completely irresponsible or not. Especially since I’ll be inside a lot, I think it could be really great to have.

But I don’t know. I know that I need to watch my spending, and I’ve set out budgets and all sorts of things to monitor that. It’s something that I can easily afford right now, but I’m worried that it’s a stupid idea even though it’s something I’ve wanted for a long long time.

Idk. What do others think?",29Jul2020,1
1135,"please help  
So to give context on my mom, she is a crazy person. From what I've seen personally and heard from my dad:

She goes through my dads pocket's when he leaves for work and used to steal his change he'd been saving.  
She went through my dad's trash and I saw her going through my own trash at one point.  
**She can talk to herself for 3 to 4 hours.** The only people in my house are my dad and I and neither of us even reply or say anything. She just keeps talking for 2 hours, really loudly. Yelling about people calling people *'bitches', 'sluts', ""hoes"", ""fat asses""*, she'll use every curse word and slur and she's usually talking about women she knows and she likes to fat shame even though she isn't thin at all. she's been doing this since I was like 7.   
She is racist towards everyone who isn't her race. and she cares so much about my race. (don't want to say it's not really important)  
She calls her race the best race and has talked about how she's going to take me to her country someday. 

She's attacked my dad on multiple occasions, I once saw her hit my dad on the head with something. And that was when I was 10. My dad also briefly mentioned a time when I was a baby when she scratched my dad until he bled.   
I've gotten into several arguments over the past like 5 years because she doesn't let things go. She always needs to point out something wrong I'm doing.   
When I was younger up until like age 12 when I started failing due to just her. She had this expectation I get all A's. And that a smart phone was for smart people who got all A's. And even in *progress reports*, if I had a C then she'd get mad.   
She neglected me for most of my childhood, and my dad was the one taking me to school events. She'd barely show up and when I was at home would always be in her room watching her shows.

One story she randomly talks about, one she seems *proud of*, is a story about how a kid was messing with her chair so she stabbed him with a jumbo pencil. And she's talked about this story a lot.   
She hasn't had a job since January 2020. And when me or my dad ask her about it she says ""don't worry about it""  


As for my dad he isn't perfect especially when I was younger. Like he'd yell at me over stuff that didn't matter. But he's been apologetic, and he does do better. Plus he was in the military so he usually didn't have time for me but he always tried to take me to school events, but I've always been alone with my mom.  


It's hard not to blame my mom for the way I am now (social anxiety, depression, etc). Since she always sheltered me and I was always afraid of having friends over because of her.   


Quarantine has been rough on me, considering I've spent about 4-5 months at home with her, and she doesn't have a job so she's here *everyday.* We've gotten into the most rough arguments and fights ever. She's been ""trying to change"" by trying to take me to go eat, and eating with me when I eat dinner. But we usually don't even say anything to each other. *Does that make me a bad person if I just don't like her after everything I've seen and heard about her? Does it make me a bad person if I just want to cut connection with her after I'm out of highschool? And am I a bad person if I'm uncomfortable around my own mother?*  


Like I've tried to be nice to her but even as I""m writing this she's yelling about something to herself. My dad thanked me for being nice but the past 4 days have been tough. Driving me almost insane. I even had a dream where I was trying to sleep but she was doing the same yelling as usual. This quarantine has taken a toll on me more mentally, and I'd probably be okay if my mom wasn't in the picture. She'll yell in the afternoon and she doesn't go to sleep until **1am to 4am**. And with school starting back, (half at home.) If she's going to be doing this, I don't think I can take it anymore. It was easy to put up with in the past because she'd be working, or I'd be in school but I just can't anymore. I've been in and out of nearly letting my depression take over.  


And for anyone saying I should get out of this house. Where would I go? I'm not a social person and the friends I do have stay indoors as much as I do. Plus I wouldn't get far without being hit with several questions and calls from my parents.

1136,"Hi! 
I'm am employee at a hospital (1-2x a week) and also work 4 days in an outpatient office both treating patients. It has now become mandatory for part time staff to treat COVID positive patients at my hospital job and my other job has threatened to not let me work If I see COVID patients, since I see medically fragile children there.  Given thorough analysis and knowing I won't get pandemic pay, lose my hours and patients at my other job (which doesn't have COVID patients), will be exposed and also live with an immuno compromised over 60 parent - I think it is best to resign. 

I have only worked 10 months and love my coworkers and boss and it's my first real job. But feel placed in a corner at this point. Any advice? Thanks 😌

TLDR: Two jobs making me pick to stick to one, one does not have any benefits and is 100% treating COVID patients. It is my first job and I have to resign from one as the other job will not accept COVID exposure employees.",29Jul2020,1
1137,"I know feeling this way is wrong. We're really good friends, and I do love her romantically, but she's not into guys so nothing can happen between us. I'm not sure if bringing it up with her is the right move since the only thing she can do on her end is to not flirt around me which sounds unreasonable.

Any advice is appreciated.",29Jul2020,1
