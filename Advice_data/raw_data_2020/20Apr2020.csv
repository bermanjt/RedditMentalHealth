0,"I was walking my dog and there were 2 small kids probably around 8-12 years old sitting in the grass hitting a dog (smacking,punching, scratching, kicking but they missed when they tried to kick it) the dog was pretty big about medium size pitbull mix maybe (the size of my dog, a Norwegian Elkhound).

At this point my dog went crazy barking and lunging for the kids so I had to walk away with my dog before he got out of his collar.

Now I know where these kids live. Should I approach their parent and tell them? I don’t know the parent nor do I know they will react. 

Need some advice on if I should:

A) approach the parents and tell them what I saw.
B) wait till I see it again and then confront the parents.
C) forget about it

There was an animation where a guy dies and wakes up to an entity explaining that he (the entity) and you are part of a race of beings akin to gods and to mature and become an adult you have to live all the lifes of every human to ever exist.

  


theres more to the animation but thats the gist, i really really really wanna find it but cant seem to find it anywhere or remember the name :/",20Apr2020,1
2,"Both of my parents have this disgusting habit. They talk with their mouth full of food and smack obnoxiously loud. It’s annoys the hell out of me, and it’s so nasty. My moms mouth has been so full to the point, to where food has came out of her mouth before. I wish they just cover their mouth while talking or finish eating. Then they smack so obnoxiously loud. I understand you’re going to smack on some food, but they smack on everything. I’m 19 btw. I hate taking them out to eat because I just always end up disgusted. I’ve never seen anybody eat like this except one of my friends. How should I go about this, I’m tired of dealing with this everyday? They are older and stubborn too so they might just tell me to “stfu” or something",20Apr2020,1
3," 

I was just thinking about my future and my plans to have kids, and being trilingual (kind of) myself, I've always had the thought that I wanted to do OPOL (One parent one language).

But I've been thinking, I could honestly do so much more than two, or even three languages for my child. I mean, here's my thought.

I speak French to the child. My girlfriend / wife speaks German to the child. We speak English with each other. And we live in Russia (just an example). Would they effectively pick up all four languages? If so, how far could you go with this.

More theorizing.

Second child, first child speaks Russian with the baby. I speak French, Wife speaks German. We All speak English with each other. And we move to Italy. Would they pick up five languages?

I am aware that children are not an experiment lol, but I'm genuinely looking for someone who's successfully done something like this, or who knows how it would affect a child's brain. Thanks for taking the time to read!",20Apr2020,1

5,"Long story short, my best friend and I used to talk and hang out almost every day for 3 years. Sadly, I had to move away about 2 years ago. We kept in touch through social media and texting/FaceTiming; we even played some online games together like we used to. We wouldn’t talk as much as we once did, but considering that we lived in different places, it was‘t a big deal. One day she suddenly stopped answering my texts and any other ways I’d try to contact her. This made me feel upset, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and kept trying. Eventually, I figured that she was no longer interested, so I stopped trying. 

After looking back into our relationship, I couldn’t figure out why she would ghost me so suddenly. It felt out of character, before I moved she’d tell me how we’d still stay in touch and how I shouldn’t worry about our friendship. We never argued, got in fights, or hurt each other’s feelings intentionally. And if we did we would apologize and move on. We also tried to be there for each other and helped each other out when we could. I can’t think of any mayor or even minor event that would’ve made her feel upset because of my actions.

After thinking some more and talking about it with friends and my therapist, I think one possibility might’ve been that I was in a bad place due to my anxiety and depression. I might have been holding her back because she knew I was struggling and felt the need to look after me. Maybe tried to get rid of the negativity in her life and that meant cutting me off?

I’d understand if that were the case. It upsets me she didn’t feel comfortable talking about what was bothering her, specially because of how close we were. Of course, that is if this is why she ghosted me. Maybe she just got tired of having a long-distance friendship or even my personality? I wish I knew.

This didn’t help me with my battle with mental illness, it left me confused and deeply hurt. I was advised to just move on with my life and not let it have such a huge impact, but we were so close I just can’t help it. Regardless, I've tried moving on and even forgot about her for a little bit due to school and work. 

Recently though, with the quarantine going on, I've had time to slow down a bit and think, and I realized that I still really miss our friendship. I don't know if I should still try moving on like I am right now, or if it’s worth trying to reach out again. 

Maybe it's just me overthinking it, but I feel like she’s so much happier without me. I’m scared of reaching out and somehow making her annoyed or even mad that I’m trying to reconnect with her. I want to consider her feelings too.

I still have a lot of love for her and wish her nothing but the best. I’m wondering what I should do and what would be best for each other. Am I overthinking things too much? Any advice and input would be highly appreciated. Thank you for reading.",20Apr2020,1

12,"Hey guys, so a bit of background. I have a friend that ive had since I was young (Im 23 now). 

The past year or so hes just been really toxic, he was horrible to my girlfriend that lasted ago year up until maybe a couple of months ago. 

Hes always complaining about how I dont hang out with him and makes me feel bad for it, when really I just dont enjoy his company. 

My problem is that hes part of a closely knit friendship group and after a recent falling out over me not wanting to attend a gathering at his house because I've been obeying social isolation laws, I just want to get rid of the stress he's been causing me. 

What should I do?",20Apr2020,1
13,"Background: My brother (M17) has always been a trouble maker but as he entered his teenage years, he has gotten worse. My dad being an alcoholic and my mom has depression. It gets crazy in the house once in a while. My parents are often fighting but me and my brother are usually not involved in that. Now that we have been in quarantine, it has gotten worse at home. Therapy has been mentioned, but has never been taken seriously. When it was brought up to my brother, he said “f*ck off, you need one yourself” 

My brother manipulates my parents, especially my mom. She usually believes whatever he says (where he is, who is goes out with, etc). She likes to have trust in her kids, which I completely understand. But that trust should be lost when your child is constantly lying left and right ...
Also, we found a bunch of marijuana things in his room hidden and he manipulated our mom saying that it’s his friends. His friends smoke and many have gotten in trouble with police. He is extremely disrespectful to my parents, but is even worse to me when they are not around. 
He says things to my parents like “You deserve for someone to spit in your face”, “I promise you, one day you will never see me again”. He takes the car when he doesn’t even have his license. I don’t remember the last time I actually heard him talk normally without him screaming or cursing. He gets mad over everything and anything. He refuses to even say hello/ good morning back in the morning to anyone, and gives a dirty look. He refuses to eat with the family, just because he knows it upsets my parents. Instead, he comes to eat 30 minutes later... the list goes on and on. 

Today, I was trying to make myself some food and so was he. I placed my pot down, and he didn’t like where I put it although it was not in his way at all. He took the pot and set it on the other side of the kitchen and said “I am here. You funny if you think you’re gonna be here too. Get the f*ck out of my way” I proceed with saying “but I’m not in your way. You have more than enough room” and put my pot back to where it was. He got back and pushed me against the cabinet. My mom was there and all she said was “hey hey hey that’s enough. Too much!” And he replied “she deserves for me to spit in her disgusting f**cking face”. I lost my appetite completely and locked myself in my room. My mom ended up telling him that he made me cry and got more joy out of it and replied “I don’t give a f**k, she deserves more than that. No one gonna be in my f*cking way. Stupid b*tch”. 

I just can’t stand it. My parents don’t discipline him. I know it may be harder now that he is older but it’s actually terrible here. I am afraid that he will end up on a bad path, if he didn’t already. He fights, lies, emotionally abuses everyone, threatens his friends with burning their houses down or hurting them (I overhear his convos from my room), and now he is starting to try to physically hurt his family members (me). 

What do I do in this case? Besides try my best to move out.",20Apr2020,1
14,"I started a job on Thursday and I ABSOLUTELY hate it, it’s customer service on the e-commerce side of an agriculture store, basically it’s taking a whole bunch of phone calls on how long it will take for people to get the fire arm they ordered on this website. I’ve worked a lot of call center jobs before and it’s something I’m extremely good at and I don’t mind the job duties but this entire place seems extremely unorganized and unprofessional towards their customers. They had an average of 70 calls in queue with a 3.5 hour wait on the line all day and only 3 people working the phones and even then only one person actually actively taking calls at a time while the others just chit chat. I’m the type of person that will feel uncomfortable even along a bathroom or lunch break if I know there’s this much work to be done because that’s how I’ve learned to be from all the call center jobs I’ve had in the past and I know that will stress me out. In addition the building they gave us in is dark inside there are 3 rows of florescent lights and only one is on in that room, I’ve literally walked out with a migraine every single day. 

Another big thing I don’t like is the fact that they don’t seem to be progressive at all, I’m a straight white female and their rules don’t necessarily effect me but this is a corporate building with hundreds of people working there and I have yet to see one person of color and the dress code specifically states that males  must not have their hair past their shoulders. This company also doesn’t ship products to California because they refuse to be subject to Prop 64 (labeling all ingredients on products) which I strongly support consumer rights and the anti gmo movement so it feels like I’m disregarding my morals. 

This job pays $12.00 an hour (our state is 9.25 minimum wage) and the hours are 10-7 Thursday-Monday (so I would work the middle of the day and every weekend) 

Friday I got offered a temporary position that pays $20 per hour and it’s Monday-Thursday 8:30 pm-4:30 am and it’s literally checking temperatures of factory workers while sitting behind a plexiglass shield and when there isn’t anyone clocking in I can sit on my phone, read, or play on my iPad, I’m a digital artist so I know I could use this time to create work for my clients and also finish up some homework. This should be a no brainer to take and I really want to the only problem is there’s no guarantee on how long the job will last, I have an interview with one of the highest employing companies in my area in a few weeks and I have a recommendation that got pushed up from the head of that department so I think it’s likely that I’ll be able to get that position but it’s still a slight gamble that I’m not sure that I should take.",20Apr2020,1

So I am a seasonal worker and thus have to move a lot and got used to the grind, but my employer usually provides housing so this is a new issue for me. For this season I got a pretty good for the summer season, however no housing is provided. My hiring manager gave me a my two coworkers some leads for local housing. One bailed early and got a single apartment leaving me and the other guy, let's call him Tim, to figure somthing out on our own. We both agreed it would be mutually beneficial if we lived together for cost and social reasons.

I should note this is a rural area. I found a ok apartment in a town about 15 minutes away. Very small community, but so close to the larger town that I really feel like it's not an issue. For $800 a month (utilities, internet and tv included) its perfect for two people. 

Tim on the other hand was deadset on an AirBnB in town. $1350 (same deal with utilities and tv), but tiny. The main bedroom has about 4 inches of clearance between the bed and the wall, with not much room at the foot of the bed either. The second ""bedroom"" I'm not sure meets local code for a bedroom. Its obvious that it's a utilities room they stuffed a twin bed in. It has a washer and dryer unit in the bedroom and an external exit. I think it's a terrible deal. I spoke to Tim last week and brought up my concerns about the Airbnb and he agreed that my place was the better option.

Today Tim sent me an email basically saying he was going for the AirBnB. He said that the place 15 minutes away is too far and in too small of a town. He has a car and never specified why he thinks 15 minutes is too far. But, offered me $300 for rent, much less than I'd paying if I got a single. But as I said the AirBnB is a dump.

I get there roughly around 630pm. Her roommate “Ashley” [27F] invited her brother “Jon” [29M]  &amp; his roommate “Daniel” [25M] to eat dinner. Jon &amp; Daniel begin to disperse around 11pm. After food is put up, kitchen/living area has been cleaned, &amp; showers have been taken, Liz &amp; I retreat to her room. 

After about 30 minutes, we hear another voice in the living area with Ashley. It’s obviously friendly and Liz seemed to know who he was. Liz falls asleep shortly and I stay up to play 2K. I started to hear “No” &amp; “Stop” over and over. It didn’t sound like sexual banter, it was very much fearful. I kept my gun in the nightstand on the side of the bed that has been deemed to be my side. I took it out and investigated. Ashley’s door was closed and the lights were off. It sounded like a struggle, so I went inside and turned on the lights to see some guy I didn’t know wrestling with Liz’s roommate. I told him to go. Ashley’s pants were off and I didn’t know how far he had gotten but he ran out in a hurry. Liz woke up &amp; Ashley just hugged and cried on me. Liz and Ashley talked alone for a couple of hours. I waited until Liz got back to go to sleep. 

Come to find out, it was Daniel’s brother. This guy has been nothing but a friend to Liz and Ashley, so to hear that this man thought this was cool was crazy. Liz told me that he didn’t get too far but Ashley was traumatized nonetheless. Ashley doesn’t want to tell the police, her brother Jon, or Daniel.

For a month now I would say but probably way longer there’s a Chevy SUV and a old Nissan car meeting up on state line road. To put it as easy as possible here’s how it goes.

Every day at 11am and 7pm on the dot, there’s a Chevy SUV that comes from Crete Illinois and turns down state line road which I live on and turns around to go back down the road it comes and meets up with this old Nissan waiting on the side of the road. A couple of times the SUV would turn in the driveway of a persons house and wait. Once when the Nissan car arrives, the SUV turns around and heads back the way she came. Makes no sense what’s so ever. From what I know and seen. It’s a older black female with braided hair with always a person on the passenger side. The Nissan car is unknown. I’ve tried getting a license plate but her car is a complete wreck

License plate is rusted, turning signal in the back is cracked with red tape, passenger side doors are completely dented, and I believe one headlight doesn’t work. 

At the end of the day at 7 they meet up. Same schedule and rotation. Drive down state line, Turn around, stop in the middle of the street, beep at each other and go back the way they came. My mother made a point that there’s no reason to meet up here cause they are both going the same direction, and probably going to the same place. 

Once I knew this was going on I thought they were doing a drug meet up but every day twice a day doesn’t make sense. Also my car in the middle of the night was broken into. I don’t know if that ties up with anything. I’ve tried multiple times to get the license plate of the SUV but it seems like she knows where I’m at and knowing what I’m doing.

I do have more feminine habits (shaving, jewelry) but I like more masculine interests (working out, grilling, hands-on work, more masculine clothing). Since I'm in a religious family, I'm not sure how to go about these interests or know if what I'm feeling is normal. I hate dresses, shirts, heels, makeup, and hair clips/ties. I'm into suits, dress shoes, and short hair. If I am trans and I am male, then I feel that I would be more on the feminine side of a man, but I'm bothered by that.

34,"Long story short! Back during my kindergarten/early elementary school years, my mother used to bring be to a psychologist because I had a few problems and I wasn't like the other kids. My mother asked if I was autistic, but the psychologist said no.

Tonight, I found some old papers from the psychologist to my mother, and there was one saying ""Behavioral peculiar child (can be very verbally abusive if upset)"".

Honestly, there has been zero progress on that. I would describe myself as pretty chill, calm, and helpful, but I still have irrational spikes of anger sometimes.

41,"I made $14 hourly, and was paid bi-weekly, but the unemployment I've been receiving is better pay now. Weekly. I haven't found another job yet, but I'll be moving and renting a house with our friends in 4 months, 45 minutes away. 

I was let go over a phonecall, and I had been out sick.  I brought a doctor's note, but returned to sign an acknowledgement sheet, only to see the company let the entire warehouse go.
My job consisted of orders that popped up, of any size.

My manager has called (5) times today, after leaving one message and sending a text..



 I worked in a rental lighting company, so that could mean testing a headset to several HUGE followspots, which take half an hour each, at least. It is especially busy in the summer, peak season, and tapers off at the beginning of the year. 
I worked there for one month shy of 2 years before I was let go. 

My supervisor would likely be returning and I hated working with him, because he easily switched moods and called out the morning of, a lot.
He is an overly-political person who never asks my point of view. My first summer, he left me (only a few months into my training) to run our entire department, so that he could go to a week-long music festival in another state. It's his yearly thing. 

Head manager hardly shows up during the week unless we have a meeting. He doesn't communicate well to the rest of the team about changes.

I was the ONLY female in the warehouse so there was a lot of heavy lifting, my former dealer tried to hit on me, and I feel like I was looked down upon with everything I did. Like it wasn't enough.

I'm indifferent to this, but nearly every person there (including my manager) smokes weed. I do too for my pain and anxiety, so please don't say anything rude. 

I'd be getting paid less if I went back there, but I'm sick of being in the house every day. 

My husband thinks that I should continue to take the extra money from my unemployment and put it towards us paying off all our debt. With these checks, we would be debt-free (minus our car) in 2 months. I hate not having a job, like I'm sure many others do right now. But I'd rather collect this unemployment for as long as I'm able until a new position pops up up near where we are moving (closer to my husband's work.)

44,"My father died very unexpectedly. He died of a Heart attack. I was, of course, devastated that day, and that feeling stuck with me for a few days, but after 3 days i told myself to get a hold of myself and continue preparing for my university entrance exam, and i just got better since then. I have been occupied enough with it to stop thinking of what happened for a short period of time, I started seeing my friends again and i behaved more or less like nothing happened, and after 2 weeks i felt completely normal again. Around that time i started feeling grateful about the moments we spent together instead of being sad or feeling empty when thinking about him.
Mind you, I had an amazing and a close relationship with my father and I really loved him. 
I feel like i reacted this way because i didn't want it to affect my life in any way, and i also felt like i had to be strong because of my mother, who took this way worse than me. But, at the same time, i am wondering if I'm being disrespectful towards him, that i practically haven't mourned him?

i’m not a cringey person, but the way i act makes me seem that way. especially when i’m happy and make ironically cringe jokes i can be super weird but when someone else does the same thing i lowkey cringe hahaha

i think a lot of it has to do with not really caring enough to make an image for myself, but i feel like people get the wrong idea of me. for example i post a lot of stuff about what’s on my mind and stupid questions cause i think they’re funny but i feel like it comes off as a dumb white girl kinda way

when someone gets to know me, especially when i’m serious, im cool &amp; collected and i have common sense but i just let myself go in front of other people and on my social media’s :/ maybe it’s just a teenager thing and that’s why no one likes me right now. hopefully in the future someone will appreciate my weirdness hahaha 

i’ve also never had a boyfriend so it makes me think that my personality just isn’t likable for other people. like i’m too much of a kid. even though i’m truly not when it comes to any one on one conversation. i think it’s because of how i look, i’m short, don’t show off my body, and i’m skinny and i have braces. i think people are more attracted to women and not girls  

btw it’s not me pretending to be stupid, more like ironic and goofy and overall just not trying enough like those girls that work really hard to be aesthetic and rarely post on their social media so they’re more mysterious idk. 

i also don’t type/text like any of the cool people i know. i use stupid bitmojis and don’t bother fixing typos 

THE MAIN reason why this bothers me is because i can never seem to attract people that are like me, since i don’t act like my inner self. i act not very well put together in a way and basically just not like how the people i want to attract act.(if that makes sense lol) i’m just too lazy to try too hard",20Apr2020,1

50,"This may sound ridiculous as it is such a minor problem but it is starting to really annoy me and I could use some advice.

When I was younger I always had a very wild imagination, often good but it also caused me many nightmares and created an even incredibly stupid fear for werewolves (that’s a long story).

That was a long time ago as I am now 21 and the nightmares I used to have seemed to be a thing of the past. I would maybe have a nightmare once a month and it would suck, but it wasn’t the end of the world.

However, for the last month or so, I seem to be having nightmares almost every night. They can range from me kicking and killing my pets (which is a heartbreaking one) to having my boyfriend cheat on me, or something straight out of a horror movie. 
While not all of these are necessarily “scary” they wake me up with a beating heart and sometimes tear me up.

After a nightmare I stay awake for 1 or sometimes 2 hours, to process the dream and find some rest.

None of my nightmares are actual fears of mine as (to take the examples above) I would never hurt an animal, let alone my pets, and I have the most loyal boyfriend.

I don’t know where they are coming from and I want to keep them away but I have no clue on how to actually do that.
Any advice?

Tl;dr: for the last month I’ve been having regular nightmares that keep me up for hours and don’t seem to have a specific source of fear. How do I deal with them?",20Apr2020,1
51,"My boyfriend and I have been together six months. The other day we were looking for an email in his inbox together. As he was scrolling through, I noticed what looked like an automated profile from
the dating app Hinge (where we met) saying a girl had “liked” his profile.

I had always thought he seemed very trustworthy, so I figured I must have somehow seen an old email. I didn’t even think much of it, but, just in case - I said “hey babe, you don’t still have your Hinge profile active, do you?” (we agreed in our first few weeks of dating that we would be monogamous and would get off dating apps.)

He gave me a funny look at first, and I said “when uou were scrolling through your inbox, I thought I saw a Hinge email.” He was quiet for a minute and said he realized earlier when he got that email that he had deleted the app from his phone, but not the site
itself (which you have to do in order to delete the profile).

Ok, now I was starting to get suspicious bc - if that were the case, why didn’t he delete the prof when he got that email? He told me he hadn’t had a chance that day. I started to get really uncomfortable and left the house to clear my head. When I came back, I asked how it was possible he was still showing up in the Hinge search tool after five months of not using it. He then said “well, when we had our first argument, I thought you were breaking up with me, so I reinstalled the app.” Even still, that would have been four months ago. I told him this didn’t add up, that I was losing trust in him and asked him to show me his phone. The email from Hinge I had seen earlier had been deleted (he deleted it and also deleted it from his trash). I then searched “Hinge” in his inbox, and several other emails from Hinge came up. They had all been read.

I told him this, and he said he must have accidentally clicked on them, but that he never read them and had not logged into the app. 

At this point I started to freak out. I start asking more questions. He says “look, I had the app tucked away in a separate folder and it was out of sight, out of mind. I just forgot.” And I said “you told me earlier you had deleted the app from your phone.” And he swears now that he meant he deleted the app from his phone the first time around, but not the second time, when he reinstalled during our first argument, at which point he thought I was ending the relationship. I am not sure I believe this. I am also not sure how it could be “out of sight, out of mind” when he was getting other emails from Hinge this whole time, at least a couple a month.

I feel pretty strongly that something here is shady. I have always trusted him, but now I don’t know what to
think and feel he is not someone I can trust at all, anymore, bc I really feel like this is some gaslighting type manipulation. 

From an outsider’s perspective - what do you think? Do you think he is hiding something?",20Apr2020,1

while my gf and i were on a break a few weekends ago (after fighting about distance etc), my best friend and i both planned to go over his crush’s house to hang out since the three of us live very close to one another. 

he couldn’t go over right away but his crush encouraged me to just walk over earlier, saying that she wanted to show me the room renovations she was doing or something. i knew straight off the bat this wasn’t the best idea. she is a very flirty person in general and although she has told me that she has feelings for my best friend, she has definitely hit on me and vice versa. 
when i got there she told me her mom was her mom’s boyfriend’s house so we ‘had the whole house to ourselves’, which was another sign. long story short, we had sex and i instantly regretted it. i told her i was sorry and she understood but told me she wanted it to happen for awhile. i left her house before my friend could get there and i texted him and told him that i forgot i had homework to do so i couldn’t make it. 
that happened a few weeks ago and i haven’t told my girlfriend (who i got back together with very shortly after) or my best friend. i don’t know if it’s really considered cheating since my gf and i were on a break, but ultimately i know it was unfair for my friend. especially since i don’t have any romantic feelings for this girl (his crush).  i asked her not to tell anyone but i don’t have total faith in her, she tends to be the gossip of the friend group (?) and i already am clowned for my sexual endeavors so this will really dig my hole if the rest of the group finds out. also, my gf will hate me. so
sorry for such a long post but i just don’t know what to do. should i not tell my gf? or my friend? i don’t know if it’d do any good to tell them anyways seeing as it technically hasn’t hurt them, you know?

72,"Hi all!

Background:
My sister is currently staying with me, she is 8 years older than me (shes 38 and I'll be 30 this year).

I have 3 kids (elementary aged) and she has 2 (middle school aged)

I have become the head parent of the house, assigning chores and helping with school work etc while my sister spends most of the time in her room (shes disabled and that's why she lives with me). I want to clarify I have NO ISSUE with this as I love my niece and nephew. 

I grew up pretty much knowing from a young age that I was bisexual. I was open about it throughout my childhood from about 7th grade until currently. I have openly dated and both men and women, was married to a man. Therefore my niece knows that I am bisexual. 

My sister has always told me I ""need to pick!"" And that I cant like both genders. I have just opted to ignore her and we agreed to not discuss it at all. 

CURENT SITUATION:
My niece has also came out as bisexual recently (maybe pan? Shes still deciding) and I obviously support her completely. She has ""dated"" both girls and boys (held hands, cheek kisses). The boys shes been interested are usually shorter than her and slim, (she describes them as femme bois) and my sister has told her she needs to start dating ""real men."" I often jump to defend her and my sister says ""just because you refuse to date like a normal person doesnt mean you can let her do it too!"" I've just dropped it as it often turns into a screaming match. 

NOW: 
My neice likes to experiment with her gender identity though her clothing,. Today she put on traditionally masculine clothing and asked me if I would consider calling her Sam instead of her name (Samantha). I said absolutely and held to it all day. I've helped her pick out a masculine outfit and slicked back her hair when she asked. My sister is now accusing me of ""forcing"" her to my ""weird ways"". 

My question: Do I keep going out of my way to help her even though it is causing such a rift between her and her mother? Should I back off and let her mother decide what to do with her daughter? I'm torn, please help!",20Apr2020,1
73,"I’m a 19f who had to move home due to the closure of my college. I’m a first year college student finishing my second semester. I’m living with my parents and younger sister, and I’m not doing too well.

There’s a lot that I won’t get into, but I’ll talk about the thing that’s been bothering me for a little while now, basically since I moved home.

My mom has a bad habit of talking over everything. She always needs to put her two cents in for something. A couple examples that have happened:
-Dad sometimes plays a Metallica concert video (the one in the Roman coliseum, “Francais Por Une Nuit” ) and listens to it, and she’ll try to have a conversation with Dad or me. I try not to keep in conversation by responding to her and then turning to the TV, but it doesn’t work. Then when I have Dad play some of the new Five Finger Death Punch music that he didn’t know had come out yet, Mom started a conversation with my sister with her yelling in my ear on the couch rather than get up and walk to a quiet area.
-They were watching some videos they discovered on YouTube that had an announcer who normally comentated sports had taken videos and TikToks off the internet and commnetated over those. Dad showed me and my sister one of the funnier one, and she had to narrate everything that her favorite video was doing, even though we could see it.
-Today at dinner, an animation YouTuber (Odd1sOut) uploaded a video today. None of us had seen it, and everyone likes watching them. One of the things he stated sparked a story in my mom, who tried to yell over the video her own story. I eventually just said calmly “I’m trying to watch this-“ Thankfully Dad interrupted me saying he agreed with me and rewinded the video.
-It’s not a big deal, but I’m rarely allowed to join a conversation with my Mom at the lunch/dinner table. She’ll have a conversation with my sister, and she can hear I’m starting a sentence, but she’ll talk over me until she has run out of attention for the conversation. Then it’s just whatever I wanted to say to participate in the conversation, but only my younger sister hears or pays attention. But that happens all the time and I’m used to it.

I know I need to have a sit down conversation with her, and I know how to be respectful, not accusatory. (I would say something along the line of “Hey, I’m glad you like the video, and I would love to hear your stories, but I would appreciate it if we watched any video through the whole way and then I can hear your story.” or something along those lines) The biggest problem is that she still thinks of me as a little kid and that she’s right. So if I try to say absolutely anything, it’ll be “sorry, but don’t do it that much” or “You are very accusatory” or “You can always go back to watching the video on your own.” 
She still thinks of me as her child, even though I’ve been gone for months without contact except for mayyybe an occasional post on my Instagram account that she knows of. For example, I have to go to my bedroom before she does, I can’t hang out with Dad on the couch watching the aforementioned Youtube commentator or anything. Then she still always tries to censor things that have cuss words or adult themes, and no matter how many times I tell her that my classmates talk about so much worse out in the open, it’s still inappropriate for me. (So I’m frequently watching kittens with her). 

How do I approach her as an adult and talk to my mom about talking over any and everything?",20Apr2020,1
74,"Hi, I recently transferred serving jobs to an up scale restaurant. COVID 19 shut down all restaurants in my state before I was even at my 2 week mark. Unemployment and the company has helped take care of my family. Here is the problem: I live in GA, our governor is eager to reopen everything and my boss told me today that their hopes are to re-open on May 1st. I have a 7 month old daughter who I would never forgive myself if I got her sick. I originally wanted to go  back to school during the summer and finish up my certification for electrical work. That went down after the virus. I only have two options: Stick with the restaurant, possibly get my daughter sick, and ride out business being slow.

76,"Classic 1am existential crisis. I've been having this sadness of losing the people close to me in my life, not family, I know they'll always be there, but my friends and coworkers, I work at a golf club in the Caddies, and I get on really well with one of the Caddies; it's weird that I do because of our age difference (he's like 13 and I've just turned 18.) usually i find people around his age annoying but he just isn't, he makes work enjoyable and when I work with him I look forward to working on the weekend, it's genuinly the highlight of my week. I'm afraid of losing this 'bond' or whatever, as I go to university in 9 months, I'm moving away, and il only go back to work in the Caddies on holidays when I return, and I'm afraid he'd move it another job in that time and I'd never see him again, and I'd lose a bond with someone. It makes it even harder that, due to the age difference, it would be weird to message him over Instagram or anything, just to talk to him and stuff. The same with my friends, i'm afraid that when we all move off to Uni we'll lose our connection, we'll all move to different parts of the country and we wouldn't see eachother much/ ever again . I love all these people to death and I'd hate to see them drift away and to lose all the connections I've strengthened throughout the past few years.

77,"Warning: wall of text incoming, tl:dr at the bottom.

Quarantine has really forced me to reflect a lot on myself. These thoughts have been circling my head for the past weeks, and I can’t seem to reach any conclusion. I just end up overthinking things and working myself into this state where I’m crying those angry tears that make you mad at yourself and everyone and everything around you. Somehow, I came to the conclusion I need to share these thoughts with someone, and while a therapist would probably be ideal, that probably won’t happen anytime soon.

I’m a sophomore chemical engineering student, and I think I want to switch majors, and maybe universities. It’s such a big decision to make, and I feel like I’m in way too deep in terms of time and money. I can’t really tell whether it’s my major or the whole online school, but I am struggling hard. The only thing I know for certain is that I hate my current situation.

Throughout high school I was really good at all the subjects, but I was really good at math, science, and history because at least in high school there was only one correct way to solve those problems or “regurgitate” the answer the teacher wanted. I did pretty well in most of my English classes, consistently getting A- ‘s to the A’s in other subjects, and I think a huge part is because the grading is subjective. Anyway, my parents, teachers, and even I told myself I was really good at math and science and I shouldn’t try to do anything with English. It doesn’t help that my dad is a mechanical engineer and he pokes fun at any of the liberal arts major, calling them fake majors and so on. When my high school AP chemistry really “clicked” with me, I decided at the end of the school year I wanted to be a chemical engineer.

Fast forward to my senior year and I received no help from my parents on deciding on a major or school. I guess they thought “I guess he knows what he wants to do so we’re not going to bug him”. I only applied to three schools, one being my dad’s alma mater, and got accepted into two and waitlisted and later declined from the last. My dad was ecstatic I got accepted into his alma mater and I’m pretty sure we toured the campus later that month. Because the other school I was accepted to cost more, had a smaller engineering program, and honestly it was a safety net, I never toured that campus and obviously didn’t go there.  

Freshman year was like a repeat of high school for me. I knew how to solve basic derivatives and integrals, write analytical English papers, solve simple momentum balances, and balance chemical reactions. I finished that year with a 3.89/4.00. I’m not telling you this to brag, but to contrast with what I’m about to tell you.

Last fall, I started taking chemical engineering classes, and they completely kicked my ass. I got my first B in linear algebra, scraped by intro thermodynamics with a C, and completely failed chemical engineering statistics (I got a 37/250 on my final project (yikes)). I managed to get an A- in organic chemistry 1, which is honestly probably the reason I’m still even in my major. I had 2.65 for that semester, dropping my cumulative GPA to a 3.35. My parents and I both blamed my fraternity, and truthfully, I was spending time with brothers getting drunk instead of doing work. This semester, I’ve stopped partying with them nearly as much (maybe twice a month) and been focusing on school, but the truth is that the classes have only gotten harder and I’m still struggling. 

I’m angry, sad, and confused all at once. I really feel like I’m in the wrong major and probably the wrong university. I really enjoy learning, but I don’t think my brain is wired correctly to be an engineer. I never skip class, and I put in the same if not more effort than my peers. However, I don’t *get* the material. I solve my homework problems by looking at them for hours, determining they’re too different from the example problems, then consulting Chegg for an answer, trying to learn the material by studying the solution. More importantly than the fact I suck at chemical engineering, I’m not passionate about it anymore either. 

In picking a new career, I realize I/it has to do three things. I want it to be something I actually care about. I want to be good at what I do so I can take pride in my work. And lastly, and I really wish it didn’t have to be this way, it needs to pay well enough that my ~~parents~~ dad won’t look down on me for my entire life. I also feel like I can’t have the third point without the first two, and I can’t have the second without the first. I don’t enjoy chemical engineering anymore, I’m not good at it, and I doubt I’ll be able to find a job if I graduate with a poor GPA. 

This might sound crazy, but I think I’d really like to be a lawyer. I want to work with and help people. I still have this dream that maybe I could make an impact. I wouldn’t want to be a corporate lawyer; I’d want to represent *people*. I feel like I’m good at analyzing situations and people’s intents. Also, I think I’m *good* at talking to people. I really enjoyed my AP government class in high school and still have my stack of index cards analyzing famous court cases. It might sound dumb, but I really liked cases set precedents and new laws would build on existing ones and how laws could be reinterpreted over time. I know I’m only scratching the surface, but I think that kind of stuff is really interesting.  It was because of my AP government class that I wanted to go into patent law after my undergrad. My parents are aware of this and they honestly weren’t fans. They both believe in the stereotype that *all* lawyers are weasels and want to milk you for every dime you have whether they deliver meaningful services or not. And no, I don’t want to be a lawyer to change their minds or “prove them wrong”. I want to do it because I think I’d enjoy it and hopefully I’d be good at it.

Now for the tricky part. I have a problem, I think I have a solution, but I’m so nervous to do anything. My parents have already shelled out near 100k for the last four semesters, and I’ve taken four semesters of classes that would likely have no relevance in any kind of pre-law/ criminal justice major. I am truly grateful of what my parents have provided me, but I know it won’t look that way if I tell them I want to switch majors and schools. I really don’t want to drain their bank account and postpone my dad’s retirement. My parents are middle class, so I already receive no money from my FAFSA, but I’m pretty confident I still qualify for my state’s scholarship if I went to an in-state school. But then again, I have no idea if any school would even accept me.

I feel trapped. I think if I try to “tough out” chemical engineering another two years, I’ll end up hating it, graduate with a poor GPA, and never find a job. Or, if I find a job, I won’t be passionate about it and I’ll want to leave. I feel like if I leave chemical engineering, there will be no turning back and I will have wasted the last two years of my life and a lot of my parents’ money. Also, there’s no guarantee that I’ll even like criminal justice. I may find that I don’t enjoy it (or I’m terrible at it) and then I’d be completely SOL. I also think if I try to postpone my decision, my GPA will drop farther and I’d have no chance being accepted into a new school. Lastly, there are three weeks left in my spring semester, but don’t worry; I plan to put forth my best effort, but I feel the time to act (if I even should) is soon after that ends.

If you read this far, thank you. I wanted to be thorough and paint as complete a picture as I could. I know I suck at getting to the point. I think I’ve let my parents subconsciously influence my choice of major and it took me writing this to realize it. A lot of tears were shed while writing this, but I feel better now that everything is out in the open.

tl;dr: I suck at and hate my major and don’t want to be a chemical engineer anymore, but I have significant pressure from my parents and myself to not “rock the boat”.",20Apr2020,1

Anyway I’m gonna be graduating but COVID szn has affected the job market pretty bad at where I live. Companies are mostly on hiring freeze, and have rescinded internship offers and job offers, or are just on the fence when it comes to confirming someone after an interview. 

I haven’t really put in much effort to find a job even before covid became severe, went for one second round tech interview but I flunked it because I was caught off guard about the question. I spent one week to practice but just didn’t practice that qn. 

Was also discussing with my friends and they were talking about how hiring freeze may go on 1-2 years... 🤔🤔🤔 i was really worried about getting a job especially because some of my peers put in the extra effort to interview more than me. In the end I just put my mental health first and focus on schoolwork plus health (get adequate sleep daily and ensure I exercise few times a week).

My bf said that I need not worry about job, and I’m welcome to go work with him 😂 I asked my friends about it and they say nooo they wouldn’t work with their bf/gf. But I’ve worked with my bf on school project before and it was fine, nothing personal was taken, and it just boosted the amount of time we spent with each other. Also, I know the boss from doing a project together as well. Well... honestly my skill set would be useful for them. However I must admit bf working there is a main factor why I would want to work there too lol. Otherwise it’s not really a “want” but I’ll still consider...

Other than that I could work for my parents too. 

Or should I try to spend idk how long looking for another job? I do have some alumni networks that offer referrals to some pretty large companies that are apparently still hiring.... tbh that’s kinda my dream first job but I would need to intensely grind interview qns before those too. 

If I factor in job and interview anxiety, and upgraded difficulty of looking for a job (I would suppose with constant demand from people who are graduating, and less supply... more competition right?), then the bf option seems the best. Idk if it’s a suicidal move career wise tho",20Apr2020,1
85,"Hello everyone! 

so here is my deal. I’m currently doing a BA with one year left. I initially intended to go to law school but with my current GPA that is not happening (long story short - forced marriage, me not accepting it and facing abuse at home for it while my parents try to get him over here, not being able to study at home because I’d always get my ass beat and I’d start feeling claustrophobic with my dad near me). But now I dont know where to go. I thought I’d do a public policy program and work for the government but its not certain at all. 

And then my home situation is not good - I want to be able to leave as soon as possible and need to apply to an out-of-province university for that. I thought I’d redo a bachelor degree just to get a better GPA for law school but that means staying home longer and then falling behind in whatever sort of career I can make. 

because finances are also an issue, I thought I would apply to this scholarship to Korea (which I’d likely get) and then study for my masters there. but that would only add a degree to my resume and not more much since I have no idea what I want to do with my life.

93,"So I’m a 16 y/o female, and I’m very intelligent compared to my peers (I.e. gifted, Ap classes, in the ib program etc etc) and I’ve always been mature and collected. However, I am also a cheerleader, and I’m SUPER extroverted. I’m also bipolar! But that’s not an issue, as I have an amazing therapist and wonderful meds. It’s completely managed.

However, last year when I was undiagnosed, I signed up for this sports class and ended up being grouped with the hottest, smartest, most POPULAR guy in the entire school. I have a type, and he fits it to a T. Mans is an upgraded version of my previous crush. Looks wise, they could be siblings. Anyways, for the first semester I never talked to him because we would be in different areas, and I had braces and glasses and my hair was a wreck.

Then second semester came around, and I discovered nic, and lost weight, fixed the hair, contacts, braces off, the whole nine yards, and he finally noticed me. We would banter and flirt and he would like jokingly push me and stuff and we had actual conversations, and it was GREAT! But then this other girl transferred into the class, and she was really hot and had been playing the sport for two years. Guess what happened. 

So he dropped me haha, and then over the summer I realized I really liked the sport, so in July I tried out for the team (didn’t make it, sports at my school are competitive and I was on my first bipolar medicine which turned me into a living zombie that would sleep 15 hours a day. It was bad.) and throughout my ugly drugged state, wonder boy was helping out with tryouts, which was SO EMBARRASSING because I would try to talk to him but I wouldn’t know what to say and I was acting weird cause of the pills and UGH.

So then, in September, I got switched to another medication that made me gain fifty. Pounds. In three. Months. And at the end of the three months, it was homecoming!!!!! Great! So I was wearing a bodycon (it was my first time and I’m not that curvy) and I got my hair and nails done and I was feeling super confident even through the weight gain and I’m at homecoming and it’s my last chance to dance with him before he graduates and he turns to me! And looks me up and down! With a look of disgust! And says “nah, I’m good” and walks away. 

Man...

So now it’s the end of the year, that was my last time talking to him, and I still like him. Idk what in the hell is wrong with my dumbass but I still. Like. Him. Mans body count is like 15 and I still like him. He openly rejected me and I still like him. He left me for other girls and I still like him. WHY. Please tell me how to get over him, I can’t do this anymore he’s going away for college and I still haven’t stopped thinking about him even though we haven’t talked in half a year literally what do I need to do! Is there like witchcraft or something? Do I need to like, idk, eat more avocado? Please give me advice!

101,"Im pretty sure she has reddit so all the names are going to be changed. We’ll call her Alice. Alice has been talking to said piece of shit for over a year now and even in the very beginning there were red flags. They met on some app and within the first 24 hours he asked her to move across country for him. We talked about it, and at the time it seemed like another dodged bullet. 

Fast forward a couple days later she’s still talking to him. Alice tells POS that she’s not comfortable with the speed things are moving in and he completely loses it. He throws a multitude of slurs at her and just throws a gigantic hissy fit over text. He called her fat, he called her a slut and even called her subhuman. He threw a few more creative and more hurtful jabs at her as well but I’m not going to share those here. We talk it over and it seems like things with her and her POS friend are over. 

But ofc not. After a month of not speaking she unblocks and reaches back out to him and they talk again. He once again throws a giant fit just like before but for the sake of time I’m not going to get in to it.

Fast forward to just 2 months ago. They’re talking yet again and this time it seems serious. She tells me she really wants to fly across the country to see him and about a week after that they buy plane tickets.

Alice and I have been best friends for a while now and recently it seems like all she wants to talk about is POS and how inspiring she thinks he is and how she thinks he can really help her. Usually I avoid these conversations but I eventually just give in and let her talk. Then Alice lays this bombshell on me; he, on many occasions, has hired hookers and apparently his use of said hookers is what ended his last relationship. She also tells me that she’s afraid to post a picture of herself that shows too much shoulder on her social media because she’s afraid of him blowing up on her again.  

I’ve tried to talk some sense into her many times but she just repeats the same old “He’s getting better” or  “you don’t know him like I do” and I don’t know what else to do. I don’t want her to throw her life away and go live with that absolute piece of shit (who she has yet to actually meet in person), but I also don’t want to drive a wedge between us by telling her how to live her life.

102,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 4 years now. It’s always been good but quarantine lockdown has been getting the better of us. We’re both the kind of person who is non-confrontational, but once it gets to a breaking point, she’s the kind of person who will finally come out and say something when she’s mad and I’m the kind of person who just bottles it up. 

The last couple weeks she’s been really irritable. 
“Why are you doing (insert any action) THAT way??”
“DON’T talk to me I’m grumpy!”
“I’m really pissed at you for doing (something that’s never bothered her before.”

I figure she just needs space away from me and hasn’t been able to get any since we’re both stuck at home together all day until quarantine is over. 

Thing is though, I’ve been having to tip-toe around her and I’ve been living my life under the assumption she’s constantly on the verge of becoming angry. And I try to be gentle about everything and keep my distance, but it’s still not helping much. It’s now at the point where every time she’s upset, I now get angry at her for it, even though I don’t show it. So now I’m constantly mad at her for being (what admittedly is assumed) constantly pissy. It’s felt like an abusive relationship where she gets upset at me everything, and I have to just sit there and take it. But I feel like I’m about to blow. I’m getting really sick of it and I want to break it all off and never talk to her again. But I know it’s just us needing space from each other and not being able to get it.

i got the results and they said i have an enlarged vein in my brain and that they referred me to a neurologist. something to keep in mind is that i am 19 and my dad has a cavernous angioma (cluster of veins in his brain i’m pretty sure). my doctor said the neurologist would do an mri to rule anything out, but the neurologist called and said we would do a phone appointment in 2 days instead. is that because of the covid-19 situation or is my situation better than they thought?

105,"So we have been locked inside for a month now and the inevitable happened today. We had a big argument over some stupid nonsense that was only symbolic for the tortures of social deprivation.

First off I have to say that i am not the physical kind of person. I have never gotten into fights as an adult nor have I ever had a fight with anyone else than the few „you know“ fights with  my brothers when i was a child.

My girlfriend on the other hand gets very physical when fighting so usually ill be the punching bag and since I am a rather big guy that does not bother me at all. Her mother was pretty physical when she was a child whereas my parents never raised their hands.
Today something happened I would have never thought I was able to do.

She said something really stupid and hurtful and then it just happened. i slapped her... It was a pretty strong slap i guess but i can’t tell really... She was pretty shocked and at first she wouldn’t talk but then suddenly the fight was over. I immediately told her i am so sorry but she didn’t even seem to mind.  

She said shes forgiving me and that it was okay.
But its not ok?! I feel like the dirtiest scumbag asshole in the universe. 

I would haver never thought i was capable of doing this. At this moment i just want to be punished for it. But it seems like its nowhere as big of a deal for her as it is for me. I really hate myself right now and i mean hate. I don’t know what to do with such a feeling. I told her how i feel about it but she said i shouldn’t make a big deal about it.

106,"i’ve been having difficulties with my father; mostly on his actions and how i perceive them. i’m fifteen, if that matters, and i was hoping to get outsider opinions on my dads behavior.

for context, he sexually assaulted me, throws things at me, taunts me, takes my money, also accuses me of trying to kill him, ruin his life, trying to get blackmail on him and threatens to sue me for manipulating him... phew.. 

—

i would lock my door at night for safety, since my room is on a different floor and it’s not safe at night. while sleeping, he would keypick the door, although he was the one who had the idea for me to have a lockable door. i wish that i wouldn’t rather be stuck alone with a stranger/burglar than my dad, but it was impossible to ignore how petrified i was although i knew it was him. when he would pick the lock, i always pretended to be asleep. he never yelled at me about it after, never even brought it up although it happened multiple times. when he would unlock the door, he would only enter and stay at the door frame for some time then leave. i asked him about it, and he pretended not to know what i was talking about.

after a while, i wrapped duct tape on that side of the doorknob, covering the keyhole in the process, hoping he would get the hint. it seems like overkill now, i really should not of done that, but because of past experiences with him i felt uncomfortable. he didn’t yell at me when he found out, which surprised me. he didn’t even attempt to unlock it for a few nights. until he did, of course. late at night, i heard him ripping off some duct tape. i didn’t even pretend to sleep. i just listened, the knob lock clicked, he walked in and turned on the light. 

he told me he was glad for a challenge, but i *should’ve made it harder*. 

he was smiling and i felt ill, i knew him enough to know that he took this as a fun game.

if a parent got upset for their child using their door lock, wouldn’t they yell? change the knob? at least bring it up? that would make more sense.

why was this my father’s reaction?

&amp;#x200B;

he acts like this all the time. i feel like he views this as entertainment, so he continues to do things similar to this. we don’t get along well, he knows that i get uncomfortable when he’s nearby. he does this to get reactions out of me, he called himself brilliant for waiting those few days when i first put the tape on the doorknob; giving me a false sense of security. then, he ripped the tape off and unlocked the door to ruin it for me, liking the face i wore. why was he getting enjoyment out of this and views it as a 'challenge'?",20Apr2020,1

108,"My boyfriend and I have been together six months. The other day we were looking for an email in his inbox together. As he was scrolling through, I noticed what looked like an automated profile from
the dating app where we met saying a girl had “liked” his profile.

I had always thought he seemed very trustworthy, so I figured I must have somehow seen an old email. I didn’t even think much of it, but, just in case - I said “hey babe, you don’t still have your Hinge profile active, do you?” (we agreed in our first few weeks of dating that we would be monogamous and would get off dating apps.)

He gave me a funny look at first, and I said “when uou were scrolling through your inbox, I thought I saw a dating app email.” He was quiet for a minute and said he realized earlier when he got that email that he had deleted the app from his phone, but not the site
itself (which you have to do in order to delete the profile).

Ok, now I was starting to get suspicious bc - if that were the case, why didn’t he delete the prof when he got that email that day? He told me he hadn’t had a chance yer. I started to get really uncomfortable and left the house to clear my head. When I came back, I asked how it was possible he was still showing up in the Hinge search tool after five months of not using it. He then said “well, when we had our first argument, I thought you were breaking up with me, so I reinstalled the app.” Even still, that would have been four months ago, and it seemed odd for his profile to still be visible (we live in Chicago where there are tons of people on these apps, so my understanding is the inactive profiles get weeded out pretty fast). 

I told him this didn’t add up, that I was losing trust in him and asked him to show me his phone. The email from the dating app I had seen earlier had been deleted (he deleted it and also deleted it from his trash). I then searched the name of the dating app in his inbox, and several other emails from the app came up. They had all been read. In other words, it is not possible that for all these months he had been unaware his profile was up.

I told him this, and he said he must have accidentally clicked on the emails without reading them (ok, but every single one, really? An accident?), but that he never read them and had not logged into the app. 

At this point I started to freak out and started asking more questions. He says “look, I had the app tucked away in a separate folder and it was out of sight, out of mind. I just forgot.” And I said “you told me earlier you had deleted the app from your phone, so how is this possible?” And then he swears now that he meant he deleted the app from his phone the FIRST time around, but not the second time, when he reinstalled during our first argument, at which point he thought I was ending the relationship. So actually, now the story is that he had the profile up AND did not have the app deleted off the phone. Simply that, even in spite of the automated emails from the app, all of which are marked as read, he was oblivious to the app’s active status due to lapse in memory and “accidental”
clicking on these emails.

I do not believe this story, it simply defies logic for me.
I feel pretty strongly that something here is shady. I have always trusted him, but now I don’t know what to
think and feel he is not someone I can trust at all, anymore, and to make things worse, I really feel like this is some gaslighting type manipulation.

111,"I have 3 kids (12, 5, and 2) that live in MI. I'm in WI. I don't have custody of them (mutual decision during divorce, since they live so far away.) Under normal circumstances, I would visit every few weeks. It's now been nearly 2 months, and we're all getting antsy and missing each other immensely.


I had plans to drive out to visit them this coming weekend, but am getting nervous about that decision. None of us have had any symptoms, nor have the people around us (that we are aware of), but my current girlfriend that lives with me is possibly immuno-compromised (inconclusive, but would rather be safe than sorry.)


I do video chat with the kids a few times a week, but recently my 5 year old has been showing more signs of emotional ""need"" during those calls (crying when she doesn't get control of the video to see me, lots of affection shown during the call - much more than previously shown, etc.) and I'm concerned that pushing off a visit much longer could be detrimental to her emotional state.

113,"For backstory, I'm an only child, so when I married my husband, I was excited to gain a SIL.

She wasn't always into conspiracies, but it got worse over time. It started when she first bought/invested into bit coin; she went on about how our currency will be obsolete, we should invest, blah blah blah. My husband and I didn't care and ignored her, it's her money so not our problem.

As the years passed, she began to tell us about her certain beliefs such as ""gays are the sign of the times"", vaccines cause autism, and her plans to build a bunker for the apocalypse. My husband and I couldn't be any more opposite or disagree more than her on these things, but again, that's her prerogative. With the recent Coronavirus outbreak, I thought FOR SURE she would take it as the first sign of the apocalypse. NOPE. She believes it's fake. 

When we talk to her, she always turns it into a lecture about how the virus is fake or tells us about the books she's read about how to build a bomb shelter, how to scavenge for food and even how to build guns out of scrap metal. My husband and I politely try to steer her to a typical conversation but we never make comment about our opinions on those things. We just let her go on.

The only time I made any implication of my opinion was when she made a comment saying ""well the reason your 2 year old cousin is behind on speech is because he was probably vaccinated."" (He's not vaccinated, unfortunately, and my cousin isn't autistic.) I sort of snapped back a little by telling her my cousin isn't vaccinated and even if he was, it wouldn't have anything to do with his lack of speech. My SIL didn't respond and we changed the subject but every single conversation turned into her lecturing us. 

Despite her beliefs, I want so badly to have a sister connection with her. I don't want to change her opinions, I just want to have a conversation without her going on a tangent about topics I, quite honestly, find offensive. She is a very sweet, patient and giving person in general, we just don't share certain opinions. But  I mean, that should be ok; not everyone thinks the same way and that's fine as long as you're kind to others, which she is. I want to have a sibling relationship with her, but I feel like I missed out on finally having a sister I could count on. I also worry about my husband's relationship with her; they were so close in the past, but now they hardly talk. On top of that, my husband and I plan to have children one day and I don't want to hear her go on about our decisions on how to raise our child. I want my children to have a relationship with their aunt but if her opinions directly affect our children, we will not hesitate to cut her out. How do we talk to her without it turning into a big soap box and how can I develop an actual sibling relationship with her? Thanks.",20Apr2020,1
114,"Hi there,

I’m a Film student studying in London (although currently online of course) and I have a problem I need advice for:

In my spare time I’m apart of a REALLY cool journalism group that gets to interview A LOT of UK YouTubers and people in various creative fields, it has given me an IMMENSE experience so far in going to events, meeting people I grew up watching on YouTube, being able to get tips and advice on how to grow as a creative individual personally and in creating a business, and I’ve got some AMAZING friends out of it.

Although, I think I’m having a small crisis, I’m not sure if I need to cut back on it, because especially recently, I’ve been missing out on article deadlines, and it’s beginning to effect my motivation.

The group and the leaders are INSANELY understanding and kind, I just feel like I’m letting them down a lot, and I feel really guilty about it, even though they’re really kind about my situation.

I’ve been working in a hospital for past few weeks to help COVID patients, by sanitising hospital areas among other duties, while I’ve got the spare time, and now I’ve just moved across the country yesterday (uni still in London, but online, so I’m in the North east looking after my family for now) to keep my bills down.

It’s been really hard, although I’ve got time for focus on myself, and I think this is ESPECIALLY the time to focus on what I want to do, and although I’m really happy about what I’ve done in the group, I don’t want to keep feeling the guilty feelings anymore when I’m doing the best I can.

I’m not sure whether to cut the group for now, and focus on myself, uni and my family, or to keep it and push through.

117,"My boyfriend and his ex wife share a 10 year old daughter. Her sleeping habits are all turned around and neither of them seem to care.  She stays up until 6am every night and sleeps all day. We dont live together and I have never stayed over at his house. In fact, I try not to go over there at all and invade her space. I think it's important that her home is her safe place and that she has uninterrupted time with her father.  

I dont believe I need to chime in on how they parent their child but it has affected my children and I more than I ever thought possible. I am at my wit's end and considering ended the relationship. 

I am also divorced and have a very healthy coparenting relationship with my ex. My kids are super active with sports and clubs so we are always on the move.  Their child is not and that's okay. Different strokes for different folks.

On the alternating weeks when we both have our kids, we like to do a group activity like bowling, game night, a special dinner...whatever. One activity a weekend.  So we wait all day for her to wake up to go do something. When she does wake up, the odds are 50/50 if she will go. (I am not comfortable with a 10 year old being home alone, so that ends our plans right there.) For instance, we wanted to celebrate Easter today. We bought a bunch of food, easter baskets etc. Well, she woke up at 5pm and said she doesnt want to leave her house. My boyfriend is very passive and says okay and they stayed home. I am fuming but simply said I understood and kept going about my day but I am getting angrier and angrier. 

I have asked about her sleeping. Suggested a visit to the pediatrician. I have asked if perhaps some counseling to help her cope with their divorce. I have asked a million freaking times if anyone has checked her phone and her social media. Of course, her parents have not. I have asked a thousands times if my boyfriend thinks it's normal or healthy for her? He says of course not but doesnt do anything. I have washed my hands of it because I am frustrated and it isn't my place. 

Has anyone had a successful relationship when you have vastly different parenting styles? 

Do I just shut my mouth and move on? Do I shut my mouth and pretend everything is ok? I have tried before to say...""let's meet only when have no children"" but he was not okay with that.

I've never been in this situation, and I'm too embarrassed to seek help from my friends. I have a million questions that I'd like to ask her, and I'm hoping we can bring each other some type of support and closure.

132,"Starters, I’m slightly entitled because I'm a cancer survivor, and the journey has been a disaster just until a few months ago. Most recently, I secured a significant position in marketing. We’re an essential business and have a bit more job security. My credit score has been in the 490s for the past five to six years because I made terrible decisions when I was ‘cured.’ My dad has always supported me in some way, but I have to play his game rules, and it leads to toxic manipulation and control. The car would be the last string to the puppet master. 

I’m not an idiot. I’m pretty careful with money now. I've learned how to budget on $500/mo and SNAP benefits. I enjoy learning about all industries of STEM. Personally, AI/AR/VR could become even more prominent now with social distancing and marketing. 

I pulled my shit together in the last five years and have become much happier. 

I bought a used Audi S3 yesterday. The car went from the mid-thirties to $20k and was such a steal for its condition (babied lease). I decided to go for it because:

1. I’m becoming 100% independent 
2. I wanted something I’d love and have fun with for the next ten years 
3. My APR isn’t too high and the amount of money coming in would pay off the car in 2yrs vs. 6yrs
4. It’s def superficial, but I also love it which reinforces number 2
5. Coronavirus is life or death (chance) 

PS: Housing is not an issue. I’m permanently protected. All bills are paid on time and finances being settled. The car payment is about $900/mo, including a warranty. I bring in $7600/mo and have about $50k in debt to pay off. 

Will my dad disown me and should I care? Competition can be toxic. And without the psychological sad dad part, is it an okay investment given with all of the things going on in the world?",20Apr2020,1

135,"Here's some background info: My mother is bipolar. She has had a rough past but is going strong now and has medication. She's a really amazing mom, despite the troubles she faces. She goes out of her way to make it known that she loves me with all of her heart. Let's call her Quinn.

So Quinn drinks. Not much usually, maybe a a glass of wine a night. It's not too bad. Also, her work is very stressful. Every once and a while, though, she has a little more alcohol and gets tipsy. Now, usually this isn't a problem, but sometimes it is. 

She has these little fits every month or two when she just bursts. She gets extremely mad at me and calls me names and yells rude phrases at me. ""Dick"", ""You're a shitty human being"", ""I hate you"", ""Fuck you"", and more. She also pulls on my limbs, and this go-round she sat on me to the point where I could not breathe. Quinn got up after a few seconds and I burst into tears. It's hard putting up with the rude remarks and her taking away my ability to breathe, which was really scary. She then immediately started to tell me to ""Calm down"" and ""Stop being a baby"". Quinn continues to pull on my limbs and even tries to smack me a few times. Sometimes she will get really aggressive. She yells, a lot of times, but at points she screams at the top of her lungs. Of course it scares me, but when I tell her that she just shuts me down by saying ""STOP BEING A FUCKING BABY"" and ""YOU NEED TO CALM THE FUCK DOWN!"". She would continue to belittle be with terrible remarks about me while continuously trying to snatch my legs from beneath me. 

When I try to go to my room she follows me and tries to (yet again) snatch away my legs. Once I close the door and lock it to ensure she doesn't get inside (because usually she just yells more and calls me more names) she begs me to open the door. Then, she starts yelling and banging on the door demanding that I open the door. I eventually cave in because I'm so frightened and I just don't want her banging on the door anymore. When she comes in she sits down on my bed, talks shit to me, and then refuses to leave my room when I ask her nicely. I sometimes get to the point where I'm sobbing and begging her to get out of my room, but she yet again refuses and calls me a baby once or twice more. 

I try to go to other rooms, but she just follows me and asks me to open up the door again. I can't escape her when she gets like this. 

Luckily this time we were at her boyfriend's house, who is a real awesome guy. He knows about her disorder and always comes to the rescue, thank god. She restrains herself a little more when we're at his house. He has comforted me after these things, which is really amazing. 

When I try to be rational with her she gets mad and tells me to ""fuck myself"" and other things. When she's like this it's ""her way or the highway"". 

I have to admit, though, I do sometimes make passive-aggressive remarks. I'm not excusing it, but at the time I'm just so frustrated and in a state where I can't really make rational decisions because I'm so stressed and anxious. I can't explain to you how terrible and fearful I feel. It's like she's not my mother, but a new beast. I have called her a ""dick"" (I never curse) and tend to (when in not balling my eyes out) agree with her whenever she calls me something. This angers her, so she just calls me a ""stupid bitch"" and such. I know I shouldn't do that but it's hard just standing there letting her comments rain all over me without a single reply. 

After a few hours of this she passes out. The next morning we don't talk (I'm not sure if she doesn't talk about it because she doesn't remember it or just doesn't want to recall the night's events) about it and I can't bring myself to bring it up. When she's sober she's an amazing person and we've had some great times together. Like, I can't explain how much I love her, and I understand that she has bipolar disorder, but those nights I despise her. 

How do I deal with these things? I'm just so conflicted right now and I'm really confused. Please help if you can. This has been bothering me for some months now.",20Apr2020,1
136,"Hey guys,

Maybe someone can put together my thought dump and give me some advice on why I get so disinterested so fast.

I'm 22 and noticing a trend in my relationships and I'd like an outside input or thought on this...

I  am not the most outgoing guy but I'm also not shy at all usually.

I have always wanted a girl that can push me to be better and the girl I am dating now is great at doing that.

What I've notice is that usually I will chase a girl for a few months and when I finally get her I will be that amazing boyfriend that I've always wanted to be but with maybe the last 3 girls at a certain point I start noticing more and more flaws in the girl and end up not being interested in her anymore.

My relationships usually span 3 months then I get completely disinterested.....

What I don't get is, every time I look back I either, can't see the flaws I was putting on her or I want to be with her again.

Currently, I am dating a girl that lives in Russia that has completely opposed to mine in some aspects (things such as me not being vegan, her being very feminist, and spoiled vs me that I work for everything I have) but she is a gem of a girlfriend. I have met her once for 10 days where she stayed with me. I have recently noticed I have been more and more problem picky than usual and I don't want to let it get to the point that I feel like I can't be with her anymore.

We communicate very well and she empowers me to be my best self but she has some authoritative ways of speaking on certain subjects.",20Apr2020,1
137,"17M

I've always avoided drugs and other dangerous behaviors like gambling or eating unhealthy due to the detrimental effects, but that left me open to music addiction, something that is usually not seen as a negative influence on people.

As a kid, I didn't really like music. I thought it was for people who wanted whiney love songs or to sing or dance like a fool. I always felt that music HAD to be accompanied by singing or dancing, two activities that I was too insecure to do myself. It wasn't a very realistic perspective of music (or my psyche) but it made it very akward when I was a bit older (probably 10 or 11) and felt compelled to listen to music regularly.

I would seek out music like porn, trying to make sure nobody knew I was a fan of it, embarrassed to listen to Katy Perry or Sia, the 2 singers that really got me into music early on. I would only end up playing songs on the TV when my parents weren't around, but it wasn't until I was 13 when my love of music changed.

I had a very bad rejection from a girl I ""loved"" more than anything. That event in January 2016 is a big reason why I stopped pursuing love interests, possibly why I'm so lonely and disconnected now. It made me very depressed for a few weeks, so I decided to get into dubstep.

Yes, dubstep. A very cringy genre that I don't listen to much anymore, but electronic music appealed to me because it was mindless, synthetic, and had no embarrassing qualities (at least at the time). I would sit for hours and drown out my sorrows by scrolling through the many EDM playlists on Spotify, starting my sedentary lifestyle in the process.

This went on for about a year. The only problem is that I would ONLY listen to EDM. I had no interest in any other type of music. That would have been embarrassing for me at the time. I eventually made my love of music public, of course nobody was surprised. 

In late 2017 I decided I wanted to produce tracks on my own. I downloaded some music software and began uploading to SoundCloud. It was a lot of fun and I felt like I could make a career out of it, but then I started to get migraines all the time. My hearing was starting to crackle and pop off. I realized I was damaging my ears from playing electronic music too loud, as well as messing around with random synthesizers.

I had already destroyed a pair of cheap Skullcandy's from blasting hardcore music, and my replacement Sony extra bass headset must have been slowly damaging my hearing. I immediately realized I had to quit listening and producing, so halfway through my first mixtape in early 2018, I told myself to avoid music at all costs or I'd get tinitus or go deaf, right around the time I was becoming open to enjoying other styles of music.

It didn't work out. I had become addicted because music was my only emotional escape. I didn't (and still don't) have an emotional support system or a group of friends I can share feelings with, so I ended up relapsing many times in the last few years.

I have absolutely no care for those dance tracks I played back in the day and I've since moved on to hardcore hip-hop. I chose hip-hop because it came closest to the loud, rythmic sound that EDM has, and all my peers liked it. I convinced myself that it wasn't going to be as damaging to my hearing, but I was wrong, especially since I got into the underground Florida scene, where rappers scream their brains out about sex, drugs and murder.

The content is offensive and I don't agree with it AT ALL and the music is extremely loud, harsh and painful. I get at least one migraine a week now, if not many more. My hearing still pops out or sounds like a loudspeaker once in a while too. It scares the shit out of me. I'm afraid I'll go deaf forever. I always try to quit cold turkey but my life is so meaningless and lonely that I always go back.

I watch the same music videos again and again, it's really my only hobby. That or feverishly trying to complete a discography list of my ""favorite"" artists songs. I swear it's OCD. I can't bring myself to avoid it, despite the pain. I really need help. 

I tried getting into filmmaking, and I've said that my go-to job will be to make movies for a living, but film just isn't as emotional an art form for me as music. When I was avoiding music for the first time, I tried to make some mini-movies and it always felt forced, like I only enjoyed film because it wasn't music. It felt so unnatural and pointless after a while. I eventually stopped. I have no passions otherwise.

I have no job or money and I'm afraid I'll be a bum in a year when I'm an adult. All I can think of to make money with is to make music. I keep telling myself to go back to producing, or heaven forbid rapping. I keep downloading music software, trying to make a beat, getting a migraine, then raging and deleting it. This happens about once a month now.

My parents always play music too. The problem is enhanced because I also like some of their music (some pop and classic rock) and it's just unavoidable in our household. They always want to talk to me about music and it's just enforcing my bad habit. They've spent so much money on records and CDs for me and giving them all up feels like such a dick move. If I did, they'd be pissed.

A therapist told me to accept it and try to live with it, to listen to music moderately, but it's still terrifying and meaningless. I would have seen a doctor about my hearing by now but I have to wait until the social distancing is over.

What should I do? My life has been falling apart for a few years now and I can't seem to get out of this vicious cycle. Any advice is appreciated.",20Apr2020,1
139,"Backstory: my dad gave me his phone to find a video he took of a much younger me playing piano.

148,"I've (21F) been friends with my friend (21M) for 5 years. We were getting close last summer, in terms of being able to talk emotionally and about our life problems, when I accidentally fell asleep at his place one night. When I woke up the next morning, I was groggy and it took me a second to realize my friend had been grinding into me from behind. I became frozen, as he touched my arms, thighs, and when his hand got closer to my crotch, I finally gathered the courage to tell him to stop. He immediately did, it became a big thing, and we spoke about it several times then. He apologized profusely, and said he thought I was awake and okay with what he was doing because I hadn't stopped him till then. He made it clear he wanted to respect me and my boundaries, and it would never happen again. I was unsure, but I wanted to believe him. 

Later, when we would hang late sometimes, I would doze off for a bit before going home because I don't do well sleepy-driving and because I didn't want a repeat where I slept over. On those instances, I would always get the vague 'memory' of him grinding against my crotch as I lay paralyzed but I always thought the 'memories' were too hazy, so I labeled them as nightmares. I stopped dozing off at his place after a bit though, because they kept persisting. 

We stopped talking for about 6 months because life and then recently we started talking again. We've hung out late, and I had the hazy 'memories' again, but I chalked it up to my nerves of being at his place. However, this last time, it was so different. It felt more real, and I 'saw' him pull out his phone multiple times to record what he was doing. I couldn't move, but it was too real to ignore. When I woke up, I asked that he let me see his phone. He wouldn't, and that was when I confronted him about the 'dreams' I had been having and how this one was too real. Finally, when we were outside and I essentially implied I wouldn't be talking to him again, he went to get his phone from inside and showed me his pictures. He just showed me pictures, so I don't know if what I saw was a folder or the actual camera roll, but I was too terrified and tired to really demand that he let me grab his phone.

He claimed it was probably just PTSD when I have those 'dreams,' but I don't know. He said we would hang earlier so there would be no sleeping and we could feel comfortable. Yes, I know, I am stupid for sleeping at his place in the first place but I really wanted to believe him because overall he has been a good friend and (at least when I am awake?) respects my space. I'm not sure what to do, but the thought persists that he might have those videos, which I don't like. 

Am I over-exaggerating? Should I confront him again? What should I do?",20Apr2020,1
149,"My parents aren’t awful people most of the time but they just can’t deal with the fact that I’m a lesbian. I identify as bisexual currently because I’m still exploring with my sexuality but the more independent I become the more I realize that I’m probably gay. My parents don’t think it’s natural and they have always had opinions about it but they’ve never been violently homophobic. One time my father confronted me about only having friends that are on the LGBTQ+ spectrum (because I primarily do) and he thought that only gay people hang out with primarily gay people. So I got angry and told him that I was bisexual. He just laughed and said I wasn’t. 

It’s been three years since this happened and I’ve told more people in my family and they all say the same thing. That I’m confused and that I’m not gay. They just laugh in my face and tell me that I’m not. This has been a reaction from every single person in my family that I’ve told because I thought I could trust them. And I can trust them, because they don’t ever talk about it. I’ve come out several times and they all ignore it and say I’m not.

I remember as I was walking home from my bus stop I felt a chill and my vision got a little fuzzy, and I just felt strange because I could sense this van driving next to me slowly. When I turned the corner onto my street, so did the van. I stopped in my tracks when I realised something didn’t feel right, and the person continued driving down the street (we live in a closed street). When I got inside I told my dad what had happened, and he didn’t really know what to do. At that point the man had parked in front of our house, and just stayed sitting inside. After a while the man drove away, and when my mum came home from work we went to the police station to put in a report. I don’t know what I was expecting, but it did nothing because I didn’t have any useful information to tell them like the number plate or anything.

I never really told anyone else and I don’t get nightmares or anything like that, but I think this incident has made me develop an irrational fear of men. I don’t hate men, or think they’ll all attack me, I just find it hard to trust them and in the back of my mind I feel paranoid that they’ll do something to make me feel unsafe.

My boyfriend has been through a very tough life coming from a little known country between Mexico and South America from a tribe similar or branched off the Aztecs.

He grew up in a very rough country and through a lot of daring survival got to America. Some of his family is back in his home country unable to do anything, and he is here living alone.

Thankfully he has managed to survive, and he even got a job after a month of constant job applications he managed to work at this restaurant aimed for older people.

Because of COVID19, he's out of a job and the store is likely going to close down. His apartment refuses to disallow rent, and he is out of money and can not afford to pay it.

If he doesn't pay it within (roughly)  31 days, he will go homeless and an eviction is already going to be set in stone. His family also live in apartments that are currently not accepting new people or will allow him to stay.

His family I doubt will be able to send him anything enough to cover the cost, and because he is male, there aren't a lot of groups here to support males during this time. No one in the area wishes to hire him to 'prevent risk to other workers and/or the company' .

This is very stressful because I'm in a similar boat, and he was supporting me financially this way, but he won't be able to survive this time, he's run out of things and is even considering criminal activity if just to survive.

How can he survive this? He was not eligible for the $1,200 because he was marked as a 'dependency' on his parents on his 2018 or 2019 tax forms.

I'm sad I have to write this but the intentions are well off. 

A little over 2 months ago I met this girl from a dating app called Hinge. Shes 26F and I 24M. We went on a bunch of dates and we clicked! Real promising signs to a relationship. I can see myself being with her and I feel that I'm falling hard but there's just one thing I don't think I have the same views on. So I need your advice. 

We went on five dates together and then the coronavirus quarantine in our state happened. 

On date #4 she practically jumped out of her seat at the restaurant because a idk 10yr old kid walked past the table on his way through the dining room. It was a high-end restaurant she picked out and took me too. I asked if she was ok, we laughed, then she said ""Its fine maybe I shouldn't tell you where we are"" jokingly about where we are in our dating situation. I finally got her to tell me and she explained to me how she is ""childfree."" Call me out for not knowing what that was but she delightfully explained it to me. I one hundred percent respect her decision. I agreed with her points and that yeah I don't want children either. She called the kid a crotch goblin to me. made me laugh but also thought the kid didn't do anything to her wtf?

 I'm 24 and to be completely honest having kids has NEVER come across my mind for my future plans til now. I am hungry to grow, work, make a living, and I like to think I'm the type of person that's open to new things and never saying never. I just started to think about all this and feel that I had a wonderful upbringing and one day I hopefully will get to do the same for my own. I know I have to end things because its unfair of me to be blinded by love to waste her time. Or I compromise never want kinds and idk I might be willing to go that path. 

During this quarantine its been hard. She's been wanting to zoom every day, facetime talk, text, gets mad if I don't get back to her reasonably, I am bad a using my phone. I really feel like I can have a connection with her but yeah. ultimately I know it's her decision. Today was the first time I saw her in a month. We took a drive together and I couldn't do it bringing the subject up. I just missed her so much and we caught up had a great time. But am I bad for not wanting to think if I want kids with someone that I only knew physically for only a month?

159,"So a couple weeks ago I was feeling fine with everything I eat. I (22F) had no issues with any foods or intolerances. the only issue is my high metabolism which fluctuates my weight but that has happened since childhood and was given a glowing bill of health from my doctor 3 months ago.

I am now noticing 3 weeks ago I was having some upset stomach. It was days after I tried to eat some homemade guac (which I ended up eating a little too much and threw it up. Apparently you can eat too much guacamole which I never knew about, guac is a rare treat for me and I love it.) it left my stomach sour. I didn’t think much of it at first thinking maybe my stomach was still raw from me eating too much of the guacamole. A week after this, my upset stomach turned worst. the next few weeks I was in pain which felt like I was immobile for hours on end (4 to 8 hours). It was a vast majority of pain ranging from a sour feeling to nausea, burning pain and just different pains I can’t even describe! It was such a weird feeling that even my hubby couldn’t figure out. We tried different home remedies to help with my stomach but after several day’s I started getting IBS symptoms and ended up having the worst pain from my IBS after taking different home remedies and over the counter medicines. We never tried any home remedies after this. 

I started to get frustrated and started to eat things I normally ate. I started keeping track. It was not any up until I ate meat. I started with beef. Then chicken. I noticed the meats were giving me the most grief. 
I laid off the meats for a week. I came back to them tonight because my hubby was making angus smash burgers (his favorite meal). I ate it around 5 pm. It’s now almost 10 at night and my stomach just feel so sour and in pain. It’s like a gnawing pain like I’m hungry but I’m not.  I feel so helpless and upset because I never had issues with meat. My family always ate a lot of meat as my family was raised on a beef farm. 

Why am I now having these issues with meats? Is this have to do with indigestion or is it more serious? Is my gallbladder inflamed or I just have bad gas? 

Any advice welcome.",20Apr2020,1

161,"My mother works 3 hours away from home and comes home weekly (for two days) for the past 6-7 years while my father isn't really in the family picture. When she comes home, we talk for a bit and then just head to our separate corners of the house. I end up on the computer and play games with my friends (up until 12 or 1 AM) while she does her own things. I sometimes come in to check up on her, but she always says she's okay and I end up doing my own thing (it's been like this for the time she's been working far away). She also calls home when she's home from work.

Over the years, I kept getting lectured by my mother over things such as not staying up until 1 AM, doing basic chores around the house, or building better habits for myself such as reading more or drawing more. As much as I tried to change, I always reverted back to my old state and did not change that much (one of the reasons why my father isn't really in the picture anymore). 

It wasn't until today that we had a serious conversation where we expressed our thoughts and feelings about our views and she broke down in tears. She told me she was worried that I would grow up to become my father. She expressed her concerns about how I would end up doing nothing with my life, not have habits that would be beneficial for my future and that she would ultimately have to end our relationship just like how she did with my dad. 

Furthermore, she voiced how her relationship with my father gradually got more distant over time. He would always carry a stern face, not say anything to her after a disagreement (which she also said that I do as well), and treated her like dirt (which I don't do, she's my mother after all). These factors all added up and resulted in an end to their relationship.

 **In short, I feel that she just wants me to have the right mindset/habits, to smile more around her, and to be more open with her (or to show her more love as her child).**

I honestly do want to change but I do not know how to do so. It's hard for me to smile (it just feels weird to do it around her). It's hard for me to try to open up to her with my interests and hobbies. I don't want this relationship with my mother to end this way and I understand she wants the best for me as her child. If anyone could give me some advice, I'd really appreciate it. 

\*I hope this post made sense. If not, the TLDR should make more sense (I hope).

TLDR: The relationship between my mother and I are slowly deteriorating as we don't seem to interact with each other and my bad habits/mentality don't seem to change.

162,"People say that 21 is the best age to live. A lot of my older friends told me that they wish they could be 21 again.

My 21st year has been a rough year, but there were some blessings that were added to my life during this time. 

It was rough in the sense that I found out I have body dysmorphia, I was involved in a terrible car accident that made me scared to go back on the road (this really affected me since I live in California, where driving is incredibly important to get around), and I didn’t really get to experience the “night life” that many people experience when they turn 21. I never got to go to a bar, club, or 21+ parties. Plus I am an engineering student, so I spent a lot of my weekends and nights studying and participating in engineering related activities. I wish I had the “fun” that I hear about.

The blessings this year was: I got a body dysmorphia diagnosis, which is beautiful because it’s the start of seeking help. I am expected to start therapy during early summer. Also, I had an internship offer (before it got rescinded by the COVID19 situation), which made me feel like I am good enough for my engineering career. And best of all, I met my love  during my 21st year. He has been a very positive aspect in my life. He’s willing to drive over to see me every single chance he has, he is my biggest supporter and cheerleader (even with me going through body dysmorphia), he makes plans with me and integrates it into his future, we smile and we laugh a lot during our conversations, we always have an amazing time together, and so on. I feel incredibly lucky to have him in my life. He’s also a busy student, and we plan to move in together. The problem is, he’s currently at a different state for his PhD and he’s stuck there, so I can’t see him at the moment. I haven’t seen him since January, so we are currently long distance.

163,"Hello all,

I am a 19 year old college student sent home for the semester due to the health concerns of the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, my institution was one of the first to do so, which should've further signified to my parents the brevity and seriousness of the situation. 

Anyhow, upon returning home to my parents' house in Long Island, NY, I discovered my mom and dad were and still are harboring different perspectives on the coronavirus pandemic. My mom never leaves the house without a face masks, makes us lysol the shopping cart before placing any groceries in it, tells us to use always use gloves and wash our hands, and does not leave the house unless it is absolutely necessary (which means only going grocery shopping).

My dad, on the other hand, could not give the slightest fuck about this situation. He hired a contractor that he's actively financing to work on a construction project in the house because he is ""bored"" and ""needs something to focus his attention on when not being able to work"", invites the neighbors over, never wears face masks or uses any other form of precaution when going out to get takeout at his favorite restaurants or to Lowes stores all across the island to find the perfect mirrors to ""perfect"" the gym, has snuck out of the house multiple times to run ""quick work errands"" near NYC, and he refuses to acknowledge the stupidity of these things or promise to stop.

Today, after weeks of saying that he will be returning to work after Trump gives the OK presumably on May 1st, (his rationale being that Trump is our leader and we must respect our leader's word) he announced today that he plans to go out this Tuesday, April 21st, to NYC to officially start working again. What are his job tasks? *Meeting up with or tracking individuals at either job sites or in private locations* (he owns a small private investigation business that works for insurance companies). 

Not only has he and will he put the family's life and health in danger (especially my 84 year-old grandmother who currently lives with us because can't fly back to her home in the Dominican Republic), but he is clearly putting all of our lives at risk in his own interest. Nothing my mom says to him stops him, and although I've tried to reason with him many times as to why going out is a selfish and ignorant idea, his responses to me include ""Someone's got to make money"" or ""I can't just sit around -- I'm not built like that.""

Obviously these are bullshit reasons. The construction of this gym is costing him multiple weeks worth of pay and even causing him to delay important payments like the mortgage on the house (which my mom secretly pooled money to pay off so he wouldn't get mad as to why she wouldn't trust his intuition) while putting everyone in the household at risk for the disease. So this idea that he has to work to pay the bills is asinine and completely preventable by just stopping the construction of this gym. Furthermore, with the amount of money we have (had) budgeted for just staying at home getting groceries coupled with government aid, we could have lasted months without any reason for my father to attend work (my mother is unemployed). 

Though I do love my father, I am truly concerned for both my family and I's safety, and I also am starting to believe my dad is in a total state of disregard. I contacted my Residential Dean and was informed of the possibility to have emergency housing provided back on campus, and my mom said that she would drive me back to college to make sure I'm safe. However, I don't want to leave my mother, brother, and grandmother in danger. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can possibly do?

TL;DR My dad is refusing to adhere to all of the coronavirus precautions and is putting the family in danger; he won't listen to anyone to stop -- what should I do to protect myself and my family?",20Apr2020,1
164,"Don’t know what’s up with my body nowadays.

15 , female, scared to lay down in bed

No previous medical history of heart problems. I do have two cysts in my left and right breast.

A lot of the times when I lay down, i find it hard for me to breathe. It seems as if my nose gets clogged with air (if that makes any sense), and I have to breathe through my mouth if I want to breathe freely. Not only that, but my heart starts to feel weird. Occasionally, I would get heart palpitations, but they don’t hurt. However, it does scare me and it seems to only cause more. 

I’ve tried to calm down through meditation and it didn’t help at all. for some reason my heart seems week? I don’t really know what the cause could be, except my anxiety levels and stress levels get higher when I try to sleep at light. This rarely happens to me when I take during the day. Usually, I’m able to sleep just fine without any problems. 

I’m a bit scared to lay down, as these symptoms get way worse when I’m laying down. Tonight, I felt a bit of pain on the right side of my left breast, but I don’t know if that’s a sign. Also, occasionally I feel soreness in my left arm or right arm.

165,"I'm in this group chat with my team, and we often exchange memes. 

Somebody sent a video that was posted on Instagram, showing security footage of a car that runs over and kills several people (possibly a drunk driver, but no one in the group chat knows the context). So like, one member got really mad and disappointed in the rest of the team for laughing at it, cuz we all sent our LMAO's.

At first, he was just getting triggered, but it got to the point to where he called us ""just as sick as the person that committed the act"" because we were sharing and laughing at the video. 

I said ""I just don't see why you would waste your time getting offended when instead of making it something negative, make it something positive and enjoy the moment with us and laugh."" 

He claimed that we were being disrespectful because there is a bigger picture to everything and that the people in the video had lives ahead of them, and that I was ""justifying horrid acts of violence against innocent people."" 

I guess I see where he's coming from, but I think it really pissed me off the most when he called us just as evil as the murderer in the video. It's not like we were promoting the behavior in the video, we just thought that it was funny. For him to not think something is funny is one thing, but when he called our actions just as bad, it made me furious because he was straight-up calling us (his own teammates and friends that I know he needs) awful people. For laughing at a meme! 

I just wanted some advice to see if I really am in the wrong here or if my teammate should not have got that upset. He was telling me to see the bigger picture, when I believed that it was *not* that deep.

168,"Sorry if this seems a little rushed, I'm not great at formulating my thoughts into a Reddit post.

I feel like I'm in a rut. I graduated a few years ago and currently work in a job field that I don't enjoy (mostly, in part due to my boss that has zero respect for me), and still live at home. It has recently occurred to me that my job is pretty dead end; decent pay (at least compared to previous jobs), but no benefits and no chance of advancement. I barely have any hobbies or friends that I want to hang out with. A positive of having no hobbies is that I have saved probably 80% of my net income from this job.

Here's where my dilemma comes in. I've been looking into getting an apartment or small home with some of this money, but I realize that in doing so I will need to have a job that allows me to pay for that, which unfortunately means I would have to stay at this job for much longer than I think I physically and mentally can.

 I think what would be best is to quit my current job and move to part time while attending a community college or trade school, so I can have a chance of doing something I slightly enjoy instead of working shitty job after shitty job until I die. The problem with this plan is, obviously, I still live at home and my parents (and I) wouldn't like it if I stayed here even longer. So somehow I would ideally move out while working part time, enough to pay my bills, and attend school but I'm not sure if this is viable or even realistic, but I feel like doing something, anything that breaks the monotony and gets my life out of this rut would be a positive change.

Sorry if this was too long. Kinda at my wit's end, and haven't spent too much time on this sub.",20Apr2020,1

170,"My mom since I was a little kid has claimed that she has all of these diseases she is dying from. Many have beem dropped to the wayside but if I were to name them all we would be here all night. One of the things she loves to use is saying that MS is causing x problem. But lately she has trying to use it to act confused. By switching out words that don't make sense such as bathroom and chicken coop while stuttering maniacally. After a few moments she can suddenly be better. 

The other day she couldn't take basic instructions when driving and we almost got in a wreck. I lost my cool and told her to pull over in the most angriest shout. Of course, she ignored me even though few moment prior she was making me feel bad about not driving. But lo and behold she could scold me in perfect sentences saying she didn't deserve to be spoken to that way and suddenly if my phone said turn left she did. I'm not even sure she has MS and my sister who is a nurse doesn't think so either and many of her pain doctors think she is something like a hypochondriac and addicted to vicodin. Its so bad that she literally wont change her medicade insurance to the current state she lives in and drives several hours to a pain clinic in her former state.

She is also known to lie a lot and is manipulative. But I have recently moved in to help raise my neice who her parents abandoned on my mom and help her out as well. My mom has never been healthy and suffers from diabetes and uses fast acting insulin while eating poorly. She has never consulted a specialist. Another thing about my mom is that during my childhood she was very abusive and she says it was due to her medication she took for MS. So now as an adult I can't tolerate this. But if I am in the wrong, and these are symptoms are found in MS then I'm gonna need to do soul searching.

Lately, she has been unbearable and using her I don't know what I am doing, I'm confused act. We just got into an argument where she pretended. She has now left the house angrily perfectly fine cognitive. I don't know if my doubts are founded or if it is all escalating from my childhood abuse. Any advice?

171,"Kind of a vague title. I know. I just didn't know how else to word it.

So a bit of backstory. There is a lot going on with my parents, and I guess a lot to take into account. Thing is, I'm too biased to make an objective opinion. I'll explain best I can.

Me and my parents have always had a *very rocky* relationship. Mainly due to them being extremely toxic people.

Short version of my parents....My dad is very abusive....an asshole.....and doesn't have 1 single friend because of that *(spends his entire day watching TV on the couch)*. My mom is half-good, half-bad. On one hand, she can be very nurturing and caring....but she can also literally be the most selfish and manipulative person on this planet....without any care for who she hurts, which includes me and my dad. So that's kinda the short gist of them.

So.....I used to live in NYC. I had a job and was renting out Airbnb's for awhile. Well about 6 months ago I lost my job and I had to move back in with my parents. I have yet to find a job in my current area that relates to my field. It's getting difficult, especially with the coronavirus going around these past few months. My parents had agreed to pay for the basics at the house until I get a stable job....which just includes groceries and all utilities.

Fast-forward to this week, my stimulus check from the government comes in. My mom had been asking me for a couple days If I had gotten it yet. When I finally got it, I told her and my dad.

Her first response was....*""Great! Now you can pay us back for everything!""*

I said *""What?""* She said *""I kept a list. Did you assume we were just giving you money?""*

I said *""You never mentioned at any time that I would have to pay you back for all of this. The agreement was that when I get a stable job....I would help with all expenses. I don't have that job yet. This isn't even a big check""* With that logic I would have to pay back my friends who *""lent""* me money and never said I'd have to pay them back. That convo didn't end well

Fast-forward to yesterday. My mom said to me *""Well don't you think you should repay us for taking you in?""* I agreed that they deserved some of the check, so I told her I would give them $300. She actually laughed in my face, and asked me where I got such a low number. Her constant condescending attitude made it seem like she was making fun of me.

I then asked *""You're thinking half aren't you?""*

She responded seriously *""No.....Just a little bit under half. Y'know We should all have a family discussion about this, because Dad gets a say too in how much we get""*

**Because Dad gets a say too in how much we get.** That sentence just seemed very manipulative to me. If I had just given her what she wanted right then and there, she wouldn't have asked for my dad to join on the convo. Which says to me....She doesn't give a shit about my dad having a say.....she just wants the $.

I feel like I'm stuck in a position where...they do actually deserve some of the $ but...they are going about it in a very selfish way. It feels like If I give them the money they want, it'd also be rewarding their manipulative behavior....and rewarding bad behavior is never good.

Back about 3 months ago, I went to the doctor with some stomach pain, that had been lasting a few days, I thought it was my kidneys, as I have problems with UTIs recently had one that went untreated for about 2 weeks. 

As I was telling the doctor about my stomach pain, she blew me off entirely, before asking me to get up on the table.

Once I did she felt up my belly, and didn't skip a beat, and told me, "" You are just constipated."" This didn't surprise me though she made a few comments that didn't have to be said. 

I was 5 foot 4, and 210 pounds at the time, so not skinny by any means. I have been struggling with my weight my whole life but had recently started feeling better about myself.

The doctor ended up being ""so concerned"" and my stretch marks and told me something along the lines of ""Oh my, I can't believe this, just look at your stomach"" Then pointed at my stretch marks.

She had been my doctor for about 3 years and in recent months I had gained some weight, but she didn't need to act like she had just seen a dead body.

After I got home that day, my image of myself had completely changed, I cry myself to sleep, and can't go out in public. I have started extreme dieting (often 700 calories or less) in an attempt to lose weight, currently, I'm at 176. I know its not a healthy diet but I just can't stop. If I eat, I end up self-harming and sobbing on the floor. Even smashing things in the house out of guilt. I feel like if I eat then I am fat, and don't deserve to be alive. I have had to cover up mirrors in my house because if I see myself I start crying. 

I can't even function normally, like taking showers, and I skip hanging out with friends because I'm so scared for people to see how fat I am. Even with all the weight lost, I still hate myself, and I'm seriously considering suicide. My life is miserable. I can't do things that make me happy without thinking about my weight. If I see a skinny person on the Tv then I start crying again.

My worst breakdown was when I smashed my Nintendo switch because I was fat and didn't deserve it, that happened yesterday.

I don't know what to do, I'm miserable, my relationship is failing too because I'm constantly crying on the phone. I have never hated myself so much in my life.

John is very in the loop wth drama so he has the scoop on a lot of things, but isnt really good friends with brad. So, apparently grace had a few guy friends over and made out with two of them, got felt up etc etc, according to john. This is while she is dating my best friend brad, who has even mentioned marrying this chick. Completely caught me off guard. Anyway, the only way I couldve find out about it really is from john, who  specifically told me to keep him out of it completely, bc he doesnt want to get caught up into the situation as he isnt really close with these people (small town so everyone knows each other). But, I know i need to tell brad what happened. I don't know how i can bring it up to him without telling him who told me, and I cant say john, I stick to my word. How can i tell brad what happened?

188,"So long story short, I moved to a small town in middle school. I was different and got severely bullied and humiliated until I graduated. I developed an eating disorder and attempted suicide several times. Recently a bully has reached out with an apology and I have been trying to find the words to respond for about a month. I forgave her a long time ago but I did need to get some stuff off my chest. Her message is below as well as my response. I don't want to be mean to her as all of this stuff took place over 9 years ago and we were different people. I just wanted her to know how bad it was for me as a result of her actions; hopefully, she raises her girls better. I just wanted to respond to her gracefully and get my point across; I dont want to come out as bitchy or mean. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her message: 

Hey...I just wanted to apologize to you. I was a bully to you in school And I'm incredibly sorry for that.I think about it and you more times than you'd probably realize. I'm a better person now and I've grown so much in becoming a mother it's been my biggest blessing and I cannot imagine someone treating my little girls the way I did to you sometimes. I just wanted to say you are a beautiful woman with amazing talent. Always have been. It's totally okay if you don't respond either, I understand both ways. I've been going through some stuff and I needed to make amends with that part of myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

The message I want to send back but am unsure of: 

Your message was a shock to get honestly. I’ve wanted to respond but the right words never seemed to come. The biggest thing I want to say is thank you for your apology. I never thought I would get one. It really does mean a lot. You were one of the many bullies in our class who, for the 6.5 years I lived in Cooperstown, made my life absolutely miserable. It was not just you doing the bullying nor were you my worst bully, but your actions did contribute to me developing an eating disorder as well as several suicide attempts.  I’m not trying to guilt-trip you or make you feel bad. I just want you to know the reality of my situation back then and the severity of your past actions. I know you are a different person now. I forgave you for all that a long, long time ago. You had so much heartbreak in high school and I understood that. I have kept you in my prayers for many years. It’s been really great watching you grow. I know you probably already are, but please teach your girls to be kind to those who are different. I wish you every happiness.",20Apr2020,1

192,"Brief background on my situation. I met this guy at a meetup around 5 months ago and was instantly attracted to him. Tried to get to know him, spark up conversation each time our group hung out, etc but was really only ever getting friend vibes from him. We hung out solo once as friends and he never initiated any hangouts after that. Well a new girl joined our meetup at a group event and they seemed to instantly hit it off. She is very pretty and has a lot of sex appeal so I get it. But he’s in his mid 30s and she’s 10 years younger and not serious about life at all (still goes to clubs, out partying etc). I’m a few years younger than him and am at the same stage in life as him - solid career, financially stable, etc. I’m by no means ugly - average to a little above average looking and fit.

Point is, this guy doesn’t like me right? He’s had five months to initiate something and was super flirty with that girl the day they met. They’ve hung out multiple times in smaller groups of our friends and he has not extended an invite to me to those hangouts. I only know of the times they’ve hung out in groups, so who knows if they’re hanging solo as well.

I think those are pretty big signs he’s not interested me, yet I find myself hanging on to this idea that he might like me. Guess I’m delusional. How do I get past this?! Especially being in this quarantine and not able to really date other guys. This sucks.",20Apr2020,1

Back when I was a little kid in 2nd grade 5th graders always walked over the hill - from different schools - to mess with kids. Keep in mind this school is relatively good on monitoring, but I guess not a few years ago.

This guy named Ford and his friends always picked on me since I was smaller than other kids, they normally said rude things but eventually it got to the point of hitting and slapping. It stopped in 3rd grade and I never told my parents.

Now to the present, my brother recently added a person to his friend’s friend group (they are all nice except another time, which I’ll explain another time)

The person was Ford. My brother introduced him to me and he first went to an expression to shock then kept a straight face until we were alone, then he gave the most devilish smirk if I’ve ever seen one.

207,"Long story short, I have developed some health problems over the years and this includes allergies to various things.  I have recently started reacting to my dad and siblings shampoos and body washes (they use heavily scented products, which I steered away from years ago due to allergies).  It used to be ok, as long as I didn’t use these products myself, but now, whenever they shower, I am starting to get breathing issues, and every new time it happens the reaction gets worse and it’s starting to scare me.  Not being able to breathe is kind of a big deal.  I mentioned it and gave them the products that I use that are ok for me and don’t make me react.  Thing were fine for a week or so, but then my dad used his own products again, and I had a really bad reaction.  

I am really heartbroken that a body wash that he likes is apparently more important than my health and well being, and I don’t know what to do.  My reactions are getting really bad, and I don’t know if I can keep going through this without it getting dangerous.  My mom has yelled at him and I have told him myself(and I will mention it again) since he tends to think my mom is over dramatic.  He claims he just ran out of the one product that I gave him, so he used his old one, but to me that’s like saying, “Oh, I know you’re allergic to peanuts, but I ran out of almonds, so I put peanuts in your smoothie,”.  

My dad has always been selfish, but this really hurts that my health doesn’t matter to him.  He’s already being very unfair in his treatment of me vs my sibling, so I’m starting to think he hates me or something.

About a week ago, F1 accused F2 of raping 4 women (soft power rape/sexual assault) over discord. I have know both of these guys for a long time and could never see F2 doing this as I’m especially close to him. F1 claims to have been told indirectly and directly by these women that these situations happened. It seems to me as though this is completely impossible for F2 to have done this. (I’m horrible at writing btw so just ask in comments for more info if the situation is unclear)
Separately, F1 told me about one of the situations (no name given):
They went to a parking garage in F2’s car and F2 asked to have sex, which the girl denies. This happened a couple of times and then she got out of the car. F2 said to get back in the car and eventually she did, but felt as though she had no way home and proceeded to have sex with F2. (Keep in mind this has passed through a couple of people before getting to F1 and there is no way to confirm this)
F1 also refuses to tell anyone any names and refuses to tell F2 any names or situations to protect the alleged victims.

He currently lives in a house with family members who are abusive and are also threatening to kick him out at the end of June. He has nowhere else to stay so would end up homeless. 

When he arrives here in the UK, he will be safe and able to stay with me at my parents home until we find our own place. I have many friends who are welcoming and we are all looking forward to him coming over so that we can show him what a loving family actually is even if they aren’t blood relations. 

UK visas are both confusing and restrictive. We are not married (but intend to in future). We don’t feel it is the right time to get married for other personal reasons. He wants to study but has not yet got a place at Uni (his home situation makes it hard to apply for courses he likes). He would happily work here in the UK but again, can’t apply until he is over here.

So to the main question:

Can anyone shed any light on what the best way forward is with this? How can we get this sorted ASAP mostly for his safety (given the current situation?)?

Side question: the standard visitor visa says that you can stay for 6 months. What happens after that? What’s the “reset period”? I.e. could he just fly off for a holiday to “home (the US)” and back again?

Any advice would be much appreciated. Suggestions of other options welcome!",20Apr2020,1

234,"Alright so some back story. My MIL and I (24F) do not have the best relationship and she doesn’t have the best relationship with my husband. 

However, I talked to my SIL (19F) who still lives at home (my husband and I live 600 miles away) last night for a while. She was telling me how fucking awful her step dad is. This guy came into the picture when my husband was around 16 and is one of the biggest reasons my husband moved out at 17, because the guy was such an asshole. 

SIL goes on to tell me how her stepdad will SCREAM in her face (above her, she will be sitting on the couch and he will be standing), will slam doors, he is mentally and verbally abusive. I have witnessed him on several occasions make “jokes” about SIL and MIL weight. I also have a BIL (16M) who moved to live with his dad last year because stepdad is so awful. SIL also goes on to tell me that he used to hit his ex wife (her step brother informed her of this), my MIL doesn’t even do her hair (doesn’t dye it or anything like she used to) or wear makeup anymore because her current husband “doesn’t like it”. SIL also says that MIL doesn’t have any friends anymore because her husband has also ran them away. Every single thing I know about abusive relationships, this guy checks all of the boxes. I don’t know how to help or what I can even do. Her and I are not really close enough for me to call or text her to make sure she is okay, but even if I did, I know he prints out the phone bill and reads their text. BIL and SIL have both gotten in trouble because he reads their text (for seemingly no reason, they are not bad kids at all).

239,"So, im trying to move out soon. Obviously during this pandemic my whole family is quarantined and we have not left the house almost at all. I brought up me moving out on my 18th birthday (which is in a week) and my parents blew up on me, my mother started crying and calling me selfish. and that I'm leaving this family behind if I move out. I tried to explain that I'm not coming back into the house once I leave and that i'm not going to risk my family catching it because of me. My family will cut me off, not let me take any of my belongings and will cut off my phone service if I leave. I understand that, because I don't expect them to support me when I leave. I have two younger siblings that are extremely upset with me leaving. She keeps using that against me, and telling me that its not fair for me to leave. I know they'll be upset with me leaving whether I leave now or later though. I just dont know what to do. I really do feel like im being selfish. My parents have always shown me support and have always been there for me and I feel like im taking that for granted. I just want to be on my own, and If i leave i dont expect my parents to support me because I know the consequences. I promised them I wouldn't leave until the pandemic is over so they wont completely ground me, but I just don't want to be here anymore. I know my mother will forgive me someday for moving out, but I just dont want them angry at me at all. What should I do?

240,"back when I was maybe 17/18 my brother and cousins and 2 girls were hanging out with us ina car, driving around. 

Apparently one of the girls had a crush on me, and decides to sit on my lap while taking her home. I tell her, ""Hey I'm getting an erection and you're sitting on it."" and I vaguely recall saying it so she'd be aware that I was aroused, I can't remember if I wanted her to move as well, but she didn't. I remember telling her twice, but no budge on her part.

We I got the smart idea to try and grab her breasts as she was sitting on me. Well, she was pulling my hands away, still sitting on me. And I just kept going for it. 

Apparently she had told my brother I was too agressive and obviously the crush diminished....
I don't know why I remembered this now (22 now) but I feel immensely guilty and remorseful. I've been told to get therapy and I'll try it. 

But I'm afraid this makes me a rapist. or some kind of sexual assaulter or sex fiend. I haven't done anything like this ever since and I would never even imagine it....

So Reddit, please tell me what I am so I can do something about this.

I have no way of contacting her because this was 4/5 years ago. I don't even remember her name....

243,"So I started smoking weed a couple months ago and bought off this delivery service who sells to underage. I am also underage. I bought multiple times and met in places not to far from my house. A couple minutes walk. I quit smoking because I saw it was affecting my health and i shouldn't do it anymore. My parents raised me better then to succumb to this.

244,"I'm not going to leave anything out about me, I'm just going to pretty much say everything that's going on in my head and my life. So anyone that reads the whole thing and proceeds to give me any life advice I really do appreciate it. So right now I am going to community college and I switched from computer science to a business major since I wanted something easier. Even though I haven't done any difficult cs required classes and I've only done general ed classes for 2 years in community college. Throughout those 2 years in community college I've pretty much done the same classes for 3 semesters in a row and ended up stopping going to classes or dropped them and keep in mind each semester they all were the same classes that I wanted to re try and just make myself finish them. All the classes are really easy gen Ed classes that if anyone put in a decent amount of time they could get an A in it. So after switching my major to business I decided to just do all business classes for a semester just because its something that I could stand and not some boring gen ed class that are basically the same shit that I went through in my 4 years of high school. So far out of 5 classes I'm taking that are all related to my AS in business and information systems, I will only pass 3. The reason for this is because I constantly wait till the last minute to do assignments and the only bad grades I get are the assignments that I do not do at all. I really dread doing my classwork even though all my classes are online work, I absolutely hate it and feel like its a waste of time. My high-school life was the same as I did barely enough to graduate. Now That I gave the backstory to college, I will talk about what my goals are in life. My goals in life are to own my own business/brand. I've wanted to be a entrepreneur ever since my sophomore year in high school. And even before that I wanted to be a YouTuber(which i still do now). Basically my goals have always been related to being my own boss and go the entrepreneurial route and never really cared of going into any regular job. The thing is I know that there are a  lot of business people and entrepreneurs that don't swear by college and don't have a degree. And based off my research and watching videos about people who are successful in the way I want to be the general idea is that you need to hustle and put endless hours into it knowing that it could take years to pay off. The thing with me is that I think i suffer with some sort of depression. From time to time I will randomly just fall into a sad hopeless mood. And usually depending if I get into this mood in the morning or night it will go away within a certain amount of hours and if not I will be fine the next day. Now the extent of the sadness is that I often seriously contemplate suicide. Even when in a normal mood. Not happy or sad I usually think that suicide is an option and that I should do it when I fall into one of my ""sad moods""(idk what to call it) since during that mood is when I would only be able to do it. Idk honestly, I'd probably even do it now If it was as simple as turning off a switch. and keep in mind i'm not in one of my sad moods right now. Its just how i feel. But when i do get a sense of hope and plan out things i should do to work towards my goals of creating content on youtube and owning my business. I never go through with my visions because eventually I will catch the sense of hopelessness. and the sense of hopelessness isnt rare, It happens every week and if I could try to put a number on it I would say a average of 3 times a week. Honestly I know that i probably will never attain my goals because I assume that entrepreneurs are mentally tough and how could I ever be in charge of a whole business or even youtube channel If I am constantly getting depressed?  So given all this is the reason why I decided try college. Knowing that my series of depression will stop me from being consistent with goals I have decide just to get a college degree so that I could hopefully have a decent paying job in the future(if i have one), I even know I know i will be just as sad as I am now. It also doesnt help that im majoring in business which is known for not being a useful degree. Anyways thanks to whoever took the time to read this and give advice. First time on this sub-reddit so hopefully I didn't do anything wrong to get this taken down since it took me a while to write this. Anyways  thanks again.",20Apr2020,1
245,"As school is closed now due to the Coronavirus, I’m in a unprecedented situation where I can take a break and really get my life back together.

That being said I practically wasted an entire month doing nothing. I was consistently very sad everyday and I was going through mental problems. I only did the bare minimum to get by. I started different projects on myself but failed to remain consistent.

I wanted to get ahead of my school work but I ended up procrastinating.

I developed a skincare routine but I struggle to be consistent. I tried to fix my sleep schedule but some days I just want to lie in bed all day and stay up all night, toppling all progress. I tried to lose weight and improve my cardio health but sticking to my diet and exercise routine has been challenging.

I tried to work on myself and become a more interesting person. I am getting more involved in politics and just trying to be more aware of my surroundings. I wanted to read more books but I can’t find the focus and opt for my phone or a tv show instead. I also can’t seem to break off my phone addiction, especially reddit. I tried to go on phone fasts, but I need to be able to call contact people I work with, so that never works :/

Next year is going to be the most important year, it will be everything I prepared for my entire life. I really don’t want to screw it up. I just want to be able to set a routine, be in a good place where I’m mentally stable and happy with myself.

246,"So back a few months ago I had always eaten a lot and was getting really self conscious about my weight. Around this time was also when I first got a girlfriend that didn't work out. I felt like I had to prove myself worthy of having a girlfriend by losing a tremendous amount of weight. 

Over the course of three days I ate nor drank anything. After I saw that I was losing weight, 15 pounds if i remember right. I began to start eating a whole lot of food. My appetite skyrocketed after the three days. It was really unhealthy. I then realized that 15 pounds wasn't much weight at all, so after I ate every day I would throw it up and quite frankly it felt good afterwards. I did this for a couple of weeks every day, and I finally got really tired of the vomiting on a routine like that. 

I kept eating and eating more food, gaining more weight. I still feel more hungry than I used to before all this happened.

249,"So I (16) have been struggling with my emotions for a while now. I have a history of self harm (1 week clean, yay!), slight alcohol abuse, and suicidal thoughts.

I started self harming when I was 12, drinking when I was 14 (got drunk for the first time a few nights ago, only got buzzed before) and have been having suicidal thoughts since 12 as well. Since then I'd say it has gotten a bit worse. I started cutting deeper and more frequently, I got drunk for the first time, and I've been toying around with my belt and fantasizing about all the different ways I could kill myself. Hanging, slitting my wrists, shooting myself while hunting, overdosing, running out in front of a car, jumping off of a building, slitting my own throat, etc.

I've been getting better definitely, I'll usually end up just listening to music or working out or taking a cold shower. But every once in a while they pop up, I want to get drunk again, I want to cut again, I want to end my life.

251,"Hello, my friend (senior in high-school) is becoming really insecure about her actions and choices because of her uncle. Since her father passed away last year, the uncle became a trustee and seems to influence her choices. She's also the eldest child in the family, which usually means more responsibility and pressure is put on her. She's at a breaking point where the thought of him makes her upset. 

The uncle is stubborn, likes to speak whatever is on his mind and pressures you to do something.

After graduation, her plan is to take an extra year for work and university transferable courses. The uncle judged the plan and asked ""Why do you want to take that? Do you know what you want?"" Which she doesn't (that's why she's taking transferable courses, to have more options in uni). And this made her really embarrassed about her choices.

He also compares her to her sister (a junior) who might be planning to take medical courses in uni. (They both don't like how they are compared). He would pick out little things about her like ""I noticed your reaction is slower than your sister's"" which brings down the whole mood for them.

She's afraid that if she speaks her mind, the uncle and the rest of the family won't support them and spread rumors. In the past, the mother was worried about money because of the passing, and the uncle said to other family members ""She's a greedy bitch""; the other family members haven't visited since.

They also said, ""Don't ask help from other people other than us."" indicates that outside aid is not needed.

260,"So I(15M) was really good friends with this girl in the 8th grade (Last year). We both had personalities that played off eachother really well and would always make eachother die of laughter. When our friendship took a downturn is when we had this end-of-year field trip. I went along with her and her friends group and not really being that good of friends with anyone else I just really tried to talk to her. Fast forward a week when we both this concert on the weekend. When it was over I had went to put away my instrument in the backrooms and I accidently walked in on her hugging the guy I knew she liked at the time. Not really thinking, being the idiot I was, I say ""oooo what are you guys doin' in here"" like a big ol creep. She rightfully got weirded out by this and hugged me on her way out the room to make it less awkward. Me being confused at the time why she had hugged me in front of the guy she liked, texted her to ask why the heck she did that. She then begins to unload on me about how I overreact about everything and that I was clingy, awkward around her other friends, how I wasn't funny, how I was a creep and accused me of flirting/liking her with her, etc, all of which were probably true except the flirting. I was offended and called her some names. She then tells me I really just needed to know this stuff that had been bothering her and that I gave me the choice of forgiving me, being normal the next day, and giving her some space, or I could continue to angry and bitter and she would simply stop talking to me. Me being to embarrassed to talk to her just proceed to just not talk to her and be around differnet people for the rest of the year, giving her the space she wanted. I tried to talk to her one time but she just ignored me, so I figured that our friendship was just over and I shouldn't engage anymore. On the last day of school she tried to talk to me as if none of the month we hadn't talked hadn't happened but I just didn't talk to her not knowing what to say. That's the last time I ever saw or heard of her. It's hard to get the story in a correct perspective, but she was justified and right in every way and I was wrong. I just don't know if reaching out is a good idea and if so how I should do it. I just really valued our friendship and wish we could maybe rebuild it.

264,"Hello, 

First of all, this is a job I recently returned to earlier this year. I had no idea Covid would strike the way it did. If I did, I may have reconsidered returning. But nonetheless, that is in the past. 

Just a brief summary. I have worked at this company since 2014, and I left recently just last year (July2019) on good, professional terms. I left because I felt in my heart that I could not be there without accumulating overwhelming toxic feelings. The job is easy, the people are tolerable, but I underestimated the resentment of returning to a company that I hated for a time. 

Why did I come back? Well, I underestimated the amount of money I needed to return to school full-time (without taking out loans so far). I'm not doing bad - but I just felt like my funds were dropping faster than I would have liked. My supervisor offered me a weekend shift (which was supposed to be temporary) and I took it. I figured why not? I already knew the ropes. Working weekends isn't an issue for me. And I'd get decent pay for working on a shift with very few people. It sounded ideal. 

When I'm there, something inside of me is...just boiling. And it effects me outside of work - and I AM ashamed of myself for being so petty and illogical. I should be better. I want to be better. 

I think I regret going back. My leaders and supervisor has been kind and understanding to my return, and I don't hold ill-will towards them. But the overall resentment and hate is just overwhelming.

If you haven't figured out, I am definitely not mentally stable. I am well aware of my faults, I really am. I'm selfish and arrogant. I was 'patient' for a time, but that good quality of mine dwindled after the 4th year of working there. Some of them can say I am nice. Nothing but a facade I use so I can make through day in and day out. Whatever respect I have for my co-workers dwindled because I hated being taken advantage of. 

Should I just quit? I am lethargic when I'm there. When I was studying full-time, I was happy. Really happy and I enjoyed life. I was not in a good place mentally last year (just before leaving) and I honestly believe if I didn't leave when I did, I may have turned to self-harm. 

I'm very sorry if this is long or even childish. I understand if you feel that way. I'm sure I'll wake tomorrow feeling like an idiot. But I would just like some thoughts, even advice? 

I want to be happy. I'm afraid of mentally regressing to a bad state. That's what my heart wants but my brain tells me, I need to stay and make the easy money. I just need to suck it up and work it through. 

If you read this, at the very least, I want to thank you for taking the time. 

Take care and stay safe, everyone. 

Side Notes: I didn't delve into why I hate the place. It's basic - I worked very, very hard and got very very little. I have dislike for some co-workers sure, but that's not out of the ordinary. Over time, I just grew to feel...lethargic. I feel like my energy and joy is just sapped every minute I spend there. I tend to take things personally no matter how hard I pretend that I don't. It's a flaw that I simply cannot put away. 

I am not struggling financially. Maybe over time I may but I'm not against taking out loans down the line. I can easily acquire my associates without having to take out loans. Bachelors is a different story though.",20Apr2020,1

Well one day he told me he would give me 50 bucks for doing him a little favor I didn’t know what he meant by a little favor, I was innocent and didn’t think much of it. But he told me to go to the back of the store where he worked and he said unbuckle my pants and to show him my dick. At that moment I felt numb and frozen I couldn’t move and or do anything. What he did next was he put his hand down in my pants I didn’t know how to react to this and afterwards he told Me if I would to say anything he’ll come to where I live I was scared and felt lost growing up I just need some guidance from this trauma.

I recently found a shrink who understands my situation. Unfortunately he’s gone through a hard time (we also have the same trauma and I feel like I’ve been triggering him once or twice a week for a year) and I think he’s taking it out on me.

He’s been calling my siblings and parent to get in touch with me. I would tell him before about how my mom would do something bad and tell my counselor(s)/psychiatrist before I could. Ever since I’ve wanted total privacy. ⬅️underage

Whenever my mom would ask to talk to him I’d tell him I don’t want to but he’d persuade me to tell her to come in. ⬅️ adult

He wouldn’t tell her details but he would tell her if I’m ok or not and ”accidentally” talk about something I asked him not to talk about without saying I do that thing.  ⬅️ adult

I vented to my sibling about it and he reacted in a mean sarcastic way saying I should let them talk to each other. He later apologized and sent long paragraphs about how he loves me and talked to my shrink who says he just called everyone to make sure I’m ok bc I didn’t answer.

My shrink has been violating my boundaries and privacy. I feel like because I didn’t stop him from calling my mom, gave him her number in the past, and brought her in when he asked that I gave him that “technical ok “ that the law allows but he clearly did this on purpose.

Because my brother tried to help and told him that I think he’s talking about my personal info to mom (which he kinda is. He told her to tell me to go do training that I don’t want to do and she does want to take me to do it.)",20Apr2020,1

Also I know that everytime that we had a little argument he would talk about me behind my back.

274,"This is going to be a weird one, but I really, really need advice on this situation. Recently, this kid from high school I used to talk to reached out after not speaking for over a year. I never really knew him well at all but we had hooked up once and were kind of talking for the few months before that. It always felt like he took it more seriously than I did. After it happened, we never spoke again. 

Until last week when he randomly snapchatted me saying that I ruined his life and I was a bitch. I never answered and just blocked him, but the next day he DMed me on Instagram apologizing and saying that I didn’t do/wasn’t any of those things he said, he’s just really depressed and his family is fucked. I know this is bad, but I just ignored it because I haven’t talked to him since high school and I’m 20 now, a sophomore in college. He kept DMing me since then saying that he just wanted to talk to someone. Then tonight he texts me asking if he should kill himself. 

Now this is where I’m conflicted. Obviously, I don’t want him to do that, but I just feel like he’s forcing his problems on me when I genuinely don’t feel like I know him well enough at all for them to 1) be my problem, as awful as it sounds, and 2) even be able to help him. I would just feel HORRIBLY if he hurt himself but I don’t think I can deal with this since I’m the only person he has talked to within this year that wasn’t his “dysfunctional” family. I’m rambling, but it’s making me nervous that I’m the only person in his life that can apparently help him and if he does something to himself, it’ll be my fault.

276,"It’s been several years since I have seen an actual psychiatrist. I’ve had all of my anti-depressants prescribed to me by family doctors in the past two or three years. It was usually a single dose of an antidepressant after filling out a simple questionnaire, and I feel that my mental health is too complex for a simple questionnaire which is why I want to see a psychiatrist. 

I have seen three psychiatrists in my area and I did not have the best experience with either. One was a bit cold, another retired, and the third was at a practice that was seeing a lot of patients who were on parole or probation and I felt very anxious there. None of the above made me feel any sort of comfort or connection. I was a teen and that was just important to me. That doesn’t matter. I need help now. 

I can’t function like a normal adult anymore. I am so anxious all the time. I am regressing into old habits that years of therapy have helped me to break out of. I get nostalgic and cry almost every night. I am so irritable. I have thoughts about harming myself and others. 

It’s been so bad that I quit my job in January. I was trying to focus on graduating college, but then I started to deteriorate more. Then the world went to shit. 

I’m also in a catch-22 in my life. I am trans, have been for years. Told my mom years ago, but I’ve never put my foot down to make it stick. I’ve never told her that if she respects me then she could make an attempt to call me by my name and pronouns. However, I am so anxious I can never bring it up or the few times I do I start to shut down instead of asking for her to work with me on this issue. It creates a huge cycle of self-loathing, fear, anxiety, and sadness. I can’t break out of this loop. I don’t know what to do. 

I don’t want to die. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I don’t want my girlfriend to leave me because I am constantly either agitated or apathetic. I want to live. I want to enjoy my life. I want to be able to roll with the ups and downs of life.

Soon the frequency of our chats diminished significantly.  I never told him where I live, but he began making references to my house and noting everytime anything changed.

280,"Greetings Reddit (I am on phone so sorry for formatting)

I am 17M (18 in august) Australian who recently moved out of home due to it being an unstable place to live. After years of mental and physical abuse I finally managed to get out. I am currently staying with a family members Ex partner but we are good friends so that is fine.

My parents have always smoked pot but in recent years tried other drugs. Now I also partake in these things and I dont see them as necessarily bad things as I have never let them affect me or those around me negatively. But I do see them as bad things when they do start to affect you and those around you. (Because lets be honest nothing good ever really comes from regular use of drugs) My main turning point for leaving home was discovering my parents were taking crack. This made the abuse much worse and that was the last straw.

I currently live with just one room mate. I dont really have much choice living here as the rent is all I can currently afford. Within the first week of moving in I found out my room mate also smokes crack. At first she said she was doing it for work because she works from 5 am  and doesnt get home till 6 pm But now that corona virus has everyone home, she has still been smoking it and spending a majority of her money on it to the point she is constantly broke, I don’t even understand where she gets all the money for it. 

Now unlike my parents, yes sometimes she gets cranky but she isn’t even comparable to how my parents get. My only concern is that she might end up homeless one day because she doesnt have a good job and shes a high school drop out. Even without the crack she was just making enough to scrape by. She has been addicted before and I can tell shes addicted now. 

But have you ever tried telling someone who smokes crack that.... they shouldn’t smoke crack. Because I have and it never ends well. I care about her well being as she is a good friend but I don’t know how to bring it up without a major confrontation ending in huge conflict as she is a very confrontational person and will argue until she wins.

My partner and I have plans to move into a place together but thats probably not going to be until the end of the year. I don’t know how to bring up my concerns with my room mate if I even should at all. I don’t even really know what advice Im looking for I just haven’t shared this with anyone as I am afraid of how people will view her and myself because I live with her.

285,"I'm currently deciding between two colleges: UNC and Rutgers.

When I found out I got into UNC, I was ecstatic. UNC has been my dream school for as long as I can remember. As a premed hopeful, I was looking forward to their excellent programs and research opportunities. Not to mention the campus is absolutely gorgeous and the social scene is nice.

However, it's 55k a year.

My parents and I agreed it's way too expensive to pursue an undergrad education there. Sure, I could apply for scholarships before fall and while in school, take on a job, possibly do a work-study, be an RA, etc. to mitigate the debt. However, at Rutgers, my in-state school, I'd only be paying 38k.

I want to be a doctor when I'm older, and I am more than willing to push myself through these next 8 years of schooling (and 3 years of residency) to achieve this goal. Attending UNC would be a dream come true, but I know the debt of my undergrad in addition to med school will mean I won't be able to actually ""start"" my life until the age of 30. Granted, I could live frugally and attempt to pay it off sooner; the frugal lifestyle doesn't scare me, but the crippling debt does. I just don't know what to do anymore, and I really just want what's in the best interest of me and my parents, especially theirs considering they have two more kids they're gonna have to send off to college in a few years. I don't want them to have to worry so much about me when they're going to have their own problems on their hands.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things I left out:

\-Wherever I go, I will be responsible for the majority of the debt. My parents agreed to help me, but I made it clear that I do not want to burden them with all of *my* debt.

\-I am a hardworking student who will always try to make opportunities for myself wherever I end up.

\-I was not admitted to Rutgers' Honors College, which is a big reason as to why I would rather not attend. Getting into the Honors College or not was a huge factor in my decision, because in most cases the Honors scholarship covers a large portion of the tuition.",20Apr2020,1
286,"Before current world events upended university systems, I had a plan for how I wanted to finish my last year of university. The plan was as follows: 6 classes this semester, find a 9-5 over the summer, work full time while taking 4 evening classes next semester. 

Well. Current world events forced me to move back into my parents and made me miserable. I'm behind on everything, and I had to drop a class. That's without working.

My concern is that I have no work experience, skills, or recommendations. My major is oversaturated. I don't make a good first impression. I have poor social skills. etc. etc. Point is, my chances are low and I was terrified of not finding a job **before** these events.

Tomorrow I need to register for next semester's classes. If I don't have a job next semester, I'd be better off picking classes I'm interested in rather than the mish-mash of stuff that's offered in the evening.  I have to register tomorrow- all the spots do fill up.

Basically ever since my sister turned 18 she’s been going downhill. She started drinking alcohol and taking drugs obsessively. She is borderline becoming alcoholic and she even admits it. She thinks it’s funny but I’m very worried about her. Recently she’s decided to lose her virginity. She met up with a random on Tinder after talking to him for a couple days. She went to his house without letting anyone know where she was and did the deed. The next week she repeated the same thing with a different guy. The next time, however, the situation got a lot more serious. 

She met up with a new guy and on the first date asked to go to a hotel. They got a hotel and she decided she didn’t want to do it. She wanted to get drunk instead. She said that she thought this was a great opportunity to test and see if he would take advantage of her. I was furious and told her that she got lucky this time but she could’ve been raped. When I said this she claimed that it just hit her but she was giggling. I know for a fact it didn’t hit her hard enough. She also got drunk and decided to see if he would encourage her sending nudes while she was intoxicated. Apparently he took her up on this offer but this didn’t alarm her too much. She is taking no measures to make sure that she’s safe (not talking about sexual safety). She is blindly trusting all these random men.

I’m just worried about her. She’s my sister and I don’t want to see her go down this path. I know that she’s young and teenagers do dumb things but I think this is going too far.

Motherfucker it’s none of your god damn business if I’m going to beat off or shit or watch porn it’s none of their god damn business but they do it constantly. 
Another issue I pay rent but since they pay for the internet and stuff they use it against me as leverage I do something they don’t like boom no internet and they can turn if off while I’m gaming if im too slow to get off. 
Phone- this is big issue because I’m “addicted” to my phone apparently and can’t get off it which isn’t always true   But they had screen time blocks on my phone I got around it  and I’m 24 almost 25 I get treated like a child like why. They also nag me about being on my phone at dinner which is stupid like I eat dinner take my time and enjoy myself because I want to be left the fuck alone sometimes.
Working for parents- I do stuff for my parents for some money mainly errands pick up and deliveries grab lunch sometimes but all I am is a pack mule I feel like.

I hoped this would relive me of some of the pressure, but it just made things worse. I feel alone and desperate: I’m trapped and I put myself there.

300,I have a best friend of 11 years and within the past year or two I noticed her becoming more mean. She will always make snarky comments and will always try to prove shes right over the littlest thing. I would always laugh it off or change the subject the past years because it would only happen once and a while. Now she would say something almost every time I talk to her. It got to the point where I stopped facetiming her and stopped talking to her for weeks. I don’t want to end our friendship but at the same time I feel like every time I talk to her there is something that bothers me afterwards. I would confront her about it but I don’t know what to even say. One of her other friends recently stopped being friends with her and explained to her why but she didn’t understand and hasn’t changed. Kinda just ranting but not sure what I should do. Any advice or input/ your experiences are welcome!,20Apr2020,1

She bids into my business, listens at the door, mentally abuses me all the time and I’m sick of it. I asked her why she won’t give me a lock and she didn’t even give me one single reason other than “there are no locks in this house”. She just said the discussion was closed and offered a consequence if I continue it. So then I said “if there’s no locks in this house, are u gonna take off the front door lock? What abt the bathroom?” She again refused to give me one and to talk to me any further. I am a good kid and both my parents know I don’t hide shit from them. How do I convince her to give me a lock?

302,"My friend group broke apart after i admitted to ""wanting to give it a shot"" with another friend (in the group, lets call her Diana) who secretly (secret from the group) liked me for quite some time now. Our group broke, because unbeknownst to us, apparently, friends are friends, and you should never be of romantic involvement with each other.

oh, and did i mention i was a girl? well yes i am, and that was the first time i ever came out. didnt go as how i expected; things got messy.

Pre-quarantine, i kinda came out as Bisexual by peer pressure to our class--which also kinda meant the whole school 'cause nothing ever not gets out down here.

* peer pressure in the sense that part of the group would treat me more like usual once i told  the class what i was planning on doing--dating Diana. Though i was too much of an emotional coward and stopped right after coming out

and now while still in quarantine, ive done a looot of thinking. idk but whenever i think about me and Diana dating-- i just cringe so badd. i mean ever since i was a kid i always figured i liked girls TOO but when i think of the future, having a home, all that stuff, ive always thought id be with a guy. is this a phase? was i just bi-curious? am i straight?

PLUS, ive never seriously been with anyone until idk Diana if i still manage to pull this off, but i feel so awful and hypocritic. I ruined our group for wanting to give Diana and I a chance, but now im thinking of breaking things off before they get too serious because i dont wanna hurt her anymore. She pretty much was a fan of me for four years now. I dont get it too. i dont deserve itt

am i just scared of all the commitment and expectation that comes with dating? or does Diana and i just not *click* and *this* is my conscience creeping in??",20Apr2020,1
304,"Lately, a long term friend (I'll call her Tracy) I've had has been texting really concerning things to my best friend (I'll call her Sarah) . She has texted very nonchalantly on multiple occasions that she thinks about murder often and has tried to kill her sister once by pouring detergent into her drink, hoping she would die. She has also texted about her insecurity about her weight, although she is very underweight and doesn't eat nearly enough. Tracy has always been an introvert, and doesn't have many friends. I have known her since kindergarten and now we're in high school, although I am in a different country since I moved recently.  My best friend, however, is still in the same school as her. We are both concerned and at a lost at what we should do. We have tried to advise her on this issue, but she is scared of therapy and we're not sure how much longer we can keep talking to her about this. It's very uncomfortable to hear about all this and not be able to help. Her relationship with her family is also not great. Her parents are very strict people who think grades are the most important thing in life, and her sister frequently comments on her insecurities and eggs her on. Tracy does not feel safe or comfortable talking with her parents and has never attempted to do so, even though Sarah and I tell her to have a serious discussion with them. She is so worried that she cannot even ask her parents for more food during dinner because she feels greedy. So far, every time Sarah tries to give her advice, Tracy just leaves the conversation, and then texts again when she has more problems to rant about. The only option that we see now, is to contact the school counselors and we don't even know how much that'll help because the school is shut down. Please offer us your advice, because we don't know how to confront this.",20Apr2020,1

Everything he does makes me angry.  We’ve been through a lot and we were raised completely different. I have a hard time forgiving him for the things he has done, things he has said to me, and things he’s pressured me to do. He dropped out of college twice and works full time at a chicken plant. He’s been handed everything his entire life because his family has money. Mine doesn’t so I’ve had to work for everything I have. I’m a junior in college majoring in business management. I’ve always wanted to be in the military and he knows that; however, now that he knows I’m serious about commissioning as an officer after college, he is completely against it. He says he doesn’t want to wait to have kids. He doesn’t want to move them around their whole lives. He doesn’t want to move out of the state and definitely not across seas. He wants his family to be around to see our kids grow up. Which I get, but it’s not their life. We can visit or so could they. He doesn’t want me to make a career out of the military and I do. Honestly I don’t know what to do. My family is completely supportive of my desire to serve. His family is not. I know he is my family, since we’re married, but he is not supportive. I got cussed out for getting a tattoo. And I got told my face was embarrassing and ruined when I got my nose pierced. “I thought you’d have more respect for yourself!” Wtf Why would I expect him to support me moving him away from his family? Am I the selfish one here because I don’t see what is holding him here when he works at a chicken plant? I feel like we’re on two different paths. And we’ve only been married for 6 months. Don’t get me wrong, this is not to make him sound awful because I know it goes two ways. I’ve never claimed to be a good person,  but I am supportive and I do not judge him.  What am I doing with my life? Any advice on this? We’ve already discussed the fact that I don’t know if could be with him without resentment if  I did not commission in. And he would definitely resent me if I did. I don’t want him to feel like I’ve waisted his life because he is 23 and wants a family. He says he loves me, but honestly I don’t think he knows how to.

312,"When I was 14 I made friends with a girl who I'll call L, I introduced her to my friend group and we all became close. Although we were all a group of good friends, L and I were eachothers best friends and I always felt more of a connection to her. Later when we were all 16 and 17 year olds, one of the girls in our group, J, got into an arguement with me one day about something dumb I cant even remember, and everyone took her side, even L. L still talked to me but I felt like it wasnt the same at all. I saw her and J get closer. I basically lost all my friends because of J. 

J ended up making up rumours about me and even other girls who were just aquaintences at school wouldnt talk to me. I missed out on the last two years of high school and it was really shitty. I had no friends at all. I still dont talk to anyone from that time.

I ended up moving away from my home town to a bigger city and started college. I met a girl who got me involved into some bad situations.. long story short I didnt make any lasting friendships in college. My first job out of college I made a few friends but nobody I felt like I could really trust or feel much of a connection to. 

In summer 2018 I got a message from L. She basically said ""hey OP I just wanted to say I'm really sorry for how I treated you in high school. You were genuinely one of my best friends and one of the best people I knew. You didnt deserve how we acted towards you. I understand if you dont want to write back"" 

I never wrote back because I wasnt sure how I felt at all. I missed her terribly for the first few months when I was a teen but not so much anymore. I miss having a best friend *like* her though. I've recently realized I want to write back and say that I'm sorry too and that I wished things played out differently, and wish her well, and thank her for the apology. Should I do it? It's almost been 2 years, is it too late? Maybe it's stupid but I'm afraid of how she would react. Am I just feeling this because I don't really have any close friends?

I still have a lot of feelings towards her, both anger and love. Though, she has completely changed as to who she use to be. All of a sudden, she's using drugs and drinking heavily, I've heard from other friends that she will invite a few guys over to hang out. A part of my emotions are definitely jealousy, heating about her being with others and what not, but I'm also very concerned for her. She changed so much so fast. 

Should I just continue to live life as if she doesn't exist? How can I move past my emotions?

I thought putting on weight would help make sure he would still want me around. Although I know it certainly didn't hurt, I now know deep down it wasnt a real factor in his decisions. I dont feel like I want to be as fat as I am. At my lowest that I was mentioned I was 170 (5'3"") and still SLIGHTLY chubby. I've inherited my mom's sense bones. She literally sinks in swimming pools. I'm now about 215 lbs and very chunky. My husband has said he would still find me sexy if I lost weight. I dont know if I believe him or not.

Me-me

Hubby-my hubby

Miranda-currently the source of my anger

Bob-dumbass that falls for vaginas

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Very long story about life events, as a child my world was absolute hell. My fathers sixth wife made my life horrible and almost unlivable. She had my father wrapped around her whorish fingers. She had me blamed for things my step-brother did, made up lies, and convinced the rest of my family that I was a liar, a cheat and the neighborhood whore. I was 15 at that [accusation.To](https://accusation.To) add to that she started telling everyone I was suspose to be molesting my younger siblings, yet when I challenged her would not go to the police station to report me. After my father heard her accuse me he told her to knock her shit off or he would put her in her place. That only pissed her off and the accusations became worse. Which in turn made my father beat, steal(money), and degrade me on a daily basis. How I didnt flip and kill them both is because I knew I could have a better life then them. Thoes seven years were the only years I tried to commit suicide several times, failed because I was tired of hurting and I didnt want it to hurt. Growing up I learned how to lie, be sneaky, steal, and manipulate people to get what I wanted no matter if it hurt them or not. After telling myself there was more to life than this, I was finally free. Free to make my own decisions and realizing I didnt want to use the nasty tricks I learned from before. I met my future husband, moved to a different city and we started a new life. Me being always cautious never trusted him fully till the ten year mark. things were good, I started to open up to him about myself, my feelings, and my past and why some things set me off and angered me. Enter FIL's adopted daughter Miranda (not her real name), we befriended each other quickly. She was already pregnant with her first at that time. She seemed really cool to hang out considering I didnt hang out with anyone just my hubbys friends who came over all the time to play MTG. So we started to hang out, not all the time just when I was tired of getting rude comments from hubbys friends (I was never their fucking maid).Started to get tired of his friends bullshit and told him about it. He told me to chill out they were just having fun, but at my expense. Almost left him beacuse I was tired of him not backing me up or standing up for me when they were assholes. He proposed and my dumbass fell for it. Thats when I really started to hang out with her and let off some steam to her about my home life. She always had an answer for every issue. Which brought our friendship closer. After some time she and I got a job at the same place, we goofed off mostly but still did our work. Thats where she met baby daddy number two. A junkie who thought he was always better and smater than everyone at everything. The kind of person that (for a G rated example) if you asked him to buy you a loaf of bread, he would take half and say thats how he got it (for thoes of you who get the pinch refrence). I knew what he wanted the time I hung out with her and she invited everyone over, I also knew she was horrible at taking birth control and didnt really care to remember. Sooner than later shes preggo with baby number two. Near that time I became preggo with my first, scared to death I didnt want to become what I went through in my past. I almost wanted to get an abortion but I wanted to prove more that I was better than my past. I had my baby a boy, I was shocked and still a little scared until I held him for the first time, I knew nothing would stop me from loving and caring for him ever. I felt a joy I never knew, I was so proud of myself, I knew I would do anything, and everything to make his life great. As with Miranda, she had started to leave her baby one at grammys for hourse at a time. Till she had baby two. She always complained about never having enough money to take care of her family, but always had party money. She would leave baby one and two in the care of her adopted dad and his wife for the miminum of six hours at a time, claiming she lost thatck of time, or she got lost or any other stupid reason for not being there when she said she would be there. This carried on for several years until she met Bob. Bob had his own house, had a great job and didnt mind moving her two kids ib ti take care of them. In between her meeting Bob she had pissed of my inlaws with her missing in action act with her kids all the time, along with borrowing money she never paid back. Mind you shes never been off government help since her first pregnacy. When I asked her why she got so much back living with Bob, she said she lied on her application about paying rent. So while still collecting from the government, she was still asking for money from FIL. Flag number one. I started to distance myself from her beacuse thats what my stepmother did, lied about income and when that was questioned, she would have another kid. Rinse and repeat. After having some problems with Bob, she came to me asking for a place to stay beacuse FIL wouldnt let her stay anymore after her constantly leaving her kids there and not coming back for several hours later. So I opened my home to her and her two children I had been made to feel bad for her beacuse apparently Bob had been physically abusing her for some time, I find out waaaay  later thats not the case and the pictures she showed me were self inflicted. He had called the cops on her several times for pointing a gun at him and her psychotic behavior. So with out consulting my hubby I allowed her to move in with us and the discussed time was until she got her own place. A month goes by i'm babysitting her children quite often and for way past time time she said she would be back. When asked why she was gone for so long she confessed she was partying and sleeping with five different guys, two were engadged to be married. I told her she needed to be home with her children beacuse they missed her and that she hadnt paid any rent or other bills. She got angry and said she was an adult and could do whatever she wanted. Until I said find another babysitter, you may live her but I am not going to be forced to watch your kids. Thats when my baby number two was born. My hubby and I decided(I was going nuts alread tired of her BS) to find another place to stay and moved out leaving the utilites on for a week after we moved. She begged us to stay beacuse she was going to be lonely (she needed a babysitter as she had exhausted all other options) and would miss us bad. Hubby ans I moved out I let her borrow half my towles,blankets, sheets, and left her a fridge, stove, ect, ect. With the promise she would return them when she got on her feet again. She was not happy I heard later from MIL that we had abandoned her and left nothing but MIL was no dummy and went over to see everything I had told her I left was there. As it was the utilites were going to be shut off in less than a week so she came over and begged me to have them put in my name. I refused, if your bills were overdue why didnt you pay them. SHe said she didnt have the money so, she called BIL and asked him if he would do it. He did so she was set for a bit. One late evening she came over upset that I wouldnt put the bills in my name, I told her if she ran them up in her name what stops her from running them up in my name( by this point I was already getting tired of her woe is me bullshit). She flipped told me I had to pay her back right away for loaning me her food stamps to get food when we were low on cash. I told her I couldnt and thats the reason whY I couldnt at that time. She called in FIL. FIL for some reason thinks she cant do any wrong and even if she steal directly out of his wallet she is forgiven. He steps in I tell him to fuck off its not his business. He tells hubby. Hubby is pissed I borrowed and paid her back. Come to find out she has been poppin pills and thats her pill money. I cut off all contact for her throwing a fit in my house, I had wondered why her behavior was the way it was now I see why. A couple months go by my hubby and a family friend apply for a job at chrysler. FIL works there, and said he would put in a good word. He did but not for hubby or family friend, turns out Miranda applied and he really worked to get her in and she did.A month goes by FIL is banging on her door waking her up to go to work beacuse shes already been late several times. Turns out she had been up all night thoes nights high as a kite. Her kids kept skipping school, and she never bothered to ask anyone to help them get there mostly because she had already burnt her bridges. She gets fired,then goes to rehab. Kids are sent to baby daddys ones home to be raised. In rehab she hooks up again, preggo with baby number three. I;m asked what I thought, I said I didnt care as long as I wasnt involved in any way and that I was done with her. When asked why I was so heartless I gave a confused look and said arnt you done with her BS too? I get told thats my daughter, and I think, you fool shes going to make you bankrupt. Now every holiday i'm forced to spend time with her, she makes snide remarks about me, my family, and my home. I ignore it. After being ignored for a while she starts in with the physcial when no ones looking as in bumping into me, tripping me when i;m carrying things and even pushing my children at times and always making it look like an accident. When I tell my in laws, i'm that asshole trying to start shit when shes just trying to get her life in order. Heres the main part, the part i'm currently at and unsure how to go. I have a terrible past, and a greivance against Miranda, my hubby blew up at me when I tried to talk abouyt it and said he was tired of hearing about both and why cant I keep the peace. When i've tried to tell him about her actions towards me, he breaks my heart and stands up for her. When I tell him it hurts or try to tell him how I feel about it he uses his logic to make me feel stupid and says its in the past and to give it up. They once had sexual relationship but that was long before he and I met. But now I cant help but be suspicious and feel hurt and betrayed. I left my hometown and everything else to move to a new city with him. I've left toxic family member and gone no contact bcacuse they were against out relationship. Hubby even spoke of divorce if I wouldnt let it go. I'm feeling betrayed, hurt, scared bcacuse I have nothing else but the family I have now, and no where else to go no money i've spent it all on him. Everything I have ever had has gone to my family without regret until now. I dont know what to do as i'm not allowed to share my feeling about her or my past with hubby or the word divorce is said and not by me. I've always been faithful and too my vows long before we were married and never had suspicion about him and her until now. I wonder why I am second best? I've giving him all I can give. Maybe its my lack of wanting sex. Since having baby number 2 my sexual drive and been not there. When we talk its not talking its him berating me for never wanting to do it and him griping that he has needs. I feel horrible and times do force myself to interact, but most of the time i'm turned down and that hurts. He can spend hours touching himself when we plan to have sex and he expects me to be ready and waiting, but when I tell him I might need a little interaction he gets angry and says its all him all the time. I dont know what to do, I'm so emotional I almost want to end myself. Please help me I cant talk to anyone beacuse i've been isolated for many years. I need any advice offered. I dont want to end my marriage but at the same time I want to be able to express my thoughts, fears, and worries without backlash.

319,"I had a hell of a night tonight, and heard from a friend that if I can be more open about my feelings, they'd appreciate it.

Problem is, I'm really not good at doing that.

I'm so not good at it, that I spent 2 weeks excommunicado from social media because of it.

Yeah. Why? I didn't want to effect people with my negative energy.

I also feel I'm not worth the effort as a friend, but again, I'm highly neurotic.

Back to the point, I have some questions.

- How do you know who to talk to first about your feelings? Do you only share your feelings with people you want to be best friends with?
- How do I know if I'm oversharing and theoretically could ruin my friend's perception of me?
- How do I know if I'm undersharing?

321,"Most antivaxxers and other conspiracy theorists straight out push their claims like the law and expects people to believe it, for example '5G causes Covid, WAKE UP PEOPLE' (a comment I literally saw on a post about the Coronavirus pandemic).

Lately though, the amount of backlash has been growing to an unhealthy amount.

Bill Gate's Instagram page is now been blasted by idiots (including celebrities) claiming bullshit like this, while some are actually citing several scholarly articles and journals to support their claims.

I looked these up myself and they do indeed exist( the scientific journal articles). 

I am of two minds here. Right now, I really want to read up on these and point out any misinformation, misunderstandings and whatnot. But most of the science used ( concepts, theories, methods etc) are far beyond my understanding sadly.

On the other hand, I'm ashamed to say that I now have a sense of doubt on my mind. If these scientific journals are making false claims, why publish these at all, if it goes against proper logical scientific consensus? Who peer reviews these and why?

Any suggestions on how I can debunk claims like these?

TL;DR
Any suggestions on how I can refute conspiracy theorists citing scholarly articles that I, unfortunately, cannot clearly understand?",20Apr2020,1

323,"The daughter of my aunt is staying with us during this quarantine. At first she was very shy and did not talk to anyone except my mother. But, in about two weeks, she started stealing stuff.

But I'm not too worried about her stealing food. 

However, last week my collection of rare marble stones worth of $800 disappeared. I was sad, and thought I may have kept it somewhere I can't remember.

Today I talked to her and she instantly brought up my friend I don't talk to anymore. Telling me updates on how his life is going. I asked how her visit with her older son went and she chuckled awkwardly and told me she mentioned me and that she called cause they both wanted to say hi to me.

To the ladies, please don't be offended at all with the content that I am about to write. In fact, I'd love to hear opinion from the ladies more than the guys. 

To start off, I've been in 5 relationships, all of which lasted for about a year or two. Now, we are living in the modern age, in the year 2020 now, and to my belief, everyone is equal, man and woman, we are both equal and have the same rights, or at least that's what I'd always believe, and I still do. Here comes my question, when you get to know a girl, or a guy for that matter, he/she asks you out on a date, now is it always a must for the guy to pay for the first date ? Most would have mixed opinion, but here's mine, I don't mind paying for the first date as it shows the sincerity of the guy, or of course it doesn't have to be that way, as most ladies would actually prefer sharing the bill, but to each their own. 

Now, to ask everyone, what do you think about couples sharing bills in everything they do ? Or do you think a guy should be the one giving and not the girls ? This is a very general question and I know everyone is different based on their character and mindset, but I just like to know some answers in general perception.",20Apr2020,1
334,"The other day we were very short-staffed. I am unsure if it was due to the people who were meant to turn up became unable to come for whatever reason and nobody else who could fill in was able to be found or if there was an error in the rostering.


Either way, only half of us were there, which left the rest of us with double the work. One of my co-workers who isn’t in charge of my area but is a more senior employee in another area came to help us as she often does. She was very frustrated in the lack of help we had and said that we often need extra staff for various other night shifts throughout the week.


She mentioned that the day after (today) we would probably need more staff for the same night shift and the same with all the rest of the Sunday night shifts especially. So, she told me to talk to the person in charge of rostering and tell them that I am available for these shifts and therefore to ask if they wanted/needed me to come. This is the second time she has told me to speak to the rostering manager and let her know of my availability, last time I forgot, this time I haven't done so because I wanted to ask other people's opinions first.


Should I speak to the person in charge of rostering and offer to come/tell them I am available or should I just wait for when I am asked to come? In the past I have often been asked to come and have always said yes when asked, so I don’t want to come off pushy by asking for extra hours because I would like to give the rostering manager the benefit of the doubt that they are capable of rostering people adequately and have everything sorted. However, could me doing so be seen as a sign of me being keen and willing to go the extra mile/help out?


If I do alert them of my availability and offer to come, how should I phrase this? Should I say something along the lines of:

""(Co-worker name) mentioned we sometimes need additional staff for (x and y shifts). I Just wanted to let you know I am free during these times, so if at any time you do need staff to assist with these shifts, I am happy to help.""

(If it makes a difference, my workplace has not really been affected by Covid 19 financially so I don't think the lack of staff is due to finances)",20Apr2020,1

338,"Hi. Due to COVID-19, I'm staying with my family - mother's brother, wife and kids. My cousins are a bit younger than me and also in university. My aunt is handicapped due to multiple strokes and is a very demanding person. She wants things done a certain way and is very stubborn. She also doesn't have much of a filter when it comes to saying what she thinks. 

Since I'm living here since a month, I just don't feel valued. I'm in a different country, away from everyone, struggling with my workload. Due to timezones and work, I am not able to keep in touch with my family back home. I contribute to the house by doing the chores I see and try to pick up chores when my cousins seem to be struggling. I talk to everyone in the house regularly and I honestly do my best given mine and  everyone's mental health currently. And I have been feeling sad. I wanted to get out of here. I didn't understand why since they are nice to me and I have everything I need. I just realized today it's because I don't feel I add any value. 

I helped with dinner today - I'm not the best cook and haven't helped with the cooking part much since everyone eats very different things - one of my cousins is vegetarian, the other is very American and survives on snack, my extremely particular Aunt also can't eat some things because of her health and also likes to eat healthy but again, is extremely fussy. I'm not American but I eat everything and try to ve accommodating at all times - not finishing anything etc. 

So, as you can imagine, i got no appreciation. Which was awesome since these people literally say thank you for every little thing. My aunt ate some and said it's a different style. I asked her if I should modify it and did take her input, but she just smiled and said it's fine. And later, got my cousin to heat it more to thicken it. This is after I asked her multiple times if I should do anything more. 

My uncle involves me in the family decisions and treats me like one of the kids - gives me chores and asks me how I'm doing etc - but he doesn't really know me very well. We talk oftentimes and he's a very different person but I like listening to him. My cousins don't really talk to me much - just polite conversation. I do make an effort but don't really get a response. I feel like such an outsider. 

Today I noticed that ny cousin was really tired and stressed so I tried to help more. I went to her and said 'I noticed you look stressed and tired' where she cut me off and said I don't want to talk about it. I was going to say and said let me know if there are chores I can help with or if I can help 'babysit' my aunt. (She 'likes' having someone around... She doesn't really need to... And mostly wants her daughter even when she has Assignments etc to do).  
This cousin is pretty reserved and therefore I don't ever push her and try to be very accommodating when I talk to her by letting her exit the conversation at any time and not putting pressure on her to talk to me. So it really hurt me when she responded like this. 

I just don't feel valued in this house. Like no one will even care if I'm not there. I feel like a leech. I don't know what to do. I'm aick and tired of trying my best. Many a times I try to do certain chores and it just backfires because it's not the way they do it, which makes me feel horrible and useless.

We text religiously since the day we met despite us being quite different in terms of personality, she’s very girly and has a group of girlfriends and all and me on the other hand I’m more of a tomboy myself, all my friends have always been guys, all that jazz. We’re both straight [question mark].

Ok so enough intro.

Im confused because she treats me in a way that I’m not used to, like I said all my friends are boys and they tend to be less sensitive and affectionate than girls, at least in my experience. She told me once she would hate me being in a relationship because I would “forget her” and constantly compares me to her ex boyfriend ?? Like how he remembered her orders whenever they would go out and she likes to ask me what i would want in places like Starbucks and such, she likes to know what I would choose. One time I made a comment about how I dislike her silk sheets because I don’t like silk sheets later she bought crisp sheets instead to try new things (I guess ?). She tells me all the time how all the boys are chasing me and she thinks all my closes friends secretly like me whenever they are affectionate with me. She told me she is mesmerised whenever she hears me talking my native language and she’s even trying to learn it. We make playlists for each other since we’re both super into music, and one time I mentioned how cute it was that my guy friends told me they listened to my playlists (since they are public in spotify) and they liked them and she went off saying how she’s got them all saved and I don’t say anything but they listen to a couple and I’m all heart-eyed (as if I didn’t make those playlists for her). Overall she’s very affectionate with me in a way that I think it’s different from the way she treats her other girlfriends (and they are as close as we are). One time I asked her if she would date a girl and she was like what about you? and after I said no she said same which is kind of like waiting for my reply first? We are always kind of passive aggressive with each other and idk when it starts becoming like flirty ?? like I’ll joke “who wouldn’t be in love with me” and she’ll says me. She says I’m the most interesting person she has ever met and the smartest and stuff like that which I think resemble like the infatuation we have with someone when we like them ??

Idk maybe I’m overanalysing a basic situation. I just want to clarify this is not meant to be taken as homophobic, I literally wouldn’t mind if she liked me, I love my friend and I just want to understand her better (since I seem to be disappointing her a lot lately and idk why).

345,"This has been a topic for us for a while. Sometime last fall we discussed me moving to Canada, and it sounded fun, but I don't think I put much thought into it. I was just so happy to be happy. Then, things changed and him coming to me was the plan. I was very happy about that. 

But now, its flip flopped again. He has recently graduated and secured a good job. This wouldn't be so difficult if he wasn't a police officer. If he moves here, he will likely have to start at the bottom again. 

Canada is hard to get into. I would have to get a bachelors degree for the easiest access. That's 3 to 4 years away yet for me, for us. He lives in Toronto, Ontario, the fourth biggest city in North America. And he grew up that way. Me, I have always lived out on a quiet little farm in the midwest.

Sure, moving to the big city sounded amazing when I was younger. I'm 23 now, and having visited places like Washington D.C. I don't think I can ever leave for that kind of life. When we talked about it he said we would eventually move, but that of course there won't be anything like what I have up there. 

As a bonus, I have depression, but it is much harsher on me during the winter months. I feel my best during spring and summer, and planned on moving where it was a little warmer year round in the US. This has always been a goal, even before him. We talked about this for a few months, even.

I'm very afraid of undoing all the progress I have made. It's not much, but I'm really making a way for myself. And I don't want to lose...me, again. I can't. I'm scared of myself. 

I think it's really starting to hit me. That I won't be home anymore. And I love him, I do, but just the thought of it makes me cry. Maybe it's me. Stress, paranoia...I was never this upset until now. While we were on call earlier discussing this, I started crying. I hid it well enough he didn't catch on. With the way I grew up, I promised myself a few years ago I would always put myself first. If I move...I'm afraid I may come back. It's so much trouble; lots of planning, money. Waste of his time and mine, when he could find someone else. 

I know things can still change from here. I also know how stupid it sounds to throw away our relationship over something like this. I won't take any actions at the moment. I will give myself time to calm down. I would just sincerely appreciate any input on this. 

I can answer any questions you have if it helps.",20Apr2020,1
346,"My best friend/roommate and I had a really solid relationship formed on strong communication. We are totally on the same wavelength. She was my confidant and the most important person in my life for a long time. I valued our friendship and honestly felt like I did everything I could to physically and emotionally show her that. 

She had some family issues a few months ago that ultimately led her to become really distant. At least I believe this was the start of when things got hard for her, because it was when she stopped communicating with me about her feelings about stuff on the level we did before. She never really hung out in the common area anymore. We barely saw each other it seemed. I would always reach out to her And ask her how she was doing or if she wanted to hang out. I got the same response a lot of the time, which was that she was super depressed and going through something. I wanted to be a good friend, so I gave her space and made sure she knew she had a safe place to talk about her feelings. 

I started noticing that I’d walk into a room and she would leave. We had some really good days but most of the time I felt like I was highly sensitive to her emotions, and constantly walking on eggshells because I didn’t want to say the wrong thing and push her away or hurt her. I just kept reminding her she could talk to me. Eventually I flat out asked her if there was something I did that was causing this distance, because it was hurting me and I wanted to help (even if that meant I had to change something about my behavior). I began internalizing these feelings that I was a bad person, a bad friend, and that she hated me. So I flat out asked her about a month ago. I said that I’m sorry to make this about me, but was it me? She again told me it had nothing to do with me, she was just depressed and having a hard time. 

I wanted to be a good friend. And to me, that meant giving someone the benefit of the doubt when they were struggling even if you weren’t being treated 100% right. However, while I was at work a few days ago she moved out of the house. She sent me a message saying that she couldn’t take being disrespected anymore and that I crossed a her boundaries too many times. That my behavior was disgusting. She ended the friendship and told me she felt uncomfortable and unsafe in her home. This is why she moved out three months early. 

This broke my heart because this person is more important to me than most things. I tried really hard to give her a space to feel comfortable and show her that I cared. I’ve spent the last few days trying to figure out how I hurt her and why she felt this way. I don’t want to invalidate her feelings at all. There must have been something I did if she had such an extreme reaction (moving out of the house). I’m sure the distance between us had her uncomfortable because I definitely was. But genuinely, I don’t understand it.

I maybe made her feel like she had to talk about her feelings, or made her feel guilty by giving her gifts and offering help so much that she felt like she had to return that to me when she wasn’t in the place to do so? Was a boundary crossed because she said she didn’t want to talk and I kept checking in on her every week or two? I never forced her I would just remind her I was here whenever she felt like talking. I care about her so much. I guess I let myself feel bad for so long because if it was me that was going through hard times, I would hope that a friend would be willing to stand by me. 

Again, I don’t want to invalidate her feelings, but I don’t understand it at all. I didn’t do anything that was mean our obviously bad to warrant such a reaction. To call my behavior disgusting and say that it made her feel unsafe. We had an amazing relationship before all of this, genuinely the healthiest friendship I’ve ever had. It feels like she just doesn’t like me for me. Or maybe little things were annoying her and they all just built up. But I wish she would have communicated, especially when I flat out asked her if it was me. I don’t know how to handle this and it’s effecting me so badly that I called out of work all week.",20Apr2020,1

350,"My little brother (10) was telling me today about some of his dreams and one of them he described went like this: he would be sleeping in his bed and everyone else would be as well but he wouldn't be able to move. He would feel a hand on him and he would be being pinned down by something he said looked like bloody Mary. I immediately thought this was sleep paralysis but didn't tell him cause I know a factor that contributes to it is stress.


He has previously multiple times in the middle of the night started screaming and yelling out of no where and once while sleeping with our parents, he started yelling something like ""SHE KILLED ME, SHE KILLED ME"" or ""I'M DEAD/I DIED"" (I don't remember the exact stuff cause I was asleep and my sis told me about it a long time ago) but in the morning when I tried to ask him about it, he said he didn't remember anything like that.

353,"I honestly have no idea who to ask or where to post this, so please send me in the right direction.

My husband, since he was 3, has been having terrible pain every night at midnight. He describes it as “my soul is being ripped from my body” or “my consciousness is being ripped from my body, smashed, crushed, and reformed, then destroyed again, over and over.” It’s happened at the same time every night like clockwork for 20 years. He’s perfectly healthy physically, but has some emotional trauma from his childhood, but it doesn’t explain why he has these pains at the same time every night. They started before he had the trauma. The one time he didn’t have the pain was one night in high school when he heard “a beautiful voice-no, several voices together as one-all speaking so gently and sweetly. They told me to go outside. I didn’t want to go, I just wanted to sleep, but it insisted. I finally went outside and sat down on the lawn. It told me everything was going to be alright and that it wouldn’t hurt anymore. I cried until the sun came up.” He said that the voices were made up of all of his past love interests and I, as well as one less gentle, more hissy, raspy, and impatient voice that he hasn’t identified yet. He hasn’t heard that voice since. He thinks that, if he had kept walking, he would have met the thing that called to him.
I’m not a religious person, I’m agnostic, but I fully believe that this could be something to do with something spiritual or religious. He tried Christianity to see if that would help. He placed his head on the altar and it burned. It left him with a red mark that looked as if it were sunburnt. He walked into the Native American church (one that had been said to have not been maintained in 80 years but still looked perfectly new) and immediately felt as though he was being choked to death. They said he must have been allergic to something in the structure but I’m not sure.
He tried meditation, but had to stop because, while in his subconscious, he said “a [normal grey] wolf grabbed me by the leg and dragged me farther than I was supposed to go. The guy guiding me was lucky to bring me back.” He also described how he played an Xbox horror game where they take your console data and put your name on the tombstone with your birthdate and the current date on it, but he played it on a friend’s console and his birth name appeared, along with his birth date and no current date or cause of death. By no means would the game have been able to get his information.

364,"Well. Tis as the title suggests, I don’t know what is wrong with my mom and I am scared to be around her at times. 

I am a 15 year old guy. I have had a good, if not normal, childhood. My mom and dad loved each other and it was the American Dream, so to speak. When I was around 13 my mom got drunk with me for the first time and it has been a steady down hill from there.

My mom and I were on a vacation in Vegas with my dad staying home for work and the pets. We had a nice time but my mom got super drunk at a restrauunt our second to last night there. My 13 yo ass had to carry her home after calling my dad for help. This was the first time I heard her rale against him. She told me that he would take me from her and that he wanted to ruin her life. I have trouble believing this.

My parents have always been happy, or so I thought, and my dad and I have alwasy had a good relationship. My dad is the nicest guy on the planet, he goes out of his way to help strangers and he always waved at everybody he passes. He has also been nothing but good to my mom since all of this started two years ago. Yet she now mentally abuses him all of the time and I can do nothing to stop it, since he will not stop it himself. 

The next time I remember her getting drunk was around a year ago when her and my dad were out with friends. She came home with him carrying her and she was falling on the floor half of the time, that’s how out of it she was. Later I recall her making me stand there and listen to her while she insulted my dad and he just stood there stunned and tried to tell her to stop. I, however, fought back and yelled at her that I had nothing to do with their bullshit (maybe not the best idea....). Later she threatened him with violence and I remember having to stay up half of the night Bc I was so worried she would hurt him (which she has threatened to do)

Now I must say that it is 4 am here and I am having difficultly remembering the other events that have happened, these are jsut the most prominent three.

Finally, we get to tongijt. My mom had just gotten back from a trip to the beach woth her friends. We were all on the couch and my mom and dad were talking about buying a beach house to rent. My dad said we should wait until the summer to do so Bc of the covid. This sent my mother off. She ranged for minutes about how it doesn’t affect us, and only poorly educated black people (this is soley her opinion, not mine..) and we needed to buy one. Then she went out to the garage with wine and my dad and I wateched TV. Cut to 2 in the god damned morning, I wake up to my mom banging on the fence on the back yard (her spot is below my room window) and screaming. My dad goes out to tell her to stop it and she yells and tells him she hates him etc. then when he gets her inside I’m sitting 5 feet away in the dark with a hammer Bc she is now threatening to murder and torture him Bc she hates him. If this really did happen idk what I would do, but I would do what I had to to protect my dad from her ig. This concludes tongijt so far.

She is normal in the times she is not drinking, but when my dad and I try to do anythinf we agree on it sets her off. For example, my dad and I are both very left and my mom very right politically. If we are having a political discussion my dad and I usualy agree and half of the time this sets my mom off about how my dad is trying to take me from her and she hates him. It’s. Fucing. Mental.

Finally tongiht i texted my dad and told him to leave mom, or I would need to move out when I’m 16 Bc I can not emotionally deal with this bullshit. I feel kinda bad abt texting him this but I think he understand the situation.

I recorded their argument where she threatens his life, so if y’all want a transcription I can give. Any help would be great, thanks. :)

365,"Throwaway because why not.

Trigger warning: depression

The only reason I am alive right now is because of my religion and fear of suffering even more if I die. My depression has been so bad and has gotten exponentially worse since quarantine started. I once again began to utterly despise myself both physically and my personality and am in a constant state of either intense painful sadness or numbness.

But here’s my problem. I downplay everything I feel a lot, if not hide it completely from other people. When I try to communicate how bad I am I make it seem like it’s nothing and it’s something minor but it isn’t. I desperately want to stop hurting because I can’t take it anymore. I’m 16 and have been this way majority if not the entirety of my life. I don’t remember ever being happy. Also my parents/ family don’t believe in meds, so there’s that.

The only way I knew how to show people I was hurting was by cutting myself. But I finally have my own room after previously sharing it with two sisters. If I cut and my mom finds out she said I won’t be allowed in a room by myself anymore and that would make everything so much worse for me. I can’t let that happen. But I desperately need to show people how badly I’m hurting.

I’ve tried and I’ve tried and I’ve tried talking about it but I can’t seem to make it as bad as it actually is. I am also currently in therapy but it’s a new therapist and it began to go okay until quarantine. The phone calls are 100% ineffective for me and I am making 0 progress with it but what can you do.

369,"I have a great life. And I know this post will come across as entitled. But I feel like I am just too deep into a path that I wish I had never started. I could use some objective and realistic advice.

I am 29. I have an amazing wife and two little girls. I am graduating law school next month. I have a great job secured as long as I pass the bar exam (starting salary is $190k + bonuses, and it only goes up from there). Ridiculous. I know. That's about 4x my parents' combined salary when I was growing up. I have worked really hard to get to this point. Practically killing myself for it for the past 10 years.

But I don't want it anymore (not the wife and kids, I want to keep those). In fact, I never really wanted it. I just felt like I was so blessed with so many opportunities that it would be a waste for me not to grow up, work hard, and get rich. And now I'm there, right at the cusp, and I'm dreading it.

There are so many things I would rather do: Army Ranger, Firefighter/Paramedic, High School English Teacher/Wrestling Coach. But I know that if I start this job, I will not have the guts to back out of it. I will be too far in, making too much money, and the logical side of my brain will justify the decision. 

I am almost 30. I know that's not very old, but I feel like I am still past the point where I could follow a dream career. **My wife, by the way, is amazing**. She would support me no matter what I want to do, but I feel foolish and immature just bringing up some of these ideas.

So what should I do? Do I buck up and go to work at a job I dislike for the next 35 years? **I would still be happy**: I have an amazing wife, kids, and extended family. I would be able to spend money on things that I enjoy like woodworking tools and backpacking gear. And I think I could find fulfillment by giving back a lot of my money and skills to my community. But at the same time, I would dread going  to work every day. And I would always have that nagging feeling that I could have been doing what I know I would love instead.

**I wish I could just hit RESET**, jump back 10 years, join the military (still meet my same wife) and follow my dream career. My friends and family think I have it all figured out, but I feel like I am at one of the biggest crossroads in my life, and both paths are completely obscured.

Any advice?",20Apr2020,1
370,"I’ve been kinda friends with this guy for a few years now (I say kinda friends because I don’t like to assume friendship, and we only hang out at his workplace where I am a customer), and I have liked him as more than a friend for a while, but he’s very, very shy, so I can’t tell if he also likes me like that or not.  

He took a very long time to warm up to me (as I said, VERY shy, like wouldn’t look me in the eyes for a very long time kind of shy), but now that he has, we get along great.  We have very similar senses of humor (very vulgar at times), I find him hilarious, kind, caring, and a great guy in general.  Best guy I’ve ever met; I’ve always wanted to know someone like him.  I give him birthday presents (thoughtful, but not over the top), I compliment him all the time, and I have always shown that I like him a lot, because I do!  Now, he is always nice to me, he has stuck up for me/ “protected” me in the past, and he recently gave me a gift with a card saying that I’m a great friend.  This is the first time he has called me a friend after knowing him for years, which I was very excited about because we act like good friends, but due to past friendships I never assume.  Plus I never thought he would actually call me that, since there is a kind of an awkward, “consumer/provider” relationship that we have, which I assume neither of us would want to make that weird by assuming we are more than that; and again he’s SUPER SHY, so I never expected him to make any sort of “move” either romantic or friend related.  He also went from avoiding me around other people to not avoiding me.  He is completely fine and comfortable when we are alone, by the way, but he gets distant in front of his family and good family friends, and strangers, but he’s gotten slightly better about that over time.  His family even helped him pick out the gift he gave me, which was really nice.  I thought he would’ve tried to keep that to himself, so he wouldn’t get teased.  His family loves to tease him about everything. 

Anyway, now that I am in quarantine, I don’t get to see him regularly anymore, I really miss him... I don’t have his number, though I do have a couple of his family member’s, because they all work together, so it’s an easier way for me to contact them if I need to reschedule something, and they like me.  They always said that if I needed anything I could call them, which is super nice.  So I am wondering what to do next.  I’ve known him for years, and I could really see a future with him, if we ever tried, but I don’t want to scare him off or make our “business relationship” awkward.  If he didn’t like me back, I’d be more than willing to let it go, and keep him as a friend, ‘cause if he isn’t “the one” then he isn’t “the one”, that’s fine, but I don’t know what he would do.  I’ve always done things on his terms, and took things extremely slow with our friendship, so should I just keep going as I am and see if something eventually happens?  Should I do anything more to indicate that I like him as more than a friend, when I see him again?

Sorry if this post seems at all disjointed in thought, I am a bit tired when writing this, so my train of thought might not be so steady throughout the post.  Thank you for your advice if you choose to give it!",20Apr2020,1
371,"Hi! This is gonna be long so bare with me

We've been friends for over 2 years. I met him my freshman year of college (I'm currently a junior) and it was clear he was interested in me from the beginning. Long story short, we talked for awhile, eventually kissed (thats the furthest we've gone) and I eventually asked him what his intentions were. He said he didn't want a relationship at the time and we left off on good terms and stayed as good friends. Sophomore year came along and we still stayed as friends and he would ask to hang out here and there but we never did anything physical or anything.

Summer entering this school year, things changed completely. We began to talk a lot through Snap, he would tag me on things on Facebook. Immediately when classes started in August, he asked me to hang out which then became a consistent thing throughout the year. From August to March, he did a lot of things for me such as: asked to hangout a lot more often, always pay for my coffee several times, always try to hold my hand when we hung out, bought me wine, cooked for me (even bought me a steak because I specifically asked for one), asked to hang out in the city and Facetime over winter break. We were at two parties together this year and he stayed by my side the whole time which was unusual because the past two years he would be hooking up with other girls. At one of those parties, I was dancing close with another guy and I knew he got jealous but just didn't say anything. Anyways, he also remembered my birthday and bought me a bottle of wine after I jokingly asked for one. At my party, I got really drunk and was apparently flirting with his friends and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Fast forward to March, our school required all of us to leave because of COVID19. The day before we all left, he asked to hangout with me because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, he pays and holds my hand. Eventually, we go back to my room and we talk for a bit. Eventually, he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I say I'm not good at this physical stuff (By physical I mean like kissing/making out - i have no experience) and he ensures me its fine. I say I'm only comfortable with just the cheek and he just kisses me on the cheek and kind of just makes out with my neck. We then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he's coming too. I dance with my guy friends and then later, I see him hooking up (making out) with another girl. I then got kind of pissed so I find another guy where I eventually sit on his lap and I knew he saw it.

I like him but I'm still confused on whether he wanted a relationship or not but I’m leaning more that he did want one and just started to realize this now.

I know I should’ve asked what his intentions were but I feel like he should be the one making it clear if his intentions from freshman year changed — not me. I'm not sure if I should reach out because I don't know if he still has feelings for me or if he even thinks about everything that has happened. We’ve barely talked since all of this happened (it’s been around a month)

Should I reach out or just move on and wait for someone who’s more mature and has better communication skills? I’m tired of the immature games and not knowing. I’m well aware that I need some growing up to do too and need to work on communicating better

tl;dr: I don’t know this guy wanted to just hookup or wanted an actual relationship. Should I reach out or just move on",20Apr2020,1
372,"I (24M) used to be athletic and was very into sports. I still have my medals from my karate tournaments and trophies from soccer tournaments. Its kind of long, but it helps putting things into perspective.

In the summer of 2011, I did something extremely stupid that resulted in me basically shattering my left wrist. I was abroad and the country in question is/was known for its corruption and the doctor that was supposed to take care of my wrist basically screwed my family over for a sum of money (healthcare isnt free there), botched the surgery and left a piece of bone basically floating around in my wrist (we didnt know at the time of the surgery). He inserted nails where they weren't needed so I had to undergo another surgery to remove them. When we came back home, I noticed that my wrist looked wrong and I would write (am left handed) the pain would become unbearable after a while. Went back to the hospital and there they discovered the floating bone. Right before going to the hospital I received news that I was selected to play in my college's soccer team. When I left the hospital, doctor basically told me that I cant play competitively because my wrist was still fragile. At first, doctors decided to wait and see if the bone was going to reattach on its own. They decided that the best course would be surgery 2 months later. Those 2 months were extremely stressful: it was my first year in college, my injury meant that I couldn't practice the sports I loved and on top of that I was dealing with some personal stuff. When it was time for the surgery, I had gained a lot of weight. When the surgery was done, I stayed in a cast for 6 weeks+4 weeks of physical therapy. At the end of this ordeal, I gained a lot of weight and developped nasty habits. It stayed like that until  2016-2017 when I finally decided to get my shit together and trained hard. I lost all the weight I had gained in a year and was loving it. I loved that I could challenge myself and see the results of my hard work.  I was very close to the goals that I had set. But with the passage of time, I lost the appetite. I found it more and more like a chore. I then started to make excuses for myself. Fast forward to now, I have gained some weight, I am now considered a little overweight. I want to go back to being athletic but I just can't find the motivation. I would love to hear some advice.

374,"(TL;DR below) In my undergrad, I was the delivery boy of the school newspaper and occasional Op-Ed writer. I had a crush on one of the writers, but our friendship grew in a strange pattern. The first thing I did when I met her was make a pun on her name, trying to tease and show confidence, but I realize how childish that was of me. It didn’t damage our friendship, because we actual had our laughing moments and I like to think she respected me. 

The thing that broke me down was that the newspaper members were pretty volatile when they were together. They had that mindset journalists have of engaging in dialogue like a surgeon’s knife, trying to find weak spots in someone to find particular truths. I’m shy by nature, but I can be confident to a point. 

My confidence failed when my crush, the editor in chief, and another writer jeered at me at the same time for borrowing a chair in the club office. I had every right to it, but left and right they made fun of me, saying I should get chairs from another club room
I frequented in. I basically ended it by saying, “Bet you would miss me tomorrow” — delivery day, the only person available to get the paper across campus. 

My crush texted me a long apology. I unfollowed her on Instagram. We act as fellow college students now, but nothing more. I talk with her best friend all the time, but I know he sends my Instagram stories to her once in a while, and he brings her up to me all the time. If I mention any of this to him, he will surely tell her whether I want him to or not. I have no doubt about it.

In the end, though, I want to give my crush a second chance, or rather give US a second chance, to start over. Should I just follow her on IG again and go from there?

TL;DR : I got mad at crush, but I’m not the best person either, and I want our friendship back again but don’t want to look desperate. Should I restore the bridge or let the past go?",20Apr2020,1

I recently joined a new school and things were going really smoothly, made friends, and thought i was generally liked. I moved schools mostly because of my parents, but the summer before joining my new school was the most dreadful and excruciating summer, emotionally. This led to some major trust issues, and alot of insecurities, such as basically thinking no matter how much you think a person cares for you, deep down they think your an annoying piece of trash. Recently, someone who i have got somewhat attached to, (for other reasons), i feel like completely hates me, she said she misses me, we have had so many great times already, but a while ago, we were in a group ft playing around and asking questions, and someone came up with the idea to give each other a letter, and like do this thing ""do you miss a person with the letter s"", ""name a singer with the letter z"". My name starts with an S, nd just minutes before she posted the story, saying ""no i dont like or miss a person with the letter s"" she told me she really missed me and cared about me. I truly dont know what to do, i thought i had found a best friend, but now im just really hurt.",20Apr2020,1
380,"I am an engineering student currently working (from home) as a research assistant at one of the most reputed universities in my country. 

  
I love what I do, but the lockdown has withered me down and I would appreciate any advice on how to deal with this. 

  
Opening my laptop to work, checking my inbox to reply to my advisor, reading a book to relax, or even texting a friend to check up on them - everything scares me. When I start working and I am progressing slowly, I get nervous. When I talk to my advisor (who is very helpful and kind), I get nervous. Even watching a movie or talking to someone makes me nervous, because, given that I am not progressing fast enough, should I not be working harder and not kicking back? 

  
I know this is a very common problem now. I apologize if this has been asked many times before. What I want is to enjoy working again, rather than doing it out of fear. I do make sure to put in at least a couple of hours every day, but that is simply out of anxiety.  

Currently, I am trying to take it slowly, set smaller goals, and see what happens. But I still feel shackled by my fear and I would greatly appreciate any advice to help me out of this rut.",20Apr2020,1
381,"First of all I just want to say that I know what I did was terrible... I’ve never been the person to cheat on exams, but with the online classes going on along  with the other current stresses I’m having to deal with (not going into detail, but family deaths and car problems being stranded) I had an urge to cheat on an online college open note/internet exam (yes I know I shouldn’t even have even needed to cheat). I wasn’t 100% sure about one of the questions, but I thought I knew the answer (which turned out I actually did), and posted the question on Chegg which was answered quickly. I just didn’t want to lose points on a simple tricky worded question. There were 25 multiple choice questions in less than an hour in this engineering class, so I was just freaking out the entire time. I ended up getting a decent score and I was satisfied about it. I didn’t even need to post that question...

Then a couple days after the exam, there was an email to every student in every one of my professor’s classes for this particular subject. It said he knew there was mass cheating about people collaborating in group chats and to confess and you will be looked at more favorably by him and the dean. I didn’t think much of it because I didn’t talk to anyone in chats until his second email a couple days later stating that he’s received more evidence of cheating and stated the rules for the next exam, one of which being you can’t use Chegg (so I assume he saw my post on it) and that he’s reporting everyone suspicious to the academic integrity office. I still didn’t think much of it because I thought there’s no way he could know it’s me. Then I looked at my Chegg post and noticed that my dumbass included the time stamp of when I took the question in the picture. I know that the professor can look at canvas and see when each question was viewed and answered, along with how long it took to answer the question. 

So am I too paranoid that I’m going to get caught? I hate myself for even giving into that temptation, given that I already knew the answer. I never would have if it was in person. Also, it’s been about 2 weeks since the exam took place, does anyone know how long it takes to receive *the* email from the dean? I've felt like crap about this forever now.",20Apr2020,1

384,"Basically I’m being screwed over by a major youth tour company in Australia. I booked my tour in November last year - around $8000 - for a trip in Europe starting in June. It was cancelled due to COVID19

At the time of the booking when I signed and paid the full amount refunds were within your rights within the contract. There was just a cancellation fee of $300

When I requested a refund for my trip I received this back 

‘Given the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 we have been adapting our booking conditions and cancellation policy regularly in response to the evolving nature of the situation. We believe that the remedy of a travel credit voucher with an extended period in which to rebook plus a $AUD 100 additional credit is a reasonable resolution to your cancelled booking in these unprecedented circumstances . The current tour operator and travel industry standard for cancelled tours is to provide customers with a travel credit which is a reasonable remedy in the circumstances. ‘

Putting aside it seems very ethically questionable to do this to your customers at a time like this - are they legally able to do this?

I’m sure a travel credit is okay for some, but speaking for myself, I’ve been stood down from my job and I can’t imagine the borders will be reopen for travel by December 2021 which is when they have advised the credit needs to be used by.

387,"(Xpost to r/weddings, if it matters)

Hi all, looking for some advice. We were meant to be married this month but our big plans were smashed with covid. We were going to still get married with a 5 person wedding (us, one parent each and pastor). I was scared it wasn’t going to be what we planned but ready to give it our all, until my mum smashed it and told me I ‘would never be a bride’ and effectively that it wouldn’t be special on our rebooked date next year. I was devastated by what she said and couldn’t do it. It was the nastiest she has ever been. This has rocked my partner pretty hard emotionally but we’ve been working through it. My mum refuses to apologise for what she has said basically saying she is entitled to her opinions and will ‘support (me) with anything, but can’t help that (she’s) disappointed for (me)’. She hasn’t discussed the issue any further and basically just waxes about how special and perfect I’ll be next year which I chose not to react to, but find infuriating. 

A compromise we have currently come to is a religious ceremony now and legally signing papers next year at what would have been our original wedding plan. Our pastor is happy for this and doesn’t see why it would be a problematic from a religious or legal perspective. Mainly, we’re Christian and us not living together is causing issues. He very much doesn’t want to wait another 12 months and it would cause a slew of financial issues along with causing him mental stress. He also doesn’t want to move in before marriage and I respect that. This is our current compromise to meet both our needs right now, as I can’t do a full legal ceremony and waiting will be detrimental to my partners mental health and our relationship. We’re fine with being honest with anyone who asks saying we had a religious ceremony to move forward in life but look forward to legally marrying with all our friends and family next year. 

The issue I am still concerned about is my mum. I am concerned she’s going to crap on this idea the same she did our last plan and I don’t want it hanging like a dark cloud. If she doesn’t agree, I can realistically imagine that she will come but be mopey and fake happy. She doesn’t see any reason why my partner wouldn’t just move in. I have considered not telling her about a religious ceremony but I think that could potentially cause issues down the track, though there is a chance she’ll never know. 

If this were you how would you handle this? As a side note, I’m starting to become more aware I have a difficult relationship with my mum and am now in the process of therapy to make changes. I’ve been labeled with mild depression and anxiety, along with high stress by my doctor. This is impacting the situation. She’s overly dependent and I have tried my whole life to make choices that please her. Gentle advice please.",20Apr2020,1

Just then she called me and I’ve never heard her so anxious... she thinks it might be because in a few days she has an appointment with a psychiatrist she’s been waiting a couple months for and this might lead to her finally being able to go on HRT and start to transition physically

She’s been really excited to transition though, she said she thinks the anxiety might be because of that and is questioning if this is the wrong thing but she really doesn’t want it to be because she wants to transition so badly and that’s what feels right for her..

390,"So I've (20f) been seeing my psychologist for about a month now. I really do need to be seeing one. I have PTSD, which has caused me to also have anxiety, suicidal ideation, panic attacks, etc.

The worst of it was our first appointment. She directly said to me ""rich people don't have problems."" Direct quote from her. While I no longer consider myself rich, as I'm working as a waitress, living almost paycheck to paycheck, and having to pay for my own education, food, etc. my father did inherit a large amount of money that he unfortunately spent on court cases to get me away from my mom. I used to go to the best private schools and live in a large house. My PTSD largely stems from my father manipulating me into saying my mother raped me. I was not allowed to eat, sleep, drink, or go to school until I said what he wanted to hear. I'd go days without anything to eat or drink and he gave me energy drinks to keep me awake. Yes, he has his own mental disorders. My point is that I grew up wealthy and definitely well off, but you wouldn't guess it looking at me now. And yes, I did in fact have a terrible childhood, and I had many problems.

So I guess we really started out on the wrong foot. But, I did do my best to make every appointment, which my depression does make it difficult to do so. During subsequent appointments though, she did seem very knowledgeable and understanding. I just wanted to make sure that I'm making the right decision in looking for a new psychologist, because I have a tendency to avoid dealing with my issues and to be a bit flaky with things I can convince myself aren't essential. I'm trying to train myself to stick to everything I start, no matter how small, until it is finished. I don't want to take a step backwards, so some advice would be appreciated!

I am a 17 yet still can’t show my emotions correctly. When I am just feeling nothing in a sense everyone seems to think I am mad or sad and it is probably my face but I don’t know what to do. Through text it is even worse 

Through text my girlfriend will always ask “are you mad (frustrated or annoyed or sad)?” when there is no reason for me to be any of those and I rarely get mad at her. IRL people say I have a resting b*tch face but I really can’t do anything about it. I also am apparently very monotone. 

This has become a big problem because it has made any interaction with someone way harder. Everyone says “first impressions are extremely important” but when everyone thinks I am mad or sad it makes it hard for me to interact with people.

402,"Hi all, 

To begin with some background context:

I am a 22M who has just graduated from university (For context I studied Economics and Finance) and am pursuing a career in Finance which is known for highly demanding work in terms of hours etc. I really do have a passion for finance, and am genuinely interested in having a career in finance. 

Contrast to my ""other life"" in which I play a semi-professional level of Rugby Union. I love playing rugby and I do have potential to play at a professional level (Though I am aware of the high-risk, low probability of becoming a professional athlete). I also love playing rugby and it is another passion that I have carried through my childhood to adolescence to now adulthood. 

Throughout university, I had managed to balance both of these priorities to the best of my ability, and although they would often clash (training commitments vs attending classes and finding time to study) and in the last 4 years I have known that the longer I continue to balance these priorities, the more difficult it will become, eventually reaching a critical crossroad.

Enter today. I am currently applying for graduate positions in finance and believe that if I were to receive an offer, it would mean I would have to give up Rugby entirely. I do not want to be forced to quit rugby but I also don't want to sacrifice a career because I waited too long to get into it (Often in finance recruitment begins at the graduate level and if you do not enter the door at this time you tend to get left behind for the next-years cohort and it is incredibly difficult to enter after that).

Has anyone had any experiences like this? If so, what did you do? Is it possible to pursue both? Any advice would be very greatly appreciated.

Thank you.",20Apr2020,1
403,"I’m in need of help; it may seem petty but in my area reputation is a big thing. In an all-boys school, we hang out with people from other all-girls schools. Anyways I fucked up. (16M) A close friend of mine has a TikTok account, and her account is private. Basically only her friends can see her posts on that account. She posted a video of herself on the beach; and me being the teenager I am, saved it. The thing is she only has a handful of guys that can see the video. Few months later, one of her friends tell her that the video that I saved had spread to some guys in my school. The thing is, I sent the videos to around 4 of my friends and they said they didn’t spread it. To sum it up, I technically spread it, but the video got leaked and it wasn’t my fault.

I’m very close with my family, I’ve always spent my time with them, I never even went through the angry teen phase where I didn’t like my parents, I always was the only kid who would sit and watch tv with them.

406,"Two years ago, a girl asked me out. While the first few months were great, it eventually became clear that she wasn't able to handle someone with a lot of baggage. To clarify, my parents beat me and sometimes try to drown me in the bathtub, my sister often ran away from home and sometimes disappeared for days on end and she actively dates pedophiles. She ran away for good recently and no one knows her status at the moment. And my family is dysfunctional enough that I heard of the death of my uncle a year late. I don't think I need to explain further, but I am aware that I'm very hard to be close with since I'm a person with a lot of nasty things on them. Likewise, my now ex-girlfriend broke up with me on pretty rough terms because I'm gross and mentally unstable.

Fastforward to now, and I suddenly get word from my two only friends that she made up a story about sexual harassment, probably for pity points, since a lot of cosplayers on social media have been sharing their #metoo-kinda story lately and she wants in on the pity party hugs. The problem is, I'm the star of her sexual harassment story, and I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything to her. She was the one who asked me, she took the lead in every sexual activity we had, she has a drawer full of adult items that she bought of her own accord and that I didn't have any say in, and she was known for often bragging to others about how she did it with a girl. It was almost as if I was some kind of trophy for her. She also took nudes of me, despite me being very much against it. And while there's enough photo and screenshot proof of everything I mentioned before, the cosplay community is a crowd filled with SJWs and other tumblrinas. Someone who suddenly decides to blurt out they were sexually harassed doesn't need proof; this kind of crowd will eat that all up and do everything to make my life as sour as possible, no matter what I say or show them. 

Apart from that, due to my upbringing I'm incredibly socially inept. I may have a sizeable following online, but I rarely talk to anyone on social media. I just produce content, but am quiet otherwise. When my ex came up with the story, I doubted myself and my two friends who know the full story had to talk me out of believing her lie. I live with the assumption that, if someone says something nasty about me, it must undoubtedly be true, since everyone else matters more than me, and therefore their opinions are always more true than mine. I'm a pretty useless person. And I don't know what to do should she decide to make her story public.

Bonus: if my parents find out about this story, they might try to kill me. It has happened before when a bunch of high school bullies photoshopped my face on pornographic content.

413,"It’s kind of hard to explain,and my head is all over the place. It seems like my friends treat me like a punching bag. I’m a female who typically hangs out in male groups. There isn’t a specific reason for this. It’s just growing up with 3 brothers kind of makes you feel like you get them better I guess. Whenever I seem to talk to my friends they just insult me. When I ask them why me specially they claim it’s cause I’m a girl. I’m just called “ugly,stupid,retarded,whore,bitch” over and over again when I’m in calls with them,and I just try to laugh it off the whole time.I’m used to this after being friends with them for awhile,but after years of this constant teasing it’s getting to me. Maybe it’s just high school boys being high school boys,but it’s hurting me significantly. It seems like I can’t stop them. They know I’m extremely shy and insecure. Comments like “ugly” make me feel like breaking down and crying. I’m extremely fragile. I used to have a boyfriend who I could rely on to make me feel better which I know is extremely unhealthy,but he’s the reason I had confidence. After we broke up my insecurities hit hard. I couldn’t go a day without crying,and yet they still thought it was appropriate to joke about my breakup.I just wanna feel validated for once. Even my family doesn’t seem to support me. It’s always about grades and being the best. My brothers claim their teasing is so I “grow tough skin,” but it’s just made everything worse. I can’t talk to them about anything. I never get any validation. I try so hard,but it feels like nothings ever enough. Despite my all A’s I’ll never be as smart as my older brothers. It seems like no matter what I do I just fail. Nobody’s ever proud. No ones ever there for me. It’s just an opportunity to poke fun at me. I remember trying to open up to them,but they just reply with “L” or some shit like that. I can’t learn to love myself. It’s so hard. Everytime I feel confident I’m just shut down. I don’t wanna lose my friends cause they make me laugh. I feel happy when I’m with them,but I’m not sure if it’s healthy for me to stay with them. I have already discussed with a few of them my insecurities in a serious manner,and in the moment they understand but the next day they continue to practically bully me. I remember so vividly I told them they were basically breaking my confidence and they literally made a meme out of it. It was on the lines of “When we break (my name)’s confidence” and it was just a bunch of guys dancing.Since I know they won’t listen I just resort to bottling up my feelings which I know is unhealthy but I don’t know what to do about it. I just wanna feel loved. I wanna feel like I’m worth something. Are my friends toxic? Is getting rid of them necessary to me feeling better about myself? Sorry if this was all over the place and if it’s just some angsty teen phase. I just really wanted an outlet to get out my feelings.",20Apr2020,1

415,"Swallow my pride again or no

*****So my friend (female) and I (male) have not spoken through text since February. Let me explain. For months (about 6 now or so) she has been doing this thing of texting me for a few days, usual “how are you” thing and such, then leaving me on read, then after almost a month, she hits me up again. So In February she did the same thing but I swallowed my pride and double texted her a day or so later, only to be left on read that very same night after a few texts. So after that day, I just was fed up with the constant circle of texting and being left on read, so when she hit me up in mid March, I did not reply. We have not spoken since, other than 1 time in person which was while we were at work, and it went fine. I’ve been waiting for her to hit me up again since, but nothing has happened. My other friend pointed out that while I know how I feel about all of this, in her POV she does not, and she can’t read my mind so until I tell her she won’t know what’s up. Now I’ve been waiting for her to reach out with anything, and still nothing, and now I don’t know if that’s the right thing to do or to reach out myself. I’m stuck. Help? Opinions?******

Update —- she reached out to me and we had a normal talk about normal life things. For some reason once we started texting, I decided to look at our texts again... looks like I was the one leaving her on read, and I did it because she would take a day or 2 to respond. But once she did, I did not. I feel dumb. All because she didn’t respond with decent timing I kept doing that. It was a good handful of times too. Smh. Now what?",20Apr2020,1

I was also sending nudes to others for comfort and had a very hard relationship with my dad. As I’ve grown older I have gotten over this guy, but I came into a new school where I just felt I didn’t belong and everytime I go there I just feel very depressed. I have gotten into some new issues now where I kind of cheated on my boyfriend where I sent a nude picture to a guy from the internet and I feel so horrible about it now because a the guy online keeps teasing me and jokes to everyone on a discord server about it which makes me very uncomfortable because I have really suffered of guilt and emotional breakdowns because of it and i’ve really tried my best to make for it and i’ve said sorry. I still do self harm and I’m 17, i’ve started to cut on my back and I think a lot about suicide because I also have some trauma from bullying, and a mom who left me when I was a child and other difficulties i’ve stuggled with as a child and I’ve always just been incredibly sad since I was about 9.. I’ve really seeked help and begged for it for a long time now, but it just takes so much of my energy and I’m exhausted and I don’t how to exercice because I have a medical condition in my feet which makes exercice pretty hurtful and that treatment also takes a lot of time to heal and I’ve called numbers, talked to so many about this but nothing seems to help... I don’t have any motivation either and I’m just tired of hearing the same thing over and over again «get help» I just feel hopeless when people say that. I have really just felt very sad, envious, frustrated and misunderstood for a long time of my life and I’ve come to point where I have decided that my due to end my life if anythibg great happens or If I get the help I need is at 21 years old or if I don’t feel better at a new school in the future I’m offically done.

My bf had a day off today, and when he heard the noise he discovered they were using our dryer without permission. When he knocked on their door, they said their dryer wasn't working and they didn't think we would mind if they used ours. I wouldn't have minded if they asked, but they didn't and I think they've been using it for at least a few weeks.

Then my internet has been spotty and my provider isn't doing anything to help. Headache continues and I cannot concentrate much. I then start coughing a bit and muscle aches long with exhaustion. This weekend my allergies were really bad and I had a fever on and off for 2 days while also being cold. 

I learned that tomorrow I have to go into work early since my coworker tested positive for Covid so we have somebody covering for him and I need to provide keys. Finally I feel as if I'm ready to focus on homework. Have to wait for internet to catch on. 

Internet starts and I'm feeling confident for homework. My mom calls me to help her with her something. I tell her that I can't help now because I need to do hw but she could call my brother or I can help her tomorrow/Tuesday (not urgent and I mentioned she could've asked earlier when I was cooking or cleaning). She complains so I set it up but tell her I need to go back to hw. Then she starts saying how she hates her life, wants to kill herself, that she will do it tomorrow, nobody cares about her, it will be my fault etc. Tomorrow also happens to be the day my dad and I go back to work so she will be alone. She tells me in detail what she will do. I tell her that I can't do my hw now and I'll stay there but she kicked me out of her room and slammed door. I break down cause I actually had my ex commit suicide in front of me and this brought back all of those memories. And also cause she told me how much she hates her life and has tried it before. I wake up my father and he has been able to calm her down somewhat but I've lost focus. I was having a panic attack and just remembering everything about my ex (I was blamed for his suicide).

As time went on, she ghosted me and even blocked me on messenger only to find out she’s interested with another guy. We settled, never talked to her again as I tried to move on.

Months passed I received news that she’s been hospitalized, I didn’t mind I think she deserves it(what nice of me). My friends kept telling me to visit her at least but I ignored them. After a few weeks I saw her message at our class group chat that she had surgery twice, for an ulcer and a tumor. At that point I was still reluctant of visiting her. 

A snitch from one of my friends told me she already dumped that guy she’d been dating a few weeks ago(Ah yes a motivation to visit). Few hours later, her friend messaged me telling that she’s in a coma now and her family is asking for prayers.

424,"Long post ahead, TL;DR at the bottom.

My boyfriend and I have been living with my cousin for the past month (ever since we moved down from Maine). Things went well for the first few days, but then my cousin decided to leave a petty note with a list of rules on it stuck to our door while we were out. I was upset that he didn't try to sit down and talk about that sort of thing with us and get our insight, but we got over it pretty quickly since that's not a big enough deal for us to want to move out of a $100 a month deal, especially since my boyfriend and I are both unemployed because of the Coronavirus.

Then, about a week later, my cousin shut off water to the entire house for 3 days without telling us because of an issue with the tubing in the shower. For 3 days we could hardly make actual food, couldn't use the restroom in our own toilet, and couldn't bathe, so we were naturally pretty pissed. I wanted to talk to my cousin about how I felt disrespected since he refused to communicate with us about important things in the household, even though we pay the entirety of his lot rent.

Things smoothed over though, and I thought we were past the petty miscommunications. I was wrong.

Today, my boyfriend and I had to go out to buy groceries, and came home to find that my cousin had been through our room (a dishtowel that had been in there was on the kitchen table). I was pretty upset, since we pay to have privacy in our own room and he could've just asked us to bring out the dishtowel.

I was starting to get over it and feel a bit better, though I was definitely psyching myself up to force him down into a conversation tomorrow (since he usually puts himself in situations where we can't sit down with him and have a discussion when he's home), but then I decided to leave the room and noticed a note fly off of it. 

The note essentially said that he thought our room was too messy (it honestly just has suitcases and boxes from loving that we haven't been able to get rid of), that we needed to contribute to the household and get jobs (in a recession, even though we have the money to pay for a year's worth of his lot rent), and that he felt ""disrespected"" because he didn't like that we didn't do things the exact way he likes them. 

Even though the entire note was pretty much unfounded (he said there were cockroaches in the restroom next to his bedroom that we hardly use, so that must be our fault of course), I still want to try to communicate with him one last time and tell him that my boyfriend and I feel disrespected by the fact that he treats us like children when we pay his rent. However, I'm mostly just scared of saying the wrong thing and offending him somehow.

TL;DR: My roommate/cousin has consistently disrespected my boyfriend and me by treating us like children and not communicating about important issues, even though we pay rent. I'd like help with finding out what to say and how to talk to him without making him act worse.

425,"I've suffered from extreme mental illness for the majority of my life now. Upon meeting me you probably wouldn't suspect anything is ""wrong"" with me but that's because i've perfected my mask so that you'd never be able to tell I was internally losing it. Anyways, i've never really liked myself, ever. Very poor body image issues have effected me deeply that I think turned into deeper things and just eventually turned into pure self hatred. I dont find myself attractive despite having a partner who says otherwise. I cant look in the mirror for too long or else I will hyper fixate on huge problems I have with my appearance that would appear small to someone who isn't me. I dont think I have any redeeming qualities or talents or anything. Before you tell me to try something new that i've never tried, i've done it. That's the thing though before i even go into something new without even thinking my brain is already telling me how awful i'm going to be at said thing. I don't mean to it's just an instant thought because I feel like i'm just being honest with myself. Recently before dropping out of college (which was a very hard decision i had to make especially since recently its playing into a lot of self hate/ disappointment although i decided it was the best decision), my advisor plain out told me that he's sad for me and that he can tell how hard I am on myself, yet show great empathy towards other people's situations no matter how similar they are to mine. I'd never thought of it that way. How easy it is for me to be forgiving and understanding with other people yet with myself I cant even give myself the understanding and love that I give others. With me, if something goes wrong it's instantly my fault and i'm just dumb and useless no matter how small, that's just what I feel programmed to tell myself. But i'd never say those words about someone else or let anyone know that's how i feel about myself. I just have always felt unloved and undeserving of love. I've tried daily affirmations in the mirror when i wake up but just end up feeling silly and even worse than before since I dont believe the words i'm saying and it's like i'm trying to convince myself. I'm actively seeking help with a therapist starting soon, but basically would love some advice on how to slowly start being nicer to myself? and how to start loving and forgiving myself i guess.

428,"So to give a little bit of context to this, I found out about my younger sister’s secret boyfriend while snooping on her phone. I KNOW that it was wrong but she has been acting very down lately and every time I asked her about how she was feeling or ask her more personal questions (like crushes and boys) she always got very defensive saying that “all the boys in my year are gross”. I didn’t believe her because I know she’s not that superficial but I also didn’t push it. 

A couple of weeks later she confessed to having a crush on a boy. I was a little surprised because she was so adamant about not even being attracted to anyone but I tried not to make it weird. So I just said “oh that’s nice, what is he like”. She told me a little about him and that was that. I never asked her annoying questions or teased her about it. Now, I literally found out about this secret relationship about 30 minutes ago because she’s on a walk with my mum and left her phone at home and was getting bombarded with texts from a guy. I was going to mute her phone but I saw that this boy was referring to her as “babe”. 

I was a little concerned but mostly curious so I looked. I know this is very wrong and I feel awful about invading her privacy but this is not the first time something like this has happened. In the fifth grade she got a secret boyfriend and was “dating” him for about 2 months before she slipped up and told my mum. She was 10 at the time so it’s not really boyfriend and girlfriend but it still worries me that she was keeping big secrets like this from so young. 

I don’t want to tell her that I know because the way I found out would make her upset. I just can’t help but be concerned that she is hiding bigger secrets or has developed a lying tendency. I also found out that while they were dating, he would come over to our house while I was at uni and my parents were at work and she had to rush him away before my dad got home because “he’d flip”. 

This is quite distressing for me as my sister is going to lie about future relationships and something bad might happen because of it. It hurts me to know that she doesn’t trust me with these kinds of things but even more so that this boy hurt her feelings and she couldn’t confide in anyone other than friends that she insists she “doesn’t trust and will talk behind her back any chance they get”. Sorry that was very long, if you have any advice or insight on my sister’s situation that would be amazing.",20Apr2020,1
429,"Hello r/advice,

This is a long story about almost a decade long feud and I'm going to try to condense it down the best I can in chronological order. Sorry for the novel.. 

We've been in the same house for just over 20 years and these people were our neighbors when we moved in. Growing up, they were fine people. I'd often get a popcorn ball for Halloween and if I was ever locked out of my house I could always use their phone. The family consisted of the two parents and their 3 sons.

One day (I would guess, one thing I do not have is a detailed record of when all of these events happened) more than 10 years ago, the youngest son died of a drug overdose in his bedroom while the middle brother was also present in the house. he said that he heard him but decided not to go check on him. Make note, we'll come back to this.

Fast forward to maybe 5 or 6 years ago, after a moderate amount of time away from home, the middle son came to visit my mother to chat. He came by to talk with her a few times over the course of about a week. As a teenager I wasn't very interested in what my mom was doing to socialize and I trusted the family so I never really put my guard up. It turned out that he was coming to visit my mom to tell her about his time living out of town in another province (I live in Canada by the way) and the business deals and investments that he was allegedly making. It was after all that exposition that he offered my mom the ""opportunity"" to get some money. all he needed was about $10,000 and he could double or triple it or something. The entire thing turned out to be a pack of lies and well he actually just took the money and ran.

We talked to his parents who were rather apathetic about the whole situation and offered that we take all the new clothes he had bought that week presumably with my mother's money. The situation escalated and we had a couple run ins with the middle brother and despite our best efforts we couldn't extract any compensation from either him or his family. He moved away a short time after, i suspect it was still somewhere in town though. We weren't able to pursue any legal matters because in Canada this is an issue for small claims court and the cost of the whole process would have probably been another $10,000 taking into account legal fees. 

Maybe a year or two later (because he's a loser) he moved back in with his parents but made himself scarce during the day so as not to have any encounters with myself or the rest of my family.

Anyway the parents of that sick individual during this entire time (I was going to university so I moved away) took to making my mother uncomfortable as a pastime. If my mom was ever in the yard doing some work they would sit on their deck and glare at her, they would also sometimes verbally criticize her as well. The husband states at my mom like she's a piece of meat. Real nice folk.

So my time at university has finished and I moved back home with my mom the beginning of this year. We own a 2 year old pit bull with energy enough to probably power a small car and the strength to match. Although she plays rough she wouldn't hurt a fly and is one of the sweetest dogs I've ever met. This dog means the world to my mom and I but she has this small problem of barking a lot and it is rather loud. We're working on it.. 

So this most recent development is that despite quarantine procedures, despite common sense even, their oldest son comes over to visit often, with their 2 or 3 little girls and what do they do but jump around and yell and scream in the backyard. These poor children seem to have been encouraged to antagonize our dog and just today I was able to discreetly listen to what these kids are screaming and they confirmed my suspicion that they are deliberately calling my dogs name and standing right next to the fence that separates out properties. Their father of course walks out in the backyard with them and plays dumb about the whole situation. So we're forced to keep our dog indoors for hours at a time so she doesn't start to bark and get over excited.


Please people of reddit, you've never failed me before what can I possibly do about this situation? we just want to live and let live and these horrible parasites seem set on keeping that from happening. This situation is terrible for my mental health let alone my mother's who they've been much worse to. The money is long gone and I doubt anyone in this family will have a change of heart anytime soon but the hatred and disgust I feel towards them every time I am reminded about their existence scares me. If I could I would beat their son to a bloody pulp or worse for how he has treated my mother and I often debate vandalizing parts of their property like they have ours, but im afraid they'll use it to their advantage and take legal action against me or my mom. 


By the way you may have guessed what I'm going to say but going back to the third paragraph I'd like to add a couple of my own suspicions. Firstly the middle brother was into drugs before the youngest was and it isn't a stretch to guess that he may have provided them to his younger brother. Secondly, im not sure what drugs they were doing or how long it took him to die from the overdose but these two not only lived in the same house at the time but also both in the basement. I believe judging by what I know of this individuals character that he may have been aware of his brothers distress and ignored it. This man appears to me to be a highly dangerous sociopath and I want to avoid direct conflict with him. This bastard still lives next to us and I would be lying if i said I wasn't often concerned for the safety and wellbeing of my dog and my mom.

Please guys I need your help.",20Apr2020,1
430,"Hello everyone, I'll try to make this short.

I live with my partner sice almost 3 years and he is everything one could wish from a best friend, lover and team mate. He is supportive, trusting, sincere, funny and loving. I've never felt that loved before and I am aware that I'm one of the few fortunate people who feel that way. 

Now, I'd never do anything to purposely hurt him. My previous relationships have been tough and abusive and I've never talked in my sleep. With him though I started saying insulting stuff ( very much so!!) during my sleep after not even 6 months of relationship.

I compare him to my exes which were all pieces of shit, saying that they were so much better. I say horrible things that are not worth repeating and every time I wake up I see my boyfriend's face and I realize that I've crushed his heart again. 

It must be terribly painful hearing those things and not being able to address them cause, of course, I'm asleep and in the morning I do not remember a single thing. 

I've thought already of going to therapy and actually seeing what's the cause of this problem. It doesn't happen every single night, but when it does happen it is soul crushing.

432,Im 320 lbs and only 15. I would make excuses that it's not my fault because when I was around 6 I wanna say my mom woupd stress eat because my dad was abussive. To make her feel better I would sit and eat with her to give her company. I was becoming chubby decently fast. Until the 5th grade I didn't really notice I was big. I had smell problems. I never smelled or noticed anything but other kids would. Even once in P.E. I was told to carry a letter to the nurse and so I was excited. When I got there the note was about how bad i smelled and it would bother other kids. My mom and step dad were pretty embarrassed about it. After that I stopped being social because I thought everyone thought I was being weird and the smell thing. So I became extremely aware of my size but I never did anything about it. I guess you could say I was depressed be starting at 5th grade. This continued until 6th grade when I fixed the smell problem.l but I was still gaining weight. In 7th grade my dad came back into my life. My big brother went with him when I was in the 5th grade because he thought he changed. Since my brother was with him it convinced me to run away with him and my brother. I was also convinced because he had lots of money. I was curious about not hearing my parents argue about rent money and having it easy. While I was over there my dad had me do Brazillian Ju Jitsue and the one week I was with him I lost 20 pounds. I was motivated to work out for once in my life. After that first week I was taking back by the police. I lost the motivation I had to lose weight. Im in the 9th grade now and all I do is play rocket league and apex. I tell myself now I im not motivated because I would'nt say I get  bullied but not treated equal as other kids and because of that im depressed and don't want to work out. Im realizing now thats bullshit. Those are all just excuses to be lazy. I need advice on how to make myself really want to work out. Every time I go to the bathroom I can't look in the mirror. I hate to see myself or my fat. I need to find something to help me want to work out but I just don't know. Can anybody please help me or tell some workouts that'll be the best for me? Please.,20Apr2020,1
433,"My friend and I have been very good friends for almost a year now and we are to the point where we are best friends. She confides in me with every problem she has, I see her every day, and we are very transparent with each other. We joke about sexual things and we've jokingly kissed and whatnot, but recently I think I've been getting hung up over her. It sucks because I know the type of guys she enjoys and they're the complete opposite of me, and I'm not sure if I really would ever pursue anything with her because I don't want to ruin our friendship. I would love to be the way we are now without developing any sort of feelings for her, but I have no clue how to stop myself from having feelings for her. What should I do?",20Apr2020,1

438,"I'm a male in my early 20s. This is something I've been sitting on for the past decade or so, and I haven't really pursued the chain of thought till recently, but it has affected me a lot. A little long, so I apologize. 

I didn't have the best childhood growing up, and have struggled with a lot of depression and anxiety, but I've done fairly well in life and am among the best in the country at what I do, as well as having a solid academic career alongside it, and obviously my whole life is ahead of me. I've also been very good to and with people and don't really struggle to socialize, even though I can be anxious(but I cover it up well). But I've always really struggled with physical intimacy, which includes even hugs with friends, especially women. But this isn't due to the fact that I'm weird around them, in fact I'm very comfortable with all genders and gender identities and I'm very comfortable company for everyone too. I struggle because during my childhood, a certain elder woman in my family who obviously I lived with(and still do sometimes) often touched me and groped at me in sensitive areas, which I found uncomfortable. There was also kissing, which after a stage I did find uncomfortable, especially on the lips. There was also sometimes a major lack of privacy when I was changing, which also I didn't feel entirely comfortable with. Maybe a lot of it was considered normal for kids and elders, but it made me very uncomfortable, and as a result I progressively became very uncomfortable with physical touch, and became very conscious of my body. It may be distorted memories, but I also don't remember my sister's boundaries about this being floundered as much as mine. 

It also continued into an age where it definitely became weird, and then obviously it stopped when I got on the later side of my teen years. I've never had a very comfortable relationship with my family, and they've been abusive emotionally and physically at times, and it's been very up and down, so I never thought overly about this in particular. But recently I was thinking about exactly why I struggle with intimacy and why physical touch is hard for me, and it set off this chain of thought and brought these memories to the fore.

 I don't necessarily think that the intention behind these actions was ever untoward, or beyond simple affection, but it made me very uncomfortable and conscious and affected me subconsciously. And now that I sort of went back to it and looked at it more clearly and the effect it had on me, it's driven me mad. I feel violated, exposed and just so uncomfortable. But on a different tangent I also feel guilty and dramatic and really really WEAK for letting something that was likely harmless affect me this way and make me so uncomfortable. I don't know what to do, and I don't know what to make of it. I don't know how to deal it or how to classify it? Guys was I sexually abused, even though it wasn't necessarily intended to be sexual? How do I deal with this? Am I being dramatic?",20Apr2020,1

I said to help herself and I saw her in the garden a few times since then. She lives a little way down the street, not directly next door.

I just bumped into her and she was quite upset, saying she’d just been accused of shoplifting because of the colour of her skin. I am ABSOLUTELY not doubting that she has experienced a lot of racist treatment since moving to England, and that it could well have contributed to this incident, but also I think her eccentricity played a part. It’s still not on. She said she took some empty bottles to the shop to remind herself which ones to buy, and she had them in the basket, and at the checkout they charged her for them and wouldn’t give her the new bottles ‘because she already had two’ and there’s an ‘only 2 items’ rule here.

I had the thought of pulling up some of my mint and giving it to her in a pot. But then I realised maybe that’s an anti-gift, because she’s currently helping herself to loads of mint, but being given a small pot could be taken as a signal to have only this small amount of mint, and stop coming to the garden?

My sister has been bullied in school unfortunately.  She was and still is very beautiful but she wasnt a follower. she did what she believed was right. She never joined the bullies when they wanted her to join. So they bullied her instead. It was very bad and I feel like she still hasn't recovered from this. The Main Bully ended up being her Bestfriend in college . Ever since she been with her she started using drugs, got involved in heavy drinking etc...I warned her that that friendship is not starting on a good note and that she cant trust someone who bullied her mostly at school. She rejected all my warnings..we even stopped talking for a year because she hated me for trying to save her from pain.

What happened shortly after this? Her bestfriend betrayed her worst way possible..slept with my sisters waste of space boyfriend. That's when my sister realised the friendship is over..she never made any amends toward me for rejecting me all these years. She has turned very stone cold instead..we live in separate countries and she hardly makes the effort to visit unless there is a big event like a concert or similar. She hardly has a relationship with her nephews. She abused my mother who she still lives with. She steals from her, shouts at her etc.. I truly believe she is a narcissist that urgently needs therapy.

453,"Okay the title sounds weird, hear me out. I love my girlfriend to bits but she’s trying to take up this mother/caregiver personality type that is just super accepting and never crosses a boundary and yknow. Like it doesn’t sound bad but it’s getting to the point that her mental health is getting bad from it.

She wants it be this source of undying wisdom and love but she doesn’t realise that her friends are toxic if they’re the only one that benefits from the relationship.

Like we were just talking and then she called me and was crying so I was like “oh no! what’s wrong?!” And she said that she’s really overwhelmed because she’s playing therapist for three people and it’s getting too much. I told her that she needs to tell her friends that and she said that they only talk about their problems to her and it’s just a big pool of depression and negativity. They don’t do anything good for her, I get that they have their own problems but it’s a REALLY toxic friendship if only one person benefits and the other feels sad and weird after talking.

BUT MY GF DOESNT LISTEN! She says that she “has” to look after them. No, you don’t. If their well-being is so reliant upon one person, who is in no way a licensed therapist, then they have a problem and can’t do that. They say they’re friends but friends don’t only talk about themselves while the other is getting worse. Friends look out for each other, they listen to BOTH persons problems. Not just one persons. 

But nooo my gf is adamant that it’s a perfectly healthy relationship and that she has to make up for how mean she was two years ago. That ain’t it sis. She apologised and clearly has changed her mindset, that’s the most she can do since she can’t change the past. She’s literally feeding the same bad habits she had into her “friends” by wanting to play this therapist caregiver support beam role.

I’ve tried telling her this but she doesn’t listen and just goes “lol but I have to make up for two years ago” or “but I have to look after my friends!!!” I’m so close to just getting really mad at her. But that wouldn’t do anything and is kinda mmm so yeah.

I know this isn’t very important and there’s girl code and shit and that’s like  your friends go before boys and if your friends don’t like ur man then u break up with him... but what if your boyfriend doesn’t like your friends? Suddenly I’m just an obsessive asshole! Her friends are toxic as fuck. She doesn’t benefit from the relationships but apparently they “need” her. THATS TOXIC. AND UNHEALTHY. And I just get really bad vibes from one of them. So idk what to say to her because she isn’t listening to me when I’m actually giving her solid advice.

I’m not saying she has to stop being friends with them, but like discuss boundaries and that she has feelings too and that sometimes hearing every terrible little detail of every day while not getting to say anything back is making her personal mental health decline. Yknow? Idk man",20Apr2020,1

Last night, I got extremely bored. Went on Whisper on my phone, and posed as a 16 year old girl, and got a hit almost immediately. 
I stated almost instantly I was 16, and him 24, and he can get in trouble for talking to me. He said he was fine with it if I didn’t tell. 
He then demands to see nude photos of me, I deny, but send him my thighs to get his attention. 
I did not initiate this conversation; he brought up sexual acts first, I did not say I was a cop at any point so I can’t be hit with that. 
I almost wanted to demand $ or I’d send his info to the police, but decided against it due to legality issues. 

What I’m asking for advice on is this: This man said he lives in Canada, (I’m in the US), sent sexually explicit convos and photos to a girl he believes is 16, not 22. 
What can I do to take this creep to justice and remain within the law?
I’ve looked into local laws, and until I extort money or pose as an officer, I should be fine. Arizona, if that helps. 

NOTICE: I am not going to r/LegalAdvice with this because I’m not askin for legal advice, but I will possibly cross post this to widen my horizons. I’m asking what I can do with this info, or if I should just drop a meme and scare him off with the new pedobaiting warning notice.

459,"Hi reddit!

I'm a big dumb idiot on an anonymous throwaway to ask a question. 

I recently (within the hour) made the mistake of trusting someone on Kik to be sexually intimate with. That person quickly turned around using this content to try and blackmail me. For obvious reasons I am scared out of my mind and don't know what to do. The current important details are:

1. They only know my first name, because the messaging account was a throwaway too.

2. They haven't threatened to show family or friends because the throwaway is not linked to any of my social media or my full name.

3. They are threatening to post the photos on the Ellen DeGeneres page and other major Instagram pages because they don't have direct connections to me

4. They believe that I only work in cash and that I don't have a bank account or digital payment methods like paypal or cashapp. (I showed them a special savings envelope with $100's in it)

5. They are instead asking me to get a moneygram when stores open and they will ""tell me where to send it when I get there.""

Realistically, aside from the photos, my privacy is on lock, but I am currently changing passwords and 2FA'ing everything I can and revisiting privacy settings to be safe. I reported the account messaging me to Kik, but that won't do much. I made the mistake of removing the app before screenshotting the exchange, but i delayed some time telling them I have to work tomorrow and can't make it to the stores before they close because of quarantine restrictions but they are still insistent. They are giving me that time so I have ""in theory"" 24 hours to pay them.

How worried should I be? I understand those photos aren't going to disappear, but what steps can/should I take to manage this? I tried to call a hotline number i found, but it also kinda sounded like a scam...they were asking $900-$1500 to ""monitor social media for me."" which doesn't make sense.

She got this status from being a local soccer coach and is all over our local newspapers. I can disclose links because legally she’s on Megan’s Law anyways. So, basically, I had no idea and she manipulated me, and physically and emotionally abused me until it was too late to tell anyone.

Our state laws state that anyone who leaves her in the presence of a child, etc. can be arrested.

464,"I have been in a long distance relationship with my bf for over a year now. Before becoming official, I knew about his sexual past. I was his first girlfriend when he was 29 years old (last year). He has always told me I’m the first woman he’s ever loved and that he still does, of course. He has a high body count and his sexual past is one of many one night stands (meeting women at bars/clubs/parties) and friends with benefits.

I, on the other hand, grew up very religious. I was very religious all throughout college too and never dated. I also vowed to keep my virginity for marriage. 

After graduating college, I deconverted and eventually met him and lost my virginity to him. The experience was amazing and special for both of us. He truly made love to me and he also said it was his first time ever making love to someone, because he had never loved anyone before. 

Unfortunately, I cannot seem to “get over” or accept his past. I’ve been getting a lot of consistent therapy for it too, but nothing seems to be working. 

I suspect I have a lot of resentment towards him because I felt like I really did my best to “wait” for the perfect man, the right man, suppressing my own desires and denying opportunities, whereas he had spent his youthful years partying away, indulging in pleasure, being with multiple women, etc. 

It just hurts. It hurts to imagine him with so many other women, being intimidate with so many others, while I had painstakingly “saved” myself all those years. Yes, I was saving for marriage and even though I deconverted, I still chose to lose my virginity to someone who I thought was worth it. I did that, while he was sleeping with tons of “random, cheap one night floozies” (his words, not mine!) 

I want to make it clear that he has changed in recent years. That lifestyle is one of his past, years ago, and he says he doesn’t want to go back to that “meaningless” lifestyle and that it got boring. He also told me “once you make love, you don’t want to go back to f*cking.” 

I trust my partner 100% and I know he only has eyes for me and that he’s absolutely loyal. He calls me his “first love” and proves it through his actions. I know he wants to spend the rest of his life with me and have kids with me, etc. 

However I still just can’t get over his past and it consumes me. I told my therapist “I feel like he’s gotten it out of his system and he’s ready to settle down, whereas I haven’t gotten it out of my system and I’m not ready to settle down.” 

I feel resentment because I feel like I missed out. I didn’t experience the whole party scene. I haven’t been with multiple men and built “experience.” I haven’t gotten it out of my system. 

Also being long distance seems to fuel the resentment more. When I’m actually with my partner physically, I don’t think about his past women or lifestyle. I’m with him in the present moment and I enjoy building memories with him, especially intimate memories, because I feel like I’m overriding his past. 

However when we are apart, that’s when my anxiety and resentment comes back. 

Tldr: I can’t get over my boyfriend’s promiscuous past, whereas I have lost my virginity to him. I know he’s faithful and I know he loves me and I know he wants to settle down with me/commit to me for the rest of his life, but I’m not in the same boat. I just have more and more resentment growing underneath. Is this a valid reason to break up...? Is my reaction unjustified / overreacting?",20Apr2020,1
465,"Hi! Please don’t judge me, i already judge myself enough. 

So in my teens i used to fall into the gore rabbithole every now and then, just out of curiosity, never anything really fucked up (ha!), no torture, no animals, just people getting shot/ suicide/ isis stuff. I know this is really weird but i feel like at some point everybody watched stuff like that and i was really just curious. 
My OCD is making me question my reaction though. I always got excited, not positively, i got hot, i felt sick and disturbed , thinking about it now makes me think it was anxiety. But i also got  this weird tingle in my lower regions, less than sexual arousal, i never even saw it in a sexual context. It has just always been my reaction to watching something i knew i shouldn’t be watching. Now, diagnosed with ocd i‘d compare it to a groinal response but i didn’t have ocd back then.

Why does my body act this way? Is this a normal reaction? I’m kinda sure it is but I‘m really panicking i might be all sorts of fucked up.",20Apr2020,1

470,"Long story short, my Sister loves to put the blame on me for everything, my Mother thinks only her way is correct and berates me if I do things my way, even if my way is right. I can’t talkback because doing so is deemed ‘rude’ and even if I do, they will think that they are right because I’m young and don’t know better despite me being 18 this year. I live in a very old school Asian family where the parents and elders are treated as gods and flawless beings and thus, I’ve been holding in my emotions and always feel useless despite doing what I can and despite friends telling me I’m alright, I can’t shake the inferiority feeling I constantly have. But I think it’s starting to blow up. Thanks to the quarantine, everyone is in the same house and I’ve been called to do menial task such as grabbing a chair not even a meter away. My Sister calls me in such an obnoxious voice and tone that my own name makes me very frustrated and angry, every time I’m asked something simple like the price of an item, I get frustrated because my Sister keeps pressuring me to give a response in a span of 5 seconds. This has never happened before, back then I used to calmly tell her to wait but now, I feel like I’m losing control and I’m afraid of lashing out.

Due to coronavirus lockdown, I can't have acess to any health care facility where I could get an abortion, I've asked probably everywhere, and even so, even in regular times most people in that situation go to a neighbor country to do so because it's very hard to find information about it here, in most facilities you can't even do so and in those you can it's hard to find non judgemental people that will do it. I feel pretty helpless because I fear I'll have to be obligated to carry on with the pregnancy even though I definitely don't want to, my boyfriend and I are both students and don't have enough money to sustain another person right now, the place we live in isn't suitable for a baby, either way one of us, or both of us has to give up college (which I worked so hard for) and work and who knows how hard stuff will be economically after the epidemic is over. We have problems in our relationship anyway, it really isn't going well lately, I wanted to leave recently (but obviously couldn't) so basically I feel so sad about the situation. I feel trapped, I feel Iike I will lose my freedom, lose control over my body, have to deal with a situation I don't want to, my whole life will have to change in the way I don't want to, and I don't want to stay with my boyfriend just because of the baby because who knows how long we would last on our own. He doesn't understand how I'm feeling, isn't realistic about the situation and he even guilt trips me because I'm not feeling happy about the pregnancy while I said so many times beforehand that's not what I want and did all from my part to not let that happen. It's kinda a toxic situation. Currently I I can't even visit my family and friends because I got stuck in this city with him due to college and lockdown. I can't talk to anyone about it. I can't even get a regular check up because hospitals only let you in if it's an emergency, private clinics aren't working. Does anyone have any advice in what I could do?

474,"I don't know how to summarize this but I will try my best. My best friend was broken up with and ghosted by her boyfriend (another friend of mine but not anymore as he ghosted everyone - not that I care). My best friend who I consider a brother introduced me to her and said she was like a sister to him. Me and her had a connection I never experienced with anyone before and we hit it off right from the start. I was moving away for college and knew me and her were not going to happen so I took my shot either way and asked her out but she shot me down saying she wasn't looking for a relationship as she recently got out of a toxic one. My former friend (her ex) clearly liked her and I didn't want to be competing with him over someone I had just met. Looking back at it, I don't regret anything more than letting her go and telling him I was okay with them dating even though it hurt. Over the last 9 months we built a friendship and we got extremely close. Regardless of what I may have told her (that I didn't have feelings at the time), it still hurt a little because my feelings never went away and knowing what I gave up so easily on made it worse. But I pushed through and tried my best to be happy for my friends. One day he decides to break up (for irrelevant reasons) and left never to be heard from again apart from his online status (at least he isn't dead). I was always there for her before and after the break up and seeing her at her worst broke me but it never made me want to leave and all I wanted to do was stay there for her. After that, me and her were never closer than before. She told me things no one knew and I wanted to do the same but I have a problem with opening up (from past trauma). I knew then I was in love with this girl and that I would do anything to see her happy and thriving. Past forward 2 months and we are quarantined so we mostly talk in our group of friends (including her friend and my bestfriend/brother who introduced me to her). A fight broke out due to my problem of not opening up (which they saw as a sign that I don't appreciate them when it is just a problem that I have). I lost my temper and shouted at her (misdirected anger I was more angry with him) and realized it when it was too late that I fucked up. We were never the same since and both of them got closer then. To clarify they have known each other for 11 years so in comparison I was just a guy she knew for 8 months. She repeatedly said it felt like we have known each as long as they did but he did not appreciate that and she realized after what I did that maybe we don't know each other that well. Currently everyday, I am forced to sit on call and see them interact the same way me and her did and pretend it doesn't bother me for their sake and knowing I made it that way by fucking up makes it unbearable. I don't know what to do or how to deal with my feelings without causing another fight. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: best friends with a girl my friend/brother introduced me to (never really lost feelings since I met her). Her ex (my former friend) broke up and ghosted and I was there for her before and after. Fell in love with the amazing person she is inside and out and stuck to her and we both got closer than ever. A huge fight broke out with her, me, friend/brother where I fucked up and shouted (which hurt her since she never expected it from me). Me and her are not the same anymore and both of them are close while I sit there and watch because they have known each other for longer.

482,"Okay so here’s how this started. I’m very afraid of spiders, like full blown anxiety attack when I get near them afraid. 

Tonight there was a spider in my room, up on the wall close to the ceiling; a fairly large spider I might add. I asked my mom to kill it and she laughed and told me to grow some balls. She gave me a long duster to kill it but I couldn’t get close enough without crying even with that tool. Mind you it’s like 7 feet long. I ended up grabbing everything I could that wasn’t on the side of the room the spider is on; all that turned out to be was my phone and my blankets and pillows. I’m now currently sitting in the living room and it is 3am. I can’t go back in that room, I can’t sleep in there knowing it’s still alive in there, I will freak the fuck out and have a panic attack. 

The advice I’m asking for is how do I better explain it to my mom? I think she just looks at it like I’m afraid, which is not what is happening. I’m afraid of bees, but I don’t have an anxiety attack melt down when one comes near me, I just move away. When I see spiders and get too close (like when trying to kill them) I will have an anxiety attack and I just can’t do it. It makes me feel stupid and childish when she says thing like “just grow a pair”. If it were that easy I would, but it’s not. I can’t even touch the tissue paper of an already dead spider, nor could I kill a spider with a wad of toilet paper, it’s too close. I don’t know how to explain the feeling to her, I don’t know if she has any phobias.

He's cheerful, always smiling, always joking around and rarely gets angry. When the whole squad is down he would do stupid sh*t just to make us laugh, he even told me,and I quote, ""I would always try my best to make you guys laugh when you're down, even if I have to sacrifice my dignity"", end quote. 
Now here's where the story starts,
A month ago, he invited us to hang out in his house, so we did. We just played some video games, played instruments, talked about the future especially since we're nearing college and all that.

We hung out till 7pm, and by 7:15 pm we all decided to go home, but I decided to stay put to help him clean the place.

After said cleaning, I told him that I was about to head home, he then suddenly told me to come to his room for a while since he wanted to talk about something, so just before I was about to leave, I went to his room with him.

He told me to sit beside him in his bed, with a very serious face. He then said out of the blue that he has no ambition in life. I was surprised by this. He then continued to say that if he has no ambition or no goal in life then his life must be meaningless and he has no reason to live. I just sat there silently since this is the first time I've heard him say something like this, I was... surprised to say the least. 
He then told me that he tried thinking about what he might want to do in the future. 
I told him he can be a filmmaker, since he has a hobby of making short skits, editing videos and all that, but he said that that won't do since if that was the career that he would pursue then it would make him a beggar since the film industry in our place isn't the best.
He told me that he planned on being a teacher, but he then said he isn't even that smart.
He then added that he wanted to be a detective, he IS a sherlock fan afterall, but then he said that he might end up becoming the world's worst detective.

I tried reassuring him, telling him that there's still alot of time to think about the future, but his reply scared me.
His reply was, if he still hasn't found his meaning in life, his goal in life, he would kill himself.
I thought he was joking but when I looked in his face he has the most serious expression I saw.
After that he told me that I can go home, but I insisted in staying with him for the night, he just replied with a ""no"".
So I went home, kinda shocked on what just happened, I don't know what to do and Im ashamed of myself since I don't what to do even though he has been my longest friend.

Communication has been a really essential part of everything, and we've always been open to each other about ourselves, what we want and think, and our pasts no matter how gritty it was. She's had future plans for us, and we've talked a lot about most things that many couples don't feel comfortable talking about. We agreed on always being open so we can tackle any issue we might face

To preface this, we did have a rough start, but we communicated about it and made it work. We didn't do regular dating or so, but got to know each other really well and then got together. I've always told her to immediately tell me if there's anything about the relationship she doesn't like and we'll fix it together.

However, a few days ago she went from me being a ""great boyfriend"" to being cheap. She finally said that she wants to be protected and treated like a princess. When I asked her what she meant with ""princess"", I didn't really get an answer. She also said that she didn't like paying during my last visit to her, which I completely understand. However, during that visit she insisted on paying and said that I'm her guest so she'll pay, and I'll pay the next time we meet. I paid a few times, but then I had to be really stern, and afterward she told me I don't have to pay.

She's a wonderful woman in a lot of ways, but it seems like she feels that I don't care about her. I have no problem spending money on her, but if she doesn't tell me what she wants I can't give her that. She told me that her family used to spoil her by buying things for her even if she didn't ask for it, while my family didn't do that, but if I asked for something they did everything in their power to help me.

She has recently moved city to live near me because she doesn’t have a lot of people in her life (she used to do everything with my dad) and now depends a lot on me for everything. She struggles to do a lot of life admin tasks and has a major lack of confidence: she doesn’t believe in herself. She is doing her third year of health science study and expects me to review ALL of her assignments e.g. correcting grammar (english is her second language), proofreading and formatting her 5000 word assignments on the regular. We talk everyday but only about her and what she needs help with. I work full time and come home most days to spend a couple of hours helping her with her studies or other things. She puts a lot of pressure on me. The thing is that she is never happy enough with the help I give her.. especially when I am unable to help her due to my lack of expertise with whatever task. She makes me feel guilty and blames me for not being there for her, when in fact I am doing everything I can to be present and to make her life better. She reminds me everyday that her life is miserable, that she’s alone, and that she can’t do anything well in life, etc. It’s starting to become very hard for me to deal with and she refuses to see a psychologist to get some help. I don’t know how to handle it anymore. Also, she wants me to find a new house to rent so we can live together but I am scared to be oppressed if I live with her as I’m already here feeling down everyday.

In short, it feels like she is replacing my dad with me. I can’t tell if I am being selfish or if my mum is too demanding and I can’t have a conversation with her about how I feel because she shuts down and thinks I don’t want to help her or that she is a burden to me because she’s is so useless in her words.

499,"I can't stop getting into arguments with random assholes online and I don't know why. Like those type of people with rock hard views that as soon as they know their arguments are falling apart start attacking you personally. And I know it's dumb and I'm usually thick skinned but I get so deep into arguments with people that I actually get my feelings hurt a lot. And I'm pretty good at logical arguments but as soon as complex emotions I'm kind of screwed and don't know how to respond anymore (By that I mean I have pretty shit emotional intelligence. I know when I'm sad or angry but I'm really bad at empathy and getting other people's emotions).

I don't even intend to start arguments but when someone replies to something I've written I can't just leave it like I need to get the last word and I don't know why I think it's just all my narcissism. 

I had an argument earlier today which I will admit I put myself in when I didn't have to. Someone was being an asshole to someone else in youtube comments. And other people were already telling him to stop being an asshole and I could tell by the way he responded to them that he wasn't worth it... and I still got into an argument anyway. And he was really an asshole. He picked apart everything I said, responded with things that didn't even make sense, and then turned it all personal and I've been in worse arguments but I was already having a bad day so it kind of hit me hard.

Like the argument wasn't really about parenting but kind of close to it and the only personal thing I said was that I would rather adopt than have my own kids and he went into a full rant about how selfish I am and that children aren't toys to be bought solely off that the only information he knows about me. And I know that's completely stupid because it makes no sense like adopting is the least selfish thing to do - you're giving a home to a kid who doesn't have one... and yet I still got offended? Like I know he only said that because I broke his real arguments and he didn't have anything else to stand on other than base level insults but I'm still really mad about it. And I'm mostly mad because I can't think of a comeback now and like I said I hate not having the last word. But it made me cry and I've never cried over an argument before and that's why I'm so confused right now.

So why do I keep getting into arguments with idiots and how do I stop. Because I love having discussions and debates but I'm a horrible judge of who I can have discussions with and who's just going to insult me",20Apr2020,1

501," Hi there. This is the first post I’ve made asking for advice like this, but I can’t ask anyone else about this. 

 So I can’t go into great detail just because some of the jokes she has made I no longer remember, and I’m not sure they matter really, but for the past couple of months my friend has been making ruder jokes to me. Now, she and I and another close friend of ours are very tight-knit, and often tease each other and poke fun as most friends do. But my friend is somewhat more ruthless when it comes to joking, and I’m not sure if she’s more comfortable around us so she thinks we can handle it, but it’s starting to feel hurtful, and like she doesn’t truly respect me. 

 She does this to a lot of people around her, and I would say that sometimes our friend group calls her out on it when her jokes go too far. But sometimes when she says something that I think is mean and nobody reacts except me, I start to think that I am in the wrong. I feel like maybe she’s lashing out at me because of something I did, or maybe this is just what she thinks joking around is. I have been told that I’m too sensitive before, and that has only turned into something where I allow people to treat me however they want to. So am I being sensitive? Or is she being careless?",20Apr2020,1
502,"Story time has come. Sit down child. Me and a girl met online on a discord server, she was venting about a problem that had happened. I helped her, and she helped me, we stopped talking for a while (we had no reason to). After about a month I think we started talking again. At some point while we were talking I remember her telling me to always be honest and tell someone if you like them even if they're in a relationship, so I did, plot twist this isn't me complaining about her saying no because she didn't. She just told me she didn't know how she felt, so I got excited, this was the first time I wasn't told no. (to be fair tho it was only the second time and the first person thought I was a creepy pervert, she didn't say it but I know she was thinking it). After a while she made what I assumed was a move and I was so fucking happy, we did this for a while, about a week or two, during those two weeks we did some shit and she told me she wanted to tell me she loved me but couldn't, she seemed genuinely sad she couldn't say that, I didn't care this was the first time anyone had showed me this much emotion. After those two weeks I asked her one last time and she said we're better off as friends. Boom I don't feel hurt, I don't feel sad, I feel nothing. Been about two months now and I still can't feel anything (or maybe one, my perception of time is horrible). Her birthday just came recently, I sent her the present I made for her and now I can't talk to her ever again.

506,"Hi there, I have really bad sleep anxiety/fear of insomnia and a fear of sleep deprivation, and now it's come to a head. My sleep schedule has been fucked lately, the other day I slept from 9AM to 7PM, which I realized was just unsustainable, so I tried to fix it. At first, I decided I would take a melatonin at a reasonable-ish hour(3AM), however, I think it was probably too early after waking up because the melatonin didn't do much and I woke up an hour and a half after going to sleep. So basically it was like a nap, not a sleep. I then decided later in the day that I would just stay up until a (genuinely)reasonable hour and go to sleep then. However, this came with the very big side effect of being up over 24 hours after my last proper sleep. This was a scary prospect because it meant that my next sleep was very important, I needed to get a good sleep or else I'd be genuinely sleep deprived. I got very sleepy from 5 to 7 PM, and I think briefly dozed. I considered seizing the moment and sleeping for the night right there, but ultimately decided to get up and join my family for dinner. This woke me up quite a bit. As it started approaching time to got to sleep, I started getting full of dread, getting super nervous over the prospect of not being able to sleep when the time came. Nevertheless, I popped some melatonin, about 5mg, and got into bed at 12 AM or so. It took me a while to get to sleep, but eventually I did, only to wake up about an hour or so later. I was so disappointed right then, but I popped some more melatonin, 2.5mg this time, and tried to sleep some more. After a lot of tossing and turning, I woke up again at like 2:30., and I think that's when I popped another 5mg of melatonin. Throughout this, I can't tell where the tossing and turning ended, and where sleep began, but after some half-sleeping, I woke up again around 5:30 to 6, and I wasn't able to get back to sleep.

If I'm being honest, I've been crying since I woke up. I'm so tired and so fucking terrified and so frustrated. I have no idea what to do. During the night I got maybe a little more than a few hours of sleep, if I'm lucky. It was super fretful and half awake sleep too. After having basically been up for almost 30 hours. I'm so afraid. I was preserving melatonin as a magic bullet, but I took over 12mg throughout the night, to little avail. I've always told myself that if I've been up a long time and I need to sleep, it would happen, that I wouldn't just not sleep. And while I did sleep a bit, it still feels like that comforting thought was just shattered. I wasn't dead tired, I wasn't out like a light as soon as my head hit the pillow, it took coaxing to even fall half asleep, and then I had to coax myself again a couple more times. 

I have no idea what to do. I'm so tired, so nervous, and I know that the next time when I try to sleep, whenever that is, the pressure to do so will be strangling.",20Apr2020,1
508," TLDR: Loved a girl, stopped loving a girl, loved another girl, they left me for a sociopath which they broke up with later, started liking the first girl again, mutual friend tells me he and her are almost a thing, but LDR not possible, my heart breaks for thinking i had a chance, also confused about how much my emotions are worth if I can feel this way with multiple people. I feel like shit.

I'm 21m. There's so much fucking context to this story that writing it out would take like 15 years so i'll keep it short. Keep in mind there's lots of tiny details that I can maybe elabourate on later.  
I've played this online mmorpg on and off for a couple (8ish) years. Recently I went back on the game during the end of year break and met an old \[F\]riend and we hit it off again.

Through talking to me for a solid month she (F) realises that the reason she's been anxious and depressed for the past 2 years is that her toxic boyfriend is a part of it, and that they both just accept that they're depressed together and dont try to get out of it because they're comfortable together.

This realisation + the boyfriend's bitterness/jealousy + a history of her being forced to pick between male friends or boyfriends means that she's had enough of it, and decides to break up with him, choosing the friend over the boyfriend for once. Great, good for her. Fast forward 3 months we're talking every day constantly and we're insanely close. Great. Feelings. It wasnt meant to end this way but 3 months close contact you know? Not my intention from the start, and I even offered to back off if her boyfriend was jealous and she said to stay (even her family supported this decision as they saw her mood improve).

This made me feel like I was helping her, and that I was doing something good, bringing someone out of depression n shit.

Enter player 2.  
Remember we're in an MMORPG. We do not live in the same country.  
This guy hits up her dm's and they're talking constantly. She's afraid of commitment, especially since she's fresh out of a relationship so there's nothing official between us, other than 3 months and probably over 500hrs+ in call (yes thats a lot of hours, we even slept in calls most nights). Yet this guy is apparently a master of sweet talking.

Fast forward 2 weeks maybe, she's texting him a lot, and telling me about it, we play games with player 2 together, its not bad. Then P2's best friend messages me.

She proceeds to show screenshots and tell stories of how both she and P2 are sociopaths (oh no) and that he's manipulating F for fun. The only reason she tells me this is because it's pissing her off that he's talking about F so much. Explains how sociopaths dont have real friendships or emotions for anything, and are good at manipulating. Story checks out. Screenshots read things such as calling F multiple derogatory female terms and concepts of controlling her and breaking her and me up. ""I'm gonna get them divorced (in game)""

This is all relayed to F, along with verbal proof from P2's best friend.

F doesnt care.

F loves P2

What the fuck?

Her mental gets so fucked up that she has this burning desire to 'find out' if he's really manipulating her or if his feelings are real. Spoiler, they're not.

In 2 weeks I am not talking to her anymore. Additionally she's pushed most of her in game friends away and is now exclusively hanging out with P2

2 weeks after that they're not talking anymore (I wonder why)

It's no longer viable to message her as I dont play anymore, and also received a lot of emotional damage from this situation, and have decided for once in my life to put myself first, and hope that she can too without my intervention, besides, I have already taught her a lot of anxiety and depression coping strategies which she employs/knows how to employ.

This is where the story pivots a bit.

Before this entire event happens, there was another (F2) girl (same game). We got close (over a period of over a year), things happened, things were confusing, tldr for this part is that she gave consented completely, and is confused about how to feel about me since she doesnt know if she should regret what happened or not. I swear I did not pressure, I asked for consent at every conceiveable level, and was happy to back off if she ever said otherwise, either way I guess in the heat of the moment she consented and felt weird about it later maybe.  
We stop talking, at her request, to help her cope. Fair enough.

I'm sorry this is going everywhere.

Back to present, I quit the game and she texts me and asks if im okay. (makes it seem like she cares?, first time we've talked in 4-5+ months). We start talking again. A mutual friend of mine with F1 also messages me at a similar time and we catch up on how i'm handling everything with F1 (He knows the whole story)  
I'm talking to F2 again now, just for comfort or something, and ofc I missed her, I wasnt the one that wanted to stop communication, so i'm loving it.

Today she said she had a shit day.  
Today, mutual friend (F1) also said he had a shit day.

MFF1 elabourates,  
He's been hanging out with F2 a lot recently (in game, for the past month, aka right after i quit), and they now have feelings for eachother, except they are long distance, basically other side of the planet, and she says she has feelings, but doesn't what to do anything, but also doesnt want to hurt him, a very complex situation ofc.

Except right now it's not about them. It's about me.  
(this is where you guys call me a piece of shit)  
When MMF1 told me about the situation with F2 (he knows what i had with F2), my heart just sinks so far.  
I guess I missed having someone to talk to on the level of F2 and F1, and talking to her recently made me feel like i had a chance. But this situation between MFF1 and F2 made me feel so fucking bad.

Its so fucking stupid, do I deserve her? Am I even allowed to have anything at the moment?  
I feel so emotionally fucked up that I just wanna tear my hair out.  
Am I just talking to F2 to get in with her again? On a conscious level no, On a subconscious level I cant give a straight answer. I'm so confused and frustrated and torn. During both of these chapters of my life my emotions towards them felt so real... and important. But how are they real if I have them so freely with people in such a short time frame. Can I truly say I loved them? Is it even fair to say that? If not... What am I feeling? How am I supposed to feel in this situation? Am I just desperate for human connection? I dont know. I need more perspective. That's why im here

Please help me make a rational decision here. I cant think straight anymore.

509,"I (15 F) got a text from my friend(15 F), we’ll call her Martha for the sake of protecting her Identity. She basically sent me her suicide note via instagram. I’ll just write down a summary of what went down. M is for Martha’ v is for voidz. This isn’t her first time doing this. She’s never attempted but she keeps threatening to do so, if that makes sense? I didn’t call the police because I asked my sister (F 20) for advice and she said just to keep talking to her.

M: you know I love you Voidz_ but I can’t take it.
(I start texting nonstop because she won’t answer, srry if it’s long.)
V: what are you saying? Don’t do anything you’ll regret. I love you, stop talking like that! Please. Whatever you’re going through we’ll go through together. Stop what you’re going to do, you’re just in a bad place in ur mind right now. Did something happen? I’m all ears. The pain is only temporary man, COVID must’ve impacted ur mental health :((
M: I’m tired of people saying the pain is only temporary. I’ve had it my whole life and I’ve had enough.

(I’ve had doctor diagnosed clinical depression before so I told her what would help me back then)
V: I know how it feels, it feels like it will never end but it will. It’s not gonna change easily. Please just find yourself something to distract yourself with. You’re not thinking straight right now, please just take a break and breathe. Breathe. Give yourself time to think. Did something happen?

M: I’m just done. There’s no point for me.
(At this point imma summarize cuz I’ve said p much everything I’ve already said at this point.)
V: there is, there’s so many things you haven’t experienced yet.
M: I’m fine with not doing that.
V: please just wash your face with water. Do this little thing for me please ok? You’ll feel better.

At this point one of her close guy friends (lets call him Bobby) starts texting me and freaking out, so I panicked and let it slip that I was talking to him about this to her. I also told her other BFF because I was panicking and worried that she wouldn’t listen to me. She’s known this friend many more years than me. They’re close. I thought I was doing what was right but now I see I was wrong. She has an on and off crush on Bobby. I also texted her mom- I NEVER mentioned her suicide note because I know she might get in trouble. All I told her mom was that she wasn’t responding to me and ai asked her to check up on her is all.

V: me and Bobby love you so so much! Pls wash ur face I’m begging you
M: why did you mention him
V: he’s scared. I’m scared right now. I’m talking to him because we love you and never want anything bad to happen to you.

She doesn’t look at my texts for about 10 minutes

V: I’m sorry but it’s because I love you. I don’t want anything to happen to you which is why I did that.
M; Voidz just stop.
V: fine, i feel like im making things worse. if you don’t want to talk to me please call this number. (I left the suic*de hotline number. )

Bobby told me she was better, all it took was puppy videos. The morning after he shows me she’s talking to him like normal. She hasn’t talked to me since then so I texted her this. She leaves me on seen.

V: are you okay? I’m just checking up on you.

I thought she didn’t wanna talk about it, so I changed the subject.

V: hey bitch, guess what I did.

I cut my bangs, I thought joking around would lighten the mood since she was all friendly with Bobby and not me. She leaves me on seen again.

V: why are you ignoring me? Idk why you’re mad at me but could you at least tell me why? Don’t leave me in the dark ://

I’m left on seen again. I don’t know what to do. Advice? Do I deserve the silent treatment?",20Apr2020,1
510,"

So we are engaged and have been together for two years. He’s had three exes in total. His first girlfriend of four years and he broke up 7 years ago but in our early conversations he once said ‘ nothing really went wrong. It just fizzled out. Had we been older things could’ve been different’. Ever since he said this about a year ago it has not sat well with me and I’ve brought it up a few times. He said that he’s just being mature about the situation and that whatever I’m thinking the opposite it actually true. I can’t really bring it up again as I’ve done so loads of times. I’ve also made very clear I don’t want to be with him if he has any lingering what ifs and to break up with me out of respect but let’s be real, no one would do that. 

But something in my gut makes me feel like a consolation prize. 
To be fair my ex was secretly still into his ex and I could totally tell but he always denied it so I don’t know if this is causing me to feel this way in my new relationship, but I’m very cautious about it and it’s making me not put as much effort into my relationship as I actually should be as I’m wary of making someone my all meanwhile they are wishing they were with someone else.",20Apr2020,1
512,"I've been with my current girlfriend for 9 months so far, long distance but we somehow managed to meet a few months back but we're back to long distance. Idk whether it's my paranoia acting up again but I find myself feeling about her like I felt about partners I used to get tired of or wanna move on from. The issue is how she never makes any time to hang with me despite conveniently having time for a friend of ours, to the point of where I only talk to her on call when all 3 of us hang out on call. We're open so it's less that I'm worried there's anything there and more so that generally I just feel like my needs aren't being met tbh, there's the absent from calls, the focusing on her when we're all there, her saying she'll change one thing and never doing it, her horrible sleep schedule, never knowing how to actually support me any more. I'm not saying she has to conform to my life but I need something in common, we used to have similar schedules, she used to be able to support me easily when I needed it and I support her, she used to have a bad schedule and fixed it only to ruin it again, and she never had to say she'll change more than now. What got me was when I was begging for help and she went off to do other things, but when we finally get time together after pulling her teeth all damn day she says our other friend can't be alone and how she's worried about her.

514,"The word that comes to mind when I think about people cleaning compulsively or having certaing obsessive behaviours is OCD, but thankfully, I'm pretty sure that's not my case. I don't struggle with OCD thoughts, and my ""perfectionism/obsessive behaviour only happens in certain aspects of my life.

 The first and most noticeable one is cleaning. I can spend a few days without cleaning. Sometimes I even forget to do it. If the house is a bit dirty and I'm really tired or sick, I don't feel too anxious or guilty for not cleaning it right away. But the moment I decide to clean, I'm unable to stop until I feel like EVERYTHING is clean. I scrub every surface with all my strength. I go over every surface many times. I clean every item thoroughly before placing it anywhere. I vacuum the floor for a very long time, and then I clean the floor with another product. I clean until I feel like everything is as clean as it can be. Every time I clean, I start thinking about something I could improve, and start doing it. For example, while I'm cleaning the bathroom sink, I think ""I should clean these small places with a toothbrush"". Every time, I add new routines and it takes me longer to clean. It usually takes me about 5 hours to clean my very small bathroom.

I also feel this way when it comes to personal hygiene. I spend way too much time in the shower, not because I get distracted, but because I spend ages cleaning behind  my ears, knees, elbows...and my feet. I spend ages cleaning my feet. I also scrub really hard, until my skin is a bit irritated. And just like when I clean the house, I start noticing ways I could be ""cleaner"". I can spend up to two days without showering or brushing my teeth. If I'm sick or feel really lazy I sometimes do this. But when I do, I do it for a very long time, being a bit too tough and can't stop until I feel like everything is perfect. 

Since I'm in quarantine, I've realised that I'm the same way with other things. Very random things. When I play certain videogames, I have to collect EVERY item and complete EVERY side task. When I play Pokémon, I HAVE to find every item and absolutely MUST complete my Pokedex. I start focusing on the instead of enjoying the game or paying attention to the story. And I don't do it because I want to. I just feel like I have to. 

I can stop cleaning for days, but if I do, I do it obsessively. I can leave videogames unfinished, but If I finish them, I have to get a perfect score, find every object, talk to every NPC...

I wish I could stop being this way. Cleaning becomes a real pain, and I wish I could do it often, but for a short time. For example, clean the house once a week, for only a few hours, and not feel exhausted. Play a videogame without worrying so much about those things, especially because I don't even understand why I care about them. I don't enjoy spending so much time doing those things, and I know how unnecessary they are. I wish I could stop. It. If you know anyone who feels this way or have any advice, please tell me. Anything helps.",20Apr2020,1

516,"I have a really close friend, who I almost consider a sister. I can trust her, and I would never drop her cause she is a really great friend.  


Heres the problem: She treats me like I am dumb, and she needs to validate everything I say for it to really be correct. For example we are talking about something someone said, and she says that I cant know if they meant it or if they were joking.  But it was clear that the person meant it, and its like she doesnt think I am smart enough to interpret the situation? There are many examples where I feel like she feels superior, or that she is critical to everything I say. And I dont know how to tell her that this has been bothering me, cause I dont really know how to explain it.  


Its like this ´´I havent seen it myself, so I cant trust what you say´´.  


Another example is when we were talking about her aunt getting box braids without knowing that its cultural appropriation, and I said that many are ignorant to the matter. Then she said that her aunt wasnt ignorant cause she didnt know that the braids even had history behind them. Thats what ignorant means, and she kept saying that ignorant means when you ignore a matter. Like I wouldnt know what ignorant means.   


These are all petty examples but it happens every time we meet, so its building up. I dont know how to tell her.

517,"*My name is actually Karen..*. and needless to say I hate it (I sound like a true Karen here lmao).

I'm actually pretty much the opposite of a Karen. I'm in high school, I'm Asian, I enjoy looking at memes (especially offensive ones), and I'm not anti-vax, not a flat earther, and definitely dislike essential oils. 

Ever since I was a kid I never really liked my name. It didn't have the ending that sounded feminine to me (now it doesn't matter as much). The meme doesn't help either. Don't get me wrong it's funny most of the time but imagine when I go to study abroad and introduce my name to people. I definitely find it funny, but I'm pretty sure I'd get annoyed in the long run. I might look to change it or add on to my name possibly. 

Does anyone have any unique name suggestions? Nothing like how celebrities name their children (uncanny names like True, Apple, Atlas whatever) but just uncommon or cool names. 

If personality matters, I guess I did state some aspects of my personality above. I'm overall just someone who sees the humor in everything. I also like making friends if that counts (feel free to dm me).

518,"So around a month ago, I asked for advice here. Long story short, my little sister met her half brother. She is 14, he is 17. She hates affection from EVERYONE (family, friends, anyone). She hates when we as so much as hold her hand. This brother comes along and bam, she is hooked on him. I looked him up and he is the typical mean kid of his school, racist and just an awful person. His social media is him either boasting or putting down poor kids. Here is where the problem starts again.










I showed my sister his profile. She ended up crying and hating both of us. She gave us the silent treatment, her brother got mad at me and it was just a mess. A few days ago, they have both been talking again. She is now back to kissing up to him. Even though I am pissed that she went back to him, I am bothered that she still won't talk to me. 









It's been like 20 days now, she hasn't gotten over it. I told her brother to do something about it. He claims to have tried but apparently she doesn't trust me anymore. I know me and her aren't the closest, trust hasn't always been easy, but she is my little sister. We knew each other longer than she has with her brother and yet she trusts him more than me? It just feels so awful and difficult lately. I tried to explain to her and talk to her but she kept telling me that I was just jealous and taking it out on their relationship. I never wanted to scream so much in my life. My mom says to leave them alone but my actual older brother says that I should keep looking into it. I just want to give up and go back to before this dumb drama crap.









How can I possibly fix this mess?",20Apr2020,1

520,"I live in the suburbs and I was on a PSN party with some people I knew from Highschool for the first month it was alright we would play the game and chill occasionally roasting each other and shit. One of them is a wanna be rapper and drug dealer and highschool dropout, the rapping part I know he does but he isnt good at all and lies about having 250k record deals but he only gets 10views on youtube and maybe 400 views soundcloud a pop. He tried to scam me by making a fake instagram account that claims it sell and ships weed I figured it was a scam because he was claiming free overnight shipping which no one in their right mind would do for free. In general most of the people in the party are frauds and all hate me because I got scammed twice by them in a week about 3 years ago but I ended up forgiving them because I try my hardest to hold grudges however I cant, but I stay with my defense up after you wrong me no doubt about that. So one night we were on the game and I was doing better than normal and everyone in that party hates when I start winning so I could feel the tension. Well I start talking shit like how most people do in the game when they start winning because its all fun and games right. NO not for him he gets angry and says I'm a free body I reply ""no u"" and he gets in his feeling and goes on a rampage talking crazy saying if his boy was doing something they would do me in tonight at house. He goes through old messages and pulls up my address I guess trying to scare me. He says in 1-3 months imma forget but it will still be on his mind and hes itching to kill me.

522,"Story time has come. Sit down child. Me and a girl met online on a discord server, she was venting about a problem that had happened. I helped her, and she helped me, we stopped talking for a while (we had no reason to). After about a month I think we started talking again. At some point while we were talking I remember her telling me to always be honest and tell someone if you like them even if they're in a relationship, so I did, plot twist this isn't me complaining about her saying no because she didn't. She just told me she didn't know how she felt, so I got excited, this was the first time I wasn't told no. (to be fair tho it was only the second time and the first person thought I was a creepy pervert, she didn't say it but I know she was thinking it). After a while she made what I assumed was a move and I was so fucking happy, we did this for a while, about a week or two, during those two weeks we did some shit and she told me she wanted to tell me she loved me but couldn't, she seemed genuinely sad she couldn't say that, I didn't care this was the first time anyone had showed me this much emotion. After those two weeks I asked her one last time and she said we're better off as friends. Boom I don't feel hurt, I don't feel sad, I feel nothing. Been about two months now and I still can't feel anything (or maybe one, my perception of time is horrible). Her birthday just came recently, I sent her the present I made for her (we're still friends by the way) and now I can't talk to her ever again. What do I do?

523,"Hey guys! :)
Every year that passes by, I feel ""old"".
And then when THAT year passes, I feel so dumb for wasting it because I realize I was younger than I am now..
I am currently 24 F, and I feel kinda crappy about it.
I'm not blaming anyone, but I have noticed that teenagers and young kids these days like to make everything about generation and ragging on age groups. It just makes me overthink and be stupid about it. I get a lot of people commenting on my youth, but I don't f e e l young. I don't seem to glow and shine and feel good about myself and rather feel extremely stressed about paying off my student loans, advancing in my career and staying on the right path. Sometimes I DO just wanna wear hip, trendy clothes and be 'wild', but then I stop and think... aren't I too old for this? 
I know I'm probably frustrating some readers, but this is how I feel. How can I just be more present and realize that I'm living during a very developmental time? I just don't feel it at all, despite getting told this. I just feel tired, sad and old on the inside. Anyone have tips on how to deal with this?",20Apr2020,1
524,"So I’m usually a really active guy, walk / skateboard a few miles every day along with working a fast paced job where I’m moving all day. Light body weight exercise, nothing too serious. 

But for the past month and a half I’ve been locked up due to COVID (not sick) and I have gone literally no where. I did some weight lifting but strained some of my muscles overworking them, though now over the past few days I notice a lot of my joints are sore, especially my knees / elbows. Last night I got a really sharp sudden pain in my ankle too when I was walking down a step but it went away quickly. 

Is it possible that this is from lack of exercise and my body being used to so much activity? I had to go to a doc to get something else looked at and I checked out ok nothing serious, but I’m still pretty anxious about the aches / muscle strains I have as it’s been almost a week since I hurt myself",20Apr2020,1

I cant think of a single thing to get her, or make either. She doesn’t wear jewelry, doesn’t listen to music, doesn’t want clothes, definitely no perfume, etc. She is also bed-ridden from cancer so she can’t do much besides walk around the house sometimes.

Any ideas on what I could make for her? Last year I made a scrap book for one of her gifts and got a necklace along with other small items. I spent all week trying to teach myself how to paint because I have a few water color paints, brushes, and small canvases hoping that maybe I could make something nice for her. Nope.

My friend told me that my crush said to him that I should stop courting her because I'm not exactly a ""boyfriend material"" and it'll ruin our circle of friends if we ever broke up.

529,"I recently got a friend request from my 5th-grade parent's teacher. I am 30 now. She sent me some happy message with excitement and ""hugs, hugs, hugs!"", and it's left me very confused. 

This woman was an absolute monster to me when I was in her class. She would go out of her way to humiliate me or punish me for things that I had nothing to do with. During this time my mother was getting treated for cancer and had to get surgery, my father fell back into alcoholism, and my parents marriage was falling apart. 

Every day I dreaded going to class. Literally have panic attacks. She would single me out and look for things to put me down for. I'd never screamed at a teacher in my life, but I lost it on her when I had to leave early to go to the hospital for my mom and walked in to get my things during break, which she didn't allow. She immediately screamed at me, started writing up a detention slip, kept screaming, and I snapped and lost it, she kept yelling at me and putting me down even after I explained I was going to the hospital. Or when I was having anxiety over having a tooth pulled and when my dad came to pick me up, she jokingly/menacingly yelled ""THEY'RE GOING TO RIP ALL YOUR TEETH OUT!"". And that's just some of the things she did. 

She was literally the reason I told my parents that I refused to ever go to a christian or religiously based school again, and it was living hell for the year I had her. Now she thinks we're friends?

I don't want to attack her, but I am tempted to at least confront her on it, say I forgive her, and move on. Shouldn't an ass hole be held accountable? Or is there a statute of limitations over childhood trauma?",20Apr2020,1

I am certain that I want to give to charity, I just can't decide which one. Help me decide. Here is like my basic criteria: 

\- A non-profit with a good reputation (not associated with any wrongdoings or scandals)

\- A smaller/lesser known charity that is underfunded and really needs help (so not like something huge like the Salvation Army or PETA)

\- Issues that mean a lot to me are homelessness and homophobia. So I would prefer to donate to LGBT groups maybe or food banks/shelters

537,"Okay so this is gonna be a long question. I'm 16 and I live with my parents and siblings. 

And yesterday my mother started to give me the silent treatment, she doesn't acknowledge me, answers when I ask a question or even looks at me anymore. I honestly can't say it makes me feel sad, it just makes me feel annoyed and upset bc, at least in my opinion, I didn't do anything that bad. 

We had an argument yesterday. We're a religious family, I'm not that active but I still believe and try to be better, and my mom had enrolled (is that even the right word? Idk I'm sorry english is not my first language) me in this religious course thing where you get more in depth classes about our religion. (I don't want to mention which one it is bc it feels like that could cause people to have prejudices, my parents may be bad and toxic sometimes but it's not bc of their religion) 

Anyway, she enrolled me like two years ago, I never really wanted to go because even tho I love learning new things the teacher and other students make me feel anxious and unwelcome. But I never said anything because I knew how important it was for my mom that I went and that even if I said anything I couldn't change her mind. 

But ever since the quarantine thing started they've been giving us homework and they do group calls to continue class, and when that came on top of everything that I have to do for school I was really frustrated. I was talking to myself and complaining while I was doing the homework and my mother kinda just made fun of my frustration. So then I said to her "" I mean it's kind of your fault anyway since I never wanted to go"" (Which was the first time in a very long time I even complained about it) and she got angry saying that it was either this or being sent to one of these religious schools were you stay there for a whole year. I got upset and told her that that would only result in me hating our religion and resent her, to which she replied that after a certain age it isn't her responsibility and that it's my problem. I replied by saying that if it wasnt her responsibility that she didn't have the right to send me there. After that we both kinda didn't say anything

And since then shes been giving me the silent treatment

541,"Hey everyone, I hope you’re all well and staying safe. I realize that this topic might not compare to many others on this subreddit but I hope I’m still welcomed.

So to provide some context, I’m a 19yo male and was always very skinny/lanky. I have been working for around 2-3 years pretty consistently (5-6 times a week) and upped my calorie intake to bulk a bit. Over this time I managed to gain visible muscle mass and strength, specifically in my chest. 

However, unfortunately about 1.5 months ago I suffered a seizure and was hospitalized. Luckily I didn’t have any brain damage however while I was seizing I fell into a what’s been described as “awkward” position and managed to do some damage to my rotator cuff. I had a physiotherapist take a look and they said I had definitely strained it and was to do a set of exercises everyday for 2 weeks to encourage blood flow to the area and strengthen the surrounding muscles, aiding the healing process. 

Fast forward to now. Like many of you I’ve been in quarantine for the last month or so. I am quarantining with my mother and my girlfriend at the moment. My gf is also very into fitness, even more so than I am, which is starting to become something of a problem. I’ve been doing my assigned exercises and have seen improvements since the seizure, however, the last week or so I seem to have plateaued with no real improvements. It is still too painful to do push-ups or any chest/shoulder exercises. Hence, I’ve been unable to do any fully fledged workouts for almost 2 months, which is obviously largely demotivating, watching the muscle/strength melt away. 

However, my core issue is this: as I mentioned my gf is extremely fit and gym-centric, she does 2-3 workouts everyday in our garden and has gained considerable muscle mass since quarantine (as shes had more time to workout). Now obviously I’m happy for her and I support her in doing this, but there’s a part of me which is envious and almost angry about it. You can imagine it’s almost rubbing it in my face. 

As for the time being I’m going to keep doing my exercises and hope that the pain slowly fades away, however, I am slowly becoming worked up and frustrated about my inability to work out when faced with my girlfriends multiple workouts a day. Obviously I don’t want to blame her for anything but I just don’t know what to do. I’m pretty certain that i won’t be able to work out properly for another month at least, and I feel overwhelmed that the progress I’ve made over the last few years (I don’t gain easily) will quickly be abolished and I’ll be back at step 1. 

Anyway, I suppose this was a call for advice, a rant I needed to open up about and an ask for support. Any comments would be appreciated.",20Apr2020,1

544,"I am way too calm about everything in the moment, because things take months or even years to dawn on me how serious they are.

In December, I had to tell a friend of 3 years that we could no longer be friends. I still think I made the right decision, but until now I have been more or less indifferent about it. A normal person would have had a heavy heart all along, because that’s not a pleasant decision for anyone to make.

It just now struck me that “wait a second, that was really sad. We had been friends for three years, and I had to cut him out of my life.”

That’s just one example of many.

The same thing goes for when people close to me have died. I usually don’t have much of a reaction until weeks or months later. Thankfully, this hasn’t happened in a while though.

There might be an underlying mental condition of some sort for this.

People have praised me for always remaining calm in fiery situations. The reality is that I just don’t feel these situations to be serious in the moment.

549,"Alright. So. I really like to write, and my main outlet for this is through text-based roleplaying - for me, it's like collaborative writing with another author. It's one of my favorite things to do and it really keeps my mind active and passes time, especially now with quarantine and all. Yes, I know there's a stigma around roleplaying. Yes, the roleplay I'm involved in right now involves sexual themes and some other dark stuff - drug crimes and abuse, primarily. The person I roleplay with is a close friend I've known for like, 2 years. My relationship with them is as friends. I adore them, but it's platonic.

I've been with my boyfriend for a year and we love each other very much. He's known I roleplay with my friend for several months, and he knows that it involves sexuality, we've talked all about it. He says he knows I love writing and that he wants me to have that outlet, but I can't shake the fear that he'll get upset and leave me or something. 

For clarification, the sexual themes in the roleplay aren't between myself and my friend, they're between third-person characters.

I don't think I'm afraid because I'm doing something wrong or because my boyfriend is lying about being okay with it. He wouldn't do that. I think I'm afraid because before I was with my boyfriend, I was in a mentally/psychologically abusive relationship for something like six months. It was a few years ago, but that abusive person I was with controlled me in lots of ways. One way was that I couldn't look at *anything* sexual that he wasn't presenting to me. For example, no sex scenes in movies, or in books, or porn unless he wanted to show me something. There was a game I played at the time, where you simulate a wolf pack. He made me stop because you could make the wolves have puppies. And he got **real** angry when I did something he didn't like. He really messed my head up.

I think I'm overreacting, overrthinking it, because my relationship with my boyfriend is really good. It's very healthy. We are open and honest about our feelings with each other, but he's been under a lot of stress lately so I don't want to tell all of this to him. I also don't want to tell him about that abusive relationship either. I've moved on. I'm just getting stuck on this.

553,"It's 4/20, not hard to remember.. it's only 8 am but we get up around 5 because that's when his daughter is dropped off. We've been together for a few years and hes never forgotten about it before. He's been grumpy all morning and I know he forgot because he always treats me like a princess on my birthday. I asked him if he could watch the kids for a minute while I take a shower and make us breakfast and he got so mad because hes tired, I understand that but we went to sleep really early last night and I thought maybe it was so we could have a good day. I've subtly reminded him a few days ago and he hasn't said anything like asked me what I wanted to do or what I wanted or anything like that. Not that I need a gift or treated greatly but at least a happy birthday or letting me take a shower while he watches the kids would be nice.

554,"Coming from a throwaway acct so no one can see this. So I'm currently in quarantine with my direct family (Mom, sister, brother, and father). I am 17 and next year I will be going to college. My mom is in desperate need of help because she does not want to continue living in an apartment complex. She left her job after she had her first kid (my sister), and has been taking care of us ever since. Because she cares about us so much, she has really forgotten about herself and lost friends, work, all enjoyment for herself (she never leaves the house unless shopping for us or taking us out somewhere). During this time, my father has been absent. He has not helped raise us at all and all he has done was bring money back home. We have been moving around a lot over the past 10 years because my mom is never happy with the situation. We left a really big house that we owned and we sold it after my little brother was born, and since then have been living in small apartments all over the northeast united states. During this time, she said she really needs help going back into life and has mentioned that she does not feel well and has hinted she is suicidal. She has said multiple times that she is only living for her children and she has gotten angry at us for not helping her at all. Fast forward to the present and we are quarantining for the coronavirus. We were supposed to be looking for a house to move into during summer but it is a bit hard to do now. Our lease is going to expire this summer and my mom really doesn't want to live in an apartment for another year. I don't even know where to look for houses because we have no family or close friends so at this point we are just picking random places on a map to live at. I have mentioned houses before, but my mom has asked me what is there for her there because she still feels she will be all alone and isolated no matter where we go. I have brought this up to my father, but in all honesty, he doesn't really care and will never do anything (he is a very passive person and has done horrible things to my family). How do I go about giving my mother the life that she deserves and choosing a random town to live in? I don't want to leave to college without these issues resolved.",20Apr2020,1
555,"I originally posted this on a website called “letschatlove.com” 
[Here’s a link to the original post.](https://letschatlove.com/relationship-advice-for-women/i-want-to-marry-this-guy-more-than-anything-but-i-dont-think-theres-a-chance/)
I haven’t gotten any responses there, however, so I decided to post it here in the hope of getting a response. I hope whoever reads this finds it thought provoking or entertaining at the very least.


I’ll start off by saying that I’m an adult, but still young and new to this sort of thing. Please forgive me if I come across as naive. This is also the first person I've ever wanted any sort of serious commitment with, so he means a lot to me.

I’m not sure if I should harp on details, but I met this guy my freshman year of high school. He started talking to me one day, and he said something to me that instantly made me fall in love with him. He was so optimistic and ambitious that it was almost contagious. I knew I needed a person like this in my life. 
He was hard to talk to at first, but over time, my feelings for him grew and grew to a point where they became overwhelming. We shared a class period, but I could never bring myself to talk to him. He was a sophomore at the time, and I knew that he would graduate in just a couple of years. I was terrified of not only never seeing him again, but of the two of us drifting apart for good. So, I did something any toddler would do to get the attention of a crush, and slipped a letter confessing my feelings to him into his locker. I didn’t even write my name on it. Luckily, a friend who found out about it told him that it was me and he wasn’t left in the dark for too long, but needless to say, this didn’t go over very well. In fact, the week following this might have been one of, if not the worst week of my life. After I heard that he just wanted to be friends, I thought I’d be perfectly fine and I’d be able to move on. But I couldn’t. I felt empty. It was almost like I had blown my one chance at being happy. Of course, you can’t rely on another person for happiness, but for whatever reason, I felt more empty the night I’d found out more than any in my entire life. The week after, I couldn’t bring myself to eat anything. My stomach was always tight and full. I felt constant dread and loneliness hanging over me. I had a hard time falling asleep. Even when I had, I felt relief from the pain when I was no longer awake, but as soon as the next morning, I would remember everything that happened, and my heart would sink into my stomach again. It wasn’t until the next week, when he started sitting at my lunch table, that we actually started talking again. 

I was surprised he ever talk to me at all after that. Even though he never wanted to be more than friends, he never held my stupid mistake against me. 
Fast forward a couple years later, and we’ve become really good friends. Instead of feeling helpless and nervous around him, I’m always glad to see him and talk to him. We have great conversations, a lot of the same interests and ideas, and we’ve even been able to open up to each other about some really personal stuff. I feel like I can tell him anything, and I feel much more like we’re equals as opposed to the helpless freshman gawking over some guy that I was years ago. 

The problem is that just like before I had given him that note, I thought I’d be perfectly fine if the two of us simply remained good friends and let things be.
I was wrong.
I still want him. I want a life with him. I’ve never wanted to give myself to a person before. But I’m too afraid to tell him any of these things, because I’m afraid of the soul crushing rejection I felt that first time I confessed to him.

Since we'll never go to school together again, I’m scared now more than ever of never having the strong connection we did at school again. He’ll be leaving for Dallas in a couple months, which is a couple hours from where I live. We message each other pretty regularly, and it helps that he says I’m the one he texts the most since other people are either busy, or just get annoyed by his texting. XD (he’s a very talkative person, but I don’t mind. He’s a super big extravert so this quarantine has just been killing him)
Anyways, I’ve considered going to college in Dallas, since there’s this neat private art college that has my major. It’d be really easy to get into, but expensive. That’s why I’m looking for scholarships and jobs and whatnot, but I’m getting off track.

My point is, if I went to this college in Dallas, (which is 20 minutes away from where he’d be,) would I have any chance? Should I tell him I still have feelings for him? There’s a semi good chance that we’ll see each other, since he said that if I went there, we should hang out, but I’m still nervous about this whole thing. He also doesn’t really message me as much as he used to. He’s gone from texting me every day to maybe once or twice a week. Granted, this may be partially because his parents keep taking his phone, and he messages a discord chat that we’re in every other day, but I can’t help but wonder if the time we're spending apart will damage our friendship and kill whatever very small chance I had with with him.

He gives me mixed signals sometimes. For example, we went somewhere with a group of friends one time, and he needed a ride home, and since I wasn’t allowed to drive people around all the time, I told him I couldn’t. In a particularly odd moment, someone was taking a large group photo, and as we were turning around to face the camera, he put his hand on my shoulder and quietly said “I wish you could take us, [me and my brother,] home.”
Maybe I just took this the wrong way, but it came off as flirtatious from my perspective. There are plenty of times where he’s done odd things like this. He never took me to a dance because he didn’t want people to think we were dating, (according to him, many people thought we were dating, but I never met anyone who told me this directly,) and yet he did dance competitions at our school with me. On top of this, he brought other girls whom he considered “friends,” to dances. If I was his friend, just like these other girls, I’m not sure what would have made me any different, unless he had feelings for these other girls, and not me, but simply didn’t want to be rude about it. Then again, he said he had no interest in dating while he was in high school, but I can’t help but wonder if this was also just another excuse to get out of telling me that he thinks I’m unattractive. 
There was another time, when we went to this soccer game, when he tucked a strand of my hair out of my face. I gave him a funny look, and his only response was saying “I’m bored!” in a defensive but slightly playful tone. It felt nice, but I also found it really confusing. 
I don’t want to expose too much of his personal life, but he told me one time that he had a mild form of autism that causes social anxiety and an inability to pick up on subtle social cues. This would probably explain the behavioral inconsistencies, but I can’t help but wonder if he’d ever even once consider a relationship with me.
I asked him one time if he thought of me as a sister. His response was “Sort of,” and when I asked him what he meant by that, he said that I was a good friend that he could rely on and tell anything to. This is what he is to me.

I’m grateful for our friendship, but I really want more. If there’s anything anyone thinks I could do to break out of the friendzone, please tell me. I’ve tried everything, from advice on flirting, to pheromone perfumes, and even hypnosis. At this point, I feel like it’s hopeless, but I like him to much to give up. I could see the two of us being great together, and even being able to form a stable future together, but he doesn’t see that, and it saddens me knowing that he probably never will. If there’s anyone out there who thinks that this isn’t a lost cause, and that there’s a way for us to be together, please respond.

Thank you so much for reading my story.",20Apr2020,1

I really like my best friend. Like, a lot. They've been there for a long time, 3-4 years, and she knows that I like her, cuz I told her last year, but I kinda downplayed how much and I never properly expressed my feelings, cuz I kept saying that I'm still your friend and nothing's changed (yeah, I fucked up there, but I knew she liked this friend of mine who liked her back, and I didn't wanna lose her friendship cuz that is honestly pretty special to me). She said its okay, and things became awkward between us for a while, but came back on track soon after. She even threw me a surprise birthday party and that was the best gift that anyone has ever given me.

I got her fixed up with that friend of mine she liked (yeah, dumb mistake #2) but I realized what an asshole he was, cuz he knew how much I liked her, and still confessed his feelings to her (that was before I helped him get her), and even asked me to help him out with it, which I agreed to (dumb mistake #3) cuz I wanted to see my best friend happy, and I knew she was happy whenever she was around him. And he was just using me to get her, cuz he would just portray himself superior to me whenever he was around her. I realised this late, and I cut off all ties with him. Plus, he badmouthed his ex (who's a good friend of mine) in front of strangers in order to befriend them, and I realised that he's shitty.

I had to switch my high school due to some reason, and I communicate with my best friend through text, and whenever I talk to her, I find myself falling more and more in love. And I know I should move on, and that's not healthy for me, and i've tried distancing myself from her for some time, but it doesn't help. And whenever she invites me to a party her shitty boyfriend is also there, and they're super into PDA, and that just makes my heart burn. I just want to remove this feeling from my life, cuz I know she's my best friend and she doesn't want these feelings, this part of me, in her life. How do I remove these?",20Apr2020,1
557,I’ve always had trouble sleeping since I was a kid. My house was very chaotic as a kid. Went to sleep centers and did all the works. For awhile my sleep has gotten better.

563,"This is a throw away account :-) I need advice of a friend with depression. He is one of my best friends and I want to help him. I know at this point there is not much I can do besides listen but I feel like I’m constantly saying the wrong thing. 

He has been depressed for a very long time. And has always been in therapy. He never misses a session. Last year during this time he got really low and we almost lost him. He improved and until the quarantine was on a good path but now he is in a dark place again.

His sadness stems from, other than depression, the fact that he can’t find a relationship. He will take no steps to find a relationship and always has a million reasons why he cannot. I know this is where the depression is talking over. 

I know it’s not in his best interest to try to fix his problems or offer advice as he does not hear it and always retorts with reasons why it won’t work. At this point I just tell him I love him and care for him. But I feel like this is not helping and repeating the same thing is frustrating to him as he stops talking usually after I’ve said it for the second time. But I truly don’t know what to say at times. 

We have made a plan that after the quarantine we will do some fun and unique activities to get him out and about and possibly meet someone. But mostly we would go out to have fun and do something new. I thought we could do this once a month. 

I just want to help and it’s been very hard because I feel like I am not. I don’t want to lose him. Is there anything I could do or say to make him feel more loved. 

I am very aware it is not in my power to cure his depression. But any advice would help.

568," Short summary: Me and my gf lived together, when we were together I felt like the luckiest person alive, she even told me she wants to marry me a couple of times, even 2 days before the breakup...lol. Well, one day she ""out of nowhere"" wanted to break up with me, and told me many things she told me were a lie, some were pretty big and important things, she felt sorry, she didnt love me anymore. I suddenly felt like i was dead. Atleast she felt bad about what she did. I, since I´ve never loved anyone in my entire life like her, told her its okay, i still love her, I want to be with her. She told me she needed space, and time for herself, something which I wanted to give her, but I couldnt. I tried my best, but I just couldnt. I went home and wanted to give her a few days for herself, but I just kept on texting and calling her, I felt horrible, I couldnt sleep, when I did, I woke up, bed full in sweat, had to puke, didnt want to eat. I cant even describe how I felt. Now, after a few days of that she finally broke up with me. But now she didnt even feel bad anymore, she made me the bad person. She told me everything is my fault, I couldnt even give her some time for herself, I should never contact her ever again, and If i did, she would call the police on me, since im ""stalking"" her. Shes refering to the textmessages I sent her and the multiple times I called her.

Since then my life has been hell. For the next two months I felt like wanting to die every single day, every single moment. But its gotten better in the last few weeks, and Im actually feeling okayish again. But now my real problem begins.

To be 100% honest, I still love her, I still would do anything to be with her again, but I also know I will never see her ever again in my entire life, which is the worst feeling I could have ever imagined. If you knew the full story you´d probably tell me stuff like ""Forget her, she isnt worth it""...but in my mind? She is. Or lets just say, she was. I dont love the person she is now, but I still love the person she was when we were together. I still miss that person, and I probably will miss her for the rest of my life.

As I said, Im feeling better already, but I still cant seem to really enjoy things. Whatever I do, I feel ""ok"" or ""kind of good"", when I should feel amazing. Example: I met a girl, and she is actually really really nice. We already met a few times, I can talk to her for hours, we walked around hand in hand, we even made out already. We are pretty much ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" already. The only problem: I dont feel like I did with my ex, not even close, not even 1%. When im with her i feel kind of good, and thats the problem. Im sitting there like ""shouldnt I feel like Im on top of the world, but instead Im here like ""yeah, its pretty okay right now"".

When we were sitting together under the sky, after making out she was like ""does this situation even feel real to you right now? It feels so surreal"" and I was thinking ""To be honest... it doesnt even feel surreal, it feels normal, i know the feeling you mean, i had this exact feeling when I was with my ex. But right now? No, i dont have that feeling"" and i feel horrible thinking like that, since she is great.

I feel like I just cant really enjoy anything anymore, and whenever I should feel amazing, i just feel....okay.

\--------

A few years ago i met a guy online and we started dating. I didn't know much about him and never asked his surname. I knew he worked int the entertainment industry.

He was really nice and took me for dinners, gifted me a few dresses and made me feel good. The private parties were nice and it had this pretty woman vibe.

I come from a low income family and worked all my life. I surely were starstruck.

I never wanted him to pay things for me and refused any unreasonable gift. We dated for some months and i fell in love with him. One night, i kissed him good night and went back home.

He had some issues with one of his unreliable assistants and asked me to help out at a shooting and i said yes. I got a lot of compliments and have been told i got the talent to do this, why not making a carreer out of it. Some girls told me ""who he is"" and after some googeling i found out he was prettz known in his field and was pretty successful in his home country.

He gave me compliments as well and asked if i want to help him out after work, and so i did for a few months. I wanted to support him and figured his new company will struggle in the beginning.

The fancy parties and dinners started to chase and i found myself cooking and tidying up his place. He had some successful happenings and we came home happy of our work. We drunk a bit and ended up sleeping together.

A few months later he offered me to return with him to his country being his assistant and getting paid for my work. I accepted and went with him.

Everything changed. His additude got worse by the day. He became paranoid.

I got hit up by people on the streets and eventually had some pictures of me taken sunbathing in a park (were many people sunbathe). They threatened him to publish them and i got prohibited to go outside unless i went for groceries and do errants.

One day the police knocked at our door to tell him, he will be evicted if he doesn't pay rent. I found out he hasn't for more than 3 months. His projects didn't do well and the expensive lifestyle he had ate up a lot of cash. I kept buying essentials from my savings but knew i can't hold out for long.

He started to scream at me day by day. We got drunk one night fighting and he forced himself on me. I was able to leave the room and slept in the guestroom since then.

He reached out to old friends and it was the day i found out, he was living on lent money for the past two years. Basically since the time we met.

I felt like in a prison. I understood his side. He had cool projects but everytime things didn't work out. He got some cash to pay a few months rent but it wasn't enough.

One morning, after six months of moving in with him, i told him i will leave him. He told me i am ungrateful, he gave me so much. That night he tried again to have sex with me, and again i locked myself into to the guestroom.

I called my family and they bought me a ticket home. I stayed in contact with him, because i felt for him and after i got a job again i bought him groceries once a week via online-delivery.

A few months ago i was back on my feed and dept-free. He asked how i was doing and i told him.

Two months ago he contacted me again, asking me let him move in, buy him a ticket and he even contacted my family. I refused and got nothing but nasty comments from him.

I ghosted him. I care for him very much, but i can't let slip what happend and i still think a lot about it. I will never press charges. The situation was clear to me and i didn't got emotionally hurt by it.

TL;DR at the end
I am a high schooler, and like the millions of students affected by the current pandemic, I am online learning. Well I'm supposed to be... I know this is such a first world problem, but I can't focus on anything when I am at home and my lack of productivity has taken a huge toll on my mental health. I have been diagnosed with MDD, GAD, and have been prescreened (not officially diagnosed) with ADHD. I have contemplated and planned suicide before, and right before quarantine my mental health took a sharp turn for the worse. I was having major mood swings, hyperfocussing on mundane activities (like drawing over 100 rabbits in place of chemistry notes), and worst of all I contemplated suicide. Both of my parents are essential workers so I haven't told them about this current spiral and I'd like to keep it that way. Either way the point is that I have gotten next to nothing done and the emails are rolling in asking if I plan on passing my classes this year and if the work is too difficult. A few have sent out notices that they are willing to work with students that are behind and to email them for turning in missing work. The problem comes in that I don't think I'll be able to stay on a schedule if they try to help me by giving me one because I can't seem to get out of this loop of wanting to die, not being able to do any work, feeling an intense amount of guilt and stress, and repeating that for over 1 month.

I explain everyone is in the same boat and are following the rules, and also that she's a support worker and should know better. She agrees and says she understands.

Backstory: I grew up in a religion family in America and did most of what my father expected of me in my life and when it came time in my life for me to search and marry someone I broke the rules and had a out of marriage sexual encounter with my current girlfriend of the time. The relationship ended in May and then I meet my soon to be wife in July. When I realized I wanted to marry her I knew I had to confess to my church leader and repent but that would prevent me to getting married in the church.  My fiance understood and when I told my parents they thought it was because of my current fiance and I had to explain it was from a previous girlfriend that they had no idea I was dating in the first place.

After moving over 3,000 miles away and 5 years into out marriage, my wife and i decided to leave the church together not one pressuring the other to leave.  We also decided to only tell my family on a need to know if we were dealing with them in person but later we sent a massive Facebook post that we left the church when unanswered questions of our church activity were left open.  But my family doesn't communicate well and I don't know if that message was ever forwarded to my parents because they weren't on Facebook.

Main Story: After over 10 years of marriage, my wife still believes that my father thinks that it was my wife that convinced me to leaves the church and I could do nothing bad in my life. That I would still be the church if it wasn't for her. I was planning of leaving the church even before I meet my wife. So this leaves me to last night.

W: ""OP it still hurts me that you won't tell your father why you left the church and that this was a mutual decision.  He still thinks it was me that took you away from the church""

OP: ""I don't thinks it's necessary and how do you know he thinks that, did he tell you?""

W: ""No, it was the way he talked to me last time and how he instantly looked at me when we told them that we couldn't get married in the church. Why are you letting him hurt me this way?""

OP: ""So with no evidence that he thinks this way, you wan't me to tell my father why we left the church and that it was a mutual decision and that it wasn't you?""

W: ""Yes, why do you keep avoiding this subject, why do I have to yell at you to get you to do this?""

OP: ""I'll call him right now if you want.""

W: ""No, it's Sunday, but please call him in the next 7 days?""

OP: ""I will""

I'm frustrated that my wife wants me to do this despite not have actual evidence that my father thinks this way but I can understand that it will make my wife feel better. I wan't to ask my father if he thinks this way but I don't want to potentially ruin the relationship that I have with my father.  What should I do?",20Apr2020,1
577,"So I (21F) am becoming concerned about my health. It's been a bit since I weighed myself, but I am right around 200 pounds. 

I was sitting right around 160, until this last summer - I worked a retail job where there was some down time, and most of the food they cooked in the kitchen was fried food or pizza. I ended up eating a lot. I think I gained like 30 pounds in 3 months.

Anyway, I am home from college but over the past school year I think I've steadily been gaining a pound or two every couple of weeks. I think I am verging on becoming really unhealthy (just based on my habits) and I want to take some action before things become really serious and very hard to reverse.

The issue is that I have diagnosed severe anxiety, and am in a really difficult home situation now. I eat to help cope sometimes. My biggest issue is that I can't stop drinking tons of soda. I LOVE veggies, and I actually think I wouldn't have an issue cutting out most sweets. I think my primary issues food wise are that I can't drop soda (I've tried so many times) and that I'm awful with portion control. I also eat a lot of pasta because it's cheap and easy.

The other issue is that I have a really hard time getting motivated to work out. My energy levels tend to be really low because the anxiety is so exhausting, and when I do work out, I don't know what would help the most. 

Also, I had a pretty severe eating disorder in high school and so as a result I struggle to draw boundaries between whats healthy and what's not. In the past when I've tried to diet, its always lead to massive restricting that just isn't healthy and it's been really triggering. I'm just not sure how to approach this safely.

Since I have been quarantined at home, I have been doing even less physically and eating more out of boredom and stress. I have no idea how to get myself to make positive changes. What are some tips you guys have? Like I said I want to better my life and take action here. I'm really concerned that if I keep drinking soda at this rate I'm going to destroy my teeth and eventually end up pre-diabetic. I'm young and figure this will be easier to tackle now rather than later on down the line. I have a family history of diabetes and severe obesity.

Thanks in advance for any tips you have!",20Apr2020,1

579,"I'm recently now 18M and my mom got remarried a little over a year ago to a racist, homophobic, backwater tumor of a human. It started off small, being that he started being less and less polite to me during their dating life... then they got married so fast from just 4 months of dating and he moved in. Oh, and they went on honeymoon for 2 weeks in Maine over the span of me and my brother's birthdays. He (my stepdad) has a condition called CRPS in his foot due to a work accident before him and my mom dated, and it's one of the most painful diseases a human can experience. He has a machine installed on his spine that helps control pain somehow and takes heavy medication. Because of this, I tried so hard to cut him so slack, but he pushes my limits every day. He constantly talked shit about my real dad (and still does). Me and him fought (and still do) about almost everything and they forced me to go to therapy for ""anger management"", only to withdraw from it when they realized that the therapist was giving them advice they didn't like. I was 17 at the time.

I'm homosexual and have not come out to any family other than my siblings yet, and he's wildly homophobic and preaches about how all the gays need to be locked away and burned so they stop corrupting the minds of the youth. He also likes to preach about how ""blacks"" (he prefers a different word) do nothing but rob gas stations and eat watermelon. It makes me so angry and I can't stand it.

Recently our step-brother moved in after coming from an even more backwater place in my state after getting involved in a drug war and gave him one of my sibling's rooms. So now my 2 siblings have to share the smallest room in the house while he gets his own room. I tried to talk to my mom about it because I felt that it was unfair for them and we got in a big argument. 

With the isolation due to COVID-19, I've never felt so trapped. He's unemployed due to the CRPS I mentioned earlier so he's always in the house, with the door open, listening to everything I say. His room is at the top of the stairs where my room is, so he keeps track of when I go and leave my room and hollers my name every time he hears me or sees my shadow. It's usually asking me if I've done all my chores or telling me to do something for him, but he does it in such a rude and condescending way that I have to always go back to my room afterward and calm down. He's told me so many times that everything I do is for attention and that I need to grow up. He's even once tried to send me off to my grandparents for a month or two as punishment for ""talking back"" (telling how I'm feeling) when he talks condescendingly to me, but it didn't quite work out.

I feel like the way I've written all this isn't capturing the true rancid behavior of everything he's done, but there's only so much you can remember at once and put into a post on Reddit. Even though you can't really feel exactly what I feel through font on a screen, I hope some can sympathize with me to an extent.

I wanted to get a job a month or two ago to start saving enough to maybe be able to make it through life on my own and go to college, but I don't have a car (stepdad took mine) and have nobody to take me. So getting my own place is out of the question.

TL;DR: My stepdad is disrespectful and mentally abusive to me and my siblings. I feel that I'm constantly being watched, judged, and threatened by a racist, homophobic redneck ogre. I can either move to my grandparents for a short period of time, move in with a friend for a short period of time, or wait and suffer until after COVID-19 settles down and can start working on my future again. Please help, I'm so depressed.",20Apr2020,1
581,"Im so confused about how i feel. Me and my girlfriend have put together this amazing life together for the past 2 years, and everything has been going good for us. But theres this nagging fear that I dont love her. I dont understand, because i
I do very much so love her, More than anyone.

And im so scared. Im scared that im going to mess up this amazing life that ive made with her, that im just gonna repeat the life that my dad had by not giving her the love that she deserves. I desperately want me to be the one who loves her, but i feel like its never enough in my own head. I want to give her more and more, and i have this fear that im gonna give up too much of myself. My parents went through a rough divorce and my dad felt so betrayed by my mom that he shut himself off from the rest of the world. I dont wanna be that person. I dont wanna have such a difficult time letting people in fully. But i feel like a failure.

These feelings of being a failure are so reinforced by my upbringing and im so very scared of messing my entire relationship up just because of some unreasonable doubts that I have. Im scared of letting her in and letting her see those doubts and letting that side of me out.",20Apr2020,1
582,"I’ll try to keep this brief, but I don’t know where else to turn. Hopefully this all makes sense. 

A little bit of backstory, my sister and I were raised in an abusive household. I have always done my best to be there for her and refrained from cutting off an abuser until she went to college. That’s not to brag at all! Just to say that she has come before everything, even myself. 

Currently I am living with my grandmother and after months and months of saving I finally have enough for a deposit on my own apartment and a stable job I LOVE in my hometown. Never thought I would find something I could see myself at for years, but got really lucky with this one. Duties and people, both are fantastic. 

Anyway, my sister has decided she does not want to live on campus. She refuses to make friends (by her own admission, she does not like anyone there) so there is no one to be her roommate. So she approached me. 

Her college town is three hours away from my hometown and workplace. While that drive is not feasible for a daily commute, she came up with the plan that I could ask my boss to stay at one of the locations I work at (hotel) during the times I work and then come to the apartment during my time off. 

We would split everything down the middle, and while honestly I don’t mind helping her out and originally agreed to the idea, I’m beginning to grow resentful that (1) I would only be spending 20-30% of my time there if that and (2) the apartments in my hometown have availability while it will likely be June before the ones over there open up - if any do. 

Am I in the wrong?? If I tell her no I’m abandoning her and going back on what I said we could do, but if I say yes it’s just... I don’t know. So here I am, sorry if anything doesn’t make sense I’ll try to clear it up. I just need advice.",20Apr2020,1

585,"

So I’m 24 live at home and me and my parents are constantly at each other throats on a daily basis over various things and I don’t know what to do. My parents are annoying sometimes I didn’t turn out a perfect little  hard working angel. I turned out a fucking lazy bum becauseverything in my life was made so easy and done for me most times which is one reason why I don’t want a job. That and the virus rn which is also an issue. I want to move out but I can’t because I don’t have a job can’t get or because most places are closed so I’m stuck at home with my dumbass parents and I have to deal with them and their shit 24/7 basically. 
Example one common issue Is downstairs and decide to go up to jerk off or take a shit or whatever and almost always get asked where are going? Motherfucker it’s none of your god damn business if I’m going to beat off or shit or watch porn it’s none of their god damn business but they do it constantly. 
Another issue I pay rent but since they pay for the internet and stuff they use it against me as leverage I do something they don’t like boom no internet and they can turn if off while I’m gaming if im too slow to get off. 
Phone- this is big issue because I’m “addicted” to my phone apparently and can’t get off it which isn’t always true   But they had screen time blocks on my phone I got around it  and I’m 24 almost 25 I get treated like a child like why. They also nag me about being on my phone at dinner which is stupid like I eat dinner take my time and enjoy myself because I want to be left the fuck alone sometimes.
Working for parents- I do stuff for my parents for some money mainly errands pick up and deliveries grab lunch sometimes but all I am is a pack mule I feel like. Even stuff like he owns a machine shop and I have to help him some fair enough but when all I do is clean when In not a full time 40 hour a week employee to me is stupid. I don’t get paid to go in work and work 40 hours. I don’t do the stuff others do on a daily basis why should I be a mule and all I do is clean your stupid machines and mop your damn floor? 

TL;DR parents try to control stuff in my life and get have really been on my nerves recently. I can’t move out I really want to but don’t have a steady 9-5 job and can’t really get one anywhere because most places are closed because of the virus",20Apr2020,1
586,"2 days ago my cat brought it a small rabbit, it looks a little bigger than a baby but not full grown. So my cat brings in a rabbit and we think it is healthy enough to let back into the wild because the cat didn’t seem to do too much damage. Well we ended up getting the same rabbit back the next day and my cat is old so he’s not the best hunter and usually never brings alive things because he is too slow. So now we’re thinking it might be a domesticated rabbit that someone bought for Easter then realized they didn’t want to take care of a rabbit and thought it would survive in the wild, it looks about a month old, I wish I could attach a image, it looks a little fat so I think it was being taken care of. It has a rounder head and smaller ears which I read were signs of a domestic rabbit but I am definitely no expert so I am not sure even if I’m looking at it right. I don’t know what to do because I can’t release it back into the wild because my cat or another cat will get it again and I feel I would be torturing the poor animal if I did that so I’m not sure what to do can anyone help? 

It survived the night and is definitely still healthy but it won’t eat but it tried to drink last night I don’t know if it got any water or just spilled it does anyone also know what I can feed it that I would readily have at the house because I tried carrots and I’m not sure if that is just a cartoon thing or not.",20Apr2020,1

592,"I turned 18 a couple of months ago. My home life hasn't been great. My mom took my phone away like I was 12 because I didn't want to wash the dish for a meal I did not eat. Everything I do now makes her target me. Ex: ""Why did you slam the phone down?"" after I set something down ""Why won't you look at me?"" (As I watch TV?) She yelled at me this morning because I missed my first online class and I told her quite frankly I didn't have an alarm. What was I supposed to do? She slammed my door.

She turned the whole family against me and it makes me feel really bad. She loves my sister more than me by a long shot. My oldest younger sister (16) got cancer last year and she quickly became my mother's favorite. I understand the tough situation, but my sister absolutely hates my guts since we were kids. My mom says it's all my fault because I was constantly rubbing in her face I was so intelligent and academically better than her. A) I don't remember this B) if true I was probably a child and had no idea what I was doing and C) I asked her why she never told me to stop and she didn't answer me. She gangs up all my siblings on me and clearly loves them a lot more. I feel very outcasted in my own family. I see them doing family things like their all watching a movie together and doing each other's hair. I am stuck in my room because if I go out I'm a target. Any joke I make my mom screams at me because she doesn't get it, yet when my sister tells a joke she laughs. My other sisters don't like me because I was the disciplinarian figure growing up.

When my mom really blows up on me, it's horrible. She pulls my hair and slams me. She called me a whore for trying to get on birth control to manage painful periods. She made me quit my job after a month so I can work with her, which I hate and she never paid me for anyway. She calls me the stupidest person she has ever met, piece of shit, selfish, Sangana, (no direct translation but similar to bloodsucker, idiot, jackass)  She constantly rubs it in my face why I didn't get into my dream college despite being an honor roll student. (I am upset but it was competitive). One time I didn't clean my room so she hit me constantly with a clothes hangar and ripped my shirt off and made me clean it up shirtless. SHe lies, then hugs and kisses me and tries to be my friend. SHe's been mean to my other sister but they're children and easily forgive. One time my sister didn't want to eat her vegetables. My mom stuffed them in her mouth and my little sister threw up. My mom made her eat her throw up. She came running after me when I stood up for my sister.

I don't know if I should move out. My boyfriend has offered to let me stay with him and his family but obviously he hasn't cleared it with his parents. That situation would only be for 4 months (hopefully, if it doesn't go online) because we will be going to the same college in the fall. (Coincidentally, he's number 1 was my number 2, which accepted me). I don't have a job because my mom made me quit after a month and I have no money because I gave her my only paycheck, so I don't want to live rent-free and mooch off of them, but I don't have a choice esp. with the pandemic. His parents are really nice and kind, but I think they won't believe their son because their good friends with my mom and she always has a good face when people are around. It was manageable before my mom worked from home, now it's hell.

Am I justified in moving out? If so, what should my next steps be?",20Apr2020,1

I haven’t been to a dentist in years (In Kindergarten) was my last visit, due to a free dental checkup which was held by the school. (I’m 18 now) I haven’t had the chance to go to since my family was always dirt poor. Growing up, there wasn’t enough money to buy toothpaste and all the other necessities for dental hygiene. 

Over the years my teeth have become super gross. I have really bad cavities (I think that’s what they’re called) on my teeth and I really want to get rid of them, or at least reduce the amount of it. 

The problem is, I’m scared. I’m not scared of *going* to the dentist. I’m just scared of what the dentist will say when they see my teeth/figure out it’s been a very long time since I’ve had a checkup on my teeth, because I don’t wanna live like that anymore.

Guy in question- K. Early Teens.

I met K when me and my family moved earlier this year. It was about 3 hours away and we knew no one. I got settled in quite quickly and K was my last class of the day. I noticed him almost immediately, as he was quite tall and pretty cute. We got along quite well, we both liked to read and he'd compliment the doodles that I'd draw in class. About a week before school was canceled I gave him my number.

We started talking about anything that came to mind, so much that I knew more about him than what I knew about my old friends. One day it was late, and we were both being tired and stupid. I called K and after a while I made a choice that I'm starting to regret. I took off my shirt and bra in front of him. We were both being awkward about it and then after a while I hung up and I just stared at my wall. I felt this weird and dirty feeling when I did it. It felt wrong, but I'm just glad I didn't send him a picture- my older brother warned me about that. 

It's been a few weeks since then and we haven't talked about it. Until recently we kinda slipped into dirty talk and it felt super weird. Throughout the entire thing he'd ask me for nudes and ask for any picture. I kept on telling K no, and that I didn't feel comfortable doing so. After that we hung up and I've tried talking to him a little bit since then but K hasn't been responding. I still really like K and I still want to talk to him. But what should I do?

600,"About a three months ago I (m20) was at a party where I met a nice girl (f15). She was really nice and kind, and we really hit it of talking. After a while we went for a walk and had a long conversation. For more context: I had been drinking, she was sober, also the age of consent where I live is 16. Then as we were walking she started kissing me, and I didn’t stop her at first, but after about a 2 minutes or so I did. She apologized, but I then apologized to her because I was clearly in the wrong. The vibe wasn’t weird afterwards and we kept talking. When we got back some people asked if we did anything but we both said no. The day after I felt really guilty about it, but the guilt faded away that day. My life went on like nothing happened. Then suddenly a couple of weeks ago, I saw something that reminded me of it, and now I can’t stop thinking about it. I feel so guilty. There has not gone a day by where I don’t succumb to the guilt trips. I am also afraid people will find out eventually and that my reputation will forever be destroyed. I have tried to justify in my head, but I can’t. And when try justifying It, I feel even more guilty for trying to justify it. I hoped that reflecting on it would help the problem fade, but it just makes it worse. Everyday it takes up more of my headspace and I can’t focus properly anymore. I’m afraid to tell anyone, because I’m afraid of facing judgement. And when I catch my self feeling bad because I’m afraid of judgement, I feel even worse because I’m feeling bad for myself rather than her. It’s an endless loop of self loathing and guilt that gets worse every day. I have had unhealthy thoughts that I never imagined that I would ever have. It has gotten to the point where people have caught me in a thought loop and couldn’t get my attention at first, and then asked if anything was wrong. I always say I’m fine, and it’s just work being stressful at the moment. I feel like a horrible person, and I probably am. I feel bad for her and I’m also paranoid that someone will find out.

Within the past year, there have been countless calls to the police either over physical abuse, stolen property, a psychotic break, etc. He's shown up at my house in the middle of the night several times because he needed somewhere to stay or get away. She's told him she'll kill him, he can't leave her, on and on. I know that he's scared to try to leave her because he doesn't want the situation to blow up and I've given him every bit of advice and resources to try to help him. I've opened my doors any time, I've given money, I've done anything that was needed. 

Over the weekend, another situation occurred where my brother was forced to find somewhere else to stay as his girlfriend had stopped taking her meds again and, since we're on quarantine, he couldn't stay at my house. He let me know what was going on Saturday and kept me updated throughout the afternoon and evening. I didn't hear from him Sunday, but chose not to reach out as I have pretty moderate anxiety and decided to give myself a mental break and just spend time with my kids and husband. I knew if he needed anything, he'd reach out. 

This morning, Monday, I started to get a little worried because I hadn't gotten a text, call, or he hadn't updated social media since Saturday. I sent a quick text just asking how things were going and didn't receive a response. After 30 minutes, I called as I was concerned that I hadn't received a text back. At this point, I had a full blown anxiety attack. I was sweating profusely, my heart was beating out of my chest, I was vomiting, etc. I was in the process of reaching out to my dad to ask if he'd heard from him when I received a text back that said he was fine. Before I had time to respond, he called and basically yelled at me for being ""dramatic"" and ""blowing up his phone"". To be fair, I do agree that my anxiety got the best of me, but I hadn't expressed that to him. I sent one text message and called once after 30 minutes of no response. 

This has happened several times in the past. He's reached out to let me know what's going on and I've helped in any way I could. I've given space when I knew it was needed and I never ""blow up his phone"". Then when I reach out after several days of hearing nothing, I get screamed at and made to feel crazy. Honestly, I feel taken advantage of and abused. I feel like I'm always there when he needs me, but if I reach out when he hasn't, I get yelled at and told that I'm crazy. How do I help someone like this?",20Apr2020,1
603,"So I'm 18 (since 6 months ago so I'm still kinda figuring out adult stuff) and have only had part-time summer jobs since 2018, so I never made enough money to file taxes or really do anything with the forms sent to me (also I had no adults teaching me what to do so it all kinda confuses me). 

I fit all the requirements for receiving a stimulus check (I live in the U.S. btw), but because I never filed taxes that means I have to fill out a form the IRS has for non-filers to get it.

I was doing pretty well on it until it asked my AGI from 2018, which I know what that is after a lot of looking up and video watching, but the only thing I ever got in 2018 was a W-2 which apparently does not tell you your AGI. I tried accessing my online transcripts on the IRS site that has all those forms but I don't have the things they say you need to prove your identity like loans, a credit card, a mortgage, etc.

Is there any other way to get it or should I just give up? I don't want to put in the wrong number and get in trouble or something.",20Apr2020,1
604,"So I got one of those very distinguishable phishing mails. It’s this weird Indian guy saying he has a video of me masturbating to weird porn and I have to donate bitcoin in the next 24 hrs or he’s going to send it around to everyone I know. Now for over a year I’ve always covered my camera with tape or my thumb whenever I’m doing something (thanks, Black Mirror). So I know this isn’t true.

Of course usually I am going to be like “uh, trash.” However, this mail has my password to my email almost completely correct? And it’s a very specific password. He got it up until, like, one letter. Now I’m wondering, is there some type of way these people are able to get part of a password? By just guessing or getting clues somewhere?

606,"I'm going to give you a background about my feelings. My mother, is a very bipolar person, one time she is very calm and trying to be funny (wich she fails every time, and gets angry when no one laughs), and the other she is not thinking, shouting, calling names to me and my father etc. I really love her, but some times she gets really uncontrollable, and some times when she admits she was wrong, its only like between 2h and years that she actually admits. Things that she gets mad to: me crying, me or my father not understanding what she is saying, us forgeting something normal or my father's habits, because he kinda had to educate himself (my grandparents are from the countryside of Portugal, and my father although he was going to drop school, he was one of the best in his class, and his teacher asked my grandparents on her knees for him to stay at school).

&amp;#x200B;

In the other side there's me, a person that is very shy, don't have a lot of friends, although I don't have problems with self esteem and confidence, well, at least when it comes to social life. At home, I spend 90% of my time in my computer, 5% playing with my brother, and 5% doing other things outside my room. I do this, since I can do many things, get better at many things etc. and I don't get in the middle of a argument beteween my mother and my father. Inb4 they don't seem to going to get a divorce, they really love eachother and don't want that either. When I try to confront my mom (but literally) just her, I start crying,without crontrol, and I think its beacuse I feel some sort of uncapability, since she doesn't care about the argument, and just starts shouting, calling me names and saying that she is going to beat me, or she does that AND tells me how difficult it was for her living in Angola when she was a child. When I start crying she just does that but being more threatening.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to recently, when the quarantine started (earlier than the US), and I've been spending 15/24 hours on my pc. I always keep my door closed, since it's like something that sperates me from them. And I also hate feeling like I'm being observed, since, for some fucking reason my mother loves to comment and judge other peoples lives. And while I don't really feel affected by strangers comments, I hate my mothers comments cause she can be ignorant, arrogant, everything, just like a Karen, and for some reason, I keep thinking about those comments, and feeling bad. Today, before lunch, the said ""today you are not shutting your door"", and I accepted, she already did this sometimes, and then said ""and nomre eating in there"". OK. Then lunch, she starts telling that to my father, I start getting nervous, then from nowhere she just says that its going to be everyday. I start getting nervous, remembering I cant do shit to argument, I cry, still can't argument, she just does the usual stuff (threatening beating, telling me about her life in a threatening tone, etc.), start saying (like everytime) thet I can't control it.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't care about the beating, it's fast pain and I wont remember it, but knowing that I can't share nothing with my parents without them judging me, has made me more distant from them, and don't want to live like that.",20Apr2020,1
607,"I have a weirdly specific issues and I don't know if it has anything to do with me being on the spectrum.

I got diagnosed when I was very young and could not have had more support from my parents, I am now 27. I pretty much learned from the ground up how to be likeable and easy to get on with but I'm kind of a social butterfly because over time my jokes don't strike the same cord, my stories aren't as interesting and slowly I seem to be edged out.

609,"Background:
My roommate and I have been living together for a little over a year, I'd say for only knowing each other for about two years we're fairly good friends, and we're both on the lease. We live in a US state that's currently in an informal lockdown due to covid19. By informal I mean it's not against the law to do unnecessary shit here yet. You can still drive around aimlessly, visit stores as often as you'd like, and congregate in groups, but I'd say most people here are taking it seriously and following advice to limit exposure by only leaving for necessities.

Problem:
Today is my roommate's birthday. I noticed a case of beer in the fridge and two bottles of rum in the freezer. He doesn't drink often at all so I asked him what was up. He said he's got ""like 3 maybe 4"" people coming over for a small birthday bash. We've had an agreement since all this shit started to limit ourselves to only necessary exposure.

WTF can I do? These people are going to be in our house, using our bathroom, breathing our air. Touching door handles, using glassware, going in and out of our fridge. I have no idea where these people have been the last month, but I can surmise that if they're the type of people to agree to attend a get-together amidst this nonsense, then they're definitely not the kind of people taking this shit seriously and I don't want them anywhere fucking near my house.",20Apr2020,1

We kept in touch for a few years but eventually he told me to forget, move on and never contact him again. It was hurtfull obviously, but I can understand why he said that. I didn't message him again. Now after some more time, he liked a picture of me. I know he doesn't use social media all that much. 

Why did he like this? Is he reaching out to me? Was it a mistake? Will he be mad if I message him?

613,"Hey sweet redditors! 

I've been a silent reader here for a while. But currently I'm facing a struggle to which I don't know the answer, and thought that maybe an outsider perspective could help. If you have sound advice or have lived through a similar experience, it would be nice to hear if you can share some things that have helped you. I feel like any step I take is a step backward for me/anyone around me.

So I am a 24y F of mixed marriage (Moroccan dad + Caucasian mom). My upbringing was very strict, couldn't do much: no sleepovers, no makeup, no loose hair - always ponytail, not going to the city center alone (after 16 I finally did this). My mom always tried to weigh in with reasoning but he always shut her down pretty quickly.

Fast forward to last januari, I got a place for myself in another city with roommates which he agreed to - because of my uni I had to travel a lot and this would mean less travelling time. I told him I also wanted a place for myself but he did not like that idea and said that was not 'necessary'. Now with Corona uni is closed and I 'could' go home, it's just that I study better in my own place and next to that I don't want to hand in my freedom to stay at my parents all week (I do go there on the weekends for work). He wants me to stay and  now it escalated into a disagreement. He has been throwing tantrums basically and does not want to talk to me because I choose to stay in my own place. And now I just got a call from my mom that they are divorcing, telling me that my dad is being dramatic and saying that his children will not get their share of his house when he would pass (he also has issues with my brother).

My dad is a difficult man, but he is still my dad. I have called him and he will not pick up. Last weekend I was at home and talked with him, which only happened after he ignored me for a whole day. He thought I would just go to back to my own place for a day or two and come back straight after to stay at my parents' place. I told him I didn't want that, and would come on thursday. He doesn't like it and thinks I should stay home with them. I feel sad because he is depressed and stressed, even though he called this upon himself. I love him and don't want him to feel alone in this time. He does not have family where we live, they are all in Morocco. I feel responsible to just make amends so he feels better. But on the other hand I don't want to give in my freedom and feel like if I would make amends I would never ever be able to live on my own again.  Basically, I would just be able to live on my own if I would work 2+ hours from home or would marry someone (not in the cards lol, I am single as a pringle).

Also, he is a smoker, has some heart-related complaints and is a little overweight. He seems depressed and I am seriously worried about his health. I don't know if I could forgive myself would anything happen to him.

What does one do?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: having issues with my moroccan dad. He is overprotective and wants me to stay at their home since uni is closed and he thought I had my own place only for cutting travelling time to uni. Now he doesnt want to talk to me and he and my mom will divorce. I am afraid of his health and am contemplating if I should really push through so I can be 'free', or if I should give in and be there for him, given that he is in the risk group and might get seriously ill.",20Apr2020,1
614,"I'm (26 m) in a five year relationship with a high functioning alcoholic (29 m). Over the course of our relationship he's been to detox twice, been hospitalized twice for withdrawals and once for pancreatitis. Each time he's been to detox, he's been sober for three months and then slipped back off the rails.

This time he's probably been the worst he's been, lost his driving licence, lost his job and has been progressively getting worse and worse in my eyes.

A common thing in our relationship has been that he's always said ""don't talk to me about my drinking"".
This is currently the main problem in our relationship, where any talk about his drinking just causes an argument and he gets super defensive.
I feel like I should be able to talk to my partner about a pretty serious problem that's affecting me but constantly being told not to talk about it has made me feel like my feelings don't matter.

He says he's trying to work on his drinking but when I see him drink half a bottle of vodka a day (down from a cask of wine a day admittedly) and then when it impacts his job, and our financial situation, it just doesn't feel like he's doing anything to help.

For people who do not know what is tinnitus , it is a constant ringing in your ears when there's no sound around you. It is really annoying.

For people who do not have it, you might have experienced it maybe after a party with loud music for a day or two and then it goes away. Feel free to check for yourselves how it sounds like on youtube there is plenty of videos. 

Myself, i suffer from it everyday, every night. It all started after i got hit by a car , i flew and hit my head on the ground. Most annoying times are when i have to study for midterms or finals because i study with no sounds around me. 

I noticed that stress , lack of sleep and exposure to loud music/sounds make it worse.

620,"In retrospect I was really stupid. So I with quarantine I have been getting into online dating, and sometimes (more often than not, or at least with me) people have been eager to start during naughty stuff over cam pretty soon. Maybe it's the medium of communication makes people feel more open to being sexual right away. 

So I have been talking to this girl for a week or so now, and she wants my phone number. So I give it to her. We text a bit, and this morning on facebook video call she starts getting naked and being all coy and naughty, using a dildo, the whole bit. Her fb profile says she was born 1 year after me, so we are close in age (ostensibly), and I'm getting turned on. I'm a little taken aback, but hell I haven't been laid in 4 years, and she asks if I will show her my penis, so I do. Its fun for about two minutes, and then she projects her screen onto mine and starts playing a loop of me without any pants on, jerking it, and threatens to tell the cops and everyone that I'm a child molester and that I masturbated in front of a six year old. Then she tells me she has a sick daughter in the Ivory Coast somewhere and she needs $1500. I made a poor decision I know, but I was lonely, and morning horny. It was a mistake, and I've always hated the part of myself that gives in to horniness too often by dating problematic partners, or getting into online chats too much, and it feels like I've rolled the dice one too many times, and that I've just thrown away my life.

628,"Background: My brother (M17) has always been a trouble maker but as he entered his teenage years, he has gotten worse. My dad being an alcoholic and my mom has depression. It gets crazy in the house once in a while. My parents are often fighting but me and my brother are usually not involved in that. Now that we have been in quarantine, it has gotten worse at home. Therapy has been mentioned, but has never been taken seriously. When it was brought up to my brother, he said “f*ck off, you need one yourself” 

My brother manipulates my parents, especially my mom. She usually believes whatever he says (where he is, who is goes out with, etc). She likes to have trust in her kids, which I completely understand. But that trust should be lost when your child is constantly lying left and right ...
Also, we found a bunch of marijuana things in his room hidden and he manipulated our mom saying that it’s his friends. His friends smoke and many have gotten in trouble with police. He is extremely disrespectful to my parents, but is even worse to me when they are not around. 
He says things to my parents like “You deserve for someone to spit in your face”, “I promise you, one day you will never see me again”. He takes the car when he doesn’t even have his license. I don’t remember the last time I actually heard him talk normally without him screaming or cursing. He gets mad over everything and anything. He refuses to even say hello/ good morning back in the morning to anyone, and gives a dirty look. He refuses to eat with the family, just because he knows it upsets my parents. Instead, he comes to eat 30 minutes later... the list goes on and on. 

Today, I was trying to make myself some food and so was he. I placed my pot down, and he didn’t like where I put it although it was not in his way at all. He took the pot and set it on the other side of the kitchen and said “I am here. You funny if you think you’re gonna be here too. Get the f*ck out of my way” I proceed with saying “but I’m not in your way. You have more than enough room” and put my pot back to where it was. He got back and pushed me against the cabinet. My mom was there and all she said was “hey hey hey that’s enough. Too much!” And he replied “she deserves for me to spit in her disgusting f**cking face”. I lost my appetite completely and locked myself in my room. My mom ended up telling him that he made me cry and got more joy out of it and replied “I don’t give a f**k, she deserves more than that. No one gonna be in my f*cking way. Stupid b*tch”. 

I just can’t stand it. My parents don’t discipline him. I know it may be harder now that he is older but it’s actually terrible here. I am afraid that he will end up on a bad path, if he didn’t already. He fights, lies, emotionally abuses everyone, threatens his friends with burning their houses down or hurting them (I overhear his convos from my room), and now he is starting to try to physically hurt his family members (me).

Before the virus, I sold tickets to various major amusement parks. As you can imagine, that isn't really the case any more. Luckily I did more than sell tickets, things like marketing and development for our Facebook and website.

Well that work only lasted a few weeks. I'm also teleworking, and they expect me to track what I work on everyday and send it in. Last week there was hardly any work left for me to do.

Here's the problem, today my weekly work report and my hours are due, and I'm not sure whether I should fib and make up things I worked on but didn't really do, or if I should come clean and tell my boss that there wasn't much to do.

I'm aware I should have brought up this issue to her sooner during the week but I did what I could and now it's past that.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",20Apr2020,1
632,"I joined Reddit because I would always see interesting posts shared to other social media sites. It seemed really interesting, but when I started I found myself not understanding a lot of the social etiquette, but I managed to learn it slowly. 

I also began noticing that a there is a lot of cynicism surrounding what people post, specifically ones that other people criticize as fishing for upvotes. So, my question is: is that why we are all here? Is it just to win approval? 


I’m feeling very unsure after a post I shared completely backfired. All I meant was to share comfort to people hurting, because that’s who I am irl. A healer of hearts and a comforter. People were so *mean*! They called it cringy and self-serving, or using a sad time to get upvotes. Is this level of cynicism part of the culture here? What is *here*, exactly, is what I’m asking?",20Apr2020,1
633,"I need some advice.

My wife and I have been living 5.5 (350 miles) away from the city where we are originally from for the past 5 years.  We actually like where we currently live, and have very good work-life balance.  Good commutes (20 minutes on streets not highways) and love our neighborhood.

My wife has a job opportunity that would bring us closer to home (and parents) to where it would only be a little over an hour away.

We are currently expecting our first child.

Our parents still live in the city where we are from originally and are around 70 years old.   We love the thought of our parents being more involved in our child's life.

The snag is that my only job prospect is in the city we are from, but it would be an hour commute from where her new job would be.  So we would like closer to her job, but I would have a 1 hour commute each way.

So we would be trading off being closer to family and friends with disrupting a very good daily routine and I would have a 1 hour commute (via highway) each way.  I will be able to telework 1 day each week which makes it a little less bad.

We are really grappling with this decision because we have always said we wanted to get closer to home and are afraid to pass up on the opportunity.  At the same time, we don't want to create a stressful environment for ourselves.  We want to be able to devote all of our energies into a full happy life for our child.",20Apr2020,1
634,"My mother has suffered from Chronic Migraine since I remember, there's not much to do for her when she gets it other than just take her pills and wait. Many times it can last days. Last year her neurologist applied for an experimental treatment for her, she accepted the terms and it's a molecule that has to be given to her once a month, it's about $900 a shot. the lab donated to her a year worth of the medication. she went from having migraines 4/5 days a week to once or twice a month. 

About 6 months ago her neurologist moved to a different state, after that there was always some sort of trouble every time she would go to the pharmacy to get the shot, apparently her insurance has to approve her to get the shot even tho they are not paying for anything since it's a donation. 3 months ago the insurance decided that they wouldn't approve her to get the shot anymore (there's was still 3 months left of the treatment) and now my mother is back to having migraines all the time. I wanted to know if there's anything to do about it or if that's even legal.

640," Im a 17 year old male living in Serbia.

I dont know where to start. Ive been fascinated with computers and sort of that way of living for the majority of my life. As with anything this fascination began when I was idk about 12\\13. I loved the way that doing complex math, and writing code looked like, it was as shallow and as simple as that. So I instilled in my mind that I wanted to be a software engineer, nevermind the fact that I had no idea what that meant at the time.

Although I always was an arguably very intelligent kid and had an above average reasoning skill. I never put this to good use since I never really wanted to put in the effort to actually know math very well. I always passed with mostly B's and some odd A. And sometimes I would go to competitions but I would still rely on my good sense of reasoning to do the work and never actually practiced math. The other thing is that I was always a theater kid and was very keen on being in the drama club, so that conflicted with my shallow inspirations of being an engineer or whatever.

But, come seventh grade and i dropped my silly aspirations of becoming an actor, come to think of it I dont really miss it anyhow. During this time I was about 12 idk, and I enrolled into a private programming school, which I didnt take seriously for like 2 years. I notice now this pattern of behaviour, I want to learn something but then I just dont after a while, and I hate myself for it. After these 2 years of not learning and slacking off on my parents money came the first time I learned about printf when the actually hard working kids were already well into object oriented programming. Come high school and I actually decided to take this seriously. I did start doing math very well, 'understanding' it more than I ever did, although I have the sense that high school math isnt actual real math, but what do I know. And programming was going really well, I still relied on my ol' reliable flawed sense of reasoning, but this time I actually put in more work than I ever have into something, I felt motivated. That lasted for about 1.5 years until I started doing pointers in c++ and got an F because I was lazy. After this F I started falling behind the material, and I slowly stopped caring.

A little bit before this infamous F that haunts me to this day, I enrolled into a research station called ""Petnica"", where they take selected gifted youngsters and teach them about anything they want. I fell into the programming group, because my essay relied heavily on that topic. It was fun, people were great mostly. But thats when I got my lingering sense of inadequacy. Where all the people were crazy about computers, had much higher skill levels then me and were even younger in most cases by a year. I even met one of my best friends there. This best friend is much much more intelligent than me, he reads more than me, knows more than me about almost every topic, has a lot of life experience even though hes only 2 years older. Ive talked to him about this and he told me that hes not that much smarter than me, hes just much more hard working. But I dont feel this way, even when I try something, I have this feeling that his int stats are just naturally higher than mine and he gets things A LOT easier than me. Youtuber Exurb1a put it best in the video where hes talking about our pets watching tv with us. They dont get it, they just simply cant. Its not in their reach and it never will be. I feel like the pet next to this guy.

Now that I have blabbered about myself endlessly, my question arises. Am I a fool for going into something just because 6 years ago I thought it looked cool? I didnt exaclty phrase that correctly, I actually enjoy learning about technology and software engineering. But when it comes to typing out the code and learning how to deal with the motherfucking pointers, which arent even that hard, I just have the wish to take my pc and burn it. And thats the thing, none of these things are h a r d. I grasp them within my mind, I understand how they work beneath the hood. I just get confused often when writing code, for no obvious reason. My brain just goes into poop mode. And thats when I get the feeling that Im doing something out of my reach and something that I wasnt meant for. I simply dont know what Im doing.

But when I do learn something I have an immeasurable joy. How do I combat my feelings and is this the right thing for me?",20Apr2020,1
641,I am so sorry for my punctuation. I never went to school and learned how to use proper punctuation... Okay so here's what happened. I was at work last night and I went to the bathroom. one of cleaning the ladies came in and ask if anybody was in there. I said yes be out in a minute and when I came out she asked if anyone  else was in there. I said one other guy was. I started walking away I got about ten feet away and she asked me what I was doing in there and I said I don't think that was any that was any of your business she immediately got really upset and defensive and asked what stall I was in. I told her what I do in the bathroom is my business. it's not for her to ask me. she said that she was looking for somebody is why she asked really angrily. I told her that there was only one other guy in there and he was an employee. he was washing his hands so he will be out in a minute. she continued on saying that I was being sensitive and getting mad and I need to keep my bulshit under control. I walk away and continue to go to work and I'm in the sugar aisle. she follows me and grabs another co-worker and pulls him to the end of the aisle and points at me and the guy starts nodding his head and they walk away. I ask another co-worker that walks into the aisle if he needs any help and he tells me to go and grab a pallet with noodle stuff and what not on it and start work it. so I go to the back and grab a pallet jack to grab the pallet. as I'm getting it the guy that the lady  grabbed followed me to the back and tells me to grab a different palette with Gatorade and juice and just generally much heavier things. I told him that I was told to grab this so I'm going to go ahead and get it and pull it out. he tells me that I'm doing too much. I grab the pallet and carry it out and he follows me all the way to where I put it out at and he tells me that I'm doing too much and I just need to do what I'm told and that if I don't want to do what I'm told that I need to go clock out and I told him that he was not my boss and that he did not have the authority tell me to clock out (he's just another stocker) he says ok then and he goes to get the guy who is in charge of all this of all the stocking and he calls me over and already has the cleaning lady with him and asks me what my problem is and I try to explain the situation and what happened in the bathroom and with her pulling the other guy over and pointing at me and he ask me why I'm yelling  (i really don't think I was) and she says you don't know what I was telling him you have no idea it didn't even have anything to do with you I told him she walked out of her way grabbed him and stood at the opening of the aisle and pointed at me and they both nodded their head and smiled and it was on camera and she got really mad and said I don't give a fuck what's on camera you motherfucker and the guy is over stocking grabs her and pulls her away and tells me to go work with somebody else on the other side of the store so I do that and got finished within 15 minutes of that conversation and I walk to the back to throw away my trash and the guy that she went and grabbed that told he to clock out and went and got that manager or whatever to send me home was back there with all the other guys I'm telling the story of how he sent me home in this is where I might should have shut up but I said I'm still here and he said that he was going to beat my ass and the guy who's overstocking that came and talked to me was probably 10-15 feet away and I said he just said that he was going to beat me up and he walked away ignoring the situation and everybody walked past me and he was laughing. About 20 minutes later I went on break and I called my mom told her the situation and ask her what I should do. She told  me that I needed to leave because that is a hostile work environment and since the stocking manager wouldn't do anything there was a risk for my safety since I walk home every night and we all get off at the same time that I needed to just come in the morning and plead my case with the manager of the store now here I am laying in bed thinking if it's really even worth it do I have any ground to stand on? How do I go about it? I have to be at work at 3 and I need to work this out before that. What do I do.,20Apr2020,1
642,"My husband and I just welcomed our beautiful baby girl into the world a few weeks ago. Before she was born he was on the edge of it all, He was considering suicide. But luckily he stayed strong and is still here today. I am extremely thankful for him staying strong. Hes such a beautiful person and he is my best friend, other half, my world. Id be lost without him.  Even though before she was born he was a bit disconnected from me. The second he held her I could see something switch inside him. He was always asking me how he could help and would hold her almost any chance he had. But this last week or so he has slipped back into his bad place and I dont know how to help it. He ignores everyone including me, or gives head nods or one word responses. He slugs around the house and is distant with everyone. If we ask him for help i feel like im asking him to pull out his own teeth. Whether its ""Hold the baby while zi go pee for a minute"" or ""Come help with laundry"" t breaks my heart, We were doing so good with helping eachother, supporting eachother. All of it. We've been through alot, and most of the bad we've been through was because of his lack of communication, or just not caring about anything. And I believe he wont forgive himself for what hes done no matter how many times I forgive him and express that ive never changed the way I view him. I dont know if hes just reflecting and its making him depressed or if theres something else and he just wont talk about it. He wont talk about anything really. Im hoping this will just phase through but I wanna help him as much as possible. He hadnt been working even before the virus started, but he was finally ready to start working again and now the world is shut down. I know thats taking a toll too, but hes also passed on the chance to go work again. Hes not helping himself and he wont let anyone help either. He ignores me and his daughter unless theres a true reason he feels the need to interact. We are quarantineed with his mom and step dad who i am not the biggest fan of for everday interaction. His mom helps me with the baby alot so i cant be too negative about the living situation. But im losing my mind, I feel deprived of affection and just overall good human interaction. I miss him being a person with me, I want him to feel okay again or at least content. I dont want him to look back on this time of our daughters life and regret not just powering through and being there for her. I was diagnosed with Postpartum Anxiety and was told to get therapy but ive just been powering through and doing everything for her because I know if I shut down theres a chance he wont chime in to help either. She needs her parents, a mom and a dad. I cant do this alone.. He was so good with her, but once about 2 and a half weeks hit. Hes been slowly drifting and is now here. I stay up day in and day out trying to be supermom for our daughter. Its really hard but I will do anything for her. And ill do anything to help him back on his feet.  Any advice on how to help him wiggle out of his depressive state? Or how to get him to help without it feeling like the worse thing in the world? How to I make this easier for all of us? Ive tried talking to him so thats not even an option. Ill answer any questions if itll help anyone figure out the best way to go about this. Any input is appreciated even if its not the best thing to hear. I just want to give my baby a good life and I want my Husband to feel alive again.",20Apr2020,1
643,"Hello Reddit. I work at a delivery company that I won't name. The company gives out contracts to other companies to take care of deliveries in different cities. The contractor that hired me recently sold their contract of my location to another company. My original contractor called me and asked if I wanted to switch over to another delivery company they contract with, this would be a mostly lateral transfer but with a slight increase in pay and I can take my work van home which is great because my car is about to die on me. I'm ready to jump on this offer. The contractor I work for isn't very well organized but they take care of employees they find value in. However, today was the first day the new contractor started and they pulled me aside and gave me a counteroffer: stay with the current delivery company now contracted under them and receive a management position as well as a big, nearly double, increase in pay. The downside to this offer are moderately huge: They want to fire pretty much everyone else, they don't offer hourly but rather subcontractor salary as a 1099 employee which means no benefits and I have to deal with taxes. So if I stay with my original contractor and transfer to the other delivery company I'll get less pay and I won't be a boss but I'll be guaranteed benefits and as a W2 employee I'd feel like have a bit more job security. If I go with the new contractor I'll have significantly better pay but being a 1099 employee might make me uncomfortable, and getting rid of most of my current co-workers (problematic as they may be) would make me feel like the bad guy.",20Apr2020,1

For me it is dating my best friends brother. My current boyfriend I was best friends with his sisters. Sister 1 was my best friend and she struggles with anxiety and was in a toxic relationship. I supported her and put her above myself for two years. We knew she would be fine with the relationship but sister 2 is batshit. We knew no matter when or how we told her she would flip shit. So we hid it for a month to make sure we thought it would work and to find a way to tell them that would have the least impact on sister 1 because she was my first priority. During this month a really close friend of mine died and I got complete radio silence from sister 1 (my best friend) and all I saw was her canceling plans and hanging out with my ex boyfriend and one of our friends. After about 4 days I called her out and told her she was being a bad friend. I didn’t realize she was going through a depressive episode (and I had no way of knowing). Anyways she got offended and then a week later they found out we were dating. Sister 2 flipped shit, as expected. Called us liars and caused scenes at family events and sister 1 and I are on okay terms again. She is still offended that I accused her of being a bad friend when I was hiding something from her, but I was only hiding it from her so sister 2’s reaction didn’t deteriorate her mental health.",20Apr2020,1
648,"Things with my parents have always been rocky and I really wish I grew up without a dad. I'm sick of all the abuse, the degrading, the need to control every aspect of my life, never letting me leave the house and never letting me talk to my friends which worked out perfectly because I'm a hardcore loner now. 

I still remember his loud screams breaking glasses and making my mum cry all the time. The details are fuzzy because I had to block most of it because I have no outlet or friends to share stuff with or any proper way to deal with my extreme anxiety towards literally any situation. He scared me a lot. Because he is different. I can handle abuse I think but I can't handle the unexpectedness of his ways. If I cried after he hit me he told me that if I blinked he would hit me and as a kid I would try to keep my eyes open stupidly but I had to blink and then he hit me. Him going to my parent teacher conferences and berate me telling them that I'm always writing random nonsense or drawing instead of focusing on what's important and he really tries to help me with school (he never did) but I am just a slow learner. The teachers always felt bad for me. Like most other people. 

And it all got worse when I started getting drugs from people at school but I just started having really bad trips and my paranoia and anxiety was just too much so on a particularly bad trip I overdosed on sleeping pills. I freaked out that if I don't die then he'll beat the shit out of me for doing something stupid so I went to the emergency department of a random hospital in my drug induced state and told them that I overdosed but refused to disclose any information on who I am or my parents numbers or address. 

They said that they would have to put me up on the news so that my parents come forward to contact me if I don't cooperate so I tried escaping telling them I need to use the restroom while trying to ho down the fire escape. Didn't work obviously. So I gave in and told them my parents details. My dad looked at me in an unreadable expression and I just wanted to die oh god why is that so hard. I had to be taken the the icu and I got really dizzy at that point. I heard all the nurses talking about me and the police arrived. It's a protocol when someone overdoses. They asked me questions on why I did it or was someone threatening me etc but I couldn't speak because my stomach was being pumped out and a tube was lodged in my throat and I was just so drowsy. They said they'll see me tomorrow. 

I was released from the icu in 3 days and those were the loneliest and worst days I've ever had to go through. My mom came to visit me on the second day and she was crying. She said that from that day on I was dead to her and went on and on about how selfish I was and how much I had financially drained my family due to hospital expenses. All the nurses were judging me and yeah I guess I deserved that but why is wanting to die so bad I'm so done with life Jesus I have nothing to live for. Absolutely nothing. So when my dad came to get me home on the third day we didn't say anything just thanked my doctor. He tried to make small talk and just being around him makes me so anxious and all my memories keep flooding back. Him threating to kill me in the forest by making me choke on his shoe when we were in the same car. Him checking around to see if anyone was around before hitting me. Staring at me with those dead green eyes and looking at me like I'm filth. 

After that day he always made it a point to make me come out to talk to him for 5 minutes a day which I really hated  as I couldn't talk to him without ending up crying for some stupid reason and making a complete fool of myself. He is trying to force himself to be nice towards me and gets mad when I don't reply because I have no idea what to say dad you terrify me and all I want is for you to die. Yes I'm a horrible person but the day I'll be happy to see you is while I'm looking down on your dead body. You killed any life I had inside me and that's much fucking worse than murder.

 I can't wait to turn 18 and leave this hellhole. I feel like an absolutely horrible person but when my dad tries to talk to me nowadays I just tell him I don't want to and he stopped hitting me because after my overdose I had mandatory sessions with a psychiatrist and I begged her to give me to cps. She said if I prove abuse that he hits me then she can do something about it and then she told my dad to stop hitting me or else legal actions can be enforced since in the eyes of the law I'm mentally unstable since I tried to commit suicide. 

So he stopped hitting me and just gets really mad when I refuse to have anything to do with him. I like that. I'd prefer him calling me a loser and a useless bitch like my mother because they're just words right? And in my mind I'm already dead. So words can't harm me. But there are time when he's actually nice and asks me if I want to but anything or what I'd like for dinner. But I can't stand talking to him I just want to kill him like he killed my will to live. I just get really anxious and break down when he tries to get me to talk. I can't talk to people or anyone and I hate everything. I'm numb or anxious always. Those are the only feelings in me.

I hadnt told my family so they forced me to. My family forced me to come out and then told everyone about it. I was so scared i had to lock myself in a room for about 3-4 hours and couldnt move the whole time. They said their transphobic things and their supportive things but nothing really mattered to me i guess. 

From 12 to about 2 months ago, i was so sad. I stopped going outside, stopped eating and sleeping and i became very suicidal. I started failing everything in school. I hated myself more than anyone. 5 years of feeling tired and like everyone hated me. I was given a personal list of why id never do any good at anything by my family so i guess i just gave up at everything. I saw no point. I was convinced i wouldnt have a future because i didnt deserve one. 

I started getting better 2-3 months ago. I dont even remember how or why. I just dont really care i guess. Ive lost the ability to care over anything, i havent been able to for years. But now its all happening again. I literally just got better and now im going back to where i was. I very clearly wasnt ready to fully come out to everyone but it wasnt my fucking choice. Other people took that from me at the wrong time. Ive changed my name multiple times now because i dont know who i am yet.

I dont know what it was but for the past few days ive felt so sad and irritated. Ive always had questions for myself about being a girl and if im actually sure on it. But yesterday i felt the worst ive ever felt. Like an hour ago, i just went onto social media and saw a girl and broke down crying. I cant even look at another human being without getting upset because i want to look as normal as they do. Sometimes i feel like i want to be a girl and sometimes the thought of that makes me want to throw up. I cant even look at any old pictures of me or myself in the mirror without freaking out, and its the same as whenever i hear or read my old name. I feel like nothing, like i just dont exist. 

I feel like absolutely nothing. Like i cant properly feel anything. Idk if its because of everything ive dealt with already. When i look in the mirror it looks like i dont even look like a boy or a girl. Its just nothing to me.",20Apr2020,1

Quarentine has turned me into a lazy asshole who wants to do nothing and is very behind on my college work and I barely even go to class. I dont want to do this. Im normally a responsible person but ever since I graduated high school I've had a very stupid mindset of being a much more relaxed person its already tanked my grades once last semester. Last semester was for different reasons that weren't just not doing my work on time. How do human adults find enough balance to survive without becoming depressed? I hate college itself but love many aspects of it and I dont really want to leave because its the place where I make friends and where I can talk to kind teachers and genuinely enjoy myself but Im really not built for a college environment at all and I have no reason to be going to college in the first place other than to please my parents and my friends. I fully understand that its better for me to go and have something under my belt rather than nothing. Last semester I believe I got 3 D's and a C and maybe one B and that was in math but now Im 2 lessons behind in my new math class (its online so I just have to get all the lessons done by the end of the semester) and now Im rambling so Im just gonna let you guys talk.

659,"Back in January or February, I was so happy about my life. I had a trip to Europe booked that I was so excited for. I've gotten in the best shape of my life, in prep for a Marathon that I signed up for. My company had a very good year, and I was offered a promotion to something I was very excited about.

Now, it's pretty much all on pause. My running races and trip to Europe are 90% likely to be cancelled.  Suddenly, my company's outlook has changed from extremely positive, to being hit pretty hard. Basically, my promotion has kind of been put on pause. The local economy I'm in is also hit very hard right now. 

I am going through an extremely tough time. This is all so unfamiliar to me. I am stuck in my small apartment. Luckily, I have been calling my girlfriend every day, and talking to friends often, etc.

I am pretty financially stable, and I have a family I can call upon.

But god, this is all so bleak. I see a situation where 1) the economy basically sucks for a significant (if not permanent) amount of time. Especially because I live in an area that's fairly dependent on oil - which is way down. and 2) I basically can't do any of the things that make me happiest. Concerts, travel, seeing friends, eating out, etc.

Even though I am lucky to still be working, I have been very unproductive. I've been finding it really hard to be motivated. It feels like there are more important things happening in the background.

664,"I'm a tenth grader, and I'm learning to program. We have just finished an entire year of coding in both C# and all the web languages (HTML, CSS, JS, some C# as well...) and now I have to make my most important decision of my entire 10 years in school so far: am I going to learn how to program sites, or to program apps?

There are so many factors to this question:

I enjoy programming sites a little more than apps, and I'll have more free time during the tough eleventh grade. but I don't know what is more needed in the market, and if I'm making the wrong decision and dooming myself. I'll have friends in both the sites class and the apps class. the apps class is considered more lucrative then sites, and I don't really want to be looked down at, because Ide lie if I would've said that it won't hurt a little. my graduation certificate would look the same either way, because apps&amp;sites are considered as one single subject - although they really aren't.

so I need advice on what to choose, and if anyone's working as a web/app developer, may you tell me what it's like?

I don't mind going either way, as I like both, admittedly though - I like web programming a bit more because of CSS. but I'm very troubled indeed, I would appreciate any advice I can get to make this tough decision - my ultimate goal is to get to learn the most important skills that there are to learn out of the 2 routes (will I learn more important skills in app/web development?), because if I choose web and end up not finding a good job/learning important skills for working in the high-tech industry later down the line, it wasn't worth it for me.

I would love to educate on this subject as well, and to hear from any of you who are in that field of work about anything that you think may be necessary to know about working as an app or as a web developer.  I'm taking this very seriously.",20Apr2020,1
665,"(Please bare with me, this might be kinda long) Okay so I moved into my new house (there are now 4 of us) about 6 months ago and before COVID-19, one of my flatmates was barely ever home. He works 2 jobs and stays with his partner pretty often so we saw him probably 1-2 times a week, but ever since COVID-19 he has been quarantined at home with us. He still works in an essential service job but works from 4am until 3pm. The reason I’m getting frustrated is because he has been taking incredibly long showers (20-25 mins) every morning at 3am. Our shower is very loud and the wall it is connected to extends into my bedroom. I’m a pretty light sleeper and once I’m awake it’s difficult for me to get back to sleep. He has been waking me up at 3am on the dot for over a week now and I’m starting to lose my mind, but I have briefly talked to him about 5 times because he is quite a bit older than me (I’m 19, he is 27) and I also have horrific social anxiety which means I have no idea how to go about this situation without making myself extremely uncomfortable...

My dad 
- alcoholic 
- never does any chores at home. Sure he takes the trash out but he can’t do dishes. 
- always talk shit about my mom. How much I’d a bitch she is. 

My mom
- she is the one that works 24/7 and has been doing almost everything for the house (she’s also the one that brings home the cash). 

- my mom always talks about what my dad is lacking
- my relationship with my mom is a lot more strained. There were times where I’d feel like I’m walking on eggshells. I never know what might upset my mom. 
- I never really felt like I could be heard   


Anyway, the list goes on. I’ve been severely depressed and it came to my attention that it could be my parents that have cause so much of it.

670,"I was at work last night and I went to the bathroom. One of cleaning the ladies came in and ask if anybody was in there. I said yes and that I would be out in a minute. When I came out she asked if anyone else was in there. I said one other guy was. I started walking away I got about ten feet away and she asked me what I was doing in there. I said I don't think that was was any of her business she got upset and then asked what stall I was in. I told her what I do in the bathroom is my business. Angrily, she said that she was looking for somebody is why she asked. I told her that there was only one other guy in there and he was an employee. He was washing his hands so he will be out in a minute. She continued on saying that I was being sensitive and getting mad and I need to keep my bullshit under control. 
I walked away and went back to work I'm in the sugar aisle. She follows me and grabs another guy co-worker, pulling him to the end of the aisle and pointing at me. The guy starts nodding his head and they walk away. I ask a different co-worker if he needs any help and he tells me to go and grab a pallet with noodle stuff and start to work it. I go to the back and grab a pallet jack to get the pallet. As I'm getting it, the guy that the lady grabbed followed me to the back and tells me to grab a different palette; one with Gatorade and juice and just generally much heavier things. I told him that I was told to grab this other pallet, so I'm going to go ahead and get it and pull it out. He tells me that I'm doing too much (something he has told me every night).
 I grab the pallet and carry it out and he follows me all the way to where I put it out at and he tells me again that I'm doing too much and I just need to do what I'm told and that if I don't want to do what I'm told that I need to go clock out. I told him that he was not my boss and that he did not have the authority tell me to clock out (he's just another stocker) he says ok then and he goes to get the guy who is in charge and then he calls me over. He also has the cleaning lady with him and asks me what my problem is.
I try to explain the situation and what happened in the bathroom and with her pulling the other guy over and pointing at me and he ask me why I'm yelling  (I really don't think I was) and she says: You don't know what I was telling him, you have no idea. It didn't even have anything to do with you. 
I told him she walked out of her way grabbed him and stood at the opening of the aisle and pointed at me and they both nodded their head and smiled. It was on camera and she got really mad and said: I don't give a fuck what's on camera, you motherfucker.
The guy that is over stocking grabs her and pulls her away and tells me to go work with somebody else on the other side of the store. I do that and got finished within 15 minutes of that conversation. I walk to the back to throw away my trash and the guy that the cleaning lady grabbed was back there with all the other guys the story of how he sent me home.  
I said: I'm still here.
He said that he was going to beat my ass. The guy who is overstocking was 10-15 feet away and I said to him: He just said that he was going to beat me up.
He walked away, ignoring the situation. About 20 minutes later I went on break and decided to leave because the situation had escalated to a hostile work environment that the stocking manager wouldn't do anything about.  Since I walk home every night and we all get off at the same time and my coworker had threatened to “whip my ass”, it no longer felt safe to be at work.

My high school school in northern Washington has been shut down for a month now due to COVID-19. They've recently employed Microsoft Teams to give out mandatory classwork and I don't plan on doing any of it. I never liked school, found it pointless, and always wanted to work for myself anyway.

Instead of doing the schoolwork, I plan to learn filmmaking skills. I would like to learn the skills of cinematography and story structure. I've been making some mediocre skits and vlogs on YouTube for a few years now, so it's not too far out of my league. I have a few feature length scripts I'm working on and some other ideas bouncing around in my head. Hopefully I'll be able to make some short films once quarantine is over.

In the meantime, I'm applying to jobs at local grocery stores so I can make some money on the side. I don't expect to make a living right away, so a ""real job"" will be necessary.

Because this isn't the traditional path, how risky is it? Is it likely that hard work during quarantine is going to pay off and I'll be able to make a living as a filmmaker, or should I just forget about it and do the  mindless schoolwork to graduate?",20Apr2020,1

698,"Hey redditors ! I'm going to try and explain the problems in my family as well as I can. If there's something not clear or you need more info do ask. Well... I have a bad family. Dads a 10 year alcoholic, been abusive after one year of drinking I think... Personally I haven't been hit... At least I don't remember like it. I'm 19 now. Moms under a lot of stress too, because of dad. Shes really harsh on us too. I have two brothers, one being two years younger than me and the other two years younger.

Lately I've been really feeling on edge. The situation got hard with alcoholism in dad and he left for 4 days and came back. Our family tried to control him by asking if he could leave. 

All of us we are affected by this trauma. And we may even act different than others. I'm having difficulties with relationship with my brothers and my mom... It was like we were all against dad. And when we started fighting, trouble came. I did some mistakes (minor ones). Like i didnt do chores on time... or i didnt take a dog for a walk, because I was a bit depressed (thisn happened a lot because of the enviroment, could be else though) and I would get screamed on a lot by my mother. 

I got bashed because of my looks. Just 7 months ago i started taking care of my hair. And one month in, when it was fairly long. My mother and brothers started calling me gay. And that im messy. This really took a toll on my brain after a few months.

And last but not least, one day, my family, called me ""father"". Because ""i acted like him"". Which... completly broke my heart... Like... now i am the abusor ? The alcoholic ? Just because i grew my hair because i liked it that way... or that i didnt do something on time or made some mistakes ?...

701,"TLDR at the bottom

I'm going to be graduating from my counselling degree in a few months and I'm not really sure what to do. I had applied to do teaching but I was rejected since my current degree doesn't have any early years modules.

I was looking today and I saw that there's a creative writing postgraduate degree. It's always been my dream to be an author and I've wrote fanfiction for 3 years. Recently I started writing a story which was my own idea and I've been trying to improve my writing.

So I'm thinking this degree could help with my writing and I could get opportunities to meet authors, editors, etc.

My only worry is that if I got on this course I'd have to pay for other postgraduate degrees if I change my mind about what I want to do. I have enough money but I wouldn't really want to spend it on another degree which may or may not help me. And my current degree is pretty useless as it doesn't qualify me to be a counsellor. I need a job which pays £30,000 my mum worked out to pay for all the bills and rates for the house. And I don't think I could get that kind of a job without some kind of proper degree.

I'm really not sure what I should do at the moment. If I want to be a teacher I'd have to do another undergraduate degree and then the teaching one, which would take years to complete. I've missed a lot of the deadlines for undergraduate as well, but I think the postgraduate courses are still open.

I know I want to be an author and I'm willing to work hard for it to happen. But I know I'll need a well paid job to get there so I'm just trying to figure out what I should do.

TLDR: I've wanted to be an author since I was a kid and I've found a postgraduate creative writing degree. My current degree is pretty useless as it won't get me a job. I was rejected for a teaching degree. I'm not sure if I should do the creative writing or not because I would have to pay if I wanted to do another postgraduate degree after the creative writing one. I need a job that pays £30,000 and I don't think I could get that with my current degree or the creative writing degree unless I became a famous author.

Any advice would be appreciated.",20Apr2020,1
702,"I would love to see a therapist because I think I would really benefit from it; however it costs money that I don't have, and I don't even know how I would begin the process of finding one, and fitting time for sessions into my life right now. 

I have always been the shy type, but my social anxiety really started to get worse at the beginning of high school (I'm almost 20 now).

My social anxiety has destroyed my social life and continues to reap opportunities and potential from me.

My social anxiety is so bad, that I even become hyper aware of my facial expressions. For example if I'm out in public I avoid eye contact by all means, but there is also a physical feeling of discomfort as I pass someone on the sidewalk. I simply try to put on my best poker face without looking weird (which I imagine I do). There is always this stuff feeling in my face though...

When I'm in a social context, it almost feels wrong to express any enthusiasm or emotion for someone reason... I'm not sure why this is. But it makes me seem boring, cold, and rude.

When someone tries to make conversation, even simple things like if someone asks me ""what tv shows did you watch growing up"",  my mind goes completely blank and I have no idea what to say... I just forget everything.

I feel like I can't connect with anyone because I'm too occupied with my anxious thoughts like ""I'm cringey"" ""I'm inadequate"" ""I sound weird"", etc... 

My anxiety got so bad that I ended up just avoiding people and talking to new people for a couple years... This as a result, has destroyed my social skills and confidence, which creates a feedback loop for my anxiety. 

I even hesitate about posting comments on Facebook. I'm constantly paranoid that people will misinterpret it, or its pointless, or simply stupid.

Sometimes I'm so anxious I feel crazy... And what's worse, is I feel like people think there is something wrong with me. 

I just want to be able to socialize and have a few friends; but how am I supposed to do that when everything that makes me myself, gets suppressed in every social interaction? I feel like no one even knows me, but I'm too scared to let them know me

How can I even begin to get over this? It is so debilitating... I honestly sometimes wish I could see a therapist, to make sure that this is just social anxiety... because man it is bad.

Once all this virus stuff calms down, I'm going to go to my doctor and see about getting on medication. But I don't want to wait until then, I want to take control of my life now. The thing about social anxiety, is that it makes you feel so incredibly alone.",20Apr2020,1

710,"Some background: I moved to Indianapolis a little more than a year ago to live with my fiancee and her family. We’re currently living at her mother’s house while saving up to close on our first house this next month. We were supposed to have our wedding in June, but it seems that is going to be postponed. She is a registered nurse at one of the larger hospitals in the city and I couldn’t be more proud of her and her accomplishments. However, while she is professionally satisfied with her career, I’m in a terrible rut. I’ve been working in retail (multiple franchises in Michigan and Indiana) for about eight years and my patience for this type of work is wearing incredibly thin. I’ve recently been promoted to a managerial position with an unimpressive raise (no benefits, still haven’t been informed about my 401k, etc.) I should be grateful to still be working during this health crisis, but I feel I’m putting myself in a corner with staying in retail.

I earned a B.S. in Criminal Justice in 2017 with the intention of becoming a detective or investigator, but had a dramatic change of perspective about a potential career in law enforcement after a discussion with family and some horrifying interactions with LEOs recently. This is where my request for advice comes in. Partway through my undergraduate studies, I became interested in becoming a lawyer. I took the LSAT and only scored a 145; less than average. Since this initial test in 2017, I’ve been trying to rebuild my confidence in retaking to score better so I could apply for the J.D. program at IUPUI. However, with the oncoming financial responsibilities of getting a new home, I’m doubtful that more student debt will do us any good, even if it means a potentially better career.

So lately I've been feeling undeserving of love, extremely depressed and mentally miserable to the point that I'm sick. I'm seeking advice from anyone who has any suggestions for the next steps. Here's my story:
My boyfriend and I have been together for years. For the first year or so, it was awful. Fighting nonstop, feeling horrid about myself and I had some drunken nights that I did some things I'm not proud of. Fast forward to the next two years- more good times but still belittlement, feeling not good enough and unappreciated. Mind you, I've cooked every day, maintained the cleanliness of the house, take care of the dogs, do all the laundry- essentially he doesn't have to lift a finger. 
Quarantine happened, im stuck here with my boyfriend and his family. I finally came clean with him about moments of unfaithfulness on my end and asked for forgiveness. He was very forgiving as he knew that they were all alcohol induced and the shit that he put me through mentally- however I took all of the blame as they were my actions. 
I thought all of this would make me feel better- but it actually made me feel worse. In terms of things he's said in the past, I now believe all of them, I feel horribly depressed and undeserving of this relationship. However, I still try and make him happy every day.

713,"Backstory: I have been renting a large split level duplex in Norcal for over 7 years. Originally I moved here with my ex, and we rented both units. Both are 2 bedroom apartments with separate entrances and each have a full kitchen and bathroom. 

I have been renting out the lower unit, with the landlords approval for the last 4 years. When I originally moved in I had a verbal agreement with the landlord, who is a bit of a hippy and slumlord. He basically made 2 things very clear, rent is due on the 1st, and if I don't take care of the lawn he will pay someone to do it and charge me extra rent to cover the cost of lawn care. 

I had a former co worker move in last July. He had a couple of concerns initially with a crappy heater and the floor in the bathroom beginning to rot out. I contacted the landlord and had those issues fixed. We had a verbal agreement and he is very aware of the importance of lawn care. I didn't ask him to pay pet rent or a deposit. I told him that except in the winter, we each need to mow every other week, so one a month each, and that he needs to pick up his dog poop weekly (I only have indoor cats). 

Well it's been nearly a year and this guy has mowed the lawn ONCE. I have asked him repeatedly to help out and he just doesn't. Doesn't pick up dog poop, it just piles up since he never walks the dog or takes her anywhere. The one time he did help out was 2 months ago and I am about to mow again myself today for the 3rd time in a row and pick up his dogs shit. We both are still working and have similar schedules and each have 2 days off a week.

All I can think to do is to start charging him extra. $50/month for pet rent since he isnt taking care of his responsibilities and $50/month for yard work. Since I am spending my days off doing his share of the work. 

I've never had this issue with any of my previous renters and I am unsure if I can legally do this. I also want to mention to him that I would prefer if he would just find another place, I do have other people interested in the space, $700/month for a private 2 bedroom apartment with an ocean view is a steal. 

I am looking for advice or insight about this and would prefer to keep the landlord out of it if possible.

On the walk back to his house I was already immensely drunk, but started to feel really strange. I work in a bar and drink a lot, but I didn’t feel drunk. Looking back, this should have been a red flag. I did go to his house voluntarily but I only recall pieces of what happened there, and none of them are good. I remember being pinned down, choked, struggling to breathe or speak, struggling, and at one point, smacking him to try and get him off me. I left at 6am while he slept and when I took a bath at home my body looked like the image I’ve attached. I was in a lot of pain, couldn’t sit down, and my ribs really hurt. I was bruised all over my hips, waist, neck, butt, boobs and stomach. This is an example of how I looked - [bruises](https://imgur.com/a/v3wCHfE)

I am hoping that I will matriculate into university at the end of this year. However, I’ve not decided on which university yet. I’m currently waiting for universities in my country for a decision but I did not meet their expectations in terms of my GPA so I’m already anticipating rejection letters.

My other options would either be in the UK or Australia. I come from a middle-income family and going to the UK would require a loan and the total cost would be about $200k whereas for Australia it would be $100k as I can finish my degree in 1.5 years. I know this sounds like an easy decision to make but I seriously prefer the UK modules offered over the Australia ones. 

My parents are supportive of sending me to the UK because of the university’s reputability &amp; course but my main concern is of how they are going to provide for themselves in the future when they retire. I’ve searched for the average salaries in my field and it’s only about $3.5k which is seriously not enough to pay them back :(

[TL;DR i bought a 200 euro drawing table for 60 off amino and after a month i didn't get anything and the seller deleted her account]",20Apr2020,1
723,"So I’ve been having a hard time recently and have felt overall very isolated and lonely and quarantine has only made that worse. After looking online for answers I finally decided that the right the to do was to reach out, I didn’t want to just sit on these feelings and let them get worse so I texted my best friend. I’ve known her for 4 years and I’ve never really approached her about any of my problems but she has approached me. I’ve always tried to be there for her. 
So I texted her this super long text that basically talked about how I’ve felt like we haven’t been talking as much and how I don’t want us to drift apart etc. after sending the text I tried to lighten the mood a little and I said “This is the first time I’ve vented lol” and she responded “it is” and that’s it. It’s been a day and a half and there’s been no follow up. I feel so dumb. I don’t know if I’ve just overwhelmed her or what but I honestly feel worse than I did before I sent the text. I would like some insight on maybe her point of view on things or just some advice on what I should do.",20Apr2020,1
724,"English is not my first language so forgive eventual mistakes.
During the past months some events slowed down my life: my best friend killed himself, my mother got diagnosed with cancer and my boyfriend dumped me over the fact that I'm not ""successful enough in life. I'm 28yo and I'm about to finish my MSc, after taking 4-5 years to do a bachelor. I feel like when I will be done with my studies there will be people younger than me and more prepared, that didn't waste their time because of depression anxiety and other stuff (past drug/alcohol abuse). 
The reality is that it might be true that I have no crazy motivation in life, but I feel like I can get them only if another person loves me and push me to do my best. Maybe I'm too romantic but I've never been able to aim for the best just for myself, and now that I'm alone again I can't do it even if I need to in order to be able to finish this Master and get a decent job. 
I keep thinking about the friend I lost, night and day, my family is not in good shape and I'm far away from them. Worst thing is that I realized my boyfriend never really cared about me and my entire situation. I have 2 weeks to finish my thesis and all I'm doing is crying and having panic attacks. I feel pathetic and hopeless. I'm having some really dark thoughts and I don't know where to start to get my shit togheter and be happy again. 
I tried meds and psychologists in the past, it didn't work. I'm really close to lose my mind over this story.
I'm not sure about what kind of advice I'm looking for, sometimes I'd like just some nice words, other times I'd love someone to be rude and honest with me screaming to get my shit togheter cause yes I'm a loser. 
I don't know people I'm desperate, I could go on for hours writing about my situation but it's too much.

725,"The backstory covers a lot of in-laws but maybe I am seeking advice on how to respond to one individual in particular. I (27F) have been married to my husband (29M) for 2 years and together for 6. I've gotten pretty close to my in-laws in that amount of time and while we get along, there are definitely some overall differences in how we would approach things, which I know is normal for most people and their in-laws. Well, fat shaming was never a big thing for me in my childhood and I'm experiencing a lot of it. 

My in-laws, who we moved up to live near us in the States, are constantly talking about weight. When they are catching up with someone and later let us know that they did, they don't start with, ""They are doing great!"", but almost always with ""They've gotten so fat!"" Or ""They're losing weight."" The people making these comments are not exactly the healthiest or the skinniest of people. It all mostly stems from my mother in law and sister in law (28F). My SIL has been on the larger side most her life and has been subjected to her mother's and family's constant comments. Her nickname is even ""chubby"" in our native language. They use it endearingly most of the time but I know that the fat shaming and shade that they sometimes throw in there gets to her. The thing is, her body is naturally curvy and I find it beautiful! And I know she does too, she is confident and I love that. We do talk about how the comments from her mom and other family members can really get to her sometimes, and I've also noticed that when we are at the gym, she'll look out for people who are larger than her and make fun of them. I usually grit my teeth or say, ""aw they're here and they're trying!""

I have gained 40lbs in the last three years. It's gone up and down, but as of today, that is the difference between what my weight was at stably before and now. My MIL has definitely made comments, and I know my sister in law has too based on some of the things my mom in law has said (for example, my husband and I went on a trip to our native country and got to indulge on local food we haven't had in a while. I probably put on 5lbs in that trip. When we got  back home and went to drop off souvenirs, the first thing MIL literally said to me at the door was, ""Oh! Your figures are about the same, these guys were describing your photos as if you had gotten a lot bigger"" and SIL standing next to her went quiet and abashed.)

My husband's niece (20F) lives with us. She had also gained weight since moving up, and she is getting all sorts of fat comments from my MIL and SIL. She trades shady comments with my SIL and they are always comparing their weight gain (SIL: ""my waist is smaller than yours now, look at how big you've gotten). This niece has been fat shaming her aunt, my SIL, since she was a teenager and I think she was just following what everyone in her family was doing, and I think SIL is finally getting her revenge. So how does this affect me?

Well, that niece is now making those comments towards ME. I'm used to my MIL, I put up with it and just joke back when she makes a fat comment. My SIL doesn't say anything to my face like she does to our niece, and honestly since she had a baby last year and felt more insecure about her weight, I've been building her up and she thankfully reciprocated! But I've tried joking with our niece, saying ""That wasn't nice"" after she says ""Someone needs to hold your stomach in when you dance"", or just flat out ignoring her, but she's ruthless especially when she's feeling insecure. I've made it a rule not to parent her while she's staying with us (even though she has a horrible relationship with her mom and needs so much guidance) so I feel weird about having a sit down conversation about her regarding her comments. I think she's conditioned to respond this way because of how she grew up but I shouldn't have to put up with it. My husband thinks I should just continue to joke back or to ignore it. The thing is, I don't want to continue the cycle of fat jokes until someone gets hurt. And sometimes when I ignore it, I get this irrational feeling of her getting the upper hand over me and as she's years younger, I feel completely disrespected. 

What should I do?",20Apr2020,1
726,"I have a 13 year old younger brother. He thinks he is the smartest in our entire family. The thing is though is that he is the exact opposite. He is one of the most unintelligent people I’ve ever talked to. But what makes it worse is that he lacks basic common sense. Here are a few recent examples.

We were at a restaurant that somebody my family knows owns. Our reserved table was taken by the previous people who had stayed their for 4 hours without ordering. Everyone in my family understood the situation and we accepted to sit at a different table. My younger brother however exclaims to the whole restaurant “why are they taking so long this restaurant is awful”. The whole restaurant heard it too. And it’s not like he is a little kid he is thirteen years old and in seventh grade. 

He constantly tries to belittle me and our oldest brother on our intelligence when he had to stay back twice because he didn’t understand basic math and English. He tells people I’m the dumbest one in the family when I have a 1500 sat score and the highest ASVAB score in our school.

He has chewed with his mouth open for his entire life and when he gets called out on it by anyone in his family he refuses to believe it and says we were the ones doing it. 

His lack of common sense leads him to believe he is always right and everyone is against him so he will become extremely violent if he is wrong about something.

If he loses at something he will throw temper tantrums. He swears in front of pre school age kids and has the r word in front of an autistic child. 

He refuses to talk to my dads best friend who we refer to as our uncle. This is because he corrects him on his behaviors a lot. He is a nice guy and is trying to be genuinely helpful too.

These are just the tip of the iceberg though. He clearly has severe anger issues and intellectual disabilities but my parents refuse to believe it. Their excuse for it is usually “he is only 13”. I just need people to tell me weather I’m overreacting or not because he drives me crazy.",20Apr2020,1
727,"So today my dad gave me an option. I can either work for him from May 4th until the end of August. This would be working production in a factory where I would take home $691 a week- about 10k over the 4 months. However, I did this in grade 10 and did not enjoy it and would rather not do it. I much prefer office work. 

My other option is to find a job. Given the COVID situation this is probably going to be at a grocery store where I may work up to 40 hours a week but make a lot less money. I have not done this before so I don't know if I would like it. 

I'm assuming I can travel come October (probably won't be but let's just use it as the deciding factor).  I am planning on visiting some friends in Norway. I know the country is expensive. I should be able to do it with a 6k budget (fight to and from Toronto included). I have about 4k saved right now so I don't need much to do this trip- but I do have a habit of thinking for short term plans. 

What do you guys think? Do I power through knowing I will have no fun for 4 months but enjoy it after or do I look for another job where I will make less but might enjoy it.

Hey Reddit, sorry for asking for your help again but you guys really helped out last time,

I've (17F) always had trouble waking up, i'm so tired all the time. When school was still in session I would wake up at 4:30, leave my house at 5:40, be at seminary (early morning church) until 7:10, be at school until 2:15, go to theater until 4:00, and go to work until 9:00, I started to have trouble waking up, no matter how many alarms I set up I would either subconsciously snooze them or the sound wouldn't even disturb my sleep. My brother, dad or mom would end up walking into my room six times in the morning waking me up and I wouldn't remember it. They started getting angry and would punish me for sleeping in, grounding me, taking away my computer and phone, threatening to make me quit my job, taking my car away.

I thought maybe I had too much on my plate, I woke up later, stopped wearing makeup and eating breakfast, I gave up theater, even though all my friends were there and I felt safe there. I started working less, (I'm a lifeguard at a waterpark). I stopped going to seminary (early morning church) even though I knew it would make my parents angry. I still fell asleep in every class, even sixth period. I took naps when I got home and fell asleep every night at 11:00.

I read and researched about how to be less tired, I started drinking coffee in the morning, even though it made my parents even madder because they think coffee is an addiction and poisonous. I went to the doctor, I put my phone away at 8:00, started a bedtime routine, drank tea and took Melatonin to help me fall asleep faster, but I would still have trouble waking up.

My parents confronted me about not going to seminary and drinking energy drinks and I broke down sobbing, saying how tired I am and how my grades are suffering because I can't fall asleep. I told them, even though I quit theater, uninstalled Snapchat and Instagram, I wasn't getting the sleep I needed. They just said that I needed to take control of my own life and try harder and that things would only get worse if I didn't go to seminary and stop drinking coffee. I tried because the last thing I wanted was for them to be angry.

Even now, when my work is closed down, school is cancelled, I can't leave the house, i'm still having trouble waking up before 10 am and whenever I cant wake up it makes my mom super angry at me and passive aggressive towards me. I don't know what to do, I've tried what feels like every trick I've ever read, and I really don't want my parents being mad at me",20Apr2020,1

The other day I went into my moms drawer looking for something. In her drawer, I found a pill bottle with the label and name scratched off. This really irked me, because she has had a drinking addiction before and naturally seeing this my mind jumped to the worst- abusing pills. Her and I have a really rocky relationship to begin with and i was very nervous to bring it up to her. But this morning in an argument I brought it up. She said the pill bottle was her boyfriends, but the pills were hers. I asked her '""Why are you using his pill bottle?"" and she said she needed one. I kept questioning her and asking why she would need another pill bottle, and why is the label scratched off then? She didn't really answer and just would get more defensive about me ""going through her drawers"". She then changed her story and said she got the empty pill bottle from her work after a patient finished it  (she works at a nursing home). I asked her why she lied and her response was ""Because it's none of your business"".  i got emotional and said back to her that it is my business if shes doing something like abusing prescription drugs. Instead of saying anything she just laughed really hard and walked into the other room.

From the other room i heard lots of rummaging and about five minutes later, she texted me (even though i was in the next room), She texted me not to worry, that she needed a way to carry her meds because they come in little packets, not a pill box. She put them in there because she didn't want them to get crushed. 

She was super defensive, but it could just be because she got the pill bottle from her work and that was wrong. But a friend told me she doesn't know of any pills that come in a packet, and I honestly don't know why they would be in her drawer instead of the medicine cabinet. I texted my dad (he lives out of state currently and they're divorced) an incredibly long message, because he's the one person I'd expect to be able to tell me if I'm crazy or not because I really looked up to him and hes always right. But all he said back was that ""he doesn't know what to say and he can't talk to her in any way whatsoever"". I told him I never asked him to talk to her and he just said ""I know. I've been as frustrated as you are getting for a long time. My hope is to get into your life asap. Love you"". That's it.

So right now I am feeling really alone. I don't know where to go to get advice so i came here. I know its not really a crazy or interesting thing but I just want to ask for advice about how to deal with this. Sorry its so long",20Apr2020,1

1) Our nepotism policy is rampant. There are two people actually in my department and one is related to our boss. The other person was sent to work from home during this pandemic because of autoimmune issues. In the 4 weeks since she's been WFH, she's taken off 4 days and maybe actually worked 2 full days. Her parent is aware and allows it to continue. This is not the first time it's happened either. Last year, she discovered she was pregnant and I was told I was not allowed to take time off until she returned from maternity leave. During this time, she was constantly in and out and at least 3 times I was told she was out and not coming back so I put my work aside to get hers caught up so her fill-in wasn't drowning only to have her come back the next day. Once again, I am spending much of my time dealing with stuff that she is supposed to be doing, but can't be ignored.

2) We can't or don't pay our bills and I get blamed for it. Our Duns &amp; Bradstreet rating is continually going down. We are now at the point that our references are no longer giving good references so we can't obtain credit and I can't think of a single vendor who would be able to give us an honest credit reference.

743,"During this time, I (college student) started tutoring at tutors.com so that I could get some money and help out parents who needed help with their kids. My initial intention was to deal with kids and teenagers with math, science, English, etc that I had succeeded in so far, plus I'd been a tutor at Kumon Math and Reading for a few years, but we had to pause to prevent the gathering of all those people at once. 

I was approached then by a 37 year old man who needed my help in mortgage calculations. I'm a college student who lives with my parents. My taxes and bills are paid for my parents, I've barely even heard of mortgages due to the shortcomings of public education. I told him this immediately, and he said ""It's not that hard"" and sent me the calculations and formulas. Admittedly, they were pretty easy to figure out with a few Google searches, so I accepted, under the impression that it was all just formulas that I needed to master to help this guy out. 

The first few days, it was all math, but then he started sending me the notes on things he needed to know, like how to use mortgaging softwares and the specific requirements of certain organizations. There are also 3 separate ""schools"" to demonstrate different levels. My client was on ""Ground School"" with ""Flight"" and ""Officer schools as well. 

I don't need to know any of it to figure out the math, except for a few charts here and there. I asked him why, and he said to just go over it. I charge for the hours I study too, so I do, and in the next test, it is clear that he was relying on me to just do it for him. (We are meeting via zoom, and I've been teaching him to do the math until this  point). I don't want to do it, and I told him I'll help with the math, and that is it. He acts like he agrees, but on the next test, when I had only prepared for the math, and he gets stuck on a non-math question, he gets genuinely upset that I dont know the answer. That is NOT what I was told to do, and I can't be expected to do so. When time came for my payment, he came to my house directly, despite my objections to use PayPal, he told me, in front of my parents, that he needs a study buddy that can just know the same stuff he does and just can fill him in on when he's wrong. He paid me all the hours we worked together. He also promised a significant bonus. It was my fault that I didn't get that in writing or an amount. 

It's important to note that he has been incredibly nice throughout this, minus one time his emotions flared. He is a genuine guy, and I want to help him out, so we came to an agreement to help him till the final exam and I would learn some of the major concepts just cause it may also help me out in the future. At the end of it was a payout plus a bonus. 
Turns out that was another 19-or so hours of meeting and studying over the course of a week and a half. It got way too much, and on the final exam, we (*cough cough* I ) got 96% on the final exam and he came over. He reveals that he expects me to go with Flight School and the Officer School with him. I don't want to do that in the slightest because of his expectations that I know the knowledge too,and I gave him a non-committal answer. If it was just the math, then potentially because that part wasn't terribly difficult for me, but with the expectation of knowing everything as if I was a loan officer is ridiculous.

I’m having a kinda moral dilemma:

For quite some time I have access to my boss’ email account and I do read his emails without him knowing about it. This gives me advantages sometimes on the workfloor. Never financially though. More like how they think about things so I can prepare myself for things that they want to discuss. It gives me a little heads up. However, sometimes I also read certain things about myself which can be negative too. It makes me feel bad for a few days. When I meet them, they talk nice straight in my face but I know the real truth, but they don’t know I know it ofcourse. So, do I give up my small advantage or not? The correct thing to do would be stopping of course but in carreer optics someone can go over bodies. I’m not saying i’m like that but it helps to achieve goals.",20Apr2020,1
747,"When i was 15 (f) i started to like this guy. I asked him to dance at a party and we ended up kissing that night. The next day he asked me out and i said yes. We had a long distance relationship. He lived 2 hours away and was 2 years older than me. Our parents were friends so they already knew each other buy him and i didn’t. My mom always said there was just something she didn’t like about him and all i would do was argue with her because of him. My boyfriend made me happy when he was beside me, but i was constantly suffering when he was gone. We would try to see each other on weekends, but it was never enough. I had never had a serious relationship before so i was learning as i went. I was always extra giving him the most thoughtful presents. I wrote him 37 letters on christmas plus a few other gifts. For his birthday i gave him 7 gifts, some where expensive and some where hand made. After 2 years i started to feel guilty that he didn’t make me happy anymore. He was extremely jealous, he told me i couldn’t talk to any friend or classmates that were guys. He would question me when i would have my summer job at a construction site with my dad and other men. I would feel terrified of any guy that would talk to me, he even got mad when a guy stared at me at church. I started to not feel like myself. I never went out with friends and lost touch, and had my own family problems. My boyfriend came from a toxic family, they were not supportive and he was constantly fighting with them. And i would always try to help him or talk to him when he was sad. When he wasent by my side he would ignore me. He wouldnt answer my calls or text, he made me think i would do something wrong. He visits his family once a year for atleast 4 months in mexico. And the whole time he completely ignores me. He then would smoke and drink and put it in his story. I already knew he would smoke and drink but it would still make me upset. I would always be honest and tell him that i didn’t like it when we would ignore me for weeks at a time. He told me to break up with him next time he would do it to “prove” that he really loves me. (He did it 2 more times). Even when he was back in the US he would ignore me. But he would always repeat he was going to fix it, he would just say sorry when i would see him and i would hide my pain because i didn’t want to ruin my only days with him. He would always repeat that he loved me, but his actions spoke louder than his words. 

After 2 years i felt lost, i didint feel loved. It felt one sided. He wanted a therapist and i wanted a boyfriend. I always always always told him when i was upset. And the whole last year of our relationship i would tell him that he is losing me, and that i was scared. I didint want to “un-fall” in love. But i think i was too late. I know the little stuff isnt that important, but i never got a valentines present or a Christmas present. Every time we would meet he wanted to have sex in the car, and when i would tell him i didint feel respected because of that he would get upset and say we didint have any other place to do it. Which was true. We are teenagers that had a long distance relationship. 

He would get upset if i drank, i tried to go to a party for the first time (trying to have normal high school years and party with other friends) and he would call me and make me feel so guilty i would cry. I always blamed everything on his family problems and that he needed time, he would tell me he didn’t know who he was anymore after i would tell him “ur losing me”. He would really hurt me.

The thing that crossed the line was that he changed his profile picture to him without a shirt smoking a blunt with weed in one hand and vodka on the other. Knowing that my whole family and myself would see that. It hurts to say it but i was embarrassed. His family would comment supporting stuff and applaud him for having drugs. I guess his family is okay with drugs. And i tried to be too because i didn’t want to lose him. I would always be the first to apologize or talk to him. And one day i started to realize all the toxic traits he had. My parents helped his parents with ALOT of money to help them with a financial problem, after that problem passed my mom would always repeat to me that he is using me for my money. Which i would hate and sob too. In these 3 years i changed alot. I would cry all the time, i lost close friends, i lost my relationship with my parents, i did drugs with him, i even had a self harm problem. I feel robbed. I realized to late what i had gotten into and then i pictured my future. My boyfriend didint have a license because he didint want to study for the test for 4 years (where im from you can get your license at 15), he would only skip school and rejected tons of job offers that my dad offered him. I haven’t seen him since November and he has talked to me at-least 3 times since. 

I am 17 now and he is 19. I knew that if i stayed with him i would be a stay at home mom, he wouldn’t let me go to college or have fun, i knew that he wouldn’t let me go to parties, he would never ask me to dance, not even at my sisters quinceañera, he just wanted me to sit by him the whole party. I started reading some articles and i cant tell if this was an emotional abusive relationship. All i know is that he changed me. I decided to break up with him, he never answered my call as always... so i sent a very long text explaining my reasoning and not being happy. I was terrified since our whole relationship he would say “im going to kill my self if you leave me”, or “ please never leave me”, and “promise me you will never do anything else with another guy if you leave me”. He was my first kiss, we took each other’s virginity, he was basically “my first” everything. After my break up text i was broken, and all his response after 3 years with him was “this is killing me, i never imagined it. But what can i do. No one is ever going to love you like me” and that we should stay friends. It shocked me that that was all he said, I honestly thought he wanted to jump on a plane and win me back but i was wrong. 

I felt bad that it was a text that finished it all so i called him, after his 2 am text saying “hey”. I told him i felt bad it was a text and that this is goodbye. I was heart broken and he was a friends house laughing and not paying attention to me. It has been a week and day by day im getting better. I have talked to my mom and i have never loved her more for her advise and love. He had made me think she was the bad guy. He keeps posting on his story sad quites and videos smoking weed and partying. I cant get myself to block him just yet. Or delete the pictures i have of us. It truly hurst since this was my first experience of a boyfriend. A extremely serious relationship at 15. I used to be happy when he was with me, i had never been loved before, or hugged, or kissed. And i still wonder if breaking up with him was the right choice. I dont know who i am and i really want to find myself and be happy again. I feel guilty that when i broke up with him i felt relief. I just thought that if i was already in 3 years then i could just keep going. But i want someone that will dance with me, that will respect my parents and myself, that wont do it in the car all the time with me, someone that will truly make me happy. 

Sometimes i scare myself because maybe he wanted to apologize and i didn’t him the chance, or maybe he was just going thought family problems and didn’t have time for a girlfriend but didn’t want to leave me. It still hurts very much that i feel like i gave more than 100% and it still wasn’t enough, if i would have known that if i gave my everything i would have still been hurt. I don’t know whats going to happen the day i see him, the day he comes back to the US. Im just so confused and terrified and sad, and another minute im extremely happy im single. 

My parents hate him for hurting me. My dad says it looked like i was the only one in love. And that of course he is going to want me as his girlfriend because i gave him everything and more. I am truly heartbroken. 

I guess i wrote this to see the overall story. I know right know i am the bad guy to him and his family and he will never understand my side. I still cry because i miss him, or maybe i just miss that someone would hug me or kiss me. Could someone give me some advice on how to properly move on from my first heart break. even if its slowly. I have been able to delete him on snapchat, and then change my status, and then go out with friends. I just need to know if this was a toxic relationship or if i am just imagining things??? Should i have done something different??? I really need someone else’s point of view. Im tired of thinking about this all night.",20Apr2020,1

I don‘t know it‘s really important for me to be alone when working out, I don‘t need noone pretending he‘s Schwarzenegger and ask me what the heck I‘m doing,
I‘ve thought about running during the week, but I kinda feel like that burns callories and is more for endurance, I‘m trying to gain weight. What to do, do you think I should do the routine onnweekends and keep eating and drinking as much as possible (of course quality stuff).

754,"So I have a friend who is sort of only my friend because I feel I need to look out for their health/wellbeing . There is no other way to put it than that they are an on/off alcoholic who has sexually predatory behaviours and at times has been a huge danger to themselves and others. I won’t go into the background of this as it is personal to them but they had a rough upbringing as did I and I feel like this has been their way of coping. They can’t see that anything they are doing is damaging or reckless with their life and they don’t understand why or just can’t see that me and other friends are extremely worried about them. They have decided they are joining the army and I know they have lied or skewed the reality of things to be accepted and it worked. They have been accepted but haven’t completed their training. They failed to tell their interviewer about the alcoholism which is not by any means ‘light’ it is full blown high functioning alcoholism “drink till you can’t whenever/wherever you can” mentality. They also played off a medical condition to make it seem as though it was no longer a problem when it is and they did not mention their history with self harm/ mental health issues. They in the past have been highly violent , school shooter type (they were close). I am worried for them and I am worried for anyone who comes into contact with them in the army as they are a very high risk sex offender. I am worried that they will not be able to cope and will come out far worse off mentally than now or that when given the opportunity will turn up on the doorstep of one of us, drink themselves half to death and expect us to be okay with it/not worried. 
I have no idea what I should do because me and my friends are sicky with worry and stress. Don’t get me wrong I understand that joining the army seems like their way out and get that they are doing anything they can to ensure they get in. But it is hard to try and help someone with getting their life on track and overcoming their addiction when they don’t think there is anything wrong with anything and are above all a sexual predator. 
I get a deep , stomach drop , sicky feeling when I talk about it and being around them makes my skin crawl (especially when they are intoxicated) because of the way they groom people and myself . My friends all feel unsafe around them as we can’t even sleep in the same room after they stole a knife from one of my flat mates.

760,"Hello. I (f17) can’t seem to get over something that happened to me around Christmas 2018. I was hanging out with a close family friend (m,21 at the time) at my house and we both fell asleep playing video games in the living room. I woke up to him putting his arms around my waist. This scared me so I got up and went to my room. I couldn’t stop shaking and pretended to be sick the next day. I talked to my mom and she made us talk it out. He said he viewed me as a child and had no feelings. Later that night he told me he lied. He went on about how he loved me. I was confused. I let him hold my hand and played into the idea of dating. As soon as he left my house I had the worst anxiety. I finally told him I did not like him back, but he would still flirt with me. When he did this I would shake uncontrollably. I tried to get over it and was his friend for months. He would not stop the flirting and I couldn’t deal with the anxiety. I ended up blocking him for about 4 months and now we are friends again. I still shake sometimes when talking to him. The other day he told me he loved me and I started to shake and have had bad anxiety since. I don’t see why I react the way I do. I want to get over it. He didn’t touch me inappropriately so I don’t know why it affected me so much. I’ve never been touched inappropriately by anyone. This is the first experience I’ve ever really had with a boy. He is my best friend and I love talking to him. How should I get over it?",20Apr2020,1
761,"Im 20F, he is 22M. We had a 3 year relationship. We arent together now. Listen I HATE giving up. I feel like I should never ever give up on him. I deeply feel like I would be betraying myself to give up on him. Because its my literal life goal to be with him and for him to want me. 

But now Im starting to be on the fence about it because Im learning that I have Borderline personality disorder, and he is my favorite person (missing internal part, trying and confirming, and rollercoaster). In a nutshell, I believe I am nothing without his validation and that my life depends on him. 

I dont really have much else to live for besides him. I spend all day everyday trying to get him to want me, every action I do is motivated by getting him to like me. For example, the only reason I eat, work out, shower, take care of myself, is to be more appealing to him. I wanna be desirable to him. Heck, the only reason Im in college is to get a degree to impress him and show him that I can provide for him.

I believe him and I can have a healthy relationship if we are secure together, we connect really well when we are physically with each other. He used to stay at my apartment for weeks and he loved my ""style"" and homeliness. He was really comfortable staying with me (which has given me tons of hope for a future with us). We take care of each other when we are together. Lord I just miss coming home from school and sitting with him talking. I really want to get an apartment close to him and offer him to stay with me. 

But when we arent physically together, he doesnt even text me. He tells me he wants me to KMS. So i believe if we were physically together all the time we would have an amazing relationship, seriously I know that a lot of this post sounds crazy but this part is for sure truth.

So what do you guys think I should do? I dont even wanna live without him, this is my soulmate. I love and yearn for him more every minute. 

Do you think I should keep trying for him?
Or give up because he has said straight up that he doesnt care if I live or die?

766,"Tl;Dr: My (21F) boyfriend (21) of almost 4 years prioritizes video games and gives me the impression that he wants a gamer bro.  We have played a hundred games and I am not improving.  He says ""Playing with you isn't fun because you're not even competition.  In co-op games, you're a liability.""  He calls me the r-word and ""ragequits"" our conversation in real life.  I'm going off to law school in another city against his wishes and I'm worried that this will be my future with him.  What should I do?

My (21F) boyfriend (21) and I have been dating for almost 4 years now.  We met in college and we both graduated early.  For the entire first year of dating, my boyfriend never mentioned that he liked video games or trading cards.  About a year and a half into our relationship, late sophomore year, I learned that he was interested in gaming, which wasn't really surprising considering most college-aged guys like video games.  He started introducing me to couch-coop games like Castle Crashers and it was really fun.  Of course, he shouted and got frustrated with me because I was not accustomed to using the controller.  It was then that our relationship shifted entirely.  

He started having me play everything.  A *few* of the games we have played include: Call of Duty Zombies, Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Halo, Doom, Borderlands, Forza, GTA, Dark Souls, Battlefield 4, Overwatch, The Witcher, Fallout 76, Red Dead, Rocket League, Dead Cells, Minecraft, The Elder Scrolls V, Smite, Brawlhalla, Lego Starwars, Assassins Creed, Civilization, Hearthstone, Wizard 101, World of Warcraft, Old School Runescape, Dota Underlords, and Yu-Gi-Oh, both Legacy of the Duelist and the physical trading cards.  I'm interested in some video games like Borderlands, Forza, Doom, Minecraft, Mario Party, Mario Kart, and Dota Underlords.  I'm terrible at the FPS games but I do find some to be more enjoyable than others.  I am only interested in video games because they give me that shared experience with my boyfriend and if we broke up, I wouldn't play anymore.  

With each game, my boyfriend doesn't explain how to play and he tells me to ""figure it out.""  His younger brother tells him to be more patient and he tells me the basic rules.  Mind you, I did not grow up playing video games so I don't have the coordination or understanding that my boyfriend and his brother have.  Often times, when we play together, my boyfriend yells at me, insinuates that I'm stupid, sometimes calls me the r-word, and gets really frustrated with me.  He tells me, ""Playing with you isn't fun because you're not even competition.  In co-op games, you're a liability."" I can only keep up in games that are not mechanically challenging like Wizard101, so we end up playing for 7 consecutive hours, which is absolutely awful.  

When I go to his parents' house for the week, he wakes me up at 8 am, we eat breakfast, play video games until lunch, return to play video games until dinner, and then we play video games until 1am. When I stay at his apartment and he goes to work for the day, he expects me to play Xbox all day and make progress on certain games.  When he comes home, he checks my progress and gets upset with me because I am too slow.  I would spend all day trying to clear an area in Halo that would take him 1/5 of the time. Even with all these games, I don't seem to improve.  And when he gets mad at me, I shut down.  

We have not been on a real date since we started dating freshman year.  We went to the movies and the museum once and we have never gone out since.  In the past 3.5 years, we have only gone on dates to get food, walk around, and go to Gamestop/Target/Walmart to look for video games and trading cards.  He hates movies, books, and museums, and isn't interested in doing other things together.  Video games are so important to him to the point and he argues that they are part of basic human values like education and exercise.  He argues that they make a person more conscientious, aware, intelligent, and well-connected to friends.  While he is correct, he takes it too far and says anyone who doesn't value video games is stupid and isn't compatible with him.  My best guy friend says that my boyfriend essentially wants me to be a bro-dude with benefits.  My boyfriend does say things like he hates women and he hates things that women like.  I always brushed it off as dark humor but I'm starting to wonder if it's true.  Does he really just want a boyfriend to cuddle and do stuff with?

Lately, my boyfriend has been somewhat more understanding of me not wanting to play certain games.  But he has been trying to get me to play League and buy a new PC, which I don't have the money for.  At the least, he wants me to buy a mouse for my Macbook laptop which I don't want to pay for.  I'm currently out of a job and the money that I do have should be spent on things that I want.  I know I'm going to be horrible at League anyways.  He thinks I need to try it before I knock it.  Yesterday, I was ""spectating"" his game from my laptop while watching Hulu on my phone.  When he called me, I quickly glanced up and saw that my screen said ""Victory!""  I said, ""Oh my goodness, you won!""  My boyfriend said to his brother, ""Is it mean if I call her the r-word.  That's what it is.""  And he hung up.  I realized he didn't win and I was watching the wrong team.  I called him 4 times after and he didn't pick up.  

I'm worried that this is going to be my life with him.  In the fall, I'm going off to law school in Boston which is two hours away from where he lives and only 45 minutes from where his parents live.  We have been arguing over me moving away because I could have gone to law school near him, but I chose not to.  I know if I lived with him, we would expect us to go to the gym and then play video games from 6pm-11pm.  He has already equated the difficulty of law school with high school and he thinks I should prioritize spending time with him.  He cares about me a lot and I love him dearly, but I need to prioritize my education.  I'm planning on doing long-distance (2hrs) with him but he doesn't seem to think it'll work.  Right now, he's upset with me for choosing Boston and for not understanding League of Legends, I guess.  What should I do about my boyfriend's video game obsession?  I know he's a bit immature but I'm trying to help him see my side.",20Apr2020,1
767,"ok so yesterday me and my friend were facetiming, and i basically said that if i wanted to actually pursue my dream job (model) going to college wouldnt be a smart move. he basically insulted me, saying that my life planning is the worst thing he ever heard in his life, and that he wouldnt be friends with me if i didnt go to college. i just decided to hang up and ignore him, its been 18 hours or so. he’s tried to facetime me and i would decline every time. he’s been insulting me a lot these past few days and i cant take it anymore. i usually tend to apologize for absolutely everything because im scared of confronting him (he is like insanely good at winning discussions, and ive tried absolutely everything, and i can never do it). all i want him to do is apologize, and heres where i need the advice. he never says im sorry, ever, he never likes admitting he was in the wrong. but a few minutes ago he texted “i didnt want to hurt you with what i said”. do you guys think this is an apology? or is he avoiding the “im sorry”?",20Apr2020,1
768," Hi everyone, I hope you all are safe and well during this quarantine season. Make sure to get a lot of nutrition, exercise (Even a little bit), and try to keep yourself busy doing things that will make you better as a person.

A little bit about me—I am a 22 year old college student who grew up with everything I could have asked for. I grew up with a solid education, parents who love and support me through strong moral principles and financial support, great friends, and opportunities that are not offered to everyone. I have strong moral fiber and I try to live the best life I can, and one of my main values is growth and progress.

Anyway, the main reason I am posting this is because I want to talk about my past and my future, and gain some insight on my future.

Backstory: 

I attended a prestigious college in the Eastern side of the U.S., and I had the time of my life for three years. I got a great friend group, I was well known on campus for being the light of the room, and took the initiative on a lot of club activities, on top of being a fairly well student in my classes.

In 2018, I got expelled because I was accused of two women in my friend group for assaulting them sexually. Just to be clear, I DID NOT COMMIT WHAT WAS ALLEGED, or anything of the sort. I had defended these women like they were my blood sisters many times in the past, both from physical threats and unwelcome advances from men. I had a reputation by many on campus that I was of strong moral quality, and that was most certainly one to take direct action against those who disrespected women (and men) in gross, unjustifiable means. 

I am in the mindset right now that what I went through was not a regular (or even legal?) procedure, so I will try to describe what I went through (The contents of my experience is too convoluted and ridiculous, and it would take a whole day to explain it so I will save your time). :

I was notified by a staff member that I was accused of sexually assaulting two female students after a small get-together involving the friend group. Then I went through an investigative process by attorneys hired by the school from a firm near our area. I went through the long and grueling process of being interviewed, while they took notes and did not record anything. After countless back and forth, they drafted up a massive document compiling what they had found (I found several fact discrepancies and what I believe to be are biases in the document, will try to give examples if asked about in the comments), and I was dealt the notice of expulsion. They told me I had an opportunity to appeal, and so most certainly took it. I appealed to a Dean as opposed to a council of sorts (because we do not have a Council for this, apparently), and I was rejected.

Skipping ahead of all the emotions and hell I endured throughout the next months, I hired a professional who had helped many students in the past with this kind of situation. He recommended a state university that he had sent many students who were in my position as well, and I got accepted. I failed to get into any other schools I applied to, so I went to this one and I am finishing my degree this coming May of 2020 for the business field with a 3.7 GPA. 

There are not many resources for young men who have gone through what I have, so I came here. I want to apply to grad school and this economy complicates things. On one hand, everything I read and hear tells me that I need work experience after undergrad to give me quantifiable achievements to talk about and write about during the admissions process. On another, I have thoughts that schools just want your money and this job economy will push schools to…not exactly lower their standards, but be more understanding with the current difficulties in life due to the virus. It is harder to get a job now, the economy is bad so schools are losing much money, etc. 

In terms of my past experience, I have one really good summer internship that I learned a lot in, and have gone beyond expectations at the firm (to the point where I worked on a secret project that helped save the company money by tracking truck routes and optimizing deliveries). I presented this project at the end of my internship, and I had direct impact in saving them thousands of dollars. However, that seems to be my only solid experience directly related to the business world. I worked as a Shift Manager at a high-end juice shop, and only just started to work on a tech startup with a friend (which I do not have much to write about for the latter, but I have many skills I extracted from the former).

I ask of the community to please offer me some insight into what would be my options and the likelihood of success for applying to business school at this stage. I am leaning towards trying to get through the struggle and finding a good job that will teach me things and give me experience. However, I am also considering applying now and using the time I have to study for the GMAT, as well as develop my story through the experience I have acquired thus far.

On a final note, I want to say that although I may have not gotten a job yet and “succeeded” as much as I want, there is hope for those who are expelled from college. I consider getting a degree a high achievement, after I had lowered my standards. It took time to lower my standards, but I understand now that I was given a second chance. **I need advice in terms of my options and likelihoods and how to present my detrimental past when I apply (whether it be now or in the future).**

772,"Warning!kinda long story 
Hi there, 22 (M) I am going to try and make this as short as possible, so basically it all started when I was 19 yrs old, my family, when I was a child, was doing preety good financially, but It all started from my dad which is that kind of man who only works for himself. I mean for example his salary was covering only his monthly payments, I mean necessities, like ciggarets and food, and he left my mom to stress on the things that really matter, like rent, food bills, ETC, he was always like this, I did not noticed only when I was a bit more grown up, when I turned 19, finished high school and started working bc I did not had money and I also wanted to go to a university.

 At 20 yrs old I was already working for almost one year and I was basically supporting my parents with money in the hope that things would go better, when I have turned 21 I was a student finally, also I got my driving license, all of these without my parents helping me.
Now, in December 2019 my mom was diagnosed with cirrhosis , she is in a very bad stage, this was due to alcholo   my mom found an escape from my father and from all the problems, in alchohol. She was a heavy drinker for more then 10 years, she was occasionally going to hospital, I was the one that was taking her to hospital everytime, my dad did not care basically, she did not tell me that she has corhosisi for over 1 year, yet I found out from my aunt who visited her once, I told my aunt about the fact that she is at the hospital and she went to talk with her, she found out and called my and told me that she has cirrhosis. 
Now the problem was that my parents did not payed the rent for a looong time, once I have paid the rent for almost a year, I rented money from my gf s father and payed it. 
Now we are waiting for eviction, my mom is very sick, my dad is nor supportive or helpful or anything, so ooo I have snapped... I moved  first at a friend of mine, bc I could not take it anymore, I was seeing my friends having a nice relationship with their parents, having a normal relationship like parent child. 
And I can't say that I was not envying them I have always wanted to have a normal relationship with them... After I moved out, 2 month ago, my mother started to threaten suicide and blaming my for the fact that she is sick, she started to say thing like you worsened my diseases, I am Going to Throw myself from the window if you leave, all kinds of threads. 
Now, since covid 19 started I am staying with my gf and her parents, everything is OK but my mom is still the same, today I talked with her, wanted to tell her happy easter, and she started to be very upset and angry at me, she was constantly telling my have a great day, you are there with your family, reference for me living with my gf and her parents, and all kinds of stuff, I want to say that since I have moved from there I am felling much better, I know that I am basically homeless because I cannot go back there, I would rather sleep in my car, which I have also bought from my own money, then going ""home'....
I want some advice. Like what to do next how can I make things less heavy?",20Apr2020,1
773,"I've never done one of these before and i'm a bit shaken right now so if i ramble, please bare with me.

Ok so i passed high school with above average grades (which i was thrilled about since prior to that i've always just barely scraped by). At the time my plans for the future were to join the military(parachute/amphibious jägar battalion), preferably take courses to qualify for a commander position, and then join the police force.

Well, as i'm essentially blind in my left eye (0.2 with lenses) i was rejected. And instead of applying for the force (and probably being rejected due to my age) I decided to apply to Stockholm university's criminology course (not the full program). Long story short: it started out well but I've been getting increasingly anxious about it to the point where I can barely sleep, I'm constantly nervous and on edge and I can't really enjoy things like I used to and I don't even really know why I'm pushing myself through it as criminology courses aren't a requirement to apply for the police force.

I feel like I just wanna drop out, with the points i have from the 2 exams (don't know if this is the right word but that's what Google tells me ""Tenta"" translates to). Work for a bit and just figure shit out, I've talked to some family who have all said, pretty much, if you're really not happy with what you're doing, you shouldn't be doing it (also there is a limit on how many loans you can take out and I would be wasting those on something pointless.).

Hes pretty much afraid of the computer at this points since he has to watch 2 or 3 videos per assignment and plus has to write it down and I as the adult have to send pictures of it depending if the assignment is to be done in paper. 

Ik maybe other like it this way or heck arent having trouble but its difficult to keep their attention on the videos 
The only class he seems to like is math bc is as simple as watch a video and do the work on the computer
The rest are take a piece of paper and write what we say
And also ur own answers and sendn it through

778,"Ive gone through a bit of a change recently. Ive always had office jobs, and quite an indoor lifestyle, ever since turning 13, and im 25 now.

Over the last 12 years ive had addiction problems, which have progressed over the years. Over the last 5 years ive struggled with being an alcoholic and a pothead. 

Over the last 2 years ive struggled with being an alcoholic, pothead cocaine addict, lost multiple jobs, girlfriends, created so much debt, and got myself into such an unhealthy state, nearly dying multiple times. 

I havent gone a full day sober since rehab in January 2019,and for the last 3 months, every single day, I take fentanyl, all day,  drink pretty much all day (between 15-30 units per day), and smoke spliff after spliff, which can get up to about 10 oper day. - and this to me, is myself as stable as ive been in years.

And, its better than the other side of me, where I binge with cocaine and take all of the above, plus cocaine, and sometimes ketamine ontop. Like 5 things, it was insane. -  I havent done that in a while because ive stayed off the cocaine, been off that for 10 days now, but I still take weed, alcohol and fentanyl every day.

However; on the bright side, for the last 17 days now I have been consistently exercising, eating properly, taking protein shakes, vitamins, actimels, yogurts. Breakfast, lunch and dinner - which to you sounds normal im sure, but I haven't been able to even keep that as a routine ever.  As a result, despite taking those 3 drugs each day, ive been feeling more and more physically fit and quite good. 

So I started a warehouse job, yesterday, at 7am, which is 10 hours work. Its 10 miles from my house and I have no money as its spent all on drugs all the time, so I cycled there. It was an hour and a half ride, up hills and shit terain, on a rented bike, which was super uncomfortable and definately needed suspension for the path I took lol. By the time I got there, was dead and dying for even one of my drugs, or alcohol,(ive always drunk in past jobs), but didnt take anything at all. After my 1.5 hour bike ride, I instantly started 10 hours of constant walking around a warehouse, with only a 1  hour break. Basically dead by the end of the day, I then had to cycle 1.5 hours home, lol.

So this morning, I woke up and feel like literally broken, like ive damaged my legs, calves back, everything. I cycled the 1.5 hours again, and did the entire 10 hour shift, but by the end of the shift, my legs are literally telling me im injured now, it is really very severe pain in some places. I was called in by the manager for limping lol, and I was trying not to. I couldnt cycle home, and had to get a taxi, as no public transport is running there, but I cant do that in the morning, and will have to get back at it.

Im loading on extra protein shakes tonight lol, and gonna get an early night, but does any one have any advice. I do not want to loose a 5th job in 2 years, lol.",20Apr2020,1

784,"I’m not looking for advice on how to not get left on read, more for how I can move past it and let myself off the hook. 

Essentially what goes through my head is that every time someone reads a text or snap of mine and I can see that they have seen what I sent and not replied instantly, I treat it as either they don’t value what I said, it’s not important to them despite it being important to me, or they simply don’t like me. It bothers me with friends, but even more so with women I am interested in. So my response is to keep sending messages until I get a response.

An example: met a rather attractive woman through a dating app, she initiated conversation, we exchanged numbers, we talked for a while, things went silent. I got upset by the fact that things stopped because I felt they were going well, we were getting to know each other. I reinitiated a day later and things continued, we kept getting to know each other. But then it happened again, and she has said that she wants to hang out in person and stuff and I’m trying to make plans (with appropriate social distancing, just to be clear). So I don’t think it’s a lack of interest, she is still working so I know that is there as well, but I’m afraid I’m going to smother her but being so reactionary with the way that I text. I don’t want to keep sending her messages asking when we can do stuff, but at the same time I want to keep myself in the picture and not have her lose interest. 

I gave a pretty specific example, but this is not the first time I’ve been in this situation. I want to make a legitimate change in myself so that I stop doing this and make better habits. I don’t want to feel like I have to smother people to get what I want and end up destroying any good connections, friendships or relationships because of my insecurities.

Tl;dr:  I am very insecure about texting, I don’t like being left on read so I send tons of texts smothering the person I’m talking to. I want advice on how to make a legitimate change in myself.",20Apr2020,1
785,"i've been dating my boyfriend for over a year and she refuses to meet him. she has gotten worse and worse with her racism towards him. she says things that are untrue and it's hurting our relationship. she's threatening to kick me out but honestly, i feel like i should leave. it's not the BEST TIME RIGHT NOW to move out... but i know she's affecting my mental health. i've been really anxious and nervous and stayed up all night worrying about my livelihood.

she also defends my stepdad who molested me multiple times when i was a kid and she hasn't divorced him. it's because he financially supports her so she sees that as love. she's very traditional and it's heartbreaking but i really feel like i should let her go.

i'm going to get off her phone line, give back the car she bought me, and get my own car and phone line.

i have gone to therapy for both of my parents for different reasons and i thought i found forgiveness in my heart for my mom, not my stepdad ( that's another story ), and living together has been tolerable. but now her attitude of my boyfriend is hurting me a lot and the fact that she doesn't see her husband as trash is just a slap to my face at this point. i tried to be kind and tolerant but i don't know anymore.

other info: i'm 25. i will probably get into a lot of debt over this situation but... it's something i believe i have to do. i never thought my mom would be racist to my boyfriend but this is the first boyfriend i've ever had and just because he's not the same ethnicity as us, she's gotten haywire and crazy racist.

She begins to not show up for her shifts, multiple days in a row, while calling and texting me at 5a seeing if I could work at 7a. The last straw was me asking her to work for me when I had the flu. She said yes and failed to show up the next day. She was fired shortly after. 

Now we are in April, they decided to rehire her. Since her being rehired three weeks ago, she leaves me multiple notes on how to do laundry, how to fold, clean, you name it. 

When I show up for my shifts after having not worked for three days, she accumulates 4 loads of laundry and leaves them for me to do. There is always one in the washer, one in the dryer, and two baskets needing to be done. 

I left her a note last week that said “please have all or most of the laundry done by Monday, thanks!” I also spoke to the family and asked if they could remind her this as well. 

Last night Sunday, at 8pm, I received a text message from her stating “I don’t tell you how much...or how little work to do.  Don’t tell me what I have to do.  I know how to do my job. Mind your own business.” 

I didn’t respond, forwarded it to the family and spoke with them today. I now refuse to do the laundry and the family said we should all sit down and talk about this. I said “no, I went about addressing this properly, by talking to you and leaving a request for her to do her laundry. Instead I received an inappropriate text message that cannot be justified and instead created hostility. I already don’t respect her because of how she acted before. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me”

He’s my friend so I accepted his decision and respected it and went back to treating him like a friend (I pretended that never happened) so anyways today we were talking and we were joking around and he was saying that this guy is my bestie (he knows the guys weird so he said it in a joking way).

808,"Hi,

I have a HUGE problem. As you can see from the title, my teacher contacted my boyfriend after we watched her private videos together (in order for him to help me studying). We shared them on a website called watch2gether in a room that I hosted with my school account. After a few hours he got contacted via email by my teacher asking him who he is. I am kinda freaking out because I am afraid for her to be mad at me and maybe even give me a disciplinary note or even worse bring down my grade in discipline. Was I wrong by sharing those videos with someone outside of the class? What is the best way to deal with the situation?",20Apr2020,1

810,"(Background) Before the quarantine we were going to start a Trivia League based on movies, We then changed things and have been doing ""Preseason"" games via Zoom. We each come up with half the questions that are asked, and switch back and forth to who hosts and who does the scores.

I asked a question, that I wrote, Name 3 of the 4 people who have played Jack Ryan in a film. They asked  me, ""has John Krazinski played him""?,  I stated yes but that is on TV not film. You cannot give them the point"" they replied ""lol yes I can"" and gave them the points.

&amp;#x200B;

After trivia was over we talked in circles for hours, they stated its not a big deal and its just for fun. I said its not just for fun for me, its still work even if its not in a restaurant or bar. Second i stated that I thought it was a POS move to change my answer and force me to give points to something I don't agree on. I would have rather of scrapped the question but they just did what they wanted to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to explain how that was a very big dick move not just because they literally said fuck me and what I think. but they changed an answer, what I think is clearly wrong, (a TV show is not a movie, and it is Movie Trivia) I had to state that you got points for that as an answer, I feel like it messed up my personal integrity as a trivia host and set a president of wrong answers being right. They say its not that serious and its just online with a few people.

I tried to explain that it is serious to me, and to me does not take it as serious at all. they don't think what they did is wrong and is only ""Sorry that I got upset at what they did"" not sorry about what they did. They think I'm being too much. This isn't just for fun. I left a company to start this one with them and I do not think that it is how you should treat a supposed friend or business partner. Its one thing to say ""No I think we should give them the points"" not ""lol yes I can"", something I would never do to them. but the info of the question itself also changes what is right and wrong,

I want to say fuck them, its bullshit and I don't need it. I was disregarded as if I'm a joke.  This whole trivia thing was my idea and i thought it would be nice to bring them in. They dont think what they did was wrong and I feel doesn't take it as serious as I do at all. I hardly ever go to such extremes about anything. and the fact that I care about this didn't even get them to sit back and think about why I actually defended something. I have worked in this business for 5 years, they have for about a year. we are both in our 30s. Am I making a mountain out of a molehill?",20Apr2020,1
811,"So I’m 25 years old and have been with my boyfriend for 7 years. He’s successful, financially secure and owns a house. He wants me to move in (and I would), but I think I’m afraid to move out of my house that I’ve lived in since I was born. I know, that’s pretty sad to say at 25. 


I’m super close to my family (especially my mom). My mom is a single mother with multiple sclerosis so that makes moving out even harder. If she had a partner I’m sure it would be easier for me to move out. 


That’s not the only thing holding me back though. I just feel SAFE here; probably b/c it’s all I’ve ever known. As a woman, I have this irrational fear of somebody breaking in. I’ve always been this way. I have always been super cautious to the point of being afraid. It probably doesn’t help that I’ve had a stalker before and all of the things you hear about on the news make the world a scary place. 


I don’t know how to get over my fears and take that next step in life. I know I’ll have to eventually. There’s so many people that JUMP at getting out of their parents’ house but I get so much anxiety over it. I feel like it’s easier to move out when you’re like 18 and going to school than it is to move out for the FIRST time at 25.

817,"
I had a super rough year last year with friends and schoolwork and I feel that now, I’m finally taking control of my life again.

One of the more significant people in my life used to be a best friend but we had a big falling out that a lot of people knew about and/or were part of. And I’ve  bled it dry time and time again because I was (and still am at one point or another) severely effected by the incident. Since the anniversary of that break has passed quite recently, I took the time to reflect on what both of us did; rights and wrongs.

I realized we’re both right for certain reasons and we’re incorrect in the others point of view which happens sometimes and I’m proud to say that I’m finally over it.

Towards the end of last summer, I felt like this too. It was most likely due to the fact I didn’t see him (we only go to school together) for a long time and I only interacted with the people I genuinely enjoyed talking to. But then, summer ended and we decided it’s best for us to put the past behinds us. My immature self took that as an invitation to interact with him freely which only caused him to let me down again .

Quarantine is like a much scarier, less fun summer but it still has these effects on me. I haven’t thought about him in a long time and it feels amazing. I haven’t cried over him months and I’d do anything for it to stay this way.

Obviously school is probably going to get cancelled for the rest of this year and maybe more so I’m not sure when I’ll see him or any of the people connected to the situation again. 

Overall my worst fear is that when I see him, I’ll start feeling the same way I used to feel again: insecure, emotionally exhausted, and guilty.

Clearly there are other factors such as time and personality changes that I’m not yet aware of that could have happened to the both of us during quarantine... but it doesn’t change the fact that I CAN’T go back.

I’m comfortable in my interests, my mental health, my talents, my family, my friends, my romantic life, my strengths, my weaknesses, school, and about everything that that situation made me doubt.

(P.S.A.: he didn’t really cause me to doubt that stuff, the situation as a whole did. He’s a good, smart person. I just wish I was never affiliated with him as much as I’ve made it seem)

But I can see that the meds arent helping.

I have ice packs, I massage her cream into the area, I do all the cooking and cleaning which means she only stands up to use the bathroom and to go to bed. 

Is there anything we can do to ease her pain? Shes wincing almost constantly and being in the boot hurts her and makes her leg swell. Please leave any advice if you know any.

824,"I am using a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I am in my second year of college and I am 19. I am struggling very very badly. I don't know what it is. I started taking online classes to pursue work full time. Some weeks I just forget about my work entirely and stop doing any of it. I am on academic probation and if I don't get above a certain GPA this semester I won't get FAFSA either. 

&amp;#x200B;

The semester is wrapping up and for sure I know one class I will not pass. I was able to cruise through high school with no problem and when I came to college I expected the same thing. In general, this was true for the classes I went to, but then I switched to online and I just can't keep up. I suspect I may have ADD, but I haven't been to a doctor in years and I am not even sure how to go about that path. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that it is too late for my college to be saved, and that isn't the point of this post. The point is that I feel like I don't belong. I don't belong in college, my life is better spend elsewhere. I don't know where that place is or what I should be doing, but this isn't what I want to do. I am going for cyber security and I currently work in IT. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a big interest in real estate. I want to own properties one day. I have felt this way ever since I was younger and always looked at IT as a way to make some money and help get me there. I was always expected to go to college and so I did, even though I knew it was for something that I didn't want to spend the rest of my life doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I feel stuck in my life, like a passenger in a vehicle that is about to crash. I see the imminent doom coming my way and I can't get out of the way. I am lost, I am scared, and I am directionless.

826,"***TL;DR, I have agoraphobia and severe PTSD from different types of abuse and bereavement and was in the process of picking myself back up right before the covid19 lockdowns. How can I ensure that I won't just piss away my life doing dick after some sense of societal normalcy resumes?***


I will try to keep this as short as possible. To start, my life is a fucking disaster, as far as I am concerned and has been this way for quite a long while now. I have no clear idea how to fix it. I know a lot of it is my own fault and even knowing that, I am sometimes (often) ""incapable"" of changing it. I was really, truly inspired to change things for the better right before the COVID19 situation ravaged the job market, and I live in/less than 30mins from an epicentre. 

I have never really spoken this out so I'm going to try my best to not ramble and just be as linear as possible about my life circumstances, in case it helps at all.

I was very quiet as a child and didn't want much to do with anyone, really. Looking back, my home life was very unhealthy and school wasn't much better; I felt very isolated and left out, other kids did not want to be friends with me because I probably WAS a bit weird. 

I was in public school still, though. In my first year of middle school the bullying got way worse and I started to draw very deeply inwards, I was chronically ill at the time as well and so I never actually attended school. I would just sob in the mornings and beg my parents to let me stay home. I did all of my studying and homework, but I simply did not have the physical class hours in and was told I would be held back regardless of any efforts I could take. My parents felt this was unfair and pulled me out of school to ""homeschool"" me. 

Now, this is where it gets a bit tricky for me, I think: nobody taught me ANYTHING. I had a single workbook thrown at me and when I finished that there was never anything else. My parents did very little to prevent me, or to keep me from sleeping all day and playing video games or spending all of my time sitting on my computer. My father was far too busy with work, and my mother was extremely overprotective and was generally happy I was not leaving the house. To her, it meant I would get in less trouble, and she didn't want me to go out and socialize after I was pulled out of school. So I got all of my socialization online for this period of time. I am not exaggerating at all when I say there were months where I would not see the sun even from my window; I would sleep right before dawn and wake up at dusk. I didn't leave my house even to stand outside for about four years. 

So, cut to other things. I did manage to get outside and socialize a bit, but that backfired terribly as well; the person I met online that I became acquainted with in real life was a man much older than me (late 20's early 30's) and he physically and sexually abused and groomed me after gaining confidence and trust from me. I don't feel comfortable going into too much detail about this, but my parents knew that we were ""together"", and I was ""allowed"" to go live with him (mostly by my mother) and basically had to do all of his work and cleaning for him. Not just at home, he'd literally take me to work and I would perform the custodial/janitorial duties of his workplace that he was supposed to do. In this time, he enabled and encouraged me to drink very heavily and I had a bit of a problem with that for quite a while. I left the ""relationship"" at 17 years old after he got increasingly aggressive towards me and told me that if I ever tried to leave him again (I posed the idea of us ""taking a break""), he would buy a gun and kill me and then himself. I really struggled to quit drinking even afterwards, and seemingly inevitably, in my mind, turned to drug use that same year. My mother didn't want to pay for my therapy and told me that if drinking alcohol helped me, she would supply it. And she did, for a while. But she would dangle it over my head as an incentive to do whatever she wanted, and when I didn't comply or do things to her liking, she would take it away and I would go into withdrawals. So I experimented with other drugs on my own accord, which led to me being hospitalized for a couple of weeks after an unintentional overdose. 

Shortly after my hospital stay, I turned 18 and was enrolled in school for a trade. I did end up graduating the next year, but I started to have more panic attacks. I felt okay. I think. I was sociable. Sort of. I had some better habits and routines I picked up from my hospitalization. 

After I graduated, the first actual relationship I had, my first REAL boyfriend that I met during my education had cheated on me and broken up with me; I felt very low and just holed myself up in my room. 

I eventually got a job in retail, and that lasted a couple of months. I got fired after I was sick on the job, sent home, and told not to come back until I was no longer vomiting as I worked with food and produce. I called out 24 hours ahead for three days and when I went back, I was let go. It was around this time that my father's health started to rapidly decline, faster than it had prior. 

So, a couple of short-lived jobs, failed relationships with people I probably shouldn't have even bothered dating, and some haphazard, less-than-stellar living situations that I somehow ended up in later, I came upon this past year.

My father died in front of me in the hospital in a coma last summer. I was in an even healthier relationship and being more sociable, I went to therapy, was on meds, diagnosed with ADHD, PTSD, GAD and MDD. Until my father's death, everything seemed kind of okay, like things were looking up for me. After he died, I couldn't do ANYTHING. I always took care of him, from a very young age, and I suddenly felt devoid of purpose and lost. Though my dad was not always present because of how busy he was, he was the only person in my life who showed me unconditional love and support, he was my best friend and my rock, and I just went back to my ""old ways"" entirely. 

I didn't want to go outside. I didn't want to clean or take care of myself. My partner at the time cut it off with me, citing that he resented how depressed I had become since my father's passing. 



This kind of brings me up to modern times. I am still on medication. I still have therapy.  I have tried to push myself outside of my comfort zone the past few months, I've tried to do things that are good for me. I pursue my hobbies more, I think about the future more and try my best to maintain healthy, normal routines. 

I entered a relationship that is currently (very) long distance with someone I consider to be my best friend, with the mutual intention of closing the gap as soon as we can again. I felt very motivated to pick myself up and begin working again, with a goal in mind, now. But my license/degree is in a trade that is not in business right now with this pandemic. 

My worst fear is that I will move in with my partner and be unable to perform or adjust well, and that I will become a financial and emotional burden to them. I love them so much and our communication is so healthy and amazing, so it pains me physically to think about that. 

I want to do better by them. I want to do better for them, but also mostly for myself; I want to give myself the shot at life that I feel I never fully had, if that makes sense.

Our family as a whole though is pretty toxic at the moment and honestly has always been that way growing up.

She doesn’t have a place of her own and just has her clothes and belongings stored in my room and my moms. They’re not officially divorced though and the reasoning he doesn’t leave he says is because “my daughters are still young and they need me” but in all honesty I know he doesn’t leave because he doesn’t want to give up the house (he wants my mom to leave with us and for her to leave him the house) the house is under both their names and my mom has told him multiple times to just file for divorce and for each of them to get their share of the house but they’ve gotten pretty comfortable with this situation and they don’t see how toxic it is. Growing up as well their relationship has never been healthy either even when they were together so it’s not like they’re not getting the divorce because they love each other or something of that sort. I’m quite tired of this situation especially since they don’t see how toxic it is and they don’t take our feelings into consideration about the whole thing. I also have a 9 year old sister and I know how trapped I feel and also how depressed my 15 year old sister is because of this so even though i’m saving up to move out soon I don’t want to leave them in this mess. I don’t know what to do anymore :(",20Apr2020,1
832,"I work for a temp company. Basically the warehouse I work in outsources parts of its employment to another company and it's them who I work for. 

I have talked with the HR lady some times and we have exchanged emails before.

Now I'm trying to contact her about scheduling and direct deposit and she won't answer.

I've called the office, no answer. I've called other HR people, no answer. I've emailed, no answer. They're so disorganized! The HR team works from home so I can't talk to them in the warehouse. What can I do??",20Apr2020,1

10 am- Wake up 

10:30 am- Shower, brush teeth, get dressed

11:30 am- Activity time: writing, drawing, anything other than being on my phone)

12:30 pm- Exercise: Take the dog for a walk, bike ride around the block, do stretches, or walk on the treadmill

1:00 pm- Lunch: eat a sandwich, fruit + chips (make healthier options) 

1:30 pm- Chores: Take out the trash if needed, empty the dishwasher, wipe off counter or the table 

(2-4 pm is break time until dinner)

8:00 pm- take meds

10 pm- go to bed, lights out, no video games because i go to sleep too late.


So yeah thats my schedule that i stopped following after a week. I told my mom i wanted to follow it but i couldnt get myself to do it but she just called me lazy. I really want to start becoming better because i really dont like laying on the couch everyday (this has been post quarantine, ive been like this for years) not showering or brushing my teeth and sitting on my phone until its night and then having a wave of depression because the day went by so fast.

836,"This is going to be a fairly long post so here's a TL;DR. My Grandad is malnourished and not exactly sane but my Dad and Aunt are aware of this and refuse to do anything to help him, is there anything I can do as a 19 year old blood relative?

My Grandad is about 85 years old I don't remember his exact age but he is very old, very frail, malnourished, live alone and losing his mind. Currently he refuses to eat anything and can't even be bothered to change out of his pajamas. He has carers that go in twice a day to feed him and help everyday but he simply refuses to eat. The carers understandably can't force him to eat but they are extremely concerned about him.

Some information about my Aunt and my Dad, the two people that have power of attorney:

My Aunt is one of the laziest people ever and doesn't like to do anything. Just today she missed a call from the doctors to talk about my Grandad. She has never been there to do anything for him in the past. For example, when my Grandma died a year ago it was mostly my Mum and Dad sorting out EVERYTHING, she doesn't work Mondays and Tuesdays while both my parents work full time and had to take time off to deal with funeral stuff. Even at the wake which my Aunt organised it was the cheapest options she could do and didn't even have coffee ready (she insisted that there would be coffee and tea ready for when everyone gets there) for the old people that had just come in from a cold day. On it's own this must not seem like a big deal but she does this with everything which enrages my Dad.

Talking about my Dad, he gets angry easily and likes to through a tantrum when he doesn't get his way or when someone criticizes him. Even though he likes to complain about everyone else. For example, yesterday  we were eating tea, my Dad complains that my Aunt isn't doing anything to help my Grandad then he says ""He's clearly given up on himself"" (referring to him refusing to eat) so I say ""It seems you've given up on him as well"" and he didn't speak a word after that, not accepting it, not denying it, just ignoring it. Combined with my Aunt this is a huge mess as she won't do anything, my Dad gets angry and subsequently won't do anything because ""If she doesn't want to do x, I'll not it!"". Another conversation that happened yesterday just before the last example goes as follows,

Mum - He's malnourished, he needs help

Dad - I know! We've all known for a long time that he's malnourished but he's just a nutter refusing to eat.

Mum - No he's not thinking like a sane person

Dad - Oh I know he's an idiot

Mum - No he's actually not thinking right, he needs help, you can't treat him like a normal person.

I don't quite remember what was said after that but it shows my Dad knows my Grandad is malnourished and not exactly sane but refuses to take action or treat him in a helpful way. In his words he is just an ""idiot"".

So nothing is happening to help my Grandad at all. My mum desperately wants to do something to the point where she is nearly in tears talking to me about how she feels sorry for him but it's not her place to enforce things. Is there anything I could do as a 19 year old? Do I have any legal power as a blood relative? Anything? Please help I feel like I could strangle both my Dad and Aunt because they are neglecting him.",20Apr2020,1

838,"I'll include as much detail about his behavior as I can.

Backstory:


So when I moved into my apartment everything was good and fine. My landlord seemed nice and in the beginning I was mainly dealing with his wife. Then I moved in.

Everything was fine and dandy. I am only able to get in touch with him through an answering machine, which he keeps in his basement. I don't know why he told me where it's located, but there it is. So I call him. He calls me back.

The first problem I encountered with him happened over the summer. The toilet was a little broken. It was a piece inside. So it sounded like it was constantly running. They called me at work. The woman downstairs had called him to let him know. I let him know that it was the toilet and that I will leave work to shut it off so it's not running until he gets there. He argued with me over anf over about how he's going to go in. I kept asking him tonwait until I am home from work. As I am a single young female who lives alone. I do not have a washer or dryer in the apartment. So I wash my delicates(panties etc) and hang them on a wrack attatched the bar in my shower to dry. I dont want a grown man in my bathroom that I legally pay for without me clearing my very personal items first. As my delicates were not the only lady items out and about. There was no emergency. I just needed a part replaced. There was no broken pipes, no flooding. Nothing. So he legally can not go into the apartment unless I give hin permission to do so. I argued with him and he hung up on me. Ended up waiting for me to do it. Thankfully.

Everything was fine. Then someone had tried to break into my apartment at 1 am while I was home. The qoman downstairs was away for the week. I called the cops filed a report and let my landlord know. Well after that happened he made a crack at me about how it's no wonder someone tried to break in since I leave my windows open withoit blinds. Which is only in a front room of the apartment that I keep locked and do not use. Anf the backside of the apartment where there is nothing but a field. But they are closed for most of the time. I thought that was a really odd comment to make. But I push it off. 

Well cut to and I am at work. I get a phone call from him stating that there is a fan on in my apartment and he's going in to turn it off. That the qoman downstairs heard a fan on. I tell him no. I do not have a phone on. Again, same problem. It's around the holidays and I'm busy and got called into work. I was in the middle of baking and doing laundry and wrapping presents. My apartments a mess. I tell him he can't go in and that I'll leave work and I'll go see what it is because I don't have a fan. He tells me it's a blow dryer and I tell hom no because I don't own a blow dryer. He hangs up the phone. I considered driving over there to meet him but was far too embarrassed because of all the intimates he would have seen. It made me uncomfortable. So I just stayed at work.

A couple of days passed and he shows up at my door screaming at me. I was angry because I tried calling him and left him messages and he didn't answer me as to what had gone on in the apartment. So when he showed up he was screaming at me about the mess. I explained that it was the holidays and it was busy and he knows it's usually not like that but I've been really busy and also I was very sick with the flu right before that. He wouldn't stop screaming so I put my hand out and told him he can't show up screaming at me. He finally told me what the fan noise was. My cat stole my electric toothbrush and was playing with it. So that vibrating is what the lady downstairs heard.

Another time I had a bank mix up with payments and my gas got turned off without me ever getting a notice until after they had shut it off. Basically the company left me a notice on the front door and my landlord was here while they delivered it and he took it home and then gave taped it to my door a day later after they had already shut it off. As soon as I got the notice I got the entire thing rectified in less than 20 minutes. I needed my landlord to open the lock to the basement though so the gas company could turn it back on and relight the pilot light to the water heater. He didn't answer me with every message and left me without hot water for 11 days. Finally he unlocked it and the gas company came and said that the water heater is missing a piece and thank god this happened because there could have been a gas leak. So my landlord needed to fix it before they can turn it back on. Otherwise me and the lady downstairs could be exposed to carbon monoxide poisoning. My landlord came days later, went down there for 5 minutes and theb left me a mesaage claiming it was fixed and called the technician and idiot. So I get the gas company back and it turns out he did not fix it. Then I get my landlord over while the gas company technician is here and he yells at the technician, whom threatens to call the town on my behalf. Thank goodness. So a couple of days later his son shows uo and fixes everything and I get my gas turned back on and I finally have hot watet again and all is good in the world.


**So now that you have the idea of what kind of man this is I will give you my current issue**

The current Covid Pandemic. When I found out my job woukd be effwvted by this I called him to let him know right away. No answer. Left a message and he never returned my messages. I called him again to let him know my rent was going to be late because of it and that if I need to I will pay late fees. Still no call back. I schedule the check to bw mailed put with my bank to him through online bill pay. The money comes out by the 10th and is sent through the mail. His wife texted me asking where the money was and I explained it to her and said it was in the mail and that I had to do it through online bill pay as I was sick and couldn't physically go out to the bank to get the check and mail it out. As it is a global pandemic and I didn't want to risk anyone else getting sick invase I did have Covid. Because of the test shortages I could not get tested but it was probably not thay anyway but I was still told to stay home. Then on the 15th he calls me screaming at me that he still hasn't gotten the check. I tried explaining but he was yelling so I couldn't get a word in. I finally yelled back and stated the facts that it will probably be there at the end of the week because the bill pay doesn't go through the town it comes from the bank headquarters out of state. He said he was giving me until the tenth. I mentioned how I've been trying to get in touch with him for a month about this and questioned if he waa giving me to the tenth, why he didn't call me and communicate this with me. He didn't answer and hung up the phone on me. 

The next day, the time of me staying home was finally up so I went grocery shopping. Which I hadn't done for a month. I was literally living off of oatmeal, rice and vegetable burger patties. So I got groceries. He saw me in town and followed me home and pulled in the driveway of the house. I park in the lot across the street. This is the 16th of the month. I stay in the car because I don't want to see him because he keeps screaming at me and get really confrontational. He walks up to my car kind of and yells that he still hasn't gotten the money yet. Gets back in his car and sits there. O waited almost 10 minutes and he didn't leave so I just got my groceries out of my car and walked past him into my apartment. He stared at me the whole time and then left when I went inside.

On Saturday I received a notice in the mail from the mail man stating that they tried to get me to sign a certified letter that I missed from my landlord. And that on the 20th I have to pick it up and sign for it at the post office. Now I'm thinking he's going to try and evict me because all of those times he's yelled at me that's what he threatened to do. Which he can't do of course because we're in the middle of a pandemic and I only have so much control. There is a legal ban on evictions. But it hasn't stopped landlords from filing anyway, so I was worried this is what he was going to do.

On the 18th his wife told me they received the check in the mail. 

Well today is the 20th and I pick up the mail and it's a written letter explaining that he had seen me getting groceries on the 16th of the month and if I could do that then I could have taken care of the rent.

And to further provide some insight into the kind of man he is, the paper he wrote the letter on was stained with brown stuff all over it. And instead of writing out the word *check* he drew out avtual check marks in the letter. 

I am totally disgusted by this behavior and am officially, completely and utterly uncomfortable. And am not sure what to do from here on out. What do I do about this situation? This feels like a form of harassment at this point. From the comments he makes, to the screaming, to the threats of eviction because he's angry to the not calling me back to communicate how to handle things to the letter. How do I get this guy to back off? 

**tl;dr: it's a pandemic and my rent was late because of a collection of covid things preventing me of getting my money and my landlord followed me home after my check was already in the mail. He followed me and saw me with groceries and then wrote me a  certified letter that day stating that he saw me with them and if I can get groceries then I could have paid him his money. This feels like a form of harassment and I'm not sure how to feel about this**",20Apr2020,1
839,"This might be pretty long because I have a lot to say. I’m looking for real advice, no trolls. Thanks! 

So about two years ago I met this girl in my first year of high school (Let’s call her Emily) she was part of my friend group, but I never really got to know her. At the begging of my sophomore year the friend group broke up, but I stuck with Emily. 

This was when I really started to get to know her. She seemed really nice at first until things started getting weird. Emily developed an obsession with our school principal (F40). I always knew that she really looked up to the principal, but I didn’t think it would turn into an obsession. She would often wonder what the principal looked like having sex and then she would stalk the principal after school. It was no secret either and it made me so embarrassed to be seen around her.

Emily has a tendency of not acting her age. She still sleeps with a baby noise maker, stuffed animals, and plays with dolls in her free time. I don’t care if she does this stuff, but it affects her attitude. She cries when she doesn’t get her way and uses words like ""meanie"" all the time. From the few times that i’ve gone to her house, i’ve noticed that her parents baby her to death! 

Sure all of this was annoying, but I did my best with putting up with it. About 8 months ago, I met a new group of friends. I saw this as an ""escape from Emily"" so I started hanging around them a lot more. They were really sweet people, but Emily developed a hatred towards them for no reason at all.

Emily is really clingy so it’s always hard to hang out alone with people without her wanting to come along. Anytime me and my friends would hang out Emily would trash talk them (to their face). She told them how much she hated them and how much she wanted them to stop hanging out with us. They stayed civil throughout the whole thing when really they could’ve just snapped at her. 

I got really mad at her for this and occasionally would bring it up to her face. Then she would always accuse of me of being a bully. I could tell she was extremely jealous of them and she would even go out of her way to keep them far away from me.

Still I kept on being her ""best friend"" and eventually everyone including my real friends stopped talking to me. This was a really tough time for me because I didn’t know why everyone was ignoring me. I had the idea that it was Emily, but I could never know for sure. 

I started secretly hanging out with people behind her back and found out the truth. Everyone stopped going near me because of Emily’s rudeness towards them. I was so angry and I knew I needed to end things immediately.

Harder said than done. I tried ignoring her calls, hanging out with her less, etc. She wasn’t really taking the hind so eventually I told it to her face. She didn’t take this lightly and she made me feel like a jerk so I felt bad and continued to be her friend.

It crushed me everyday to see the friendships that I could’ve had, but she ruined. Quite honestly, I don’t think I can ever forgive her. When the schools shut down I knew that was my chance and I ended things (well I thought I ended things) once and for all. 

Let me just tell you, I could not have been happier during this time. I was free to talk to whoever I wanted and just have fun! You know that scene from Braveheart? Where William Wallace yells out freedom during his execution? Yeah well that’s how I felt. Free. 

Earlier she told our only mutual friend (Abby) that she would ""never give up"" on the friendship between me and her. Which she didn’t. Now i’m back to talking to her and I can’t take it any longer! I just want to completely end things with her, but I don’t know how?! She won’t let me. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this! :)",20Apr2020,1
840,"Three days ago, I wasn’t really feeling myself. I’m easily irritated, sad, anxious and also experienced mood swings. I don’t know why. Maybe because of the quarantine, maybe because I’ve been planning that I’m trying to get my shit together this year and then this coronavirus happened, maybe because I miss my dog who died last month. 

So I decided to delete my Facebook, messenger, Instagram and telegram so that people won’t see me active on any social media. Though I’m still using twitter to get updates on what’s happening. 

My question is, should I apologize to some of my family and best friend for not telling them I’m taking a break on social media?

I never had a problem with this before Covid happened, I would go to the  library after class and do 2 or 3 of the assignments beacuse we normally had Around 3 weeks before it was due.

Now for some reason instead of keeping it the same, we get the same number of Assignments and a similar difficulty but now they are due every Monday.

Until our second test since we went online, this test required I have a Microsoft software, and I don't have a PC or laptop of my own instead I use the chromebook my younger brother got from his school. 

After that all my HW required I have this software and i wasn't able to do it. I've been speaking with the professor but she kinda dodged my questions.
Last night I emailed her asking her to straight up just tell me the chances of failure are. She said that since I havent done the current HW or the test I would definitely fail the class, she also said I could find a way to take them and she would re open the test. Problem is I don't know if I can find a cheap laptop in that time since the last day to drop is The 23rd of this month.

If I drop I would retake the class again next semester,  but I also don't wanna feel like a failure, if I don't drop and can't find a Proper laptop in time then I fail the class and it hurts my GPA.

**Too many details:** I'm a woman in my mid-thirties, and an American who currently lives in Europe and will soon be living in Asia. I've been a huge enthusiast of a somewhat-obscure musician since I was a teenager. He's been a part of a few different projects over the last twenty years, so as long as I'm being twee about it, I feel like I grew up while this guy's music also ""grew up."" This musician's projects have gained more of a following over the last decade or so, but I was part of what was a small and active American fanbase during the Myspace era, so he knows my name/says hello to me when I manage to be in the same country as a gig.

I've always believed in not getting too close to musicians, both for my sake and theirs. I wanted to be a musician myself when I was young, and a music journalist when I was slightly less-young, and stopped pursuing both of these endeavors  when the men who made music I enjoyed behaved  inappropriately toward me, thus ruining my enjoyment of their music (also: because I was neither a particularly talented musician nor journalist).  I also still get those full-body cringes where I suddenly remember some dumb thing I said at a show 15 years ago, so it's just better if I listen and appreciate from a distance. Additionally, this musician has stressed his desire for privacy in various blog posts/interviews over the years.

I've been more active on social media since quarantine, and noticed a post on my Facebook feed by a person with the same unusual last name as the musician I admire, and it turns out it's his brother. I searched my inbox associated with my Facebook, and it seems I added him. We have a mutual friend, and I guess he was a ""person I may know,"" and it looks like I stuffed my phone in my purse without closing out of Facebook and added him randomly, which has happened before. So now I feel like I'm a creep because I added a family member of my favorite musician on Facebook. The brother noticed that I've added him enough that he ""liked"" my wedding photo (a notification I missed because my wedding day was predictably busy).

I don't know if it's more awkward from to keep him as a ""friend"" or to unfriend him since it was a mistake, or to first write him a note explaining it was a mistake and then unfriending him, all of which is too awkward.

862,"I am 22 years old and for about five years I’ve wanted to move out of state. I’m currently located up North and I’ve just felt out of place. Since graduating high school, I’ve took long vacations to Arizona (as long as a month or two) and I was very happy during my time there. I have finally decided that after experiencing  it for myself, I would love living there. I have everything planned out and I wanted to use this time during the pandemic to save money up for this move. I do have a savings account which I have plans to set aside $4,000 for an apartment fund. It may sound extreme, but as a first time renter, I had planned to offer to pay ahead to raise my chances of approval. I wanted to look for a job after arriving. (Note: I was working during my “vacations” there so I have had no problems finding a job in the area.)

I also planned on having the expense saved to stay about two months in an extended stay hotel while I find work and an apartment. I would also have a bit more money saved up for food and laundry.

I am still currently employed, and living with my dad currently. I don’t particularly get along with my family too well, but I am staying there for free so I can more easily save money for the move. In my mind, I keep thinking about the move but I want to make sure it becomes a reality.

863,"This is a worry I (M 29) had been having for a couple of years since I moved to England. My parents were always religious/ spiritual. My dad (56) is a devoted Catholic but always listened to other opinions without judging. My mom (60) was always spiritual but sharp and intellectually active.

Since the SARS- COVID 2 outbreak I’ve seen a new side in them. This whole virus outbreak  has turned them into extreme conspiracy theorists. Over the course of two phone calls I found out from them that COVID 2 is biological warfare, that Gypsies need exterminating as they are harbouring diseases, that the recent draught in Western Europe is all a machination of the Russians and Jews, not to mention that I haven’t gone to church in years and that I’ve become a sinner and I’ll end up in hell.

Any sort of reasoning with them on these topics devolves into verbal conflict.

I blame it on the sensationalism of media and the way YouTube algorithms create filter bubbles never letting you see the other side . Let’s say you search for cat videos, your next video recommended will be a cat video and not something else. That’s not bad when searching for cats but when your search starts with conspiracy theories how deep will the rabbit hole take you?

866,"This is something that’s been kind of on my mind..
 
For context, I’m a university student working a part time job at a retirement home as a maintenance staff/cleaning member; meaning I work closely with residents and other staff. 

Seeing how this nasty pandemic is shaping up, a senior home is probably the worst place you can work. This has made me recently think it’s a good idea to quit my job like a lot of my coworkers have. It is a little selfish but honestly, it’s not about me. It’s about my parents...my dad is a diabetic and my mom has lung  issues (asthma and a bunch of other shit). I don’t wanna end up contracting something and then passing it to them..they are likely to have more serious complications.

But given that the economy will also be plummeting and going to absolute shit, quitting a job is not exactly a smart move either. I’ve still got some years in school and so I’ll have to manage through all that.I guess I’m sorta bent between “should I keep my job and try to work since it’ll get tough later”, and “let me quit so I can prevent contracting virus and giving it to parents”. 

I have for the most part decided on quitting my job, since it’d be selfish on my part to continue working due to risks. I just wanna hear some thoughts other people have on my situation.

Thanks r/advice and stay safe!

TLDR: should I keep my risky senior home job since it’ll be hard to get jobs later on or should I quit due to risk of contracting virus and passing it to parents with health conditions?",20Apr2020,1
867,"I'm in a kind of strange situation here, and don't quite know how to even begin telling this. Please bear with me.

I've been a fan of this Dutch rock artist with a moderately-sized fanbase for a little while now, and a few months into discovering said artist I realize something weird.

There's probably some background information needed here first, though. This guy is in his mid-20s and has young kids with his girlfriend, who's in her early-20s.

Now this girlfriend... turns out to be someone I knew a few years ago. I also therefore know this girl wasn't the greatest person. She was the type obsessed with natural healing (think chakras and auras) and extremely paranoid and distrustful (among other not-so-positive traits).

I decided to do some digging because I'm idiotically curious, and find that she hasn't changed much. She hasn't vaccinated their children, feeds them colloidal silver and still distrusts actual trained doctors. She's also absolutely obsessed with pregnancy and birth as a means of unhealthily coping with many mental issues.

This all is bad enough already because it happens behind closed doors, but I recently also found out something more damning. Online, she admitted to wanting more children than the ones she has and mentioned her partner (the artist) doesn't and didn't even want the kids they have. Instead of discussing this with him, she turned to asking about what to do in this Facebook group.

The issue is that knowing this girl, she gets her will. She's always been very cunning and has her ways of getting what she wants. I've been contemplating this post for a couple of days now and even more recently something else came to light through my digging. When she was pregnant with their first child, she made a Facebook post where she basically said she believed that her partner should not have a say in health-related matters when it comes to their children ""until he educates himself on the matter"". 

Point is, I believe that he's getting manipulated. This guy is a good guy, but somewhat of a doormat. It seems he got stuck in the relationship because they accidentally (on his part it was an accident, at least) conceived a kid three months into their relationship. No matter what, he doesn't deserve to be deceived like this.

I feel like I'm watching a train about to hit someone knowing all of this, both because of the artist himself being played and because these people are horrible parents and I know their kids are medically neglected time and again, so getting even more kids to then not look after them properly while their father doesn't even want them is just terrible.

I have no clue on what to really do. The girl is not to be reasoned with (stubborn conspiracy type who believes in 5G being harmful and chemtrails being a thing).

Tl;dr: an artist I like is dating a batshit ex-acquaintance of mine and she's manipulating him and a danger to their kids. Kind of absurd coincidence and an absurd position to be in. What do I do? I'm fully aware of how weird this is.",20Apr2020,0

875,"Hey yall, I'll keep this as concise as possible. We have a cat that she owned for around 6 years, although growing up she lived with dogs exclusively and I lived with cats exclusively (although I did live with roommates dogs for a number of years).

For a very long time we've thought about getting a dog and have wanted to wait until we had a house, which we got around 8 months ago. During the quarantine the wife got looking at dogs for adoption, we visited one, and while I was waffling eventually I ended up agreeing to him and we've had him for 4 days now.

The thing is, I've been super anxious and just feeling off and not doing great. At first I thought it was just anxiety over unknown behavior but he's great left alone, we watched him with a camera when we left the house and it was like a still image, he doesn't garbage dig and in general is just a huge beggar and a crier when it comes to negative traits.

But despite this I just don't seem to be enjoying having a dog around, anytime he's around me I feel like mildly irritated and distracted, when he's with my wife I feel like I need to stay quiet so I don't accidentally attract his attention or wake him up if he's sleeping. It's not like I despise him, but I feel like he's a negative on me more than a positive and I don't know how long I should wait before deciding I want him to stay or not.

We got him from a foster family that would be happy to have him back and he's really quick to be happy in a 'new' place, so I'm not worried about him not being happy if we did bring him back. My wife loves him, but also wouldn't want to keep him if I was always going to feel bad having them around.

I just don't know how to figure out how long I should give it, or how to figure out if I'm just not suited for dogs. All my friends are dog owners and it makes me feel like I'm just being lazy or something with how I'm feeling. It's almost like I just want pets that will leave me alone.",20Apr2020,1

Me and my Mom have been walking our dog everyday recently and I think it makes my sister jealous, today she randomly decided she wanted to go as well which I was okay with but then she said that due to the current lockdown situation only 2 people can go out together, I could see what she was doing but my mom is incredibly gullible and ended up taking her side and made me stay at home, this lead to an argument when when they got back, I tried to explain that she was only doing it to split us up and for the rest of the day I have been isolated in my room, when they were out however my sister had obviously been worming her way into my moms thoughts because she started saying all this rehearsed bullshit that she could never come up with by herself when we were arguing, I also heard my mom saying later on she was going to come and make up with me but then my sister intervened and told her not to, I later tried to make it up to her and my sister pretty much ran into the room and stopped me.

884,"First off, I would like to say that my friend (F19) and I (F18) intend on dating. We have made that interest clear, but are not using the girlfriend word yet because she is still moving on from her last relationship which she wants to heal from first, and also wants to get to know me more in person too before we decide. Even if we are extremely flirty, the label scares her right now.

Basically she has things in her life that I want to be okay with, but I'm struggling to accept. She vapes, and applies weed to her skin. I asked her how often she does this and why.
She said it is something for relaxing, and her guess was about 6 times a year. So not very much. 
She drinks socially, but never enough to make her drunk.

I was raised to not be okay with weed or alcohol, I've never smoked, drank, done anything in that area. My parents never really drank in my lifetime until recently. My dad drinks a little bit socially now which is something I'm still adjusting to. My family has next to no history of drug or alcohol abuse, except for my great great drunken Irish grandfather. My parents just chose to not really do it. 
Last year I had two (ex) friends who were extremely against drinking and doing drugs. 
My friend had talked about breaking up with her boyfriend of two years because she found out he had been smoking and drinking socially. 
My other friend broke up with her partner for various reasons and one of the reasons was because her partner smoked. 
I remember they had talks about this a lot with me. And it seems like it got really drilled into me, what my friends explained to me is that if you drink once, the only outcome is an alcohol addiction. If you did weed once, drug addiction.

My friend recently told me about how she vapes and uses weed and drinks socially and I'm having a hard time accepting it. I guess I'm having a hard time seperating those things and addiction, addiction is not 100% guaranteed, and with a girl as focused and safe as this girl I know it is very unlikely. 

Another thing is that she sees the flu shot as unnecessary and possibly harmful.
Everything like tetanus shots, and whenever a cure for coronavirus comes out she is 100% for and knows is important. She likes natural remedies but knows there is a time and place for them and that they can't replace Western medicine. Her being against one vaccine makes me a bit worried but it seems like she understands what is necessary which is all that matters to me.

Another reason I believe I'm struggling is since I have never drank or vaped I have no clue what it does to a person. I asked her to tell me whenever she's drinking if she could tell me (as we are a bit sexual and I don't want to be sexual with her when she is drinking), which she found ridiculous and explained that she never drinks enough to make her not act like herself. 
She tried her best to comfort me but I really don't know how it works.

I guess I need help understanding how drinking and such affects you if anyone could help me understand it better and know how I can be safe with it, or if I'm being overly cautious. 
I don't really plan on drinking or anything much even when Im 21. Just not something I think about.

My mind is still telling me these are all red flags but I know they're not.

Can anyone help me out here with getting rid of this judgement I have? I don't want this to be something I always have a problem with, there's nothing wrong with how she is and I want to be more accepting.",20Apr2020,1

Now I don’t expect them to call me by the name I chose because I can imagine it would be hard for them to do plus I wouldn’t really care if they didn’t it’s completely fine with me the only people that would know me by my new name would be the people I meet when I move away to university and when I eventually start working and if it ever came to a significant other of course I would explain to them the name change.

I had seen them snuggling up on walks around the neighborhood several days a week and affection through the winter (hand holding, that thing teenage boys do when the bump into a girl they like a lot, a few furtive lingering kisses). I thought cool. Nice he has a girlfriend and thought nothing of it.

But... when my neighbor isn't around I have seen her son holding hands with the woman, and some flirty touching with the woman that is living with them. This only happens only when my neighbor is at work. Today for sure I saw them in a long kiss.

My neighbor is a bit dramatic and given what I know of her I'm pretty sure her first reaction would be to get mad at me. 

What do I do? This screams grooming to me. If my son was being preyed upon by an older woman let alone and older woman living with me I would want to know.

Should I just try to snap a picture of them kissing as proof?

5. I mentioned once that I had a couple of succulents at home and she proceeded to buy a bunch and enroll in a monthly subscription for succulents after I had mentioned this


The list goes on, most of the things which involve me buying things, not telling her where I got them and her showing up to work with the same things. I’ve stopped mentioning things that I’m interested in because she’ll suddenly take an interest in them as well. This has all occurred in the year I’ve known her and I’ve asked her before why she buys things I’ve bought and she acts as if it’s news to her that I own the same thing. 

She’s really sensitive and she takes offense easily so I don’t know how to ask her to stop copying me. It’s gotten to a point where it makes me extremely uncomfortable because if someone compliments my necklace or something she’ll mention to them that we have matching necklaces and we bought them together.

905,"Hi! This is gonna be long so bare with me

We've been friends for over 2 years. I met him my freshman year of college (I'm currently a junior) and it was clear he was interested in me from the beginning. Long story short, we talked for awhile, eventually kissed (thats the furthest we've gone) and I eventually asked him what his intentions were. He said he didn't want a relationship at the time and we left off on good terms and stayed as good friends. Sophomore year came along and we still stayed as friends and he would ask to hang out here and there but we never did anything physical or anything.

Summer entering this school year, things changed completely. We began to talk a lot through Snap, he would tag me on things on Facebook. Immediately when classes started in August, he asked me to hang out which then became a consistent thing throughout the year. From August to March, he did a lot of things for me such as: asked to hangout a lot more often, always pay for my coffee several times, always try to hold my hand when we hung out, bought me wine, cooked for me (even bought me a steak because I specifically asked for one), asked to hang out in the city and Facetime over winter break. We were at two parties together this year and he stayed by my side the whole time which was unusual because the past two years he would be hooking up with other girls. At one of those parties, I was dancing close with another guy and I knew he got jealous but just didn't say anything. Anyways, he also remembered my birthday and bought me a bottle of wine after I jokingly asked for one. At my party, I got really drunk and was apparently flirting with his friends and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Fast forward to March, our school required all of us to leave because of COVID19. The day before we all left, he asked to hangout with me because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, he pays and holds my hand. Eventually, we go back to my room and we talk for a bit. Eventually, he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I say I'm not good at this physical stuff (By physical I mean like kissing/making out - i have no experience) and he ensures me its fine. I say I'm only comfortable with just the cheek and he just kisses me on the cheek and kind of just makes out with my neck. We then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he's coming too. I dance with my guy friends and then later, I see him hooking up (making out) with another girl. I then got kind of pissed so I find another guy where I eventually sit on his lap and I knew he saw it.

I like him but I'm still confused on whether he wanted a relationship or not but I’m leaning more that he did want one and just started to realize this now.

I know I should’ve asked what his intentions were but I feel like he should be the one making it clear if his intentions from freshman year changed — not me. I'm not sure if I should reach out because I don't know if he still has feelings for me or if he even thinks about everything that has happened. We’ve barely talked since all of this happened (it’s been around a month)

Should I reach out or just move on and wait for someone who’s more mature and has better communication skills? I’m tired of the immature games and not knowing. I’m well aware that I need some growing up to do too and need to work on communicating better

907,"Thank you for clicking.

About a year and a half ago, I [19M] met these twins [17F]. We instantly clicked, and we became best friends. I was with them nearly everyday. It’s a purely platonic friendship, and I saw them as my sisters.

As time went on, I became very distant towards them due to childhood trauma (I am actively in therapy and recovery for this, no excuses). I became cold, and I withdrew myself. I also adopted some red pill philosophies. I was so angry from my childhood abuse that I just couldn’t trust them or anyone really. Because of the absence of my dad, I just don’t know what it’s like to be a man. As my therapist put it, “I betrayed them because I feared that they would betray me.” I have always had low self-esteem as well, as you can probably tell. This led me to distancing myself because I didn’t feel like I was good enough. They always tried to reach out to me, and they loved me unconditionally. I always bottled up my emotions, acted high and mighty, and shifted between acting indifferent towards them and caring for them. I am now realizing that I was toxic and manipulative to say the least.

In the last two months, communication among us has been extremely slow. This led me to realizing that I am the problem, and it led me to realizing that I was a horrible person. I had an epiphany lately that I am not who I want to be. I need to fix these issues and false ideologies I have. I don’t want to run from my problems anymore, and I don’t want to victimize myself.

This led me to apologizing to them roughly two weeks ago. They both said that they forgave me, and one even expressed how happy she was that I opened up and that she still loves me (platonically).

Although I’m very slowly beginning to talk to them again, I feel that things are still weird. They seemingly don’t trust me (surprise). I feel that at a moments notice they will leave me like I left them. I know I fucked up, but I am going to change.

My question is whether I should take it slowly and see if they trust me again as time goes on, or if I should let it go and move on. We will all be in the same city for college, so regardless we will be around each other in the future (We have mutual friends).

I know I sound like a horrible person, which I was. But I want to change. I really do.

TLDR: I [19M] realized that I was toxic towards my twin best friends [17F] and I don’t know if I should try to gain trust back or move on.",20Apr2020,1

913,"*Sorry long post and the grammar is probably awful!*

I have a close group of friends (theres 10 of us for context) I've known them since college, I'm in my early 30's so we have known each other over a decade. The truth is that I still have a great bond with the majority of them, one of them is my best friend! The problem is that there is 2 people in the group who I've completely outgrown  and theres a concern that if I ditch them I'll break up the group  lose the friends that are important to me.

It's worth pointing out that a couple of us feel the same way but there's a few people who mean the world to us that dont seem as concerned or are willing to put up with their crap(including my best friend).

Theres  issues here with their overall attitude and their behaviour at recent events. The last straw was  my friends wedding, firstly, many years ago one of them had a fall out with one of the guests many years ago and kept going on about it and embarrassing the guest and creating an awkward atmosphere at th wedding. They both then kept asking guests if they had drugs then left the reception to go to another party then decided to come back to our shared cabin we rented  at 5AM and continue partying when the rest of us were trying to sleep,made a mess etc. I could go on about other events but I'd be here forever! 

 I would say the rest of us have grown up but unfortunately they are really immature, despite being slightly older than us  (one of them is 40 next year!) They never seem to hold down a job as they often quit or get fired for  a dumb reason. They'll go out to get drunk and take drugs several nights a week and sometimes during the day and also hang out with a bad crowd . They will invite these dodgy friends to social gatherings without even asking (I had to kick one of them out my house for offering ecstacy and roofies to my houseguests). Because of all this I feel anxious whenever I hang out with them or invite them to anything. 

I've discussed it with some of my friends and they feel the same but others dont seem as bothered even though they dont agree with their behaviour (I think they might just see them as the fun friends or are in denial). It seems cruel but i want to either ditch them or keep them at arms length ,as do some of us , but I'm worried about losing my closest friends.

Because of quarantine my sister is home from college so we're sharing. This is doable on holidays and spring breaks where she's only home for a week or so but it's been more than a month now and I can't deal with her anymore.

She is a neat freak and I'm more laid back so she's constantly getting onto me about making my bed up and washing my clothes in this high baby voice. I understand I should be mindful since we're sharing a living space but I vividly remember when she was 15 and i was 8 her side of the room was messy all the time. I'm a teenager in a worldwide pandemic cooped up in my house for the next few months, my thoughts are everywhere, let me live. 

She's constantly asking me if I'm okay which I know is a good thing but she asks 5-10 times a day when I'm just sitting minding my business. Just because I'm not all smiles all the time doesn't mean I'm battling crippling depression. Sometimes I want to be alone, doesn't mean I'm antisocial. I can't go anywhere. 

sometimes I can't even go into my own room because she's locked the door. she leaves the room light on when I want to sleep. She's always stealing my art supplies and makeup and then accuses me of being a selfish brat when I ask her to stop. She plays girly music on full blast at 1 am, she's so selfish she doesn't care about the 6 other people in the house either trying to sleep or get work done. She's always complaining about having nowhere to go and all these different things. like deal with it!!! the whole world is upset right now.

* My Sister hates that me and my Mom get along, she seems to get incredibly jealous anytime we go out together and she will always try to find ways to cut me off and keep my Mom to herself. For example, due to the lockdown currently where I live only 2 people can go out at a time and so My sister keeps organising trips out of the house which results in me being left home alone, She is also very good at playing my Mom and getting her on her side which I will touch on later so she will always get her own way and no matter how much I want to go out I will always be left behind. One year it was her Birthday and she tried to organise a trip out of the country with all my family accept me, thankfully my Mom refused to leave me behind but his is the kind of thinking she has towards me, its incredibly hurtful.
* She lacks empathy, I'm not saying on a Sociopathic scale, she seems to feel remorse and sympathy for people in pain and animals but lets just say she would be happy to screw someone over. An example would be, she asks to borrow money and my stuff all the time, pretty much at least once a day she uses something that belongs to me which i'm okay with but on the rare occasion I will ask for something in return she will say no, I will try to reason with her and bring up all the times I helped her and she will just say I didn't have to and she doesn't have to help me. I always promise myself that I wont help her again but she always finds a way to get more and more out of me. Another example, I let her borrow one of my bikes once and she got bored of riding it, we were about a mile from the house and she decided she was just going to leave and go hang out with her friends, I asked if she could take my bike home first and she just said no and left it there, I had a bike too but she didn't care, I had to walk mine and the bike I lent her all the way home whilst she happily left me there.
* She is incredibly manipulative, the things she can make people do scares me sometimes, one of her biggest weapons is playing the vulnerable little girl, she cries and acts like a victim and then when she has gotten her own way is magically fine again, this has been one of the things that has made my life hell, growing up I was always blamed, she could get my parents to do whatever she wanted and I would always end up losing. One time we were given the job of looking after an old lady's dog, we had to walk it once a day when she was out and one time she broke a vase, it was 100% her fault but she did her usual turning on the tears when she was questioned and managed to put all the blame on me and come off as the hero, I did absolutely nothing wrong but ended up having to buy a new one and apologise to the old lady. She plays this with me a lot but luckily I can see through her but obviously she is still able to get me to lend her stuff.",20Apr2020,1

937,"(I'm on a different account because I don't want people snooping around what else I have commented and I don't want people I know to be able to see this, so I am very sorry if I do not respond right away)

I have been dating this girl who goes to the same school as me and swims on the same club team as me for about a year and a half now... And I don't know if I feel anything anymore. How do I tell the difference between being genuinely happy or just being content with always being able to have someone there to talk to, or to say goodnight to every night? My girlfriend's definition of love, (Btw I'm going to call her ""KC"" to make things a bit easier) is that no matter what happens you always try to work things out. She came from a family where her mom had her when she was 19, just out of high school, and her dad left after two hellish years, and since then, he has visited KC and her mom multiple times with numerous different girlfriends whom he shows KC off to as if it's his own accomplishment that she is successful. I don't understand it and I don't think I ever will. But I hope that gives you a little background into why KC thinks about love the way she does, always make the effort, and make it work no matter what. Something that has made me think more and more about the way I actually feel about KC is, the other day we watched Perks of Being a Wallflower, don't worry, we used Netflix party and both stayed home :), but a line from that movie really stuck with me. ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" KC has a history of being taken advantage of by guys and getting into some really bad situations, this is because of her definition of love where you try and make it work no matter what, she never breaks up with a guy, they always have to break up with her. So even if she knew that this wasn't working, she would never break up with me because in her head she always needs to try and make it work. I have been thinking about this for hours as I've gardened and weeded outside today, how do I tell if I'm happy? I'm 15 for fuck's sake. I shouldn't even have to be worrying about this this much. But every time in the past three hours that I have tried to go to click on her name to message her, ""Hey, we need to talk,"" I wimp out, because what if I am making the wrong choice? How do I know if I am making the wrong choice? Will I ever know if I am making the wrong choice? Maybe I'm scared of doing this because I know that she will end up saying, ""So that's it? You're just going to leave? after all of this? Without even trying to figure things out with me, you're going to make this decision on your own?"" But we have just been pushing this conversation off for months and months, because she doesn't realize that anything is wrong and has a constant supercut of us running in her head, forgetting all of the bad times. Lockdown has not been kind to her. She is struggling to stay on top of her schoolwork and instead just games all day and then gets stressed and cries and lashes out at me because of her stress, I try to help her, encourage her, tell her I'll do some of the work for her, but it never works, she was having this problem even before Corona hit. I've been telling her this stuff for a year and a half. She get's angry with the little things that I do that frankly, make me, me. But she is right about one thing when things get bad, I typically don't try to work things out, I've broken up with her 3 times over the 18 month period, and sometimes, I always end up getting back together with her, whether it's because I miss her or I just miss having someone to talk to, I don't know, which is my problem. Am I  in love with my girlfriend? Or am I in love with always having someone to talk to, having someone to have sex with, and having someone fall asleep on my chest?  Could this just be any girl? Do I really love her? going back to the part where I talked about her being taken advantage of, I don't want to be a guy who takes advantage of her. I want what's best for her, but lately, her bad moods have been unbearable. She is always upset, and it's rubbing off on me. (It's not like this hasn't been happening for a long time, this has always been an issue, but since she doesn't like talking to other people except random people she places video games with online. she never actually talks about her problems with anyone, except me, which brings me down quite a bit. 

If I leave her now, am I a dick because I left her in a time of need? 

Or am I doing what's best for myself? 

If anyone has any words of wisdom for me, they would be greatly appreciated, I'll be answering clarifications in the comments if anyone wants to know, and I'm sorry this really had no structure, my brain jumps around a lot. Also, this is the first time that I've ever been truthful with my age online, mostly because when it comes to love, a sense of what love is takes time to develop for people, and clearly I'm still working mine out.  Thank you guys so much, I really appreciate it.",20Apr2020,1
938,Hello Im 23(M) and as of late my insecurities have been a constant downfall in my marriage. We've been arguing for the past month and I dont want to lose her so what are some things you've done to get over your insecurities throughout your life in general or withing your marriage?,20Apr2020,1
939,"Oh so ... *deep breath* ... here we go:

I am happily married with two young sons - 5 years old and 7 years old.

My wife is a teacher - not currently working or on call - while I work for a large medical supply company, working from home (wfh) and I have become, as I’m sure you can guess, veeeeeery busy, like, progressively hella busy over the last 3+ weeks wfh.

While my wife agreed to let me seclude myself during most of each day while I work (work which involves a lot of calls and Zoom meetings) and agreed to watch the kids to the best of her ability, the kids, like us, have become progressively irritable and stressed out. And, though she agreed to it, stares holes into my souls every time I step out of my room cause she’s so stressed dealing with them. The 5 year old, in particular, has become a needy-nightmare (constantly pissing the 7 year old and us off ). He, very literally, can’t go 5 minutes without pushing someone to the edge - yelling climbing, throwing, hitting, needing tech help, etc. Even with discipline and multiple long walks throughout each day, he is becoming unmanageable (even with some expectation from us that quarantining little kids yields these circumstances).

NOW, the four of us don’t really leave the house to go out into the general public. If one of us does, it’s with wear masks, gloves, etc. We’re healthy, COVID-free. NOW, my parents who live an hour away are ALSO healthy and precautious.

ISSUE: I need a FK’ING break from these kids. My parents are MORE THAN WILLING to take the kids for a week. I want to send them. I need to regroup my mind and sanity, and get a good week of work in. NOW, my wife is beyond anti-send and thinks I’d be putting us all at risk. My questions are:

1) Am I crazy for even considering sending them? 

2) Is she being ridiculous in thinking someone will get COVID during, which will essentially only be a car ride?

3) What are our other options given the shelter-in-place mandate? (We already walk. Her, being a teacher, already has some academic structure/time in place, etc.)

Every time I hear them running, yelling, asking me to play, throwing, or needing anything at this point, internally, I go from 0-100 in seconds (internally).  

I NEED YOUR HELP!",20Apr2020,1
940,"hello, lately I've been feeling so useless (I hate that word but that's how I feel). what I mean is that this isn't the life that I imagined for me when I started thinking about how I wanted my life to be.

I'm 24, and I guess almost everyone I know already know what to do with their lives. I guess I started feeling lost when I was at my last highschool year and had to do it all over again because I got bad grades. Trust me when I tell I had never ever failed I year in my life, they even made me skip a year when I was little because I was too intelligent for my age. My whole life I was like, too intelligent for everything, too responsible, too good. and now I feel like a failure, I couldn't even finish University because I wasn't feeling it. I always try to go back to what I was. I was active, I always knew stuff, I liked myself. but now I don't even want to be around me and that's a lot. 

when I go to sleep I always say to myself that tomorrow is going to be a different day, that this time for real I'm going to something like studying for example but then the day comes I do nothing. I always think about it I always ""maybe I should study right now"" but I just stay in bed and I lost another day and it's been like this for almost 4 years. 

I used to enjoy things in life. I don't have a hobby, well you could say my hobby is to stay in bed but I don't want that and yet it seems I can't find the strength to do something about it. I want to change my attitude but I just can't.",20Apr2020,1

We're u and ur wife surprised that ur wife kept her job?"" I replied with of course ( because they laid off hundreds of ppl, and my wife has only been here a year ) women then said "" yeah there was no rhyme or reason of how they did it"" and walked off. 

My wife is a incredibly hard worker, working in an industry dominated by men. She works tons of over time is on great terms with her boss because she's a fucking rockstar. She knows the job better then guys her age and has a fantastic work ethic. She has a great performance reviews and a lot of other ppl like her. 

So when it came down to all these lay offs her boss said that it's not up to him but if it was she would be the first pick. 

Idk if I'm being overly sensitive about what that lady said but I wanna punch her in the fucking mouth. Or at least in a calm but stern and as professional as possible tell that lady not to talk about shit she doesn't understand.

944,"My situation is a unique one. I am 29 and was raised entirely by a single mother. She was totally and completely alone. My father left before I was born and I have never met him. My mom had an extremely abusive childhood and has been unable to have healthy adult relationships. She has never been in a romantic relationship and her children have been her entire life. I believe my brother and I were somewhat of a stand-in for actual adult connections. She was an extremely loving and attentive mother and we are  now best friends.

I have never been in a romantic relationship either. I guess because I never saw it growing up and cannot connect with men, as I have never had a positive male figure in my life. I have resigned myself to this, but I feel like a total and complete loser for living with my mom at 29. We have a place together and share the bills equally. My mom is a soulmate of mine (my other soulmate is my best friend since childhood). I honestly couldn't imagine being without her. She feels the same way about me. 

I know that if I said I found a boyfriend and wanted to move on my own, she would encourage it and feel happiness, but I also know that she is totally and completely alone in her life and would be immensely lonely and empty without me. We rely on each other a ton for emotional support and I think we mutually feel bad for one another. 

So I am with my mother because we are wickedly close, super attached to one another, and both seemingly unable to find partners anyways. It makes the most sense to just stay together.

But this whole situation is an honest to God mess and I need any insight possible. Thank you.",20Apr2020,1
945,"Ok first off I'd like to say I don't have the disease. I'm talking about how it's societal impact is affecting me personally. 
Because of social distancing I'm starting to feel lonelier than ever. I had only started working and taking classes at University in order to meaningfully have an interaction with people. I have a lot of friends but only 2-3 of them were my ""true friends"" that id talk to about every day.
I just got out of a toxic relationship with my 26F ex gf and I thought I had some hope in another girl I've been seeing who is a much better person than her in many ways. 
Were both 24 and we used to hang very often, even until a week after lockdown but unfortunately she has asthma and is more susceptible to having serious complications if she gets the virus.
Because of that I have told her it's better we just keep distant like everyone else and communicate distantly. 
As I expected, our conversations have been getting weaker and I feel she's letting me go.
As for my other friends, they're just in a world of their own. 
I've been lonely for a long time and now this is just making me feel worse about myself and this cold world. 
Im good at a lot of things and have many hobbies. I've been keeping up with my online coursework and getting everything done in a timely manner but it just feels there's something missing. 
My brother is the only one I stay with and he's going through depression of his own mainly because his girlfriend is stuck right now with her family in a different state. 
I work out a lot stay very fit and try to focus on my goals for the time being until quarantine is over but it just hurts knowing that the when we come out of lockdown, were all going to be different and I feel like I'm losing everyone. 
I dont usually post on here for things like this but I'm just looking to form some new relationships with people online. Since almost everyone I know is going through problems of their own, I want to just connect with another human meaningfully and share our stories and have someone who can encourage me because that's something I can't do by myself very fluidly.

950,"So my undergrad degree was interior design. I worked in the field a couple years but decided to transition to a completely different and unrelated field to get my masters and start something more fulfilling for myself. 
Interior design was a fun hobby for me and for years when people hear you’re in it the immediate response is, “I could use your help at my house!”
I help people quite a bit just texting about ideas, furniture arrangement, what to put where etc. Many friends and family members think that once they get a house, I am their go-to person to ask a million questions about what they should do. In reality, most people just want reassurance. 
The thing is, I fell out of love of it. My life priorities changed, career has changed, and I don’t even spend time and money on decorating my own house let alone care what other people do. It’s sad enough that people expect this free service from me after I spent years studying design for education, career, and just for fun. I just no longer have the drive to do anything about it anymore. I feel like I’m ready to move on from it. 
In the last couple weeks, I’ve already gotten several questions and requests for help.

But these days I'm developing a very negative outlook on humanity, which is the exact opposite of my past outlook. Before, I was a humanist. Now, I just want some people to suffer. I don't know why I'm feeling this way.

The people protesting quarantine who believe ""God will protect them"". I want them to suffer for their foolishness.

The people buying up all the Nintendo Switch stocks and selling them for double the price on eBay. I want them to suffer.

Racists, mean people, whatever, I wish they would suffer.

The person who cuts me off and continues switching lanes without using their blinker, speeding, and cutting off others as well. Literally makes me want to follow them home and beat them up. (Seriously, when people do this, I become irrationally angry. I'll lay on my horn, flash my brights, etc. This could literally cost me my life, I know)

People who leave their shopping carts in the parking lot without putting them back. I hate them so much.

People with political views opposite of my own. Same thing. I honestly hate them sometimes.

Most people brush these little things off, but for me, I'm just letting them completely ruin my day. I know it is WRONG to feel this way and to judge others without knowing them. I don't want to be angry or hate people. I want to be able to give people the benefit of the doubt, but they make me so angry and I can't figure out how to ignore it.",20Apr2020,1

(I imagine a young couple such as ourselves living together isn’t a great idea) Because of COVID-19, we haven’t even been able to progress very far in our relationship anyway. I’m willing to give that up if it means she feels safe. We’ve always had good chemistry as friends, and I see no reason as to why we couldn’t just stay friends.

I don’t know the specifics of taking in a child for a few months. (it would likely be until June to August at which point other people could take her in)  Would this even be possible? I care about her a lot, and I just want her to be happy.

953,"OK so I asked a question the other day. Harmless enough, no N-words or C-words. No ""what would the world be like without xxx people in it?"". Nothing even remotely offensive. Got a PM back later saying my post was removed not because it was accidentally picked up by the bot as an anagram of the N- word, or because my question was political. The response was this: ""no hypotheticals questions"". 

The question itself was indeed hypothetical, but the principle of the question was not. Interpret that any way you like, but that is incredibly pedantic. So I responded myself with a torrent of abuse.  The reason I responded with a torrent of abuse is because I am borderline psychotic when it comes to pedantry. Rules are rules fair enough. But it is not in anyone's interest to enforce them so strictly. Flexibility. How do I get mods (people in general actually, but I'll stick to the example here) to be flexible. It's the lack of flexibility that gets me. That is what makes me nuts.

&amp;#x200B;

As expected I was banned from that sub that I asked that question on. But what I found extremely amusing was that I was also banned from another subreddit that was completely unrelated. This suggests to me that the mod I abused was irritated enough to research my post history to find out what other subs I post on and try and get me banned from them too! Unfortunately for that mod I was only banned from the one other sub. There is something satisfying about this. (pathetic I know). It feels that just for one short moment, that pedantic moderator felt the same irritation I did when he decided to delete my question for such an obscure reason.

&amp;#x200B;

now here's the relevant bit. How am I supposed to handle such pedantry? You could say ""if you don't like the rules, go somewhere else with different rules"" but this isn't an acceptable answer. (I try to do that anyway, you will never see me on ""askreddit"" or ""askscience)) It's not the rules per se I have a disagreement with, it's the lack of flexibility. I'd expect strict enforcement only when justified. Like on this sub as it happens. People may post sensitive content and trolling would be particularly harmful. I was asking a question about snakes!  How do you deal with jobsworths? What's the most effective way of getting flexibility from completely rigid people?",20Apr2020,1

My roommate is always going on dates and bringing different guys around.  About two months ago she started seeing a new guy.  He made it clear to her that he does not want to date, but gets furious and picks fights with her about other guys.  He is younger than us and lives with his parents, so it makes sense for him to come to our apartment.  However, he would be here all the time. I work two jobs, so when I come home at night I would like to eat dinner in our kitchen and watch tv in the living room (both are shared spaces).  When I would come home from work they would constantly take over the living room, doing PDA so I feel uncomfortable and hangout in my room. 

Fast forward to last weekend.  At 10:30 PM my roommate tells me this guy is coming over, so I head to my room.  After a few hours of them drinking and carrying on I hear them start to fight. (He is upset and suspicious that she is seeing other guys. HELLO she is because you told her you didn't want to date her) They are screaming and slamming doors very loudly in the middle of the night.  After a while I heard them leave and I assumed they went to his car.  A while later I get a text on my phone from my roommate, ""Please come pick me up \*\*\*\*\* left me by Walmart"".  Of course being her friend I tell her I am on my way and to stay put.  A few minutes later I got a text saying that he came back for her and that I don't need to get her.  So I go back up to my apartment and guess what? Now I get a call from her sobbing to the point that I cannot understand her telling me that he is trying to hit her and push her out of the car.  

This guy finally brings my roommate home and I told him he has to leave and is not welcome here.  I try to calm my roommate down and put her to bed and this guy is blowing up her phone calling both of us terrible names and making horrendous public comments on her instagram.  So I block him on everything and go to bed. He then tries to make contact with me on instagram and I block him. 

A few days later my roommate texts me to tell me that she has unblocked his number and really misses him, she wants to give it another try. I told her that I do not feel comfortable with a violent person who does not respect either of us, or our apartment here.  He came over but they sat in the parking lot of our apartment complex.

Anyway, so Mandy and I worked together on a short film. You have partners that serve as your camera person so I asked her if she’d want to be my partner. She said yes and our relationship was really awkward. She never wanted my insight and she never really talked to me when I offered to help her out or see how her script was doing.

I refused because the character was someone I was uncomfortable playing, and I’m not much of an actor, so she stuck me as what amounted as a PA, got a different camera person, and never spoke to me on set.

The next week as I was due to shoot, my anxiety took a turn for the worst and several things fell apart at once. I talked to my professor for the class and asked him advice on how to handle the fact that we butted heads on her set. He took a hands-off approach and said that it was more our issue to solve and that I needed to be assertive that I was my set. I left afterward to check out equipment and most of my crew had gotten tied up in other things and couldn’t come. I asked Mandy for her help and she came bitterly saying I interrupted one of her classes.

After loading, I came up to her and asked if everything was okay, and if I had done anything to upset her or inconvenience her on her set or in the planning stages, and she replied with:

“You have no fucking idea how irate I am with you right now. This bullshit isn’t even the tip of the iceberg with you. Don’t fucking cry about it because I’m not gonna he a babysitter on your set. Get this shit over with and go to your fucking therapist appointment because I’m done with your shit. When we’re done shooting, leave me alone.”

I left and had a panic attack driving to my therapist and nearly wrecked my car. Definitely one of the worst days of my life. Luckily my therapist calmed me down and told me that it had to be something else bothering the girl, or maybe she just wanted a target and that I seemed like a good one because I’m generally non-confrontational (and I’ll admit, kind of a softie). So I went ahead with filming, and put her on sound. She of course fucked up my sound on my exterior shots but the camera audio was still usable. Thank god my emphasis is sound design. My DP is a good friend and so was my AD, so they kept everything moving, and once we finished shooting, she fulfilled her promise and didn’t talk to me anymore.

Now it’s been months, and it’s like nothing ever happened. She got very close to a couple people I had been close with and I eventually wound up more distant. She sucks up to the professor and I’m assuming told him nightmare tales about me. I’ve noticed emails from him have just seemed unusually curt, but that part may just be my anxiety.

It pisses me off that she yelled at me to the point of tears and now acts like nothing ever happened. How do I even deal with this? *Should* I even deal with this?",20Apr2020,1

TW: rape 
I’m a long time lurker and first time poster here. I’m in a situation where I can’t speak to anybody I know and desperately need advice. 
I met my partner 6 years ago and we really hit it off. He is a soft sensitive individual and he always puts me first. We never argue. I really feel like he is my soul mate.He is amazing and he proposed to me a few months ago. I said yes! We have the perfect relationship.
The only problem is, before I met him I was raped. It was very difficult for me to deal with because the person who did it did it while I was asleep at a house party. I woke up with him on top of me and he tried to convince me that it was me who instigated the whole thing.
I pressed charges and he took jail time but it still affects me to this day.
My partner has always been supportive and has always given me my space and for the past 6 years I’ve felt like I was healing. 
However, a few nights ago, I woke up when my partner was going to bed. I woke up with him (thinking I was asleep) touching my arm and then reaching under my shirt and touching my boob for a long period of time.

Indecisiveness is hitting hard, and I'd love some opinions on my apartment search.

Some background, my boyfriend and I are moving to a growing city where rent prices are fairly high. We intend to buy within the next two years, but we want to make sure we are staying in the area long term before taking the plunge.

We both work from home, so we will be spending a lot of time at the apartment and want to love it. We are trying to decide of the high price of apartment one is justified. We keep going back and forth, so we thought we'd ask some internet strangers for some help.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Apartment 1:** $2300 + Utilities

My mom lets me live with her until I've completed school. my financial aid covered every expense for school. In October, I finally came out to my mom about me being molested by my cousin when I was nine years old. My mom told my relatives and this made my family divide into two: the ones that believed me and supported me, the ones that didn't believe me, didn't want anything to do with me and thought I only told because I wanted money from it, because of this i became depressed I didn't attend my classes anymore i took 3 classes online and i didn't check on those anymore, all i wanted to do was lay in bed and do nothing at all nothing peaked my interest anymore I didn't even practice good personal hygiene. The situation with my family happened many year ago when I was 9 years old, so I can see why many of my family members thought I was lying about it because I kept it quiet for so long. Alot of problems at work arose with another coworker, which i won't go into detail about, because its long and pointless, but my boss suspended me and only allowed me and the other coworker to work shifts when we weren't in contact with each other so I hated work too. after the end of my semester I went to my adviser and told her about my depression ( I didn't tell her about me telling my family about the molestation) i felt like it wasn't important, but she told me to see the mental health counselor at school I also went to my doctor and told him my antidepressants weren't working anymore he prescribed me a higher dose. I still had my second reimbursement from FAFSA so I continued with spring classes and I got all A's in them work is better now too, but now its that time to write an appeal letter and reapply for FAFSA and i just don't think that ""my story"" will be a good enough reason to re-appeal I want to continue with school but I can't afford it myself and my mom doesn't make enough money to help me either.

983,"Let me preface all of this by saying this is incredibly, incredibly embarrassing and shameful for me to write, and I would appreciate if you read/responded without judgment. I’m beating myself up enough as it is.

To get right into it, I worked at a summer camp for years when I was younger, and a couple of times when I playing with the kids (crawling/hugging on me) I got gotten a semi-erection/swelling of the penis. Like, not a raging hard on by any means, not the kind I get when I am turned on, but like one of those dull, blood-is-starting-to flow ones. At the time I kind of got anxious but I just shut it out. I remembered that it happened not too long ago, and I completely freaked and terrified there is something wrong with me. What really scares me is that I realized it happened (like 3 times) with kids of the same gender, and I’m scared that means something, like I “have a preference.” Let me also say that it wasn’t like I was going around playing with or touching the kids. The boys just always wanted to play around and wrestle and jump all over, roughhousing and stuff.  

I told my therapist and she wasn’t at all concerned, said that it means nothing evil or wrong about me, and it’s just something that can happen. Having googled relentlessly about it, I can see that’s the case. A lot of men have posted on here about it happening to them, and people usually answer with the same response (oxytocin, response to physical stimulation, something coming into contact with your groin.) She also pointed out to me how I have had very bad relationships with men/male figures my whole life, and being in the position a couple of times where I was experiencing the kind of bonding I didn’t get as a kid and being a “dad-like” figure just caused a hormonal reaction, but not in any sexual sense. Logically, I can understand all of this, it makes sense. And having a therapist tell me it’s nothing to worry about also is helpful. I’ve lived my entire health being attracted to/having sex with adults, and since then, I’ve played with several kids and it didn’t happen, this was when I was a young adult. I just got myself hung up on the gender part of it, scared that it means something deeper.

Basically all of my friends were brought together by school and sometimes you don't even get to choose if you like them or not. 

My best friend is a good guy who always supported me and we both enjoy each other's presence. He is kind, funny and a loyal friend, but he also really enjoyed spending time with the new kids.

In my sight they were bullies. They made fun of my weight before getting to know me. I tried to cope with it because I didn't really want to leave my best friend (we'll call him BF). I didn't want to confront BF about it because I was scared of remaining alone, so I got into the friend group.

Getting to know each one of them better gave me a better understanding about what I got myself into. I officially became friends with bullies.

Daily occurrences of bullying against anyone in their path really made me feel bad. But even though i became a member of the friend group, I still was getting bullied. My slow height growth, high pitched voice and a little puff weight didn't help. Plus to all that my parents are kinda overprotective and don't let me do most stuff they do. Even if i confirm it is safe, sometimes there isn't even a reason -- i just get grounded or something.
This gave me a big reputation of being a mamma's boy and one time one of the friends told me that he didn't bother asking me about going out once because he knew of my permission situation AND he didn't really want me to come. In front of EVERYONE IN THE FRIEND GROUP.

Eventually I tried to do something about it. I spoke for myself and told the group how I felt, but I got the same aggressive jokes back at me.

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't all a nightmare. We had fun and we spent time together nicely sometimes. Some girls' addition to the friend group helped lower the bitterness factor of everyone. 

It is a lot for me to take upon myself. I don't want to look like a victim here because I also bullied. I looked at them and saw an example to follow but i realised that its not how it is supposed to be. Unfortunately i am still in this friend group and being rude to other classmates kinda cut the ends to developing any other friendships in the class.

i posted the abusive ex bf story earlier here in r/advice : [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/g4sna7/ghosting_my_celeb_ex_bf_after_he_abused_me_an/)

Currently I am fighting with my dads and my mom. I did some shitty stuff and am currently in a hotel room, as i got asked to leave for the rest of the week.

I posted something in AITA and got a few comments before being banned, that made me call them up and apologize. Nevertheless i still think there are some issues and i have the right feelings.

my dad divorced my mum when i was 5  and moved in with his boyfriend. My mother knew of his sexuality and we grew up like a patchwork family. I moved in with my dad at the time, as  his boyfriend took care of me.

Growing  up with them was nice and i really felt taken care off, but somehow i  feel i got pushed to be gay. In my teens, they started having monthly  cocktail parties with the local community at our place. I heard a lot of  stories, made friends and felt very comfortable. No one ever did  something to me.

I got to know a guy my age at that time and we hung out and eventually shared some experiences. I had  a girlfriend too, but we never made out. Mostly because i didn't feel  attracted to her physically.

So i  thought i am gay, and that's it. 

Last Summer i met a girl at a party and shared some intimate moments. Since then we dated and i feel  comfortable. I am not a flamboyant gay person, just the regular dude,  but i don't care anyway.

I moved  out my dads place 3 years ago but moved back last spring to save some money (see the abusive ex-bf part). They had one of those cocktail parties again and i remembered how comfortable  i felt. I made out with a guy my age at his place later that night and felt i finally got what i was missing for a long time.

I am 26 now and am pretty confused. I could compare it with a gay guy growing up in a straight home being forced to be straight, and somehow i feel that way. I can't help but wonder, if I would have turned out the same, if i would have grown up in a straight environment.",20Apr2020,1

996,"Tw: substance abuse

TL;DR: Joined AA when I was 22. Stayed sober for 4 years. Drank a glass of wine on Saturday, and the world didn’t end. Now I’m having an identity crisis.

I got sober right when I turned 22. I had moved somewhere by myself, had no friends, and was drinking about two bottles of wine by myself every night. I was unmedicated for my depression and anxiety, and it was the only coping skill I had. I started going to AA meetings as advised by my therapist after I told her I wanted to quit drinking for a while, and I totally drank the kool-aid. I started counting days, identifying as an alcoholic (even though I had never tried quitting before), I got a sponsor, did the steps, and built up a community of support around me. I quoted the Big Book, found God, and I even found my now-fiance in the rooms of AA (no 13 stepping involved).

I strung together four years of sobriety. For the past two years, I have slowly grown a resentment toward AA. Slowly- but oh, boy; how it has grown.  It has become so bad that I hate almost everything about it. I hate that they told me who I was. I hate that I feel brainwashed. I hate that I can’t look at, smell, or think about alcohol without thinking about all the stupid little sayings “one day at a time!” “stick with the winners” “do the steps or die!” “this too shall pass!” I am getting heated just writing this. I hate going to meetings. I hate the idea of abstinence. So this resentment has been growing and growing and all I can hear is the fucking Big Book saying “Resentment is the number one offender. It destroys more alcoholics than anything else.” Well, they were right, as much as I hate to admit it. This brings me to my next chapter.

Over the past few weeks, I have had a total identity crisis that looked like this: “What if I’m not even an alcoholic? Why can’t I have just one glass of wine with dinner? I miss the taste. I miss the relief. I bet I can drink like a normal person- I haven’t even tried before! The only time I ever really tried to control myself was when I was young, had no coping skills, no friends, and a daily physical dependence to alcohol ( I would shake if I didn’t have it). I was in college and went balls-to-the-wall with my drinking and drug use, and I never tried any different and now I’m TRAPPED in this stupid abstinence program where if I drink it’ll be this huge deal to ALL my family and friends because I’ve identified as an alcoholic for the past four years! Not to mention I would essentially be shunned from AA- well, not shunned, but pitied and used as an example of what NOT to do. I can hear them now ‘Did you hear Jenny relapsed? Yes, I’ve been praying for her,’ and it makes me almost ill with anger. Like MAYBE I’m not even an alcoholic but just needed a break to get clean! What about the other forms of rehabilitation? Harm reduction? It would be humiliating to break my streak but who gives a fuck about a streak. A normal person wouldn’t be thinking about alcohol this much.. Or is that just what they’ve taught me????”

So that was my brain. Nonstop. For weeks. Telling me to drink. So, I started talking to EVERYONE about it. Looking back, I was trying to get someone to tell me it was okay to drink. Well, nobody did. But I had already talked myself into it. I had made my decision. I would try a glass of wine.

I was so scared and excited at the same time. I had dreams as well as nightmares about this. I sat down to watch TV with my fiance and my mom (we are quarantining together) (fiance is sober and mom is a normie) and I poured myself a glass. I gave a long speech about how this is my decision and I’m deciding to try it alongside them in case it gets dangerous or depressive. I concluded that it was ultimately an experiment- an experiment to see if I really was alcoholic or not; if I really had this “allergy” I was so convinced I had. So I put the glass to my lips, took a sip… and…. Eh. It was okay. It didn’t feel like I remembered. I remembered it being this rush of warmth that enveloped me like a hug. It wasn’t like that. I just felt… that same... only drunker? If that makes sense.

I woke up the next day with all my limbs, no arrest, no black out, no ruined relationships. I drank one glass of wine and that was that. I didn’t want more. I wasn’t on the edge of my seat waiting to drink again. Nothing like when I was younger and absolutely living for it.

My family, friends, and fiance have all been very supportive and loving and accepting. I feel lucky for that. I will continue to be open and transparent about my drinking- Being honest and telling on myself is something that AA taught me, for which I am grateful.

I guess at this point, I’m just lost. I don’t know who I am. If I’m not a recovering alcoholic then who am I? Are there support groups for this? I feel like I accidentally joined a cult or something. A good cult, and one that helped me, and one that helps thousands of people and their families every day,  but ultimately may not have been for people like me. Or maybe it was exactly what I needed and I’m... cured? I don’t know. I feel sad. I’m mourning the loss of who I thought I was. I am confused about where to go from here. I don’t know if I will drink again. I don’t even necessarily care either way. I feel ambivalent about it. And that’s what weirds me out.

I guess I’m posting this to ask… is there anyone else who has been through an experience like this? I feel alone and confused and scared.",20Apr2020,1

1005,"TLDR; my best friend of 23 years drives me insane and thinks she’s going to stay with me all summer. I don’t know how to tell her she can’t without hurting her feelings and damaging the friendship

My friend, I’ll call her P, has been my best friend for 23 years. We’ve had a lot of ups and downs, and we’re very different people, but we have a genuine love for each other and have almost always been there for one another. 

Here’s my problem: P has basically just… not grown up. She still has the maturity and habits of a teenager. I love her so much, but it makes spending prolonged periods of time together frustrating and difficult. 

Many of her close friends besides me have intentionally created distance between them or outright stopped spending time with her (which they have told me in private), for these reasons. I’m not going to get into everything she does; I’ll just summarize the last couple weeks to give you an idea:

My boyfriend, T, lives a few hours out of my city in the country, and invited me to come stay with him during the quarantine period, which I gladly accepted. Another friend of ours lives in the same town as my boyfriend and offered work to P, which she accepted. P asked if she could stay with T and I. I told her that the house is pretty small (it is, it’s a one bedroom so she’d have to sleep on a mattress in the living room) and that it wasn’t really tenable for her to stay for a long time, but that if she wanted to spend a week or so hanging out I was cool with it (I told her that after checking with T). 

The day after P arrived, T’s dad who lives 2,000 miles away was laid off from a job he’s been at for 30 years. T decided to go back home and stay there for a few weeks making sure his dad was okay and has everything he needs and is settled. So, P just kind of stayed. Its been over 2 weeks and T still isn’t home. In that time, P:

\-leaves piles and piles of her stuff all over the floor around her mattress in the living room

\-doesn’t get up off the mattress hardly at all, all day

\-leaves dirty dishes and crumbs everywhere

\-throws laundry all over the floor

\-interrupts me while I’m trying to study to show me random videos and gets offended if I don’t want to look at them

\-tracks dirt all over the carpet from outside (I spent a whole day rug doctoring it two months ago because of people doing that)

\-doesn’t cook, and gets upset if I cook myself anything and don’t offer to make some for her too (so I’ve basically been doing all the cooking, all the dishes, all the sweeping, mopping, straightening up, vacuuming, I went to the laundromat and did all of both of our laundry)

This came to a head when I finally couldn’t handle the piles of stuff on the floor anymore. I picked up everything I could, and finally there was a smaller pile of stuff against the wall. I asked her very calmly if she could take her things and put them away in the closet, where I had put my things (like a normal human being)(I didn’t say that last part). She totally flipped.

She stared at me wide eyed like she thought I was going to hit her (she has a habit of being really dramatic and painting herself in a victim role so people feel bad) and she said the following: “My mom used to do this to me. You’re triggering me really bad right now.”

Now, P’s mom is the nicest lady in the world. She is like my mom. She has never abused P. My own mom on the other hand physically abused me all through my childhood. Basically what P is saying is that her mom would ask her to clean up, would get frustrated, and they would fight, and now being asked to not leave her shit all over the floor “triggers” her. 

She was so upset with me she wouldn’t speak to me for a full hour, and when she finally did she was reading a book I just bought, and said “can I read this?” I told her I was reading it. I was so irritated I didn’t know what to do at this point, but I decided I wanted to just squash it, so as a peace gesture I walked next door to the store and bought another copy of the book and gave it to her. 

She said, “Oh you feel guilty about causing me so much anxiety earlier so now you’re trying to buy me off! Haha!”

I didn’t say anything. We were stuck together and I didn’t want to make it worse. 

Ok so now P’s friend who offered her the work offered to let her stay there (as far as I know, P thinks she and I are getting along great. I don’t think she realizes how pissed I am. It’s hard to tell her when you’re frustrated with her behavior because she self-victimizes and dodges and doesn’t change, and I know it’ll just turn into a fight, which I really want to avoid when we’re in the same house like this). 

So her friend has really bad internet, and P and I are both in college so we have lots of Zoom meetings. T has good internet. P said something about how she wants to just pop over during the days so she can use T’s internet and such. T still isn’t back, like I said, and I didn’t really say anything. T has told me privately that her behavior can be off putting in spite of the fact that he likes her, and that if I don’t want her here he totally supports me. 

The thing is… I agreed for her to come for a week (and obviously in my mind T can override anything I agree to at any time because it’s his house not mine). I didn’t think I could handle more than a week. And she clearly thinks we’re all going to spend months together and see each other every day. I’m sure she would like that. I would not like that. I am going to completely lose my mind. I know everything I’ve said here makes it sound like she sucks but like, I’m sure there’s plenty about me that also sucks and is hard to deal with, and there are lots of good things about her too, they’re just not the point of my post. 

I want to keep this friendship. I want to talk to her about this stuff and work on it but I don’t think a quarantine when everyone is really on edge is going to be the time it sticks, especially when it’s so hard for her to hear criticism on a good day. 

I know the usual response would be the normal Reddit thing of, “it’s T’s house and you don’t owe her anything, tell her to pound sand!”

But I don’t want to tell her to pound sand. I’m looking for advice on how I can approach this diplomatically and tactfully and not have to deal with this every day while at the same time not making her feel like I hate having her around and don’t want to be her friend. 

We get along great when we just hang out for the day or have the occasional sleepover. It’s just these long periods of being together that really tax our relationship, but that’s not a normal thing for us. 

Anyone have any ideas? Thank you so much for taking the time. Cheers",20Apr2020,1

i posted the abusive ex bf story earlier here in [r/advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/advice/) : [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/g4sna7/ghosting_my_celeb_ex_bf_after_he_abused_me_an/)

Currently  I am fighting with my dads and my mom. I did some shitty stuff and am currently in a hotel room, as i got asked to leave for the rest of the  week.

I posted something in AITA  and got a few comments before being banned, that made me call them up  and apologize. Nevertheless i still think there are some issues and i have the right feelings.

my dad  divorced my mum when i was 5 and moved in with his boyfriend. My mother knew of his sexuality and we grew up like a patchwork family. I moved in with my dad at the time, as his boyfriend took care of me.

Growing up with them was nice and i really felt taken care off, but somehow i feel i got pushed to be gay. In my teens, they started having monthly cocktail parties with the local community at our place. I heard a lot of stories, made friends and felt very comfortable. No one ever did something to me.

I got to know a guy my age at around that time and we hung out and eventually shared some experiences. I had a girlfriend too, but we never made out. Mostly because i didn't feel attracted to her physically.

So i thought i am gay, and that's it.

Last Summer i met a girl at a party and shared some intimate moments. Since then we dated and i feel comfortable. I am not a flamboyant gay person, just the regular dude, but i don't care anyway.

I moved out my dads place 3 years ago but moved back in last spring to save  some money (see the abusive ex-bf part). They had one of those cocktail parties again and i remembered how comfortable i felt. I made out with a guy my age at his place later that night and felt i finally got what i was missing for a long time.

I am  26 now and am pretty confused. I could compare it with a gay guy growing up in a straight home being forced to be straight, and somehow i feel that way. I can't help but wonder, if I would have turned out the same, if i would have grown up in a straight environment.

I talked with my dads about it and they simply told me: ""well, if you feel better being with a guy you are gay, or bi."" i was really frustrated at that point and started to say pretty nasty things, so nasty they asked me to spend the rest of the week in a hotel room (on my expense) and to come back once my head is clear.

My mum thinks i act silly an immature, her bf thinks i have been pushed into a direction. The girl i met last summer tells me i am in my right questioning my dads behaviour.

I started to question every move my dads made. They came up with those parties with mostly men telling me how great it is to be gay, and i don't know if i have been influenced by it a tad too much.

I am fully aware that sexual preference isn't something one can choose entirely, and that i might just rebel against my dads finding my own voice and stuff, but since the breakup with my bf last spring and the things that happened this summer i simply started to ask a lot of questions.

I feel comfy with both genders. I tend more towards men, but ask myself if i do this because of my dads.  
As my ex-bf contacted me recently, me ghosting him, i am sure many of my feelings are mixed up, but still i can't let go of the feeling to be brainwashed or something. 

I hope i get more than ""go get therapy!"" - advice. 

I will meet my dads tomorrow for lunch and will apolgize in person for what i said, but i feel i have broken something that i shouldn't have and can't shake the feeling it is a move they make on me. I know it sounds paranoid, but i want to know what they think about it.",20Apr2020,1

1013,"Context. I've been terribly bored in quarantine, and while browsing a fanfiction website the other night, I found an absurd kink fic for a series a friend of mine really likes- The Witcher. Basically, the fanfiction was a chubby/weightgain fic. I sent it to him and we had a few laughs, but then he began to dig deeper, discovering in the process that there were a lot of chubby Witcherfics. And mpreg. All that weird stuff. Neither of us were familiar with the, uh, chubby chaser(??) community, so we read and made fun of a few more.

Cut to us, a few hours later into the night-now-morning, laughing and joking, when my friend pops a joke off. ""Imagine a fanfic where Jaskier was chubby, but it turned out to be mpreg. Two weird kinks in one!"" We rattled ideas back and forth about it until we realized: it was a damn good fanfiction premise. Problem was, neither of us are into that stuff. I was growing more and more invested in the concept, however, so I started conducting research into the kinks (it was just as upsetting as it sounds) and started writing.

My friend has told me a lot about The Witcher, both the show and the games, which he's played hours and hours of. I've watched a bit of the Netflix show myself. Under his guidance on how to characterize Geralt, Jaskier, and Yennefer, I wrote a chapter of a chubby Jaskier/chubby loving Geralt fanfiction with an mpreg plot twist. (To put it even more into context how far I am from the fetishes addressed in the fic, I'm a lesbian with a bit of a monster kink, which while weird is far removed from this.)

I have an eye for detail and really love writing, so instead of going the crackfic route I took it seriously, and then my friend made an account for the fanfiction site, and I posted it. Cut forward in time again and my friend and I are both shocked and horrified by an outpouring of attention to our horrible fanfic- people loved it, and didn't guess it was ""fake"". 7 comments. Hundreds upon hundreds of clicks. Bookmarks. Likes. Needless to say we were impressed, horrified, and proud. I did too good of a job?!?

Last night, I wrote chapter two. Never in my life did I think I would write chubby gay male sex. I took it seriously once again, and almost vomited a few times. As of posting this it has five more long comments of people singing it's praises. What do I do? My friend and I are impressed and afraid. Is this a testament to my writing skills? Or am I an awful person? I have to get this off my chest, because I'm too ashamed to tell any of my other friends. At least I'm not turned on by it.

I'm not really happy about this since it's my only place to live and just being in the same room where they are with each other creates this tension and makes me feel uncomfortable just going outside my room (giving me weird looks when I walk in the room where they are, jumping up from laying on each other, fumbling words when I talk to them) I wouldn't care so much about them dating but I don't want to deal with the repurcussions if they get serious or if they decide to break up and start arguing with each other. I haven't talked to them directly yet but just wondering what course of action/what I should say to the both of them. Thanks!",20Apr2020,1

1034,"Hi. I'm a senior in college and as y'all know the COVID-19 situation has changed everyone's lives in a way no one guessed. I am definitely one of them. 

I worked so hard to graduate in 3 years and was looking forward to a career. I am a Business Management major, but I wanted to do Accounting. I know it was a bit of a reach, but since I have experience as an Accounting intern, I thought I could. It wasn't going to be the end of the world to me if I didn't though. 

Now I am only about 4 weeks before officially graduating with no offers. I got some interviews for sales jobs that were sketchy in general and noped out of them. Any position for an Accounting job or Analyst job, I've been rejected from all of them.   
The more I think about it, the more I feel unprepared about going out to the workforce now. I have applied to two grad programs and waiting for... another two rejections, to be honest. My GMAT scores sucked and I just don't know why I can't do it. I am going to apply to another school that I know I will get in, but it's 70 miles away so the commute would suck. On top of that, even if I go to grad school I still have to work in retail which makes me really anxious. 

Now I'm stuck with papers that I just kept on procrastinating like always because I just don't see myself having a great future even if I complete them. It's always been the same. Somewhere, somehow I just feel like I shouldn't even exist. Yes, I have major depression and I am getting medication for it, but that doesn't seem to be helping much.

So I'm having an issue where it's very hard for me to concentrate on anything. I'm back from college due to the pandemic, so I'm with my parents for the time being. I know this sounds silly, but my dad keeps sniffing, snorting, eating loudly, and overall just has a plethora of bad habits. Apart from that, I love him, but when I tell him to please try his best to keep an eye on his habits, he and my mom always tell me to ""tolerate it"" and that I'll have to deal with worse. So I did. I don't eat with them anymore and I always bring my food upstairs. I also avoid my dad as much as possible, as mean as it sounds. 

This is the kicker: whenever I try to concentrate on school work and get frustrated, his bad habits come to mind and give swing my mood terribly. Same thing happens when I try to sleep and relax. I don't know why this bothers me so much.  

Does anyone else have the same issue? I feel somewhat selfish for asking this because I do love my dad, but he's pretty stubborn and not willing to change when it comes to his habits.

So we are engaged and have been together for two years. He’s had three exes in total. His first girlfriend of four years and he broke up 7 years ago but in our early conversations he once said ‘ nothing really went wrong. It just fizzled out. Had we been older things could’ve been different’. Ever since he said this about a year ago it has not sat well with me and I’ve brought it up a few times. He said that he’s just being mature about the situation and that whatever I’m thinking the opposite it actually true. I can’t really bring it up again as I’ve done so loads of times. I’ve also made very clear I don’t want to be with him if he has any lingering what ifs and to break up with me out of respect but let’s be real, no one would do that. 

But something in my gut makes me feel like a consolation prize. 
To be fair my ex was secretly still into his ex and I could totally tell but he always denied it so I don’t know if this is causing me to feel this way in my new relationship, but I’m very cautious about it and it’s making me not put as much effort into my relationship as I actually should be as I’m wary of making someone my all meanwhile they are wishing they were with someone else.",20Apr2020,1

I can't just de escalate and walk away because no matter how firm I am or how much I try and escape him he just *won't fuck off*. I feel bad because the guy has obviously got some screws loose, questionable morals aside. He tries to talk to me about ""lesbos"" and  how he ""used to hate gays until he learned its 40/60"" or some insane argument that makes no sense. Then he starts to go off about politics and starts to tell me how I agree with him, which is even more awkward and hard to talk out of because he knows we support the same candidate. He tries to put words in my mouth and he uses the excuse that ""he was a veteran"" to justify everything he says. It's just uncomfortable and horrible all around. I wear a bracelet my boyfriend gave me with the German flag and once this guy noticed it he called me a Nazi lover and started to go off about German people and Europeans in such a horrible way. Worst of all, I get other customers staring and I'm scared they think I agree with him. I don't usually have issues with anxiety but this guy almost sends me into a panic. 

What can I do to get away from him? Can my managers even kick him out of the store if he's not directly harassing me or anyone else?

Now it’s quarantine and he nonstop wants to text. Every day. Multiple times during the day. If I don’t respond but he sees I’m on social media he’ll double text (I usually respond a day or two later and I’ll send really dry texts that don’t make a conversation go any further).

1050,"don't worry, not a sob story or anything. also posting on an alt because walmart has a habit of firing people who speak badly about them online. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I picked up cart pushing at Walmart because nowhere else even bothered giving me the time of day. I mean I've applied to upwards of 80-90 places. Not the most I've seen, granted, but I needed a job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this job hasn't really been that optimal for me. I went from not being active at all, to suddenly walking 10-15 miles a day. That, along with always having feet problems causes my joints ache so so so badly. I've gone through 4 bottles of painkillers in the last 2 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

I kinda knew what I was getting into and I needed the job so I don't really wanna complain about that too much. But my problem is, some of my managers don't seem to understand how much work cart pushing is at all and have insane expectations for everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll need to explain the store and the way we've been handling coronavirus thus far. It's a supercenter in a populated place. The way that we've been handling coronavirus is by completely shutting off one entrance and forcing everyone to go through another one, where we have sprayed carts. This increases the amount of traffic on one side, thus making it harder to keep up with. There's been pandemic buying recently, making it even harder to keep up with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that out of the way, let me go over the unreasonable expectation one lower level manager has for us. He LITERALLY expects the cart bay to be LITERALLY overflowing with carts every time of the day, regardless of the day. I usually take care of carts by throwing the strays in the corrals so they're out of the way, but he wants me to hand push them into the bay. The walmart has a bit of a slope, and I live in a state where the weather easily reaches 110-120 during the summer, so this will be an absolute killer. He doesn't bother trying to help us. He just reprimands us because apparently having a literal fucking pandemic shouldn't keep us from easily filling up a bay that's difficult to keep stocked even during normal operations. This happened the other day when there was 4 of us there so we were able to fill it up with about an hour's worth of work. However, they like to only put 2 of us out there at a time and I know I won't be able to keep up with these unreasonable expectations if i'm alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

What exactly should I do? The store manager and the front end manager already know about my leg issues and whatnot and they were talking about moving me, but they haven't yet because I'm assuming they need me out here. They already have a form that says I'm disabled, so that along with already talking to me means they can't exactly pretend that they didn't know. This lower level manager is having an absolute power trip and he's being unreasonable. I know that I signed up for a job that was a really bad match for me and I understand that. I will put myself through the daily body pain until I can manage to get something better. But I know if I operate at the pace that this asshole wants me to I'll end up seriously hurt. Again, I can't stress this enough: I understand that I kinda picked a job that was bad for me, but I had no other choice. I'll do what I signed up for. But fucking killing myself because a cart bay isn't completely full isn't what I signed up for.",20Apr2020,1

Sorry if this is super long, but it's been on my mind for a while.

For context, I moved in with my boyfriend of 2 years and my housing situation is complicated.

The house is occupied by 5 people total: My partner (22M) and I (22F), his brother (24M) and his parents. The house is divided into the main house (Main floor and attic) and the basement suite, the latter which is occupied by the parents. The house is in the name of my partner’s brother, so we pay rent to him.

This is where my issue is.

As soon as I moved in, I basically signed up to be a maid as well as a girlfriend. I do the vast majority of cooking and cleaning, and nobody has made an effort to change this despite me asking MANY TIMES that they help, and that I am not a maid. Dishes are the worst for me, as they will let them pile up to the point of toppling over if I leave them as a form of protest.

There have been times where I’ve been busy cooking, and the brother will come down from the attic (where he stays 90% of the time gaming since he is unemployed) and place his collection of dishes in the sink, and literally run out of the kitchen before I can tell him to please do them himself. My boyfriend is not as bad since he worked full time, but has been laid off due to the virus.

Additionally, my boyfriend and I will buy groceries separate from the brother, but we share a fridge. I will occasionally have to go on a quick shopping trip when I find ingredients missing.

It’s gotten to the point where I’m considering asking to pay less rent if I am the one always cleaning up. I pay $500 CAD a month, and right now have no income due to the virus and university finals. I have no funds to find my own place with my boyfriend, so right now I have to deal with my current situation as is.

And although I've thought about telling her I know that if I do it I'm just going to screw her more, I can't help thinking about her every day. honestly my heart can't cope with that feeling burning inside, but of course I can get myself with a goddess like her. anyone know what should I do?",20Apr2020,1

1063,"My husband and I were told about an embroidery business for sale back in November 2019. We weren’t looking to purchase a business at the time, but we felt like it might be a good fit. I am a stay at home mom who is going a little stir crazy but still doesn’t like the thought of going back to the corporate world. As we researched it further and got to know the owners (mom and pop shop just looking to retire), it truly seemed like the perfect fit. The price was right, the business was established and had a great reputation, and I would still be able to be there for my son without having to ask permission from a “boss.”

Fast forward to March - we signed the purchase agreement, found a great location to move the business to, and had the closing scheduled for April 1. And then Coronavirus hits. It’s a nonessential business so it is shut down. When it does get to open back up, I’m sure it will take a while to get back to normal because of the economy. We postponed the closing to whenever the government decides to open up nonessential businesses. 

So my question is - when that day does come, do we move forward with purchasing the business or back out while we still can? Since we won’t have the normal source of revenue for a while, we will have to run the business out of our home (so that’s two commercial machines, boxes of inventory, and everything else that the business has) because we won’t be able to afford renting anywhere. I’ve had my heart set on this opportunity and I really don’t want to give it up. I also don’t want to put myself and my family into a bad financial situation by having to sink more and more money into this. 

I know there’s no right answer to this; I guess I’m just looking to see if anyone has any additional perspectives that I haven’t thought about yet.",20Apr2020,1
1064,"long story short, my gf is really good looking, she excersices almost everyday, shes has a nice flat stomach yet when she looks in the mirror she almost cries because she thinks her body is ugly and she just doesn't wanna see what i see. im trying my hardest to convince her that she isn't fat or ugly or whatever but nothing seems to help. any advice or tips? does she maybe have a disorder of some sort?",20Apr2020,1
1065,"So my neighbour in our small building of 4 flats (2 downstairs, 2 up) has a passion for music. He's played it regularly since we all moved in to our new builds around 2 years ago. In the past month or two, it's been moving up in volume ... More and more, later and later. It sounds like he's got a new sound system and it's been driving me insane. Last Tuesday, after a long day of hearing the rolling stones screaming and thudding, it got to 1.30am so I text the girl downstairs to see if it's just me going mad. She's had to blutac things on her shelf down and wear headphones to cope. The man next to me is a police officer doing shift work so must be able to hear it during the day but not in unsociable hours.

I know he's self isolating so I left a note just asking him to cut it down. Following night, at 2am, I could still hear and feel it lightly thudding whilst in bed. I'm not sure if I was too hasty but I wrote an email to the council there and then as I was so angry, losing sleep and found myself always on edge that he's going to start playing again.

He must have seen my note the following day from the email as it did drop in volume but the bass was still far too much for a flat. Jump forward to this week, I think he's received the letter from the council. It's a tricky situation for us all with COVID-19 and I tried to be polite but it wasn't enough to take his volume down to livable levels. Now, he is a 69 year old retired man who's pleasant enough and lives alone, and I'm feeling somewhat guilty as I haven't heard a peep out of him today. He's annoyed me in the past with his smoking below my window but that's bearable, I just shut my window. And I've done him favours fetching fuel when he's run out in the past so we're not on bad terms. I know he absolutely loves his music so I obviously didn't want him to stop listening to what he loves but I couldn't work on Friday as I was at breaking point. Mental health is a big concern right now and even though I have no reason to suspect anything, I don't want to make things harder for anyone. Do you think I should follow up or leave things for now? The problem is solved after all. He was clearly not doing it maliciously but hearing a consistent thud from lunch time to the early hours of the morning was just too much.

Sorry it's long, been on my mind a lot recently!",20Apr2020,1
1066,"I’ve always been a very high strung person. However, over the last few years, i have noticed I let every single thing I can’t control affect me. 

I know everything is so fucking stupid which is why its so frustrating that I let myself get so angry. If I have to park far from my house, Im pissed. I wake up and hesr the birds chirping too loud- im already starting the day off miserably. If someone cuts me off, I IMMEDIATELY think of cutting over and doing the same thing to them- even though I KNOW how incredibly stupid and dangerous that is. &amp; then I spend the next 2 hours ranting about how fucking stupid people are.

I understand my rage is unfounded and pointless. But i just cant stop myself from letting things bother me to the extent they do. If anyone has any advice- i am all ears!!!!",20Apr2020,1
1067,"I wanna start this off by saying that I'm a mess, I don't know what happy is, I feel cold and alone.

I really appreciate you reading this and even more so if you reply with advice... let's get this convo started:

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up with mental health issues and always kept it a secret for the majority of my life thus far. Things were really bad but there was one main issue that I finally solved, although I still suffer from other issues.

I have a lack of confidence in my looks because I'm overweight and my teeth don't look to good (both because of the issue mentioned above) but I'm working on these.

I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago which really broke me, I was finally happy and it was all ruined.

I'm currently in college on an extended 4 year course, it's hard to make friends since a lot of the people in my particular course are older students and foreign students.

I have 3 friends that are really my only main friends but we all barely talk on a semi emotional level too often, I have a friend from high school that I rarely talk to but I'm able to talk to her on a semi emotional level.

I recently saw a video of a long distance couple who finally met and ever since then, I've gotten much worse. I feel bad because I don't have someone that cares for me on that level.

I feel like I missed out on a lot of my childhood because of mental health so I feel young at heart but I don't feel mature enough to fit in with older people. I feel stuck in the middle of adulthood and youth.

&amp;#x200B;

Apart from working on my lack of confidence (weight, teeth, etc), what else can I do to improve my life?",20Apr2020,1
1068,"Today my nursing teacher added discretionary points to canvas. Keep in mind these points were not on the syllabus. My class is out of 100 points and each points is a percent. She is awarding/subtracting up to 3.5 points. So if you have a 100, your grade could potentially be a 96.5. I am freaking out because I’m on the verge of not passing and she doesn’t really seem to like me too much. Is this something i can do?!",20Apr2020,1
1069,"Like a lot of people on the internet, ive seen my fair share of horrible things/gore on the internet, but this one video really hit different and it’s by far the most messed up thing I’ve ever seen. It was a video that one of my friends sent in a groupchat of a woman, who was almost completely naked, getting vacuum bagged until she was screaming in absolute agony, to the point where she was unconscious. The video lasted literally 6 minutes. She seemed prepared for it at the start, so i assume its some sort of autoerotic asphyxiation thing, but this woman was screaming for the guy to please stop and to be let out. I cant imagine the unimaginable pain that this woman went through regardless of whether she wanted it at the beginning or not. It’s all i can think about now, everytime i see my family around the house i cant shake the thought if it happening to them. Ive seen anything from beheadings to people being tortured, but nothing hit me as hard as this one. For the love of god no one look this video up i promise you will regret it, does anyone have any tips to stop thinking about it?",20Apr2020,1
1070,"When I was 10, some random dude emailed me asking for help with college homework. He said he was 20. I didn't think anything of him calling me ""babe"" or asking all sorts of info from me. He randomly dissapeared for a few years, came back saying he was in jail and was thinking about me the entire time. I blocked him. I think I was 13 when that happened.

When I was 20, he found me on FB. He had remembered or written down my name to find me. I talked to him casually out of fear for 15 mins and blocked him. This August, I moved across the country.

I remembered that he said he lived in this state, so I unblocked him to see where exactly he lived to make sure I'd never have to run into him. Yes, this was stupid and I know it. I unfortunately couldn't find his profile after blocking him because his name was too common. I freaked out and my friends told me not to worry - it had been 5 years, I'd be a narcissist to think he was still looking for me.

Two weeks later, he messaged me asking why I moved to this town and why I blocked him (my town was visible on my FB). I told him why I moved and made up a bullshit excuse for blocking him, then blocked him again. I shouldn't have even responded, but I did. He told me he was in a mental hospital for 3 years and was in a transition back into society. When I blocked him, I lost all of the proof of the conversations, which included the convo from 5 years ago where he admitted to finding me when I was 10 and never letting up. I'm too scared to unblock him now because of what happened last time, so unless I want him to reach out again. He lives an hour away and was in a hospital a half hour away. 

Today, I got a voicemail from someone claiming to be him. No one knows him, so no one could have given him my number and no one could be pretending to be him. Parents say no one called asking for my number either. He said his name and the time. I have no missed calls from that time - looks like it went straight to voicemail, so I can't block a number I'm unaware of. My cell phone number isn't on my FB and is nowhere to be found online, so I have no clue how he obtained it. All I can think of is that it's the same number as when I was 10. 

I'm scared that his next step is my address. Not only did I fuck up by not screenshotting the convos before blocking him, but I KNOW the police won't help me since I unlocked him and sent him that reply. It honestly didn't occur to me how serious this was til he called me. But now, he knows I'm local and he likley has the means to find me. 

My roommates don't speak English so we don't communicate - if I ask them to tell him that nobody lives here by my name, they won't understand. 

How can I protect myself when my only proof is a vague voicemail and now that I messed up enough for the cops not to help me?",20Apr2020,1
1071,"I want to start a comic series cos and i just want to try drawing full blown comics and not just short 4 panel ones. The series won't necessarily be published on some platform, since i haven't decided to do so yet (it might turn out ugly so I'll just never post it :3 )
My issue is that in the comic i have about 5 characters that look similar to characters in a videogame i like because a i drew inspiration from the videogame character to to my characters design.while the names, most of the colour palette, personality, outfit designs are different, they still look pretty similar to each other. if i do post it, will i get in trouble for drawing characters similarly to the ones from the videogame? Im not sure what to do. I thought that should either redesign the characters entirely or credit the original artist for the inspiration. Or is there something else that i should do? I'm a little lost here. Thank you for any advice you have to offer :D",20Apr2020,1
