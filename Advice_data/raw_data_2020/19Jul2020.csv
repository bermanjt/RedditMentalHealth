0,"My wife and I live in a home with ourselves, i our 5 year old son, and my mother who is in her 50’s in New Jersey. I just get graduated with my masters and my wife will have hers this coming Fall. Both of our fields are fast growing, especially in major metropolitan areas, but we’ve been discussing leaving the east coast and heading for California to 1.) maximize our career opportunities and 2.) move to a state we’ve visited many times and absolutely loved everything about. 

The problem is, all of our family and friends are here in New Jersey, and we not only will miss them, but don’t want to rob our son and future children of having that connection. We do have a few family members in CA but not many. Has anyone been the first in their family/friend group to move far away, especially with a child?",19Jul2020,1
1,"Writing this because I can't sleep because of the thought of my ex friends will haunt me and keep me awake at night. Any and all advice is appricated. I'm on Mobile, sorry for any formatting mistakes.

 I had to ghost my friends after they haven't been treating me nicely ever since senior year of high school.  They where often using me to be their vent buddy. I tend to be mostly hidden with my feelings due to being told by my friends that feeling the way I do is bad and will make everyone in the group angry. I often feel like I have to shut off certain parts of myself in order to make them feel good.  

But now I ghosted them for 4 months strong I'm constantly being reminded of them Via pictures on my parents Facebook. I discontinued social media for personal irl stuff. They keep appearing in my dreams and it haunts me. I can't gain the courage to talk to them again after the way disregard me and my feelings. I had stopped using most Social Media Services and blocked them all the remaining ones I use because I don't want to be reminded of them.

I feel really sad when I see other people's friendships that work out because that had always been the thing I struggled with all my life. As much as I would love to make new friends but the fear of being judged harshly. I lost so much of myself because of my ex friends.

I'm asking for advice where the people in question never see it. Is there any way to forget about them entirely. How do I find interests again that I enjoy without the peer pressure of my old friend group.",19Jul2020,2
2,"On mobile so blabla..

Preamble:
Im not american and english is not my first language, how ever ive had it validated it and its above an average college student, so my inability to understand or express myself is not the issue here.

My issue is not with the translating. My problem lies with the nature of the conversations ill be having. I've asked around and the consensus is around 50/50. (Too much stress vs Youll get used to it)

Im worried the tragic stories might affect me.
Is there anyone with similar experience or any advice worth giving? Im open to anything. Thank you.",19Jul2020,1
3,"So the story: I need help with someone adjusting a certificate and it's important for the job search because of the Corona situation. Anyways I talked to my manager's boss and asked her for support. She was talking in a friendly tone and she said we'll see what we can do and I explained in detail how critical it is for me. So she said she just got back from vacation and haven't checked yet but she'll see what she can do. I need advice about what they said, is it really what she meant or is it just code for ""not a chance"" or am I reading way too much in to this? Thanks a lot!",19Jul2020,1
4,"Hi,

I have a small penis (I'm aware of what the average actually is. I don't have a 7 inch penis that I think is small due to porn) I've never had a girlfriend because I've never felt confident enough to approach anyone nor has anyone ever shown me interest. I am worried about whether or not they'd be satisfied with a small penis, what their reaction would be or would I be able to compensate with fingers and oral? I  have other issues like psoriasis which, by themselves don't bother me, but I feel like with my small penis they make an already unattractive man even worse. Even if someone was willing to overlook it in the short term you hear of women leaving their husbands after years of marriage due to being unsatisfied with their husband's size.

I'd just someone that I could love and trust and hold. Sex isn't particularly a priority for me but it feels like it's what will hold me back.",19Jul2020,1
5,"A little background, I (28) moved in with my sister (36) last year to focus on my own thing for a bit and help her care for our grandparents (both going through Alzheimer's / can barely walk). I have 3 nephews, 10, 13, and 17. This is mostly about the 13yo (though I'm worried about the path the 10yo is on).

My sister is the type who always had the philosophy that if kids are acting up, you hit them, yell at them, and take their stuff away. I tried talking to her about it when I was younger, and got hit with a ""you'll understand when you have kids.""

Now that they're older, my middle nephew in particular has very bad anger issues. When he doesn't get his way, he lashes out, and breaks things. And as always, my sister reacts by pinning him down, shouting in his face, and taking his game consoles / computers away. Sometimes permanently. I try to intervene and de-escalate the situation, but it always ends with ""you didn't see what he did! i'm done with him!"" as if that's an excuse to act that way towards a 13-year-old.

Now, her boyfriend steps in too, and he's even worse than her, threatening him, cursing him out and saying ""try and come at me and see what happens I'll fuck you up"". My nephew (the 13-year-old) is especially bad, and constantly gets himself into trouble for doing things online he's not supposed to, scamming people, etc. I'm trying so hard to get him down the right path but it's like every day something new happens and he's getting thrown to the ground again.

I can't really approach her about this because if I get kicked out for speaking up for my nephew, I have nowhere to go, and no vehicle on the road to find a place to go. I don't have any money saved up. I brought up therapy to her for the 13yo specifically and her response is ""that won't work, nothing works on him"". I'm at wit's end here and I don't know what to do. Any suggestions on how to approach her about this and get through to her, how to help my nephew, literally anything would be appreciated.",19Jul2020,1

9,My mom is currently married to my stepdad and he isn’t physically abusive but is extremely mentally abusive.

16,"(F17) I feel like I’m useless and I bring nothing to the world. I don‘t have any talents, nor any passions. Nothing I‘ve ever done keeps me wanting more to do with it.

I‘m not good or talented at anything. There‘s nothing i have where i can genuinely say I‘m better at someone else at. At most I‘m average. Usually I‘m not even that. I‘m weaker, I‘m dumber, I’m less socially adept, I‘m less beautiful, and I have nothing. I‘ve lived almost 20 years and I have nothing to show for it. 

Maybe it‘s jealousy issues, and maybe i see other people and say „i wish i was like them,“ and I compare myself to them and make myself smaller. Maybe it‘s because I‘ve not been talking to many people and I have a tendency to isolate myself, so it gives me tunnel vision on my own issues. Or maybe it‘s because I constantly try new things and never end up loving any of them. But it feels like even when I take that out of the picture I don‘t have much.

The person I want to be feels unattainable. I feel stunted and lesser than everyone else around me. Everyone else seems so beautiful as people and they all have something they want out of life, but I don‘t even have anything I want to do with mine. A month or two ago I wanted to be a coder, but after being yelled at about it I‘ve stopped using the family computer. I barely had a start, and I don‘t know where any semblance of a career would go for me.

I feel like I have no career or life skills. Like if I tried moving out I would die alone. I can barely cook and barely clean, I don‘t have any communication skills or special talents or anything unique that sets me apart from others. 

Maybe today I‘m having a bad mood and that‘s why I‘m so pessimistic right now but all these things are a recurring thought to me. It‘s not like I‘m depressed, they’re just always here. I feel like I‘ve hit rock bottom before even starting. The only thing I‘m capable of doing is seeing the good in others, and that‘s what makes me feel so meek. 

I want to feel proud of myself even if it’s just in small steps. If I become a bigger or better person I feel like I‘ll finally become comfortable in my own skin. Even if I don‘t accomplish much I want to be happy for myself one day. I want to be able to self reflect on who I really am without being disappointed, instead of trying to envision myself as someone I‘m not. I want to improve my mental health and self image. How would I begin turning myself around?",19Jul2020,5

22,"Throwaway account... because.

I’m married, with 2 kids, and I have a job that unfortunately takes me away from home very often. Due to the nature of my career, I am gone 8-12 nights a month.

My frustration is with my spouse.  When I’m home, I’m doing the cooking, cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping, playing with/taking the kids places (as much as we can now), and when I’m at work, I’m AT work, not much down time, if at all.


Every time before I leave, I will prepare meals so that no cooking needs to be done, just thaw and reheat (meals that they ask for and actually eat when I’m home).  My spouse will pull out the whole thing, reheat a small portion and let the  let rest spoil...then feed our children cereal for dinner.  Going to the store is “not an option” according to them, but several times they have waited until the last day I was away to order groceries for delivery.

I will leave with every Landry hamper empty, and all clothes put away.  I arrive to laundry mountain every time.

We also have different expectations of proper behavior (laying down or putting your feet on the table while a meal is being served (as a 3rd grader) does not warrant any correction I guess)

Parenting is tough, but I’m feeling further apart from my spouse than I ever have.  I feel like I get no rest... while my spouse gets to rest any time that I’m home.  I don’t want to start another argument, but I am also not “ok” with how things are.  It feels very one sided, the kids like them better because they aren’t expected to “do” anything.  I’m not ok with my kids eating cereal for dinner, but I’m not sure what would happen if I just “stopped” for a bit.",19Jul2020,1

It’s just my mother, my two dogs and I...
My only friend was my mom growing up. She cooks for me, cleans the house more than me, networks for me, attends everything WITH me and too comfortable leaving the shower naked , I’m not a little kid anymore. My nickname is “babe” or “girly” I’m not your girlfriend. All my secrets and thoughts I tell her, minus what I feel about her. When I’ve attempted to have “freedom” I exploit myself to an online date (she approved I could date btw) who scammed me out of my college money two years ago, people trying to take advantage and cause problems. Then I would be scared, regretting that I tried to have some fun and socialize, run to my “mommy nest” and repeat the same fucking cycle over and over. Even my first boyfriend in high school she wanted to meet the same week. I lied to the hospital about feeling “harmful” just to stay for a week so I can get away from my mom. 

She even has a plan to go on a vacation just me and her in another state next year and even a plan for my 21st bday to go to the strip club with her! I don’t want to do anything with her at this point, I fake my emotions with her pretty much 90% of the time day and night. 

And yes I’ve attempted having a discussion bc she advocates for voice but then twist my words and makes everything my fault including the scam situation. 

I don’t even want friends or a boyfriend; just some fucking space and a voice to talk. I’ve watched this new show Euphoria with my mom OFCOURSE and she was so judgmental of the drug users and mentally ill characters (although she is a social worker) but doesn’t get my own bipolar disorder.

29,"For context, I adopted this dog 4 months ago and it has been incredibly difficult. She is highly anxious and acts like a puppy even though she is a 2 year old 70lb Shepherd. 

She whines all the time. Like, all the time. It’s this high-pitched, loud whine that sometimes escalates to this scream-bark that could shatter glass.

The first time I hit her, we were in the car and I couldn’t find my wallet. I was panicking looking for it (it had been a long day). She was screaming in the back seat to be let out of the car so we could go on our walk, and I snapped and reached back and smacked her muzzle shut. It obviously scared her and I felt so so so awful. 

The problem is, after that first time, I have been even quicker to irritate and have hit her twice more, both in whining/screaming situations. I know you’re not supposed to ever physically punish a dog as it can only make them more anxious and obviously deteriorates their trust in you. 

I feel like I’ve fucked up so badly and I don’t deserve this dog. I’m in therapy, perhaps I need to seek out someone who specializes in anger management. I had no idea I was this kind of person until my limits were tested and I snapped. 

I feel like I’ll never have a good relationship with this dog because of my actions. I feel I’ll never fully trust myself around the dog. 

What do I do? Obviously, I am going to actively work on being more aware of my emotional response so this stops ASAP, but I’m having this sudden urge to return the dog to the fosters and tell them it’s not a good fit. I’m ashamed. Looking at her makes me feel so guilty I could puke.",19Jul2020,4

A little bit of backstory first (so this all makes sense). I have this friend who I am very close with, we have been good friends for years.

 I really want to kiss her. However, the last thing I want to do is make her uncomfortable or cause issues between us. I feel like she would be ok with it, not weirded out or anything, but I’m not exactly sure. I’m not out to her or anyone yet.

37,"So my son has been using an app on his phone called Discord. It is chatting service where you can talk with others, get into voice calls, and make ""friends"". 

Today I found out my son has been talking to people on that app, in some really sexual ways. There are a few people in his friends list who have roleplayed extremely sexual situations, including rape and bestiality. He has been sharing porn images, including drawings of child porn, with these friends. From what I can tell, these friends first made contact through making advertisements on porn sites asking to roleplay certain situations.

I haven't talked to him about this yet, but I am unsure of what to do. From a legal perspective, I could face some serious trouble for not knowing my child has been doing this, and even more concerning, is the fact that others could get in legal trouble for talking with a minor that way. 

Edit: So about the child porn, there isn't much of it. I still felt it was necessary to point it out
My son is 16 by the way. I had already caught him watching porn at the age of 12, and we had the typical talk. I told him that under my roof, he cannot watch porn. Porn is disgusting in my opinion, it is pure disrespect towards women, and there are far better things to do with your time than to masturbate to an image of two people having sex with each other.",19Jul2020,2
38,"Hi, my name is Conor and I am 18 years old. I just recently graduated high school and I will be going to college in September. That isn't really important but I wanted to give some background. I thought that my life was amazing and that everything has been working out great. But over the past year or so I have started to believe that my life hasn't been all it's cracked up to be. I just want to make it clear before I start, I am NOT depressed, or anything worse than that, I am totally okay. Just looking for some advice.

I have always been a person who was socially awkward. It has prohibited me from making a lot of friends, and the only time I genuinely want to be friends with someone is if they fit my personal criteria for a friend. This is very stubborn and I hate that I think that way. Being socially awkward has affected my ability to have relationships and get girlfriends as well, more on that later.

I have also been someone who doesn't have a whole lot of confidence. I am tall, but I am also very skinny and I also have red hair. I know that that might not seem like something to be self-conscious about but there have been times where I feel that way. When I was in high school I was given a hard time for those things, and I feel like that was the start of my feelings that I have now. Being self-conscious about my figure has gone away in recent months, but there are times where I think they're right.

**So this is why I have not been happy with myself lately:** I just recently had to get rid of who I thought was my best friend. His name was Joel. Joel is a very stubborn, ignorant, and spoiled person. He thinks that he is better than everyone. Joel did nothing but think of me as a worthless nobody. He thinks he's perfect and I always look like the bad guy whenever things don't go his way.

I had a girlfriend named Abby, Abby was great, she was a loving and caring person. I genuinely thought she was the one for a long time. It felt really good to have someone in my life that cared about me other than the people that are ""forced"" to like my immediate family. I spent a long time trying to find a girlfriend let alone someone as amazing as she was. Then out of nowhere about 20 days ago, she told me she didn't love me anymore and we broke up, completely out of nowhere with no warning. I have been devastated, it took me about a week to finally feel well enough to go back out into the world but it has never left my mind and I am still pretty upset by it.

Everyone that I know in life other than one friend named Peter and my family have given me a hard time about who I am and the way I look at one point. I don't stand up for myself either. I am self-conscious myself and having to deal with that a lot doesn't help. I've tried talking to a therapist and I want it to help, but I am afraid to tell him how I truly feel, partly because I don't know how to explain it and that I am uncomfortable doing so. Even to a therapist.

A good way to put how I feel is that things just feel a little hopeless right now

Overall, I am very socially awkward, I am very indecisive with everything that I do, I just had a breakup, I just lost a friend, and my only good friend is leaving me for the next two years for college, I am self-conscious of myself and overall just not as happy as I think I can be. All of these things that I explained put together just make that feeling worse. I have always told myself, ""When one door closes, ten more open in its place"" but I am starting to doubt that. I have never been good at explaining how I feel, I am not doing a good job explaining how I truly feel which is very frustrating. If anything that I said needs more explaining I gladly will.

Do you guys have any advice on how to be happier knowing this situation?

Thank you for your time",19Jul2020,1

I am a university student who aims to become a Physician-Scientist (MD/PhD) in order to work towards creating cures for genetic diseases that I personally am susceptible to and suffer from.

I’m not sure if this is a selfish goal but my understanding is if I can work to help myself, others may benefit from this effort. 

I am in the US and with everything going on I do not feel as if science in general is appreciated or understood at the level which I want it to be. I am the child of two immigrants who were denied admission into University in their countries due to religious beliefs and financial status, respectively. 

My goal in this country is to gain an education so that I may work towards a future where I can help in the effort to create cures for diseases where, in my personal and academic experiences, only “treatments” are available. This health care system seems to value profit over life and I am deeply hurt by this realization. 

Through this rant I guess my question I’m asking for advice on is should I even try to make a difference when so many tell me that it’s not worth it? Or that I will never change the system?",19Jul2020,1

46,"So there’s a lot here, bear with me. 

My bf has a stepbrother who is 15. He has fetal alcohol syndrome, is nonverbal, and may also have autism or maybe even Down syndrome, I don’t know. He’s been acting out by messing with my bf’s dog and hurting her.

His dad doesn’t pay attention to him and treats him like a burden. The emotional abuse and neglect is making his behavior worse and I’m scared for this kid and what’s going to happen to him when he turns 18 or his dad dies. 

The most upsetting part is that the dad is practically rich and has more than enough money to pay for care or programs for his son to help him, but he just doesn’t care enough. 

I barely know the stepdad (he’s really weird, quiet, and usually drunk) so talking to him directly isn’t an option. I think calling social services is too extreme. What can I do to help this kid and family without overstepping and making the parents hate me? Are there any programs I can suggest to them? (For reference I live in northeast Louisiana)",19Jul2020,2

Just as the title says. I have my 12 year old sister living with me. Our mom died, so she lives with my husband and I. 
I have an app installed on her phone to catch certain content if she were to search or all about them to her friends. Just because I am concerned about online predators or her watching too much violence or sexual content on the internet when I’m not around to monitor her. 
Recently I got an alert and she was talking about my husband to her friend from school. She says she gets “math teacher pedo vibes” when he is around. She also said nothing ever happened, so she does not know why she feels that way. 

I’m not sure what to do about this or how to handle it. Do I gently ask her about it? Do I talk to my husband first? 

To be completely honest, I’ve had concerns about this before with him. I don’t know why, I’ve just gotten this vibe off of him sometimes when he’s around my sister. 
I don’t know if it’s just because he’s an incredibly affectionate person, and my sister and I grew up in a household where affection and emotions just weren’t seen much. Our family is not very open. So there’s one side of things. On the other side, I don’t want to not take this seriously and have something happen. 

I’m very confused and I feel like there’s a ball of fire in my chest about all this. I don’t know where to begin

Can anyone help me make sense of any of this?",19Jul2020,2
51,"A while ago, my family took in a stray female cat. But due to Covid, we couldn't take her in to get fixed, so she had a bunch of kittens. We agreed that we would keep the original 4 kittens the mother had in her first litter.

However, in the second litter of kittens one cat was becoming the family favorite, but we already agreed that we were only keeping 4. 

So when my favorite cat from the 4 we agreed to keep went missing, I was the only one looking for him. When I told my family that we should search for him, here's what my mother said: ""Oh, I guess we can keep one of the other cats then."" But by that point, we had been finding the others homes, and the only one that was left was the favorite.

She didn't help me look for him, and my father just told me to give up looking for him because he probably found a new home, even though he was one of the ones we were going to keep. Neither of them even attempted to look for him, despite them usually doing so when a pet went missing.

Now we have the favorite, I can't find my cat, and I can't try to convince them to find him because that would mean they couldn't have the favorite because they only agreed on keeping 4 cats.",19Jul2020,2
52,"I live in the country and have 7 dogs of my own. 2 are from my old Belgians malinois first litter that didn't sale and we don't have a no kill shelter around so we kept them, one is a lab mix someone abandoned with her brothers and sisters at a church that didn't find a home so we kept her. 

1 is a small all pomeranian that my sisters boyfriend got her and she left her at home with us when she moved out because she's old and doesn't get along well with new dogs (her boyfriend has a huge German shepherd/lab mix), and our last two are Australian shepherds that we bought together from a friend. All my dogs are easy to feed and take care of. They stay super healthy. 

Now here is the part about my friends dog. His house caught fire and he had to move until it was fixed so he couldn't leave his dog alone. She is a large Saint bernard about 2 or 3 yrs old. Im a good friend so I told him I'd keep her until everything was fixed at home and she could go back. That was our deal. I didn't want to see such a sweet dog be taken from her family so I offered to help. 

It has been a year and a half since we made the agreement.  He has bought her food 2 times and has had his house fixed for a while now but won't take her back. She is extremely hard to keep fed because she eats way more than my dogs which makes us run out of food fast. I've had a German Rottweiler before and kept him super fat till some jerk poisoned him and he had to be put down.

 For some reason I can't keep my friends dog fat like she should be even though she gets 2 butter bowls full of food (which she eats on for 2 days). I have asked him over and over when he would take her back because im struggling to keep her fat and i don't want her to get skinny at my home when all the others are super healthy looking and I give her so much food. It makes me feel like im doing something terribly wrong and it hurts me to see her lose weight but every time I bring it up he completely ignores my messages. He will never talk when I bring up his dog. 

What do I do? I really can't afford this dog anymore... I've done the best I can as a friend but if he won't take her back I feel like I'm stuck with her because I can't bring myself to give away someone else's dog. Its not like she was given to me. We agreed she would go back home. How do I get him to take her back???",19Jul2020,1

55,"Hi all, this might be a long post to explain everything from the beginning.
To begin. My mom and I are both VERY different. We’re not super close, and we don’t see eye to eye most of the time. A lot of what I say or conversations we have it just goes in through one ear and out another. All she says to all of my siblings every time we talk to her is that she wishes she was our best friend. We’ll be talking about something completely random then she’ll get all serious and say she wishes she’s our best friend. I’ll try to have conversations with her and it goes no where. I love her don’t get me wrong. She’s my mom and I love her for everything she does. But it’s very hard to talk to her when all she says in every conversation is she wishes she was my best friend or she’ll say you know if you lived closer I could see you more or that she wishes my brother would call more or that my sister wouldn’t have an attitude etc etc.
Anyways, tonight she called me in tears saying that she feels nobody loves her. My dad and her aren’t having the greatest relationship right now and there’s not much support and they’re building a house so it’s just very stressful for the both of them. My two sisters that still live at home are always working. And she says my youngest sister has an attitude (my sister is very mature and I can’t see it, we talk all the time. My mom is very invasive in personal privacy and space which can annoy my sister bc she wants to know everything including everything her and I talk about. But my mom gets very emotional that she can’t be joined at the hip with her or any of us ). The whole conversation I was trying to reassure her that we do love her and just bc we can’t be there every weekend bc of the commute and bc I’m married and my brother is also married and love a fair bit away and my two sisters are busy with work doesn’t mean we don’t love her, we’re just growing up.  But she doesn’t seem to understand any of this.. at all. She was very emotional and in tears and just kept repeating herself that she’s lonely and doesn’t feel loved.
My husband was listening to the whole conversation and after we talked about it we think counselling would really help her to understand what’s going on with everything and how to emotionally handle situations and maybe to even learn how to communicate a bit better. I suggested it and she’s very against it saying she’ll be fine and to know she loves me. She’s very stubborn and can’t see why or how it would be good. I feel like I talk circles around her.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. What do I say? How can I get her to consider counselling? How can she not see that it would help her?",19Jul2020,1
56,"Hi I'm a teenager and I have a friend I only met the previous year. We've gotten really close since we both have similar personality and outlooks on life. Our biggest connection above all else is prob our humor, gaming interests and future careers. We both want to become software engineers or something in the programming industry and he's prob the one of my few role models I have bc growing up my parents were fairly distant.




I originally met him in a few of my classes and honestly thought he was pretty funny despite the fact he was fairly anti social. After a while we became pretty good friends for the year but his mental health was not the best due to his parents and school. The coming year he turned himself around and began really attempting to better himself and with this he began getting really good grades. Now I have always had really good grades throughout my life due to work ethic but this guys was out of this world. Because his parents didn't provide him much he had to work for his own money via gaming, maintain very high grades and with all that also being a programming prodigy. I had always been telling myself I'd program but never got to it due to fear. But after he told me he'd been programming since he got his hand on a laptop I was amazed. He'd already learned a majority of C++, c# and a lot of other aspects of C. Not only that but he had his own income and would provide himself with resources such as online classes from Universities to further himself in learning  more programming languages. This was partly due to his parents only providing him with the basic food, shelter, occasional birthday present etc, nothing else big or resourceful making him very independent. In my eyes he was the one person I wanted to become because of his hardworking mindset, ability to rely on himself for his wants such as a PC or equipment, he was funny and a genuine person. He was the one who kick started my programming career into python by motivating me to become on par with his skill






Now to the main topic is recently both me and my friend have been pulling 6-9 hour session of programming. Of course he'd been doing this for ages every summer break but this was a first for me. Luckily it was relitivly easy due to my generally high work ethic. Although we were pulling similar hours we were at different levels and stufied dif programming languages with dif courses. I always had my schedule and he had his but recently we've gotten back into gaming and general really fun activities but due to our freetime being vastly apart we didn't do it often. Hes a night owl while I'm more of a morning person so our schedules differ greatly. One day I decided to stay up a bit longer with him an lay some video games. To compensate for the lack of sleep I would've gotten I slept in a bit later and after a few days this became a routine. I had adapted to my friends schedule and although it was new I was able to reorganize my exersise, meals programming session, free time etc. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing, on one hand I get to do all the things I did and have fun with my friend, but in the other hand this schedule isn't very similar to our school schedule in the coming months and I'm afraid I won't adapt quick enough.",19Jul2020,1

58,"I’m sorry for the lengthy post, I truly need advice or help as I feel stuck. All input and advice is very much appreciated. 

I don’t really know where to start with this but here we go: Im (23M) and besides normal conversations with the homies and other friends I keep all personal details about my life  to myself. Just my choice type of thing I guess. Anyway around the beginning of 2019 I was really hurting financially from lending out money to a “friend” and lost a job. To this day that “friend” has me blocked and screwed me out of a couple thousand dollars. FF about 7 months I had found a solid paying job with full time
Hours and started paying off debt. Things started to look up! My roommates (still my current roommates) came up with an Idea to move from the Midwest area to Washington. We all came up with budgeting plans and ideas to see if it was going to be viable. We all
Had around 5K saved up jobs going into Washington and things seemed to be finding their way. We ended up moving in March of 2020 as our lease had ended at our previous residency. (At this time WA was the epicenter of the covid virus) as we arrived in WA I receive a phone call regarding the job offer being withdrawn as the facility was going to shut down til further notice. (Obv couldn’t be angry as it’s expected during the pandemic) fast forward another 4 months and although I have applied to literally hundreds of jobs it’s still hard to find employment. Without being with work for over 4 months and no income while still needing food, furniture, etc that money that was saved for moving quickly began to diminish. A big issue currently is that when I moved to WA I have been unable to change my address, get a new license,  and sense technically I’m not a resident on the state of WA I’m unable to get unemployment here. And when I applied for unemployment in my previous state they said delays are inevitable since so many people are filing currently. (I have been waiting 2 1/2 months for ANYTHING from them). During this time I have almost maxed out two credit cards and have completely depleted my savings. I’m on my last few weeks and am incredibly scared as I truly don’t even have money to eat let alone pay rent. I’ve tried to apply for personal loans since my credit is pretty’s decent but can’t be accepted because of my unemployment. I’ve never been the person to ask for help for anything and asking another person for money seems so degrading I cannot get myself to do so. 

I know this is scattered everywhere and if anyone has/needs clarification or has questions feel free to ask!",19Jul2020,2
59,"( I apologize in advance for all of the reading lmao) 

I’ve been in a relationship with a girl for multiple years and I’m deeply in love with her and she feels the same about me (At least I’m fairly sure she does). We even have discussions about marriage and starting our life together and how excited we are for it. But, in the beginning of our relationship things got kind of wacky when I found out that she cheated on me with one of my friends (won’t go into detail about it because it’s not that important to the main story but, they both claimed that it was a one time thing and that it only involved making out). Eventually I forgave her for it because I didn’t want us to end over something small and what I considered to be insignificant compared to the relationship we had. After that things got way better and I’d never been happier in my entire life. 

Ever since then our relationship had been perfect until a little over a year ago when I was scrolling through her messages (which I feel terrible about doing in the first place) and found messages from a few months prior where she was flirting with a guy she met online. There weren’t that many messages but it still hurt nonetheless considering what we had already been through and how healthy I thought the relationship had been. So in response I told her I needed some space for a little bit (I now regret ever saying this and realize that I was just overreacting). 

She was really hurt by me saying this and I could immediately tell how much of an emotional toll it took on her (she’s a verrry clingy person so it makes sense why she took it so harshly). After about a week I realized that I was over reacting and we eventually talked everything out. But the days following I saw her getting messages from one of her male coworkers, and this time instead of snooping I just asked her about it directly and she told me that he was just a friend who had been talking to her about his relationship problems. Immediately this was a red flag to me so for the next week I continued to question her about it and she eventually told me that they had deep conversations with each other about their relationship problems and she even said at one point she was “ready to risk it all” with him.

She said that he invited her out a couple of times but claims she declined because she “knew something would happen” (a.k.a it would turn into more than just hanging out). 

It’s been over a year since then and I feel like she hasn’t told the whole truth even though she swears that she has. Based on how badly she reacted to me asking for a little space and how hard it can be for her to tell me the full truth about certain things it makes me feel like she’s been keeping some significant details from me out fear of how I might react. So I guess my question(s) would be do you guys think she’s telling the entire truth? Am I just overthinking it? (Even if something else did happen I would be willing to work it out with her and she knows that but, I do understand why she would keep it from me). Would there be any way that I could make her feel comfortable enough to tell me? I really love this girl and I’m just tired of it sitting on my conscience. I hope this all makes sense and any advice would be helpful!!

Just to add some extra context we are both young (college age) and in our best moments we make each other extremely happy. 
And in my personal opinion to build a strong and lasting relationship it’s important to realize that no human is perfect and being able to communicate and work through problems is way better than just throwing away years of memories and special moments.",19Jul2020,1

74,"Last year I (25F) was experiencing a very stressful situation (work related) which triggered anxiety on me, so I decided to start therapy. There's this organization in my city where an assistant asks you what is it that you need help with, so they find a therapist for you. Back then I didn't know there were different kinds of schools of thought or whatever they're called. So I started my therapy, and got so much better in a really short time, until my therapist (early 30ish F) said I had recovered so I didn't need to take therapy anymore. 

So, lockdown happened and for the first month I was okish but I realized I had a lot of stuff going on with my family and had a problem with my relationship where it got to a point that I couldn't control my emotions and I didn't know how to deal with it, so I called my therapist and told her I needed to start therapy again. We started with videocalls and although I feel she has helped me a little with some stuff, I feel like ever since then I feel more stressed and anxious than I did before, because she makes me question things I hadn't even thought about and so I worry a lot about those things that hadn't even crossed my mind before. I also feel like she questions my relationship a lot, and at the beginning I listened to her because what she said sounded very similar to what a friend had told me about not wanting to put a tag on my relationship, but I realized I was ok with that and I've only started thinking it was the right thing to formalize it because my therapist mentioned it, but I feel like this has a lot to do with her personal judgement.

So now, I don't really want to go to therapy anymore because I feel bad about everything I do, and I maybe I wasn't ok before starting again, but I feel so much worse now, and I think I should look for a different therapist in a different place, but I don't even know where to start or who to ask. I decided this week will be my last session with my current therapist but I also don't really know what should I tell her, because I don't want her to suggest me a different therapist in the same institution, I'd feel bad if I ever bump into her.

&amp;#x200B;

75,"Throwaway because quite frankly, idk just how much I want this on my main account.

Today, I had one of my internet accounts hacked. Shortly after I got an email stating said account was hacked, I started getting emails from, presumably, the hacker. As of current, I have 7 in total, all of which being the exact same thing: no subject, and the body just says my old password. This has gone on for hours after I've changed it. 

I've already gone ahead and gone through several extra security measure additions and I've been watching to ensure no fraudulent charges have been made (hopefully my bank should acknowledge I'm not in Brazil).

77,"Mature sexual content!

I don’t even know where to start... 
I’m a 16 year old girl who has always had a close connection with her grandparents on my moms side. However they’re getting older and when I was 11 or so my grandmother went downhill while my grandfather is still the same as he was in his 40s. That’s when it started happening. My grandfather has never touched my privates but when I hit puberty started “tickling” me. He’d move his fingers dangerously close to my boobs and touch me under my armpits. A few moths in he started “spanking” me supposedly thinking it was a sign of affection. I talked to my mother about it and she said it was how he showed affection and that it was not meant to be sexual. I made it crystal clear I was extremely uncomfortable and she talked to him about it. It kept happening. A year later she talked to him about it again very firmly. Of course it kept happening. When I was 14 he slipped his hand under my bra strap and massaged my shoulders...  He then again received a very angered convo from my mother. The final straw was last summer when I was 15 he started strangling me as a joke and my half dead grandmother told him to stop. My mother talked to him AGAIN and it finally stopped.


I’m glad it finally stopped. I’ll still always resent him and be confused though. However now there’s a new problem. My cousins. They’re both girls aged 8 and 9. The nine year old is a feisty perceptive little thing who doesn’t take any crap. I only saw my grandfather touch her once. He was rubbing her back and asked her if she had a “tickle spot”. She froze like I always did and said no. However the 8 year old girl (who isn’t very bright but I love her) is totally being taken advantage of if that’s what you’d call it. He does the same things to her that he did to me. I once saw his hand casually resting on her crotch though. 

I guess I came to reddit because I don’t know what to do. This is my most personal thing and I simply don’t want my little cousins to be waking up in a sweat at 3 am thinking about it like I do. I still don’t know where this all legally stands. My mother thinks he’s just oblivious but I have my doubts. So I’m here anonymously at Reddit. If anyone has any legal experience, or “elder psychology” experience it would be very much appreciated. Thank you.",19Jul2020,3

84,"I'm a cashier at a grocery store right now. It was just supposed to be a temporary, part-time thing while I made the money I needed to join the regulatory body for my field and looked for an internship to get my career started. Needless to say, COVID-19 has changed everything. I used to work an average of 15-17 hours a week (I still live with my parents so it's all I needed) but now I'm getting a lot of 8-hour shifts and I'm finding the toll it takes on me to be too much. 

We don't get to sit except on our breaks so I'm standing for most of my shifts. My legs, back and feet have been killing me. I'm also having issues regulating my hunger, which is a huge issue as I've been getting headaches and dizziness when I get too hungry for the past several months. On top of that, my mental health is really suffering. We've had cases of COVID in our workplace (one of them led to me self-isolating for two weeks and, thank goodness, I didn't get it) and I've been uncomfortable in public ever since. All of our lanes are open again now and, even with the plexiglass, seeing all the people up at the front at the same time and having people constantly behind me is scary. I feel anxious just looking at *pictures* of crowds, let alone being in one. I can't walk past people without clenching my hands and rushing past. The other day, someone asked if someone got something at our store and I immediately assumed for a moment that someone else got COVID. It was horrifying. Fortunately, that wasn't the case but I was so scared it might have been. I probably wouldn't die from it myself (it's possible but a really low chance) but I have a family to worry about.

This week, I have almost 40-hours and I'm not sure how I'm going to get through it. I'm tired, burned out, anxious and I feel so stupid for feeling this way because I know other people are in worse situations. I'm going to have to work 40-hour weeks all the time for the rest of my life and, while they will hopefully be at a desk where I won't have to worry about pain and hunger, I know I need to get used to it.

86,"Im to scared to get a job (F16) because of my below average intelligence

I guess I have to start from the beginning to give you some background to what’s happening now.  When I was younger I struggled with learning I never got my time tables and fractions and never grasped math like the other kids.  This went on with English as well.  I was a slow reader and took awhile for me to learn how to spell. My Spelling is worse then a 5th grader and auto correct is absolutely my best friend. So as you can see this was the root of my deep rooted insecurities and low self esteem issues. It doesn’t help that I had zero friends and was bullied because of this-

so my mom thought it was a great idea to homeschool me and in the 3rd grade she unrolled me from public school. ( Biggest mistake ever) I don’t want to say she was a terrible teacher but let’s just say she wasn’t the best either. She was just as bad at math then I was and she couldn’t explain concepts to me either.  She was an amazing writer though.  She tried  her best to teach me English although I was afraid that I was going to fail based on past experiences. 

Now I’m 16 and wanted to give public school a try, terrible experience by the way. But I did manage to get good grades. Through this experience I realized I had Dyslexia and maybe dyscalculia, because I can learn math it just takes A LOT OF TIME maybe even months to learn a simple concept.  It’s so weird because when people look at me they think I’m very intelligent and well spoken. I feel I’m very logical, but when it comes to academics I’m dumb as a box of rocks.  I cry everyday about this. I don’t want to leave the house either and I’m so ashamed that I’m so stupid.  And don’t get me wrong i try to get better, but it’s hard motivating myself to get better when I don’t have a teacher to teach me the basics. Yes I could just teach myself, but how could I if I don’t understand the material or where to even start.  Now fast forward to right now. 

I’m trying to get a job but I’m terrified of getting one because im dumb as fuck.  Literally the only jobs available are being a cashier in my area. Everyone is telling me to get one because I need the experience for the future. I’m scared shitless and worry that I won’t be able to do the job correctly. I’m afraid my I.Q. is below average and i’m scared that I’m going to live with my parents till I’m 50. I don’t know what to do.

95,"So when I’m around my gf I love it and when I’m away I often think of her. I never pass up opportunities to see her. I look for two things - 1. personality that matches mine (as well as common interests and beliefs) and 2. Being treated well and how treated I like to be treated. 

She does the second really well. She treats me well, much better than my ex’s did during those relationships. I was at a wedding today and wasn’t sure if my gf is someone I’d wanna move in with. But sometimes I question that our personalities match and won’t cause problems down the road. I don’t wanna kick the can down the road. We have very different interests and beliefs political and religious. 

Just an example - I wanna live in the country with lots of land isolated. She doesn’t like that. Just lots of things like that that seem to stack up. 

Another thing is sometimes I miss the single life. Sometimes I see someone of interest and consider pursuing it but I know I can’t. A part of me misses going on little first dates and looking. 

TL;DR: my gf is great. And treats me very well but when I think of the ideal girl for me to marry and live with, it doesn’t match her. Sometimes I think about the possibility of breaking up, but other times I think that thought is absolutely ridiculous.

“OP: Me
EV: My cousin
MP: My best friend
MA: My Aunt

So me and MP had been friends since kindergarten, and me and EV are just like brother and sister. But MP have always been there for me, I couldn’t imagine life without her, she knows everything about me and I know everything. On the other hand EV have been part of my bullying and is incredibly mean to me. On my birthday a few weeks ago, MP and EV were there. I was with my boyfriend that I hadnt seen because of the quarantine, and since MP is like family, she just talked to my family. Eventually she just disappeared, so I texted her

OP: Are you okay?
MP: Yeah I just feel sick, I threw up when I got home
OP: okay, feel better

I didnt think much of it and left it at that. The next day my mom calls me downstairs and tells me and my family that EV had sexually assulted MP when no one was watching, so she left. I rushed over there, we biked down to our hang out spot, so she explained. In my head she means so much more to me then EV. He got confronted and got in trouble, but my family wants to forget about it and MP didnt wanna press charges. Yesterday was the first time I saw him since, and I’m extremely pissed. But MA told me to forget about it, and he’s my family. She told me I was an asshole for choosing friend over family. AITA for choosing friend over family, and not seeing my blood as family.

Edit: I need to clarify, me, MP, and EV are all going to 9th grade. EV and I are 14 and MP is 13 (she came into school early)

Clarification: I showed this post to MP and she said to clarify the trouble it was he got yelled at and lived at my uncle’s for a month”

111,"Hi to all readers.

I am a elder teenager who lives in a family that has unusual family problems. I do not talk about my family and I am very embarrassed when it brings up.

Let me keep this post short and tell you what is really going on. My mom studied to be a nurse back in our former country, she didn't work but she studied at a College and that was her passion she loved. When we moved here into this country, she couldn't even find work and nobody was accepting her. My dad tried to bounce back my mom and try to get her back into her passion, but it still did not work out. Overtime, my mom developed these severely odd symptoms that look similar to a mental illness.

These symptoms are:

* Unclear thinking (Not being able to think properly)
* Laziness (This is similar to depression, no energy to do anything, e.g \[Not taking care of us (my bigger brother and I, Unable to do simple tasks each day like brushing her teeth\]
* Some kind of mood switch (I see her get somewhat angry in some days but somewhat ""excited"" in other days)

I do not know how the hell she developed these symptoms, it could be due to no purpose in life, she thinks that nobody loves her, etc. My mom still loves me and my brother despite her condition and I can tell that from heart.

There could be way more to point out, but I mainly generalized them.

My dad overtime (around 10-12 yrs) got very frustrated of what my mom developed these symptoms for. He got so angry that he kind of discluded her from public events to avoid embarrassment, in return, my mom got even more heavy symptoms. I do not know who to blame, but I should of known to act but I was a young kid at that time. **I do not want to go in depth about my dad. My dad has now kind of ""realized"" and ""took thought"" of what happening really.**

**This actually affected my brother**. He developed severe depression and another kind of mental illness that's unknown to us. He actually got similar symptoms to what my mom has now. It's just my mom that is the tough one. He blamed it all on my dad and went to aggressive violence, don't worry, we put my brother into a hospital and he's doing much better now, even my dad and my brother are doing very good. I'm not sure if my mom's symptoms reflected my brother or my dad's frustration affected my brother.

I think I am the only one in the family to recognize this. I wrote this after I went sobbing to my room after I took the time and thought about it. My mom is suffering. My dad and my brother don't seem to really notice and just deal with it day-to-day life. I still owe my thanks for my mom being the best mom in the world as well as my dad. Sometimes things can't always be perfect, but you can definitely solve them. My dad and my mom are definitely good people, it's just that the past still haunts them as well as my brother and I.

The thing that I'm most scared about. Is that the symptoms can spread to me and my dad, if that happens, my family is now anarchy.

I could of had a better childhood if my mom and my dad were more supportive to each other and us, but I have to agree that the past is over and the future is way better. We were good financially, my dad got a really good job, my mom was a smart and caring person, my dad was very supportive of my passion (entrepreneurship). We even had great family friends and my brother and I had great school friends as well. Everything was set in place for a great family.

I would like to request advice on how to get my real mom back. It looks like she's so blinded. I try to sometimes introduce her to what I'm doing currently  Family becomes first always.

Who should I blame? I can't blame anybody. This was caused by all four of us. It slid under our radar for the past 12 years.

I would love to ask for advice on how to get my mom back on the road again. She's being sliding down for the past decade. One thing I may try is to get her involved in a passion (e.x say she loves cooking, I should cook with her) but I do not know how to know her passion. I could try asking her, but with her symptoms involved it's kind of hard to decipher what she really trying to say. Please leave advice for anything related to help solve our problem especially bringing back our real mother.

My dad, brother and I are looking forward to bring back our real mom. Sometimes we might get frustrated, but my dad &amp; brother knows it's not the solution. Sometimes my dad almost gives up, but I remember him to keep pushing. 

TLDR: My mom looks to have some mental illness and is dragging our family down. She had a chance to become a very successful person but she was denied by the country. If we got her off the ground somehow, by motivating her to do something in her passion (which I do not currently know), she can greatly improve herself and the beings around her and get back on the road again. She didn't reach the age yet where it's too late, therefore I would love to improve her life greatly. How can I engage her to get back on the road and remove some of these mental symptoms stated above?

112,"Hi reddit, I am a teenager, to be precise a sixteen year old girl.

My problem? I don't get along with other teenagers, or to be exact, I don't *like* them but behave.

All of my online and irl friends are 23 and over, my best friend is an engaged woman whom is 26, she's having me help her when she goes house hunting after covid.

I haven't exactly gotten on or along with anyone under 23 since I was fourteen and had a few true friends who were seniors. 

I don't understand a lot of teen humor and see them as children, I will need to work on this for when I attend public school, I'm sure in the community college I will be attending there will be mature teenagers and some that won't be.

I recently friended a sixteen year old girl on xbox and have been observing her interactions with the other teens in her group as a reference, but it seems so childish and otherworldly to me, they are under the guise that I am a 20 year old, and not one has questioned or second guessed about it, so me not participating as often in their conversations has been excused. Their humor as they would put it in my perspective is whack, I feel so inexperienced and immature for not being able to keep up with trends and or having the boy craze mindset, as if I'm behind in these areas.

But how do I change this? Teens seem so immature and indecisive, and extremely self centered, the way they talk so highly about their capabilities baffles me, I envy the ability to pretend to have that much confidence, for I am in reality amd just someone so socially awkward and inexperienced that I got used to following around adults and adapting to how they behave.

113,"Recently, since I've been wearing a face mask at work (I bus tables), I've been talking to myself quietly. Today I had a discussion with myself about who I've become in the past month, but let me start from the beginning.

Sometime last month, I was watching anime and started thinking about how the guys and girls in anime look pretty similar. This lead to me deciding I was probably bi because if given the option to, I'd probably have sex with some guys in anime (for reference, I'm a guy). This lead to the question of whether that was limited to anime or am I actually bi, I thought about it the next day and decided I was.

That night I was up late and started thinking about whether I was a guy or not (I was half asleep so this felt like a normal question). My whole life I had secretly been into ""cute"" things and in private, would act rather girly. This caused me to wake up the next day and ignore the thoughts because I had always held no belief in the concept of transgenders (I was ill informed about transgenders and linked gender and sex too closely, I now firmly believe in the legitimacy of transgenders).

Another day or two of talking to myself at work and I decided that if had the choice, I would be a female.

With all that we've covered the fact that I'm now bi and interested in the concept of becoming transgender, now today I was on discord and saw a meme circulating about femboys. This prompted today's day at work to be filled with thoughts of buying some skimpy clothing, dressing as a femboy and relaxing, as it sounds very comfortable to do all that.

Now I'm at home and making this post because theres no one I know that I can really tell this to, my parents are an absolute no, I would never tell them this.

I was recently diagnosed with lupus.

I was prescribed hydroxychloroquine.

Yep. The drug that's always in the news because Trump has stated it can help prevent COVID-19.

I've felt awful for three years, and finally having some kind of answer and something that might help... was supposed to be a relief.

Instead, I'm *terrified* to take this medicine because all I ever see on the news is that it's going to kill me.

I have a major, major anxiety disorder. And for weeks now, when I turn on the TV, there have been talking heads saying that hydroxychloroquine will give me a heart attack. They keep highlighting cases where people died while taking the drug. They keep saying over and over how dangerous it is.

I know they're just trying to counteract Trump's statements by giving an inflated impression of how dangerous the drug is. Rationally, I know I'm just witnessing political discourse.

But every time I try to take a pill, those clips play in my head like an endless reel and I have a panic attack. It's like the whole world is literally telling me not to do this.

I want to feel better. I want to get some quality of life back. Supposedly, this drug might do that. But I don't know how to get past this.

133,"We are of Hispanic descent and both of my parents speak Spanish fluently. Not as fast as some but pretty well. I never learned since I wasn't interested since I was a kid.

 I don't recall them ever trying but then again I don't have a good long term memory so I'm sure they tried. I never really care for the language or ever found myself needing it so besides two years of learning about it in school.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to help my parent out since they want to retire young and often speak about stepping up. I already do a rather small but important part of their business but want to learn more. They have some health issues so the thought of them being able to relax more often and them transitioning from work to retirement being easier sounds great.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked if any work needed to be done and people to take calls are needed right now. We have some people out due to the virus. I think I will be able to handle English speakers well. Calls are either simply making payments or can branch out into stuff requiring me to call other companies and whatnot.

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't think I could learn enough Spanish to do everything required. I could maybe learn enough to take payments but I just don't see me being able to deal with complex issues.

&amp;#x200B;

My parent says they don't want me transferring people away due to not speaking Spanish too much or avoiding calls that could be from Spanish speakers.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at a few ways to learn a new language but lack any real drive. I've never been interested in learning a new language. I get some people love to learn new languages but I'm not one of those people.

135,"Hi everyone. I'll try my best to keep this succinct.

TL;DR at the bottom.

**Premise**
I'm 21 and I'm just finishing up my second year of Engineering. I am dead-set on getting a Master's degree as it's my dream career path. That means one more year for my Bachelor's and two more for my Master's, assuming full-time study.

Although I have worked already and sometimes tutor other students, I live with my parents (that's normal here in Europe) so that I can study better instead of having to focus on work too.
Our financial situation isn't great.

**The Problem**
My father is rapidly becoming a terrible presence. He emotionally abuses us by purposefully making us angry, insulting us after getting in a fight with us for the most stupid things you can imagine, berating us. He is an old, sick but extremely arrogant and bitter man. He disrespects us, shouts at us, demands obedience from us and is driving us all into depression. My little brother has turned into a shadow of his true potential, my mum is an amazing woman and works so hard for us and is in emotional pain every day.
I do my best to keep everyone strong but I'm just about done. I can't help anyone if my mental health starts taking a beating and boy has it been taking a beating since I was a child.
My house hasn't felt a home, safe or warm for as long as I can remember and I am starting to emotionally crumble in here. I even spent a few weeks terrified of the walls and memories of this forsaken place and crying in a corner near my bed.

I'm seriously considering saving myself and getting a part time job alongside my studies, moving out and somehow juggling a job, university and an extremely important romantic relationship. I don't want to leave mum and my brother here but I also physically just can't take it anymore. 

Do I attempt to go through three more years of this or get out but risk prolonging my education for one or two years, while working on the side?

TL;DR: three more years with emotionally abusive dad in a house that is destroying my mental health and get my degree in three more years or make it on my own but risk prolonging my studies a couple years? I really don't like the idea of leaving my mum and brother with him...",19Jul2020,1

Hi, so I’ve come to a slight dilemma. Mostly because I have a history of being slightly anti social especially with girls. So if a girl hits on me I’ll generally say something dumb or it’ll just fly over my head and I don’t really want to mess up any future chances specifically the one I’m having an issue reading at the current moment. I frequent a drive up coffee place often and their style of workers are very friendly asking you about your day and all that but recently there’s been a new barista their who I feel has probably been hitting on me. 

She started off by saying that I looked attractive with or without my glasses which caught me slightly off guard and I said something about feeling like glasses change your facial structure blah blah blah... so yah I just replied with something dumb then the day after that she ran up to my car to take my order and started off with “hey handsome” but this time I was more or less ready and replied that she was looking rather cute today to which she thanked me and at the end she just said that I brightened up her day or brighten up her days.

A couple days later I believe she said that I had a really nice smile. So yah those are all the instances that I believe she’s flirted or hit on me and I can muster up the courage to ask for her snap or number but I’m mostly afraid of me being wrong, just overthinking things, feeling awkward to go back if I read things wrong, and not wanting to weird her out . So I guess I just really need advice on wether again, I’m reading it wrong, she’s just being friendly, and their just compliments.

everyone is telling me i should report him for what he has done but he told me i shouldn’t cus a judge said that they would never let him out if he got into trouble again, he would lose his family that he has finally got back after being in foster system for so long. he brought that stuff up multiple times. i cannot bring myself to report him cus i fear i’ll feel bad, i know i will feel bad. i’m so lost and just don’t know what to do.

he told one girl he wasn’t “aware” of what he was doing but i remember being underneath him and telling him i’m not in the mood anymore and that it hurts bad and he still kept pushing it inside of me. i cried under him and by my body language and my own words he was “aware” of what was happening. he made me question myself thinking i possibly deserved it. 

he was telling me how i didn’t deny it or say anything but i remember specifically one of the times i was getting pissed and telling him no i don’t want it anymore, i’m not horny anymore and etc but he kept being persistent and i yelled “just fuckinng rape me then” and then after that he kept sliding it in me and i froze and didn’t know what to do. he tells me often “i was just giving you what you wanted” but how is it something i wanted when i told him i’m not horny anymore and that it’s painful? i couldn’t use the bathroom for a whole week (it was anal) cus it hurt so bad. 

how can you get over and enjoy your life when you raped someone you “loved”? i don’t understand. i want him to feel the amount of pain i’m in, the amount of hurt. why do i have to hurt so bad while he gets to laugh and have sex? i cant even have sex cus i’m terrified. i’m terrified of men. all of it in general. i don’t understand, what should i do? report him? can i report him where he serves little to no time but is put on a list?",19Jul2020,1

Part of me felt kinda hurt. And to top it of when I asked her to explain what she meant, she said that I forget it and that’s why I would failed multiple times.

We continue to talking about it more. It got to the point I found out that she said that all my younger siblings, 

So I’m 20 female, I have a younger sister 19, a brother 18, another brother 17, and a sister 14.

She said all of them could pass it but I would failed so many times.

I wanted to know why she would think this, but she kept saying it’s because I’m 20 I’m more likely to forget things I did in school like exams. 

But I’m older an my sister by one year, so I asked her is my other sister (who is 19) going to forget when she’s 20? She said no.

Then she continued to say it was because of experience that they have that I didn’t, I’m older than my, me and my 19 year old sister did the same work experience back in school, had the same job, only I left after a year.

She wasn’t making senses, experiences have nothing to do with passing a SATS test, either does forgetting. 

I could pass anything if I tried. I came here in London when I was little, I had to start from year 4 with no knowledge of English language, and I still passed my SATS and went into passing my GCSE’s.

Even after I told her about passing GCSEs, she still said I couldn’t do it.

She then said it was because my sister (the 19 year old) has more experiences, but after I told her all about my experiences, she admitted I had more experiences and then said that’s why I’m likely to forget. But she when thought my sister had more experiences she never said she would forget too, only said that when she found out I had more experiences.


I also asked since she said my age means I will forget more, I asked when my sister (the 19 year old) will forget when she turns 20, and she said no.

159,"Sooo, I broke up with my boyfriend after a two year relationship that was a roller coaster ride. He started out amazing and then slowly changed over time for the worst... After years of gaslighting, and constant fights where he’d ignore me for days on end I found the strength to leave him. Haven’t heard from him since. It’s been a month. 

What I’m grappling with here is his best friend. I’ve always felt an attraction to him. I had a dream about him the other night too and then I just couldn’t stop thinking about what it would be like to be with him. I feel like I’ve noticed him trying to hide having a crush on me for a while now. So, I guess what I’m asking is, if we are both down for it- (which I’m not even sure he is, but I know for sure I’d love to fuck him at least once) would it be terrible if we did? I feel like I owe nothing to my ex... I know he was stalking a bunch of girls on Facebook the second we broke up. So I mean I guess it comes down to how strong their relationship is... I would never push the issue. But if I find that he’s down for it.... should I give into my desires?",19Jul2020,1

Things have happened that were way too weird to be coincidences but most of the stuff that she was talking about was just strange and never happened. I don't know what to do because she won't listen to a word I say and any time someone tells her that it's maybe all in her head she becomes convinced that they are a part of it and are trying to hurt her children too, even though I know for a fact that the people that tell her would take a bullet for them no questions asked.

I love my sister, would do anything for her and her children, but I just don't know how to help. I don't have schizophrenia so I don't know what it's like to walk in her shoes. I want to help her so badly because watching her pull herself apart with worry is starting to freak me out. 

Any advice? She won't see anybody for it and she refuses to get medicine. I just want her to feel like she doesn't have to look over her shoulder every second of every day. And I know it's a part of having schizophrenia and some of it I can't help her with but I still want to try.",19Jul2020,1

So after all the foreplay and all,i wrapped a condom and i tried to penetrate her,and (damn,this embarrassing as hell lol) once i got inside of her,i notice the smell from her vagina ,it was pretty bad,and i got myself out disgusted and told her i couldn’t do it. I must have stayed inside of her probably 15 seconds or so. The thing is that the condom was bloody and today i was looking for some info on this matter and it seems like bad smell in the vagina is not normal per se,as when it is “fishy” (i don’t know what the hell that means ) she could have bacterial vaginosis ,wich is a type of infection. Now ,the smell she had  i don’t know if to call it “fishy”,”metallic” or “dead smell” it just smelled really bad (maybe putrid slightly) and i had to get my penis out of there. I used a condom and i was inside of her just 15 seconds ,am i at risk for something?

172,"For starters I am M18 and she is F16. I knew her from preschool, and then we lost touch, tell a couple years ago. She ended up getting my snapchat, where she started to message me all the time, asking questions and seeking help for her depression. I have had depression, even attempted suicide once, and understand how hard it is to get out of it, so I try to help her as much as I can, and to the best of my abilities.

However, she always brings up the fact that she likes me and wants to date me. I personally have no interest in dating, or anything around the matter, and that is my usual response to people. I wouldn't even date someone younger than 17 in all honesty. It doesn't work with her however. She will go off on one of her depression episodes where it ends up with me calling her, most of the time having to cancel plans with other people, to comfort her and try to help her get into a better mood. It scares me to think that she would go and hurt herself or end her life because I declined her offer to start dating. I have thought about deleting all my social media and changing my number just to get away from here, but she is going to the same trade school as me next year, so I won't be able to dodge her there.

This happened just an hour ago with one of her episodes, and I am completely lost on what to do. She said to just give her one chance, but I really don't want to date her. I am scared if I outright say no, she will hurt herself. If I say yes, and we break up she will hurt herself. If I say yes and stay in the relationship just to keep her happy, I won't be happy anymore.

Edit- I figured I would add some more stuff in. She lives with her mother, and dad is out of the picture. She is actually in a relationship currently, but her girlfriend is going to be moving in a couple months and they agreed to break it off then. I have thought about trying to get her professional help, but from a financial side for me, and from what I can gather from her mother, its not possible. ",19Jul2020,2

Today I checked the schedule and when I saw my coworkers name the schedule said 8am - 3pm for Wednesday 7/22. Monday 7/20 said 7am-3pm for my coworker.

180,"Hello,

I have a friend named London who has been homeless for 3 months in Chicago. At 18 he's been alone on the street after his grandfather passed away from pancreatic cancer. I bought him some new clothes, a tent, as well as shared my hospitality with him (providing him with hygiene products and a shower). He has no birth certificate, and no identification. He doesn't have parents. He was adopted at the age of two, and his adoptive mother was abusive to him, physically and emotionally before the scars on his body were discovered by CPS at 15. He has really hit a rough patch in his life, and I wanted to know if you know of any resources that can help him get back on his feet (in particular, work).

For example, maybe you have a friend or family member that works in construction, or another field that he can seek employment in. He has been getting the run-around by government agencies like the DMV for getting his identification, which are now closed due to Caronavirus.

He's been assaulted at a shelter, been solicited for sex by pedophiles, and had his stuff stolen, so that isn't really an option for him. 

I've decided to let him sleep at my place after providing him with hospitality for a short while two days ago until he can get on his feet. For now, I am hitting up several construction companies looking for entry level positions. He wants to work! I'm hoping he can find employment in the area soon, and then find his own place. Does anybody know who is hiring in the Chicago area, or how I can best get him hired by a company for entry level work? I figured he needs a phone and an email, so I'll get him those. I'd be willing to pay his transportation until he can pay it himself! 

Picture of us below! I blurred his face for privacy reasons. Sorry my webcam is crap, and my phone camera doesn't work!

I (23f) roll off the bed, every single night I have slept on a bed that's not in the corner of the room. I've always had my bed in the corner to avoid rolling off but it seems that the ""normal"" way is for it to be in the middle of the wall. I have really bad nightmares due to PTSD. Which causes me to toss, turn, roll, flail pretty much whatever a child does when they sleep I do. My fiance expressed he wants the bed in the middle of the wall so I don't have do step over him anymore when I need to get up.

I want him to be more comfortable and able to sleep better at night but I never fail to roll off the bed.

186,"Ok, here we go. 

I am a 16 yo guy who considers himself liberal. I support BLM, Biden (I hate that I had to say that, wish we had Bernie but oh well), etc. However, I’m growing up in a conservative household. Trump supporting, pro-police, super Christian is the norm. We clash a lot, but never have we clashed more than this year.

First, it was the BLM movement. We had an argument where he said BLM was a hate group that targeted white people. I, obviously, was quick to disprove him as this isn’t the case. It escalated to the point where we were arguing outside. I was going to pull up the BLM mission statement that disproved his accusations. He then told me that I “Trust that damn iPhone more than my own dad”. He stormed inside and that was then end of it.

Then it was the Virus. I went to pick tmy parents up after a party they went to (they don’t wear masks or social distance) and I was wearing a mask in the car. 
*Granted, this wasn’t gonna help any. If I was going home with them I’d be forced to interact with them, this only prolonging my exposure*
My dad asked why I had it on. I responded saying that I was just being safe (again, I was being stupid) and he went quiet. At this point he’s drunk. No way around it. After a while, he says I believe the media more than my own parents. I stay quiet as to not start anything. 

Now, here’s where it gets crazy. He then says I need to quit my job if I believed the “bullshit” media. I need to buy my own drinks and pay for my own gas. This wouldn’t be an issue, apart from the fact that I START SCHOOL IN 3 WEEKS WHICH LIMITS MEANS I’LL HAVE TO LEAVE MY CURRENT JOB! He’sbasically saying “Hey, son, since we don’t agree on facts, I’m going to make your life difficult.” And what he said next was what really pissed me off.

He said he’s forcing me to go to in-person school, even though this makes me super uncomfortable and makes me feel unsafe. My mom and I have discussed doing homeschooling for the first semester and see what the situation is like. But apparently my dad believes the lies of Trump and the right-wing so much that he’ll put his sons on the line just to prove it. I’m dumbfounded. 

The entire ride I barely spoke. I’m angered, sad, and disappointed. I’m more scared than anything. I want to be safe and stay home, but my dad doesn’t give a shot about how I feel. Anytime we disagree he blames me for being “Brainwashed by the media”

I didn’t really feel taken advantage of but looking back at it I was totally taken advantage of. I saw him once or twice more lost contact. then when I was 17 and in college he ran up to me and asked if I remembered him and we chatted for a bit. I saw him for the rest of the semester usually stopping to chat. After that when I was about 18 he wanted to hang out but would ask for head every time I saw him, usually at the end of us hanging out. I eventually just told him to stop texting me because I felt weird talking to him and felt like we weren’t even friends he just wanted me to do this that I did back when I was 15.

193,"I wanna start off by saying. I love him so much. Whether he’s 250-lb, or he’s 150-lb or anywhere up down or in between. I could pretty much care less about what he looks like. Whats important to me is that he’s happy and healthy. 
That being said my husband has always strived to be very health conscious. Before we started dating he was healthy weight, looking and eating. But as for everyone, once you get in a relationship eating habits can start to falter in the health spectrum, and we eat more. Thats understandable to a point. I’ve even gained a bit of weight since we first started dating, but I realized this. Put goals in place and lost it all and some. He’s gained about 70-lb. 
He’s always expressed a deep interest in maintaining health and wellness through diet and physical activity. (I know he isnt just saying this because of me and my loss, because he’s the one who first encouraged ME to work out more, and lose weight..) But lately I found he basically has two versions of himself. The version who cares deeply about it, and the person who has 3 bowls of ice cream a day, a bag of chips a day, and 4 meals per day. May be a bit of an exaggeration but— not too far off at all. I try to sometimes politely remind him about his goals, and that whether he realizes it or not he’s hurting himself in the long run. If he’s in a binge eating mood he simply tells me he does NOT care at all and continues. And of course later regrets it and feels bad for himself. 
I am very worried because I believe he’s falling into dangerous territory of having an actual binge eating disorder thats been slowly building into itself for a few years now. I try to encourage him to visit a dietician and even cook healthy meals, and try to diet with him actively to make him feel less alone and maybe stick to a healthier lifestyle better but he consistently falls into a hole where he doesnt care. Maybe I’m overthinking it, if that’s the case let me know but I feel like I have genuine concern because I hate to see my partner feel so badly about how he looks, and I want him to be happy and confident. I also deeply fear that this could intensify into something much much worse IE Bulimia. Any response with your thoughts are appreciated..",19Jul2020,2
194,"Hi there 😊

Background: This year has taken a really big toll on my mental health. With my friend group+closest childhood friends dropping me out of nowhere, having to quarantine with my toxic manipulative dad, dealing with my mother who’s never there for me, and not seeing my only two remaining friends for months, I’m not the best mentally. Especially with isolation and being out of school. So I’ve been a little- I mean very- insecure about a lot of things. And a little paranoid since I had no idea what my previous friends thought of me until it was too late.

Now: Both of my remaining two friends live together and work together at the same place. They also have other friends and one has a boyfriend. I really do under they’re busy and they still love me. Heck, we plan on moving in together when we graduate. But I’ve been having doubts and even with their reassurance, I can’t shake it. So I’ve come to reddit with hopes of 1. Seeing if I’m right to be paranoid and 2. How to deal with this constant insecurity. 

I keep thinking about how I’ve been trying to hang out with them but we haven’t been able to meet because they’re busy. But I know they hang out with their other friends and have days off to go places, I just wonder why they can’t bring me along. I mean my dad is a lot and very strict so I could see how that could affect their premade plans. But I’m just not sure why they could go to the mall or beach and not just invite me along. 

Today I asked them to let me know if they’re free anytime on a weekend and they said they can’t hang out because they’re going to the beach. I asked if I could go and what the beach is and they just said they don’t know what beach it is, not answering whether I can go or not. Idk... it’s just hard and I just feel so worthless at times and like no one truly enjoys my company. But at the same time, one of them and me were suppose to hang out a few days ago (canceled because my dad got toxic and mad.) So they’re obviously willing to hang out. I just don’t know how to deal with this horrible feeling that I’m unwanted. And no reassurance from them can cure it. Please help. 

Am I right to be paranoid? How should I handle these feelings?

196,"Here's how I got fired. This might be long. Tl;dr at the bottom

Ok so I worked at a grocery store chain in Canada for almost 5 months. When everyone  first gett hired the hiring manager created a folder which has notes about there interview/resume etc. 30 days in there department manager sits down with them and dose an evaluation then another one 60 days in but no more. Basically they tell them what there doing wrong/what they can be doing better.

Time skip 4 months in and I feel like my performance can be better in certain areas and was wanting to reflect on the evaluations my manager have done with me. So on my break I went to the room that kept the folders, pulled mine out and looked at it. 2 minutes in a employee sees me and asks if I should be looking at my folder. I tell her I see no reason why I can't. She walks off while I finish my break. Around 20 days later I show up for my shift and get fired for looking at my folder.

Edit: I feel like this might be important. This was not the managers office but a room that housed a couple company PC's used for ordering stuff/checking your paysubs. Had these folders been kept in the managers office I would've not looked at mine as everything in the managers office felt confidential to me.

197,"Hello all! I (F19) need some advice here. I’ve never been good with friendship. Like seriously. I had so much trouble with it as a child I saw a social therapist to learn how to make friends. Anyway, I’ve moved around quite a bit. Went to 8 schools from K-12. The only real friend I have left is from my second to last high school. I love him dearly but he lives two hours away and has become distant since getting in a relationship last year. I moved to a new state after graduating high school and have been here a year so far. I’ve made one friend. And that was less then a month ago. I have what I call “school friends”, aka people who only contact me for school related reasons. I’ve been so extremely lonely and I don’t know what to do to make friends now that I’m an adult (ya know, somewhat an adult). Especially now that we’re going to be off campus until at least spring. FYI, I’m at a community college. I work two jobs as well. I’ve tried Tinder, and did make one friend. But I think he’s been avoiding me because we had sex (had discussed being friends with benefits). We’re going on a day trip to Philly next weekend, but it’s been almost two weeks since we’ve hung out and he keeps avoiding it. I asked him if he wanted to go on an adventure tomorrow and he said he wasn’t feeling social, which I do understand, but things have just been weird since we hooked up. I want more friends, but I truly have no idea how to make any. Especially because of corona.",19Jul2020,2

199,"im f16! and my first job is walmart.
lately ive been really stressed and tired out from working and i cant tell if its normal because all of my coworkers around my age sound n look happy.
first off we have managers who let us go on breaks, im now usually put on late afternoon shifts/till closing (8:30pm). right before we close we get flooded, which is fine, but im always stuck working overtime and they know when i have to leave too, but they still send customers and give me tasks to do. even when i tell them i have to go.
not only that but sometimes they dont give me my last break, or superrrr late for my lunch (so late that the register kicks me off) like i worked 6.5 hrs today and i was never able to get my last break. my legs killed me.
not getting my last break is now becoming normal and they wont listen.
the personnel here totally changed my availability just because it summer. weekends i used to work mornings/early afternoon (in april/may) and now i work all afternoon. i turned in a new availability sheet but thats supposed to start in 3 weeks... my school starts in less than 3 weeks.
im really stressed out and almost hate working there. my coworkers are so awesome but i feel like the managers dont care. 
im so stressed to the point when sometimes i cry after i get off

is this normal??? or am i worried for nothing??",19Jul2020,2
200,"There is a girl I have met for a long time, but never actually talked to her until recently, I started talking to her in a small birthday party of a friend. Turns out we had a great time, we discovered that we both love anime, I met her a second time and everything was great again, we talked a lot both times. I really got interested in her and I actually got her number.

We started texting but I noticed that, while texting she sounded/seemed like a completly different person, she gave small answers to everything, and it felt as if she wanted the conversations to be over soon,  let's just say she felt really cold and she never really texted me,  I was always the one that had to start (or try) a conversation.  


With all that I started to think that maybe  I was the only one who felt we had a great time, but then she invited me to go to an anime convention, I tought she had invited more people, but no, it was just the two of us, and again she was very talkative, funny and nice in general.  


After that the COVID got intense so meeting her in person was a no, so I've been texting her a little, but she stills feels really cold. And now she suddenly invited me to a little pary she is having.  


It's like, I get my hopes up hight, then she lowers them through texts, then up again, then low ...

I have discovered that this individual is now on another executive board that gives him more power but would also require someone with ethics.
I am sure this organization does not know about the background of this individual.

My question is should I wait until the legalities are concluded before exposing him or should I anonymously send an email to the organization outing him.

I am pretty sure they will figure out that I did it. I am the one who is so appalled by the whole situation. Everyone else is in the ""clique"" and are enjoying the benefits immensely.

While I may be viewed as a shit disturber I have never experienced the dark side of the corporate world as I have with this situation. It would literally be allowing this organization to continue with their corporate mischief unchecked.

I just so happen to have the card that could check them. I am certain my already ruined reputation will be now be absolutely nuked. I don't have much more to lose other than having some serious enemies.

I feel a moral responsibility. Should I leave it to karma? Or should I fuck shit up? Leaving it to karma sounds so good to be honest but what about others I could have helped?

207,"I (24F) have a friend (31M). Said friend is one of my closest friends and someone I trust completely and really value in my life. We have known each other for around \~5 years and go through stages of being really close, and them him ""ghosting"" (if you can use that term for friendships) me for weeks/months at a time.

Additionally, he has been going through a tough time, mentally. I try my best to be there to support him and listen to him. During the pandemic, we've been playing an online game (MMPORG) together, which brings me to today's topic... something that really festers in my gut and makes me question whether this relationship is healthy, which is hard to come to terms with because it's someone I care about so much.

So, we scheduled to play a minigame together within this MMPORG one night. I am quite familiar with the minigame and really enjoy it, so I wanted to explain the rules to him and introduce him to it. It was the first time after a month+ that we'd gotten together in the game, because we'd had a bit of a tiff before and he'd been ignoring me.

So, we turned up to the minigame. I was supposed to play my role of rule-explainer but suddenly experienced a bout of anxiety. The rules are somewhat complicated and I couldn't manage to explain them in the little text chatbox. I wanted to text the rules. He didn't have his phone on him. He started reading the rules online. I felt useless, panicked and like I shouldn't be there. We went into the game, he didn't know what to do, announced ""I'm out"" and hasn't talked to me properly since.

I take full responsibility for myself. I should have communicated better. I really wish it didn't happen, but it did and here we are. This is todays text conversation after finally getting a response. (Note: I've apologised profusely and explained my situation. Also, called multiple times, which I shouldn't do because it's a bit obsessive but I felt it was necessary to get how I feel across and to validate how he also felt).

***Me:*** *Hello. I'm a bit confused about what's going on here. Can you let me in on your thought processes?*

***Friend:*** *I have no thought processes about any of this. You're the one writing and calling a million times. I've got nothing to say.*

***Me:*** *OK. I know. I won't anymore. Just trying to apologise and communicate and learn from it.*

***Friend:*** *If you need me to pander your emotions about how you were purposefully a bitch and were annoying and rude to ""learn from it"", then you prob better look elsewhere, cuz I ain't gonna do it*  
*\* explains rules of game very briefly\* It didn't need any more than that. And I don't see why anything needs to be talked about via text or phone call or anything*

***Me:*** *No it's not about my emotions. It's about me doing wrong and trying to make sure you're not hurt or thinking that I did it purposefully or hatefully. I didn't. But I do know I should have done differently.*  
*I think it needs to be talked about because otherwise it just festers. And then it has a flow on effect to other events*

***Friend:*** *Well then that's your own journey, not mine. I don't want to or need to talk about it anymore. I don't play a game to be annoyed when all it would have taken you was ten seconds of your life to explain something to me. ie. your own character flaw and not something I align with.*

I feel pretty awful about it. I just want to talk about it and fix it. I come from a place of care, not hatefulness. It's hard for me to talk about with other friends because I don't want to paint him in a negative light, so I'm turning to here... just for some advice and somewhere to vent to.

213,"We've had our Yorkie, Zoe, for almost two years. We got her when she was about two months old. She was small, shy, and absolutely adorable.

Potty training this dog has been an absolute *nightmare*. We've had her for almost two years, and she still pees in the house, and occasionally will leave craps around the house. Keep in mind: This dog is only just now getting used to me. For the past two years, she absolutely despised me. It didn't matter what I did or how long I waited, Zoe would never do anything when I took her outside.

Now, for these past two years, Zoe has been having a lot of diarrhea. Why you may be wondering? Well, my mom feeds Zoe a lot of people food, (not healthy people food, mind you), and Zoe doesn't register dog food to be food meant for her. The most common foods include: pepperoni, processed cheeses, potato chips, and sometimes will let her lick the food off of her dishes when my mom finishes eating. It is also worth mentioning that we have two cats, and my mom will feed them in the same exact place as Zoe despite how many times we've pressured her into moving.

My older brother and I have told my mom time and time again that this could have severe health consequences, and that this could be fatal. My mom will promise to change, doesn't give her anything for two days, and then the cycle will repeat. We had to replace the carpet in our *entire* dining room because the odor of pee and crap was unbearable.

I've tried getting her to a schedule, my brother bought a food that she *actually* likes, but doesn't eat it because she's offered people food.  I've told my mom that this could be fatal, but my mom will say that Zoe's ""starving"" and that she just wants to do what's best for her.

So, Reddit, I'm kind of stuck here, so some advice would be *very* appreciated. Thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE:** Zoe has always been a very finicky eater. She eats best when she's eating with another animal. She takes really well to hand feeding, and if you want her to eat her food, you'll have to hold her dish up to her mouth. Getting another dog isn't an option right now, as both of my parents are very apprehensive about it. Basically, if another dog goes to the bathroom outside, Zoe will want to. If another dog is eating, she'll eat.",19Jul2020,3

IT. WAS. HORRIBLE.

He kept food on one side of the bed away from plain view. There were roaches and dirty clothes that were emitting a smell within the closet. Food under the bed. A bathroom that has never been cleaned. Even a patch of carpet that is now glued to the floorboards because he sat on the floor while gaming.Roach droppings under the sink kind of situation. We cleaned it all. Top to bottom. Except for the patch of carpet it was stained black (after shampooing carpet) so we just covered it with a rug. It smelled nice after we finished.

Then he decided to come back. Started the same bullshit again. I thought that after seeing what his room could be and smell like he would at least try to keep it that way. NOPE. It smells rotten in there with a hint of essential oils to try to mask the musty smell. I know there is food in there because of the gnats around his room. He also doesn't wash his clothes often so he's either re-wearing them or letting them pile up until he has nothing left.

It feels like a slap in the face because I wanted him to come back to sleep in a clean environment when he decided to come back. Instead his actions are like a big ole ""fuck you"". He didn't even try. I know my parents know it's going on but they refuse to do anything about it.

224,"Hey folks! I posted in r/amitheasshole on this subject today, and while I got some good feedback, I was also immediately crossposted to r/amitheangel. I want to let everyone know upfront that I hate having to ask for advice on this, and that I genuinely FEEL like the asshole on this, regardless of what other people might say. 

 I could really use some advice on whether or not to have a talk with a loved one who happens to be extremely morbidly obese, about safety. 

 Let me explain...

 This person spends a lot of time with me, and vice versa. They don’t have a nice home, and I do. For reasons I will attempt to get into below, my place is the only place we can spend much time together. 

 I won’t get too far into the specifics, suffice it to say that this person lost their home due to medical debt and time off work for medical reasons a few years ago to foreclosure, through no fault of their own, and has been living in a cheap studio style apartment in the meantime, so when we get together (mainly before quarantine, of course, and when we see each other now, we observe social distancing protocol), it’s at my place. 

 I’m not a wealthy person, and I have a disability which causes me intractable pain. This is where the issue I need advice with comes in. 

 We both have painful health issues, and need somewhere comfortable and safe to sit when spending time together. 

 Unfortunately, because this person is extremely morbidly obese, and because we mainly spend time together at my place (she can’t attend sporting events or concerts, or even some movies, sit at too many restaurant tables, or go too many places comfortably), I’ve been running into an issue with my furniture not holding up well under her weight. 

 This isn’t something that happened after one visit or two visits, but after days, sometimes weeks or months of her using the same pieces of furniture, some of it has broken. 

 She accidentally detached my toilet seat (more than once) from the back of my toilet, and after repeated use, the guest toilet began to lose it’s seal against the bathroom floor. I know she didn’t/doesn’t do any of this on purpose, and I am in no way trying to judge her for her size—I agree that things should be made sturdier. My issue is that I can’t afford to keep fixing things and buying new furniture items. I live alone, and I don’t have a spouse or partner, or family to add income to my household, so when something goes wrong, it’s on me to fix. I love living alone, and normally that’s just fine with me. I put money aside, and I try to be smart with my finances, but lately I keep needing to replace furniture that I just can’t afford to replace—furniture that isn’t used too much, aside from when she uses it. I thought I had sturdy items, but perhaps I don’t. 

 She has broken my la-z-boy rocking recliner—again, inadvertently (it’s $600 to replace, and I wish I didn’t have to consider money in this situation, because she is worth more than any furniture could ever be). It now hangs permanently forward off of it’s frame and doesn’t rock.

 After sitting on the same spot on my couch, one of the seats has fallen completely through to the bottom of the frame. I’ve fixed it up a few times and sort of popped the spring back up, so that it’s at least salvageable, but that hasn’t been an effective permanent solution, either for her, or for the furniture. This is on a reinforced couch, with a steel frame. She permanently warped one of my bar stools. I had bought it partially because I was confident that it could hold up to 250lbs, and while I don’t know how much she weighs and would never ask her that, because I love her and it’s not my business, I genuinely can’t afford to pay hundreds of dollars for new bar stools every few months. My medical bills are expensive, and when I’m in a great deal of pain, I would like to be able to count on the furniture I’ve saved up and bought for my own comfort, without it being broken or warped beyond usability, but, most importantly, I’m worried about her safety. 

 To that point...

 We were talking in master bedroom recently, and she went to take a seat on my bed, and my entire frame went flying off of it’s risers, and skidding across the room, while she landed on her tailbone on the floor. I felt terrible for her, and when I ran over to help, I realized I couldn’t lift her. Of course, I also ended up not having a bed frame for quite a long time because of thar, and sleeping on a mattress on the floor, because I couldn’t afford to keep replacing furniture. Obviously I realize that in an ideal world, I would be able to say fuck it, I’ll live without furniture, as long as I can have you in my life, or better yet, no problem! I’ll just replace each piece with a piece of higher quality, so that you’re comfortable! But I just can’t financially afford to do so. 

 I bought a couch recently, which cost me $2,000. Part of my reasoning in selecting this particular couch was that it has a steel frame. This was a real investment for me, and not something I can afford to do regularly, and while the frame of this one is holding up beautifully, and the seat she normally sits in is only slightly dented from her using it, I can see that it won’t hold up forever. 

 I bought her a steel reinforced bench and a steel reinforced folding chair over the past year or two too, but apparently the bench is too uncomfortable for her to get up and down from, and the chair still isn’t wide enough for her. 

 I feel terrible—for her, and for me. I don’t want to be a jerk or to hurt or offend her. 

 How do I handle this situation? 

 Please be kind. I’m genuinely asking for help here, and posting this in good faith. I want a resolution that works for both of us, because she’s someone I deeply love and care for, who has really been there for me in ways I can never repay. If I were a wealthy person, I would keep replacing the furniture—hands down, but I’m not. I’m a middle class person with a disability who unfortunately can’t afford to continually replace furniture. 

 Any suggestions would be extremely helpful. Thanks in advance!",19Jul2020,2

229,"Hello I recently got a seasonal job at a local cannery facility. My roommate is now mad at me because I am quiting my current job, even though it has stable hours/schedule, I would be earning as much in a week from my cannery job vs a semi monthly period. He is telling me I should rescind my current 2 week notice and just quit the cannery, even though my current job has no room for advancement, the supervisor is prone to forgetting things, and lack of communication between the few employees I have seen. They also regularly run out of PPE gloves in my size, so I either have to makeshift one using trash bags or do with out, and have zero documentation on any cleaning chemicals they use.",19Jul2020,1
230,"This one is kind of long so I apologize in advance for this. I will make a TLDR at the bottom. I’m also new to reddit so I may not format this the best. I’m underage, and I have a boyfriend who I have started to get sexual with. His parents had him at a young age and so they aren’t very strict on him about having a sexual life and let us do whatever we want. So, naturally we tried and succeeded, but it ended quickly because I’m a sissy when it comes to pain and I said no. I’m not ready for this. Naturally he discussed with his parents that he technically lost his virginity because why wouldn’t he? The problem starts to come in here. His parents want me to get on birth control because they’re worried about any accidents, just like my boyfriend haha. The thing is though, I have really bad anxiety and I don’t know how to approach asking my father. For reasons I won’t list he is my primary caretaker and he has openly stated he doesn’t want me being sexual with my boyfriend. The only reason I’m so scared now is because I tried to get birth control before all of this by asking my grandma, to which she overreacted and asked if I was having sex, (I hadn’t at this point) and me, not liking confrontation and getting anxious, backed down. This has been really long and I apologize again but I would like some advice on how to approach it. I know hiding my sexual activity isn’t a good thing but I’m not ready to tell him and I know he’ll overreact about it all. Any advice would be appreciated. 

TL;DR - I got sexually active with my boyfriend, his parents want me on birth control so nothing happens, my dad is uptight and I don’t know how to approach asking for birth control.",19Jul2020,1

Soo I just moved about 2 months before all this craziness and went to school for about 1 1/2 months. It was good but I didn’t really make that many good friends. I am hoping I will but if not I will ask for more advice if I need it. Anyway the 2nd week I came here I was walking back from lunch when a girl fell on me and we both fell to the ground. We both picked ourselves up and she apologized. I originally though nothing of this but then my 2nd period teacher moved the seating chart and I noticed that girl was in that class with me. (I’m oblivious what can I say?) Me and her sat next to one another and one day after we both finished our work and had a bit of free time we started chatting and she made an excuse to grab my hand and compare the size of our hands.

234,"Basically, I get super easily overwhelmed. I’m a really bad procrastinator. I get major test anxiety.. where I will give the most stupidest answers and then bang my head against the wall later for being so dumb. 

Example: I drew a diagram of a water molecule on an exam and I gave it 2 oxygen atoms instead of 2 hydrogen.. I emailed the professor immediately after the exam telling her of my stupid mistake and I explained that I’m not that stupid I just shut down and can’t think under pressure. She gave me the points because I explained extensively in my email a water molecule lol.

I just looked at all the courses they recommend for someone wanting to go into optometry, and it includes all kinds of chemistry and biology. I’m terrible at memorization, (really really bad) and I’ve flunked the general entry chemistry already. I’m good at math, but that’s like one thing going for me?? 

I really want to be an optometrist and I feel I’d be really happy in that field but with how competitive optometry schools are? .. My sister in law wants to be a vet, but she is continually being denied to vet schools because of her grades (average B’s) even though she has an incredible amount of experience and background with animals. 

I’m worried that will happen to me and I’m scared if I spend money to become an optometrist it will be in vain because I won’t be accepted into one of the highly competitive optometry schools. 

Should I go forward with the career choice I want? Or should I pick something safer and strive to be happy in my personal life?",19Jul2020,2

248,"Okay, I'll try to  keep this as concise as possible. 

I don't know what to do, my Uncle appears to be missing. The trouble is that he largely cut off communication from us a several years ago, no one is sure exactly why because there wasn't a big falling out or anything on our side. What happened was a marriage fell apart, it ended badly for him and he was ripped off for a lot of money. He got a job in another town about a year later and moved, then rented the house he had been living out to a friend. 

Fast forward to today, the house he was in is now empty, the renters apparently moved out some time ago. We're thinking at least 3 months given the state of the yard. The city received complaints about it, which is how we found out, we saw the notice on the door to his house about a hearing regarding the property. Turns out the house is unsecured, none of the windows were closed, the backdoor was unlocked, and it appeared that at some point someone was squatting in there. Not long, it isn't trashed, but there are mattresses stashed in the house.  

We try the numbers we had for my Uncle, the person on the other end says they're not him, I didn't do the actual call so I didn't hear his voice, but it's been at least 9 years since I heard it anyway. I start digging, and I can't find anything about him that's current. I looked up the tax information on his properties, he hasn't paid his house in 2 years. This isn't like him at all, up until 2017 the taxes were all paid. We contacted his old job, and they said he's no longer employed, but can't tell us when he left that job. I found an old address, and in uncovering that, we discovered that his previous landlord sued him for a significant amount over the house. I found records of exactly one garnishment from his old job in April of 2019, but beyond that every other thing I've found about him stops in 2018. 

The thing that makes me worry something happened is the other name on the lawsuit is that of his ex from about 10 years earlier. Evidently they must have both lived in the house because they were both served over it. Her history with stealing money was to not pay any bills, save the money and then bolt when things came to a head, and I'm thinking this was a repeat of that, though this is only suspicion at this point. Last time he did not take it well and alluded to some thoughts of suicide. 

I've been digging for a week and have turned up nothing beyond this, I'm at the end of the road as far as my capabilities go. So our next move was to contact the police, because he lived in another city we have to file a missing persons report there. After calling tonight, their response was, he's a grown man and can take care of himself so there's probably not even a reason to file a report. But they might.

What do we do now? 

If the police won't even take a report on the fact that no one we can find has had any sort of contact with my Uncle in over 2 years, how do we move forward? He's never outright neglected his properties before, he's had more than one renter, they would deposit rent into an account so if nothing else he should notice that the money was no longer being deposited and come investigate. We know that he hasn't been there recently, because with permission of the city/police we went in and changed the locks of the house since no one had any keys, so at least it would be secured.  

Apparently none of this is compelling enough to file a report, we can't afford a private investigator, and I am legitimately at a loss as to what we should do next.",19Jul2020,1
249,"Disclosure: Me (32 M) and DW (32 F) have lived with my parents for the majority of our relationship. Both because I was in school up until 2015 and to help us try to save money for the purchase of a house. We have both been fully employed the entire time but only recently landed jobs that were “good” (not great). Father retired 8+ years ago and has both a pension and SS. Mother has a part-job and SS. Wife and I pay our own healthcare costs, insurance, car costs, buy our own groceries, and take care of our own pet costs. Currently, we MIGHT eat 1 meal at home, but due to my celiac disease 9x out of 10, the meal prepared is not something I can eat and my wife tends not to like what my father prepares. 

The issue: My father is 72 and has always been a do it yourself guy. This was fine when he was younger, fitter, and healthy enough to do things around the house, deal with our 1-acre lot property, and fix one of the cars should there have been an issue with anything. Over the years, he has repaired our family cars, dealt with plumbing issues, maintained the yard, etc. (Note: I have often taken care of things like yard work and mowing despite my severe allergies and debilitating asthma. Example; two hours of mowing the lawn equates 2+ months of sinus infections and misery for me, even with a mask). At present the issues are these:

* We have 4 dead cars sitting on the property, two in the garage, two on the parking pad. Both cars on the parking pad had “minor issues” but have now been sitting untouched for 6 and 2 years respectively. Both are now infested with critters and are literally fuzzy with mold on the inside. Currently, their daily car is one my wife and I purchased and have let them use as I want to make sure they have something clean, well maintained, and trustworthy.
* Poorly installed plumbing when the house was built has resulted in 10+ severe leaks in the pipes, some of which went unaddressed for 6+ months and have meant that we now have a SIGNIFICANT mold problem in all bathrooms, laundry room, and kitchen. Both my father and I have exhibited breathing issues that I know are being at least exacerbated by this.
* Mother has extreme dental issues. Was supposed to have dental surgery over a year ago exact teeth, smooth jaw, and prepare her for dentures and father decided it was “too expensive” and has ignored all attempts to find alternatives. I spent 3 months finding options that were affordable, taking her to dentists, and finding options I would be able to afford. I offered to take a loan out in my name to cover her surgery. 
* Will not address things like cleanliness. 
   * Things like fruit pips or vegetable waste are not trashed or put down disposal. They go into the “compost” pile. However the “compost” can sit at the top stair to our basement for up to a month and has resulted in an infestation or fruit flies and cockroaches I cannot get ahead of. Roaches are the one thing I am irrationally afraid of due to a history of having them fall/crawl/jump on me.
   * Refuses to address pet messes. If one of the cats or dogs pees on carpet, he puts a piece of toilet paper over it rather than using carpet cleaner or asking me to take care of it. (Note: I try to clean their bedroom carpet at least once a month, but between a fulltime job, trying to find a house, and arthritis in my spine and knees, it is difficult to keep up with it.)
   * Wastes hundreds on food that goes to waste. My restricted allergy diet, my wife’s picky eating, and my mother’s lack of teeth (as well as her digestive issues) mean that most of the time my father buys foods he likes. He is incapable of thinking ahead and buying responsibly. For example: Berries on sale 3 for 5; he does not consider we might not eat them before they go off. In the past, I have deep-cleaned the refrigerator and found things anywhere for 6months to-4 years past their expiration date.  
   * We have several elderly cats (10-15+ yrs), one of whom is in liver and renal failure currently, but father refuses to acknowledge and is convinced she’s fine and will “turn a corner”. I love this animal dearly and hate to see her suffer, but it’s not my responsibility to make the decision to let her go to sleep peacefully instead of being miserable up to her end. We got her as a very young kitten when I was a young teen and I love her dearly. As an example, last year it was MY responsibility to take my blind, lymphoma-ridden 15-year-old family dog into the room and hold her while the vet euthanised her, as my father “couldn’t handle” being in the room. 

I am fairly certain both my parents suffer from depression. My mother in particular went from being an extremely vibrant, strong, and powerful woman who could pick up full rubbish bins of yard-waste with one hand to someone incapable of opening a whipped cream can top. Father has had a bad past few years healthwise. Last year he lost almost 20lbs and was bedridden for several weeks due to a stomach issue that ended up being diagnosed as diverticulitis. There were times I thought we’d lose him because of how poorly he was.

Several months ago, I facilitated the sale of one of my mother’s family rental properties with the understanding that she and I would split the sale profits and utilise her half to take care of her dental needs while putting the other half towards a down payment on a house for myself and DW. While it was not an enormous windfall, her half should have MORE than covered the cost of her surgery as well as being fitted for dentures, AND given them a buffer. Without getting too much into it, I handled ALL the house sale issues, including finding out that the renter had not paid rent in over a year before we sold the property.    

Please understand; we fully understand how lucky we are to have been able to live with my parents rent-free and appreciate everything that has been granted us. Father has, in the past, helped me work on DW and my’s cars and ponied up a few hundred for our wedding. 

We are preparing to move out here in a few weeks (hopefully) and I am extremely concerned about what my mother’s life will look like if I’m not here to try (in my limited capacity) to advocate for her and the remaining animals.

250,"I apologize for format- am on mobile. I apologize for any errors, English is not my first language. 

To make a short story long, I'm living in the good ol' US of A with the rest of my nuclear family. Mom, Dad, one sister, two brother. We are all immigrants pursuing the American dream in the very hot South! We are also all practicing Muslims. Being first generation Americans, Arabs, and Muslims (visibly so) has had its ups and downs but for the most part, we are thriving and thrilled to be here! The issue comes from my elder sister. She has three children and lives just a few minutes from my parents. 

Over the past few years my sister has been, for lack of a better term, brainwashed by social media. She has fallen into the anti-vaxx rabbit hole, the 5G conspiracies, the tendencies to distrust science, and much more. We as a collective family have tried to talk to her, mostly about the importance of vaccinations- for the sake of her children. The rest, we've kind of chalked up to freedom of opinion- it is not our business to meddle with her views on pigeons secretly being drones. 

Recently, she has begun rallying behind Trump. To each his own political beliefs, but with COVID hitting our area especially hard, we once again encouraged her to take precautions when taking her children out. She believes COVID is manufactured to frighten the American people and encourages her children to not wash their hands, and to feel free to do what they please, whenever, wherever. 

My parents are both high risk, they've asked if the children come over to please wear masks (they're all old enough to wear a cloth cover safely). My sister refused, took offence and has now informed us that we are sheep, and likely will have to leave this country as we do not belong. The quote was ""you are in America now and this terrorist mindset is not going to be tolerated."" The ""t-word"" is incredibly offensive- and not the first time she has implied that we are disillusioned. My parents are heartbroken, and do not know how to reach her- she has since cut off communication and they cannot see their only grandchildren, even on face time . If even for the sake of her children. ..

258,"Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I am a 26-year-old male, and I have a family, and I've experienced trauma, and I've experienced most to all emotions in my life. My mistake may be one that leads to a state of permanent insanity, my early death, or just homelessness; truthfully, I don't know where it's going to lead me, but I have inferred that those three are my options. This isn't good, and I don't want any of those three, and this is why I would like some advice.

It's necessary for me to share what my mistake was. At the time that I made this choice, I was living in another state, and I wasn't receiving enough love in my life. This is an odd way to assess things, I know, but it's a psychological act. I moved to this state to attend college there; I chose this college because of its financial help and because my mother and her side of our family lived there. My mother is addicted to drugs. I was taken away from her by my father when I was nine years old, and she is currently in prison for her second drug-related crime in the past ten years. I should not have been allowed to go to the college in her state, honestly.

So the following is how my mental deterioration manifested itself three and a half years ago: my aunt (who shares the same age as me), my cousin, and I went out for a night of drinking. Afterwards, we returned to my cousin's apartment, and I decided to do the following:

Carrying an urge to have sex with my aunt, I stepped in the restroom, then stepped back out of it to ask my aunt if she could help me use the restroom. She entered the restroom and unbuckled my belt as I portrayed myself as being incapable of doing so. I then pulled my pants down, exposing myself to my aunt, and again asking her for ""help"".

She quickly turned her head away, and exclaimed ""No, bitch!"" and left the restroom.

This is every detail of my action.

I've forgiven myself. I now know how the choice I made is possible because I've gone to therapy a few times over the past year. Also, more importantly, I've moved back to the house full of those who nurtured that I had left to go to college. This aunt whom I betrayed through indecent exposure also lives at this house.

While I forgive myself because I understand who I was when I made the choice I did, I don't think it is possible for her to forgive me. Our relationship and any potential change/improvement to it is barricaded because of the sex crime and betrayal I committed. She claimed that she has forgiven me when we were drunk, and shows friendliness and camaraderie when around me. I know that the relationship is not truly repaired, however.

Well, I think I know that, but I am having trouble truly accepting that. Is it forgivable? Thank you for your time.",19Jul2020,0

267,"When I (F20) was little, I was inappropriately touched by a family member who was a couple of years older than me. This went on for years, and then it stopped. But I had kept it a secret until I was a pre-teen because he had embarrassed me and made me believe that we would be in trouble. 

  During one of my mom and I’s many arguments, I broke down and told her the truth. At first, it seemed like she didn’t believe me. And she kept offering to talk to the family member for me since he was still a part of the family (obviously nobody knew about the sexual abuse but him and I) but I knew that wouldn’t help. I told her that I’m over the situation itself and talking to him won’t do anything. I told her I thought I needed therapy, because I tried to tell her that I was depressed and had anxiety. But I didn’t get therapy until I turned 19 and it was only because my grandmother really cared and noticed how depressed I was.  

    I have to backtrack a little bit. Growing up, I was the first child btw. I’m the oldest sister out of my siblings. So I was the guinea pig. But anyway, I grew up hearing my parents argue and scream at each other night after night. It wasn’t pretty. But I got used to it. And I didn’t know it was bad until my cousin came over, witnesses it, and was noticeably shocked. But anyways...growing up, I developed a bad attitude. My mom is from NY, near Staten Island, so she was born with an attitude to begin with. My dad is from a big city in Michigan. They both had me young and in my opinion weren’t prepared, (but what parent is fully prepared for a child that was unplanned anyway? You don’t expect them to be, so I don’t blame them for that) 


Anyways...growing up, I was the only girl in my family. And I grew up around a LOT of rough boy cousins (NOT the family member who assaulted me) .. that lived in the same state as me. And our family is black, so we had BBQs together, we vacationed together every summer, we always hung out. Anyways, I was the only girl, so you can imagine what I had to go through with all those silly, annoying little boys. I had to defend myself from teasing, getting smacked in the face, and stupid roast sessions. (The best part is all of that stuff became fun to me. I liked how boys could make fun of each other, and be best friends all in the same day). 

  Due to being surrounded by all those boys, growing up with anxiety over my “secret”, AND growing up with my parents screaming at each other, I think I developed a strong defense mechanism in the form of a bad attitude. And it’s okay to defend yourself to other kids, but in my family, you can’t defend yourself verbally to your parents. It’s seen as disrespectful. I am not using this as an excuse for my behavior! I’m just pointing out my though processes as a child and what I believed I was doing. 

Anyways, my mom and I have had our ups and downs for YEARS. Non-stop. And it always starts with her having an attitude. She will purposely ask me questions in order to negatively criticize me on mistakes I’ve made (even though I’m working on it) if she’s having a bad day. She has called me countless names “bitch” , “full of shit” and she’s even said she wishes I wasn’t born. 

Now, I get it. I have anger issues. I’ve never gotten in trouble at school, never failed classes, never misbehaved in public or anything like that actually. I’ve always had decently good grades, and am currently in college right now. Yes I’ve made mistakes, but I desperately try to be a better person each and every day. I have never beaten someone up, stolen anything, hurt any animals, ect.....I have always had a green thumb and a love for every living thing. Even though I had anger issues. 

My mom and I’s arguing got so bad that she kicked me out at 16  so I moved in with my grandma . 


Anyway. I had three mental breakdowns / panic attacks before I started my antidepressant medication a couple of months ago. I had had enough of my mom hurting my feelings. And I blamed my mother for the sexual abuse I faced as a child. The worst part is, I said it in front of my siblings. And I told them all about how she didn’t believe me at first when I told her about the sexual abuse. She downplayed it. And I told them about how she didn’t get me the help I needed. I also said that she was a bad mother. 

And I feel so bad now😣I can’t stop crying. I feel like a horrible person. I heard through the grape-vine that she has already been blaming herself for what happened. 

The part that hurts the worst is she’s lowkey been trying to reconcile. But I’ve just had enough. I’m so hurt.  And when I get hurt, I get angry and lash out by yelling and saying hurtful things that I ALWAYS regret. 

And I just want to die because I know my mom won’t be around forever and I can’t face the day when I she passes away or gets sick or something f and I feel so guilty about everything I said. I really just can’t do this ... I can’t do it anymore . I can’t pretend like I’m okay. I’m not. And I’m sick of crying in public",19Jul2020,3
268,"This guy, Donny, who lives down the street from me has been hounding me for months about selling my old car and a couple of junk cars that have been sitting around for years and, with the money problems I'm having lately, I gave in. He got me in touch with a guy who bought the two junk cars and said he had someone who would buy my old car. All he asked is that I throw him a little money off what I made. As a sort of finder's fee. Seemed fair to me.

But this guy has been telling me for months that he works at a car auction and does this for a living. I agreed to sell the car to him for $600. Which is $500 more than the dealership offered me for it. So I figured why not. He has to leave and gets back in touch with me later in the day. He has someone that is going to buy the car. He doesn't actually have the money. He further explains that this is what he does, he finds buyers. Then he brings me in close and asks if I have a problem with him telling the buyer that I want X amount more over the $600 and letting him keep the difference. I figure sure, whatever. Another finder's fee. I assume this is how he makes his money. So he tells the guy on the phone that I'm asking $800 for the car. The guy wants to come by and look at it.

We meet back up in the late afternoon and the buyer is with him. He goes by the name Big Don. And he is huge. Well over seven feet tall and probably around four hundred pounds. When I fist-bumped this guy it looked like I had baby hands. The guy looks the car over and asks if I'll go any lower. And we agree on $750. Which didn't matter to me because I was still getting $600. 

Donny walks away to take a phone call and me and Big Don get to talking and it turns out that they're cousins. Donny is scamming his cousin. This doesn't sit well with me because I believe family should look out for one another. That's how I was raised. Big Don also tells me that Donny doesn't have fifty-cents to his name, even though he drives around in a convertible Mustang. He doesn't work and collects Social Security. He doesn't work at the car auction, he's a hustler. He goes on to say, ""Donny's my cousin but he will lie and cheat you in a heartbeat."" I thanked him for telling me this because Donny had been asking about buying a lot of other stuff I own and saying he'll cut my grass for a whole month (which would just be twice) if I give him this or that. And Donny had started to speak as if he was my new best-friend and told me he was gonna help me sell my recently deceased parents' stuff. Which didn't sit well with me either. 

My dad died last summer and before he had become confined to a bed he had complained about some guy always bothering him about buying the cars and stuff every time he sat outside under his favorite tree. I didn't put two-and-two together until Donny mentioned he had tried to buy the cars from my dad.

Big Don didn't have all the money on him today but gave me a $250 down-payment and a gentleman's agreement (nothing signed) and said that he would be back Tuesday or Wednesday with the other $500 and get the car then. Donny wanted his cut today but I told him he'll get his share when I get the rest and the deal is done. 

Now, Big Don seemed like a more honorable guy than his cousin. He was straightforward and didn't talk himself up like little Donny. And he's getting the car for his son. But he said something to me that rubbed me the wrong way. After he gives me the $250 he says, ""I'm a big, proud, American black man. I'm not a Jew. I'm not going to try to Jew you and cheat you."" Maybe it was the only saying he knew to express what he meant. Maybe he hates Jews. I don't know. But, what he didn't know, is that my grandmother was Jewish. So his words have been swirling around in my brain ever since. 

Now, I could just close the deal when Big Don comes to get the car on Tuesday or Wednesday, and give Donny his $150 share and be done with them both. 

Or, I could keep the whole $750 and be like, the deal was good until I found out you were cheating your own family. But I would then have to worry about the guy down the block messing with my stuff while I was gone. He seems like the type.

Or, I could keep $700 and give Donny $50 and tell him Big Don talked me down to $650 after he found something wrong with the car. But then Donny could call Big Don and check.

Or, I could just sell the car to Big Don for $600 and tell him his cousin was trying to cheat him. Which I feel would be the right thing to do. And if Big Don hadn't made that racist remark I would be more inclined to do so. But since he did, I say screw him, too.

Or, I could cancel the deal and take my chances with selling it to someone else. But, he gave me a down-payment and we made an agreement.

Or, if Donny is there with Big Don, I could take the $750 and hand Donny his $150 in front of Big Don and watch the fireworks happen. It would been like paying $150 to see Shaquille O'Neal fight Sammy Davis Jr.. Totally worth it.

**Do you think if he’s turning his head away from me it would be to fantasize? Do you think him closing his eyes means he’s fantasizing or he’s just enjoying it?**

He also is borderline addicted to porn and I’m worried maybe he’s fantasizing about porn while we’re having sex. I’d love to hear your thoughts and please tell me if I’m overreacting, i really hope that’s the case.

270,"Before anyone tells me to go post in r /eatingdisorders I am pretty certain that this isn’t an ED, as I don’t feel that I fall into that category. (As far as I know) 
Meaning I don’t refuse to eat because of an insecurity, I don’t starve myself, purge, or massively binge and I have a pretty positive outlook on my appearance. 
Hence, the call for advice. 

I’m just not into food, I see people all around me rant and rave about their favorite things to eat, things they wish they could eat, etc. 
And I feel like I can’t relate, I couldn’t tell you my favorite food if you asked because quite frankly I don’t think I have one. I’m not picky, but I guess I would say I’m ‘food particular’ and prone to nausea due to strong smells, &amp; heat. 

Only recently did this start to concern me and make me feel a little disconnected from others because 
I don’t eat at gatherings, friends houses, parties. 
I’m just disinterested and I don’t want to eat whatever food they decided to make, I don’t want to make a whole plate then have to eat the whole thing. 
I usually don’t even have an appetite in these type of situations, and I’d rather wait until I’m home later and can just eat something small when I actually feel like it. 

I’ve been in many situations where people insist I try something and when I only have a bite or just flat out reject them, they act like I just kicked their baby. 

And I feel awful! I wish I liked food! 

I wish I could just eat something and be interested and excited! 
I’ve never been excited over food, and it’s something I really want to change. 

Is there any way to help with increasing appetite and building a healthy and enjoyable relationship with food?",19Jul2020,1

272,"I am around 19yrs and since I was born had weak eyes, I can see fine but I can't see stuff that's far that well.

When I was younger I had gone to opticians twice a year, And I never wore glasses.

When I was around 12 finishing 6th grade I started seeing black dots in my left field of vision, shrugged it off as they were mostly when I was trying to study a subject I didn't like and reading a few pages of it, which I thought was just me being tired, finals get near and it keeps getting worse, I told no one yet, during the summer it didn't get worse, but when I started 7th grade, by the time the first term is over I am practically blind in my left eye, i was devestated, but what I thought was weirder is, no one seemed to notice, to this day I told no one about it, I haven't been to an optician since before I got blind.

Fast forward to university, I had to do a written test for applying, durning the test  one of the professors that were in the exam asked me if I needed help to read, or if they need to get a bigger exam sheet, I told them that I didn't need anything (in a polite way), after the exam and in the car with my father, we hadn't left the university for even 3 minutes he gets a call fr that professor, and asks him about my vision, and then he tells him (""he's fine, we take him to the optician to get him checked every 6 month, etc""), I am in the passenger seat next to him, I keep my face straight through all of this, but inside I am shattered.

275,"I wrote a huge text rn talking about my feelings toward my friendships and I just lost it haha help. 

ok so I'm here cause I feel like my friendship is falling apart because of me and I wanted some advice. 

so to give some background, I have only three friends (18F) and one of them is kinda distant cause she have a lot of friends and idk. we are basically a group, we've known each other for at least seven years and since them we're friends in depth. 

I think I'm falling apart from my friendship and I need an outside perspective.

we're in quarentine, but we talk every day in our group, so everything is fine. we didn't fight or discuss. things are normal. the thing is right now I'm feeling really uncomfortable with the way I'm being and: doing towards them. 

imagine a five year old going to a school trip, the teacher give the students a rope to hold in order to keep track of everyone. Ok so I'm the 5yo and I'm the last one in the line. I'm stumbling everywhere cause I'm too sleepy and I start losing track of the rope. I could either tell everyone to stop or start keeping it up with them. my friends are the teacher, who don't know what to do with the stumbling little person. That's exactly how I feel about them. 

the reality towards this cenario is that I barely talk to them about me. it's been almost three years since I don't spill out my problems at them cause I feel like they never listen to me and sympathize with my problems so I don't think there's a reason I should talk about, you know?? I mean, I feel like I shouldn't expect anyone to empathize with my problems, people hearing me out should be enough, but it doesn't feel enough to me. One of these friends was a bad energy in my life, she would ways drag me down unconsciously with her problems and I would let her. I would diminish everything I felt to listen to her and tRy to be good at that. 

also, after some time I started not talking about the series I watched, the songs I listened and the books I read to them over the messages. for example, I used to send 5 minutes audios talking about the 100 and how much i loved it but no one would listen, so why bothering right? in response to that, our conversations are basically about them, their problems or their interests and I don't feel uncomfortable with that because I know I'm responsible for that: no one is going to keep saying every day ""oh honey, what did you watch today?? what do you like?""

anyway, to summarize it: 

I'm distancing and I feel it got deeper during quarentine. I hate this cause I feel frustrated that they don't know me anymore and that's only my fault. 

maybe you're like: ""why would this be you being a bad friend?""

and I explain:

I think I may expect too much from them??? people don't always have to care about your interests, so I shouldn't have to stuck it in because I think they wouldn't care. maybe they have different ways to care? also, I blame them for being like this rn, this whole text is me saying ""I'm like this cause sis never listened to me, I am an angel and I shouldn't be living this"" and I do have responsibility (major I guess) about this. Now, when they talk about their problems I can't go deep in them, cause I  don't emphasize with them. it's like there always a voice in my head that says ""oh these are your problems???mines are so much bigger"". 

also, because I don't talk much about my stuff, the others started to stuck it in too, and not only problems, but they're interests and things like that. 

I think they are still in phase one, so they still talk about their stuff, but they're starting to cover it in a lot. idk

I feel bad for all that

I think quarentine and distance in general had brought me to this situation cause I'm much more unstable home. It's hard for me to want to talk to them through messages, so I feel more lonely and lost. 

anyways, sorry for how big this was. I guess we both are wrong in lots of ways but do you guys know what I could do to make things better with them? any advice???",19Jul2020,1

I say ""I'm not sure, but it sounds pretty weird I wouldn't Google it it's probably innapropriate""

I was in shock and didn't know if I should call the police to notify them that this lunatic was on the road. I did about 30 seconds later. I gave them a good description of the car and the color, where they were headed, and parts of the car that were missing.

I received a call about 4-5 hours later from an officer stating that they had a person in custody. He asked me what I witnessed and where I was at when this happened. He then asked me what a good contact number was for me and my address. I gave it to him to comply.

Walking into her home is like walking into a replica of my own - down to the placement of extremely specific objects on a bookcase (exact same one I have).

She constantly asks where I bought you-name-it from, and diligently buys it for herself. I just feel like she’s on a mission to carbon copy my life. 

So is she as weird as I think she is?! Or am I the weird one for being so bothered by this?

What would you do, friends?! I have no interest in confronting her about it cuz it makes me feel petty as shit lol. In the end, I know it’s all just materialistic stuff and doesn’t matter - but I get irked. I understand copying a little/subtly, but to this level is just eerie. It feels like I can’t have anything of my own, and I can’t buy something without getting anxious about her following suit. There are endless examples I could give, and more insight into who she is as a person - open to providing more info if you need! :P

TLDR my envious SIL must have everything I have and I don’t know if there’s a solution, or if I have to just get over it.",19Jul2020,1

309,"So I have really bad social anxiety. It’s to the point where I struggle to go out to get a haircut, let alone hang out with people. That’s not to say that I don’t want to be sociable, because I’d love to be able to socialize more than anything.

About a week ago, my brother asked me why I never hang out with him when he’s with his friends, and how all his friends always talk about how they want to hang out with me.

My brother and I have never been close, but I decided that opening up to him about this is something I wanted to do. So I told him that I struggle really badly with anxiety, and that I’m trying to see a therapist so that I can get medicated for it.

That was that, and he hadn’t asked me to hang out with his friends or talk about it since. Tonight I ended up DD’ing for him and his friends, which is fine. I just quietly drive them where they need to be taken, while they’re all drunk and acting goofy.

However, when I came back to pick them up, I was waiting outside for them to get ready and 2 of his friends came out and convinced me to go hang out with them for a few mins while they smoked their last blunt and got ready to leave.

So, I joined them. It was just the 3 of us and I was standing there quietly, not knowing what to say, as per usual, while they made small talk. Eventually they diverted the conversation towards me and were like...

“We know this is personal, but your bro told us that you have anxiety or something and are trying to get medication,” and then one of them started talking about how their sister is on anxiety medication and that it took a while for her to find the right medication.

I didn’t know what to say, so I just gave one word responses and avoided continuing the conversation. I was already nervous by just being around them, and when they told me that, it killed any sort of chance of me socializing. I’m insecure as it is, and now I have his friends knowing that I have something wrong with me - not such a good confidence booster.

I feel betrayed by my brother. I’m not angry, I’m just sad. I entrusted him with telling him about a serious problem that I had and then he just goes and tells his friends about it. I dont think he did it with ill intent but not only does it make it nearly impossible to open up to him about things anymore, but also destroys any sort of self confidence I might have had around his friends.

I want to confront him about it, and get out the frustrations this has caused me, but I don’t want to get into a fight with him or make him feel like I’m attacking him. How can I approach this conversation?",19Jul2020,3

313,"For context I am 23 year old guy living in Melbourne. I'm studying sports science/sports management and am in my last semester trying to figure out what to do next. I had some idea of a plan before this dumb virus hit and ruined everything. I almost had a job lined up with the sporting organisation that I've been doing casual work with each summer for 3 years but that definitely won't go ahead because they cut 3/4 of the field staff earlier this year.

So my current options are as follows: 

1. Study a masters of Sports Analytics, this is something that I would really enjoy studying and feel would be beneficial career wise and the skills I learn can be used in a lot of industries. However its a 2 year course and I'll be 26 by the time I finish. If I do this I miss out on the chance to work and earn some money. I don't really have much by the way of savings and house prices in Australia are ridiculously expensive. I feel like I won't have enough time to earn enough to save properly for a house if i don't really start working full time until i'm 26. 

2. Try find full time work within for next year and start being a real adult. Considering Australia has dealt with Covid relatively well there's still a fair amount of jobs going around and more will open up in the next couple of months. I'll likely be able to keep working as a casual with my current employer but that it very much up in the air right now as Melbourne has just gone into lockdown. This is also seasonal work because it's a summer sport and only really has work from Oct to Feb and minimal outside this. If i look for other full time work i won't be able to do any travel around Australia which is something that I really want to do and probably won't be able to juggle a full time masters at the same time as full time work

3. Go travelling for a bit around Australia next year and see parts of the country that I haven't already. This is something that I really want to do considering that international travel doesn't seem very likely for at least a year and a half. I also feel like if i don't do this soon i'll never get around to it and it will be too late and hard to find the time for it if I'm working full time. It wouldn't really be possible to find full time work and take leave because I want to go for at least a couple of months and see as much as possible.

So as you can see i'm pretty damn confused and stuck in a loop where I feel like whatever I pick i'm missing out on other things. If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it and hopefully you guys will be able to help me out, cheers.",19Jul2020,1
314,"I (M19) used to be very close friends with a girl (F19) from my high school. Our friendship has always been strictly platonic and I used to have the pleasure of seeing her every day and being close enough for her to confide in me. Now that we have been out of HS for a year, I never see her and barely talk to her, except through text occasionally. She is very introverted and also leans into that as an identity, to the point that I believe she may have mild to severe social anxiety., though I could never be qualified to make that judgment.

At this point, I don't know what to do. I feel like now the only thing that held us together was being forced to see each other at school every day for about 5 years. I've tried to communicate through text mainly since we graduated because she refuses most other forms of contact. I know that right now isn't the best time to see people anyway, but even if COVID wasn't a thing, she never leaves her house from what I can gather and becomes very stressed by even the idea of a social event with me or with a group of friends. 

She lives maybe a mile away from me and I feel like we are still states apart like during the school year since we go to different colleges. I'm considering just altogether stopping trying to communicate with her. Not blocking and ghosting, but just not bothering because it seems like she has no interest in maintaining adult relationships. 95% of all our digital communication has been prompted by me and the conversations carried only by me so if I do cut everything off, I almost guarantee that I will never hear from her again.

I have tried in the past to acknowledge this gap and the stress I feel having to maintain the relationship on my own, she just apologizes, says she is introverted and doesn't change. 

What do I do now? At what point should I just stop altogether?",19Jul2020,1

317,"Due to endometriosis and PCOS, my family had always been led to believe adoption or foster care was the only chance of a child I would ever have. I have been fine with this; however, my husband and I really want a baby. Adopting a baby domestically in the states is very expensive and comes with a lot of risk (mom deciding she wants to keep baby, yet you have paid for all bills, etc.) and international adoption poses a large risk for “stolen baby” issues. So, after a long talk my husband and I decided after I have my next surgery (removing an ovarian cyst) we would like to try for one year, naturally, to conceive.

I do not know how to tell my mom though because I was always so adamant that I didn’t want my own even if I could have them because pregnancy sounds awful. And it still sounds awful but I never want to regret not having a child.

329,"I’m starting to rethink my friendships.

I’ve been in the same friend group for about 2 years now. I was friends with one of them and he introduced me to the group. It went really well, but recently I’ve found myself being more annoyed and frustrated at all of them. It also feels like they don’t respect me.

So, I’ll go through some of their behaviours and let you guys give me some advice, should I leave the friend group? Or stick with them. For clarification we’re all 14-15.

Immaturity: This one is a problem that most of them have, I’m not some perfect modest guy so I admit, I can be immature too, but I’m no where near the levels of some of these guys. They constantly make fart jokes, dick jokes and generally immature stuff like that. Some of them constantly make degrading jokes towards the females in the group and call them whores, thots and sluts without any problems.

Unfunny jokes: If I had a nickel for every time someone had just said a sentence, and then everyone screams that sentence and dwells on it for the next 10 minutes, I’d be a rich man. They constantly make “Random = Funny” jokes. They just repeat and scream random unfunny memes and spam the chat with incomprehensible words and phrases, they spam random images in the chat, like pictures of Heather from TDI. A popular joke recently has been screaming “Joe Swan” in calls and spamming it in the chat.

Annoying: This kind of falls under the category of unfunny jokes, I’ll join a call with 4 people, and just be overwhelmed because everyone is screaming and I can’t here anyone. Once my cousin (17M) joined a call we were all in and after ten seconds hung up immediately. He just looked at me and said “That sounds cancerous as fuck” Being in a call with them is just a chore and I get constant headaches.

Putting me down: This is just one guy in particular, who we’ll call Matt. If I ever say “This achievement is really hard” Or “He probably does so well because of his character’s survivability” Matt will always correct me with something like “Umm, no, it’s because of this actually” I get that he’s trying to help but it gets so frustrating. Some of the others do this too, but it’s no where near Matt’s level.

Ignoring me: This one isn’t that big of a deal because it’s probably my fault. A recent example was when we all went out together, we had the chance of going to a park, or a nearby friends house, he had said if we wanted we could come to his house afterwards. I wanted to go to the friends house, but no one else wanted to, whatever, but then they refused to give me the address so I could just go there myself. So I was forced to stick with them. When I left no one cared, just a few Ok bye’s. This one might be on me though.

I’ve been wanting to right this post for weeks, and the final straw was when all 5 of them refused to help me get an achievement in a game, I know it’s such an insignificant thing, but how hard is it to help out your buddy for 10 minutes. I wasn’t even asking them to go out of their way, they were all literally playing the same game that I needed the achievement for.

So, should I leave this friend group. I’m hoping that with time they’ll mature up but I don’t know if I can wait that long. Should I leave the group? Advice needed.",19Jul2020,1

343,"I’m a 26 year old male and a veteran.

When I was a kid, I wanted to be a career soldier but certain circumstances led me to end that career. I now suffer from depression and anxiety that probably began when I was a child.

After I got out of the army, I went to school to become an electrician. I worked in the field for about six months and I’m pretty sure it’s not for me. Maybe I’ll try to go back into it after the pandemic is over or I’ll go back to school and become an electrical designer.

I’ve never been in a serious relationship in my life. I’ve gone on a few dates but I either lose interest or she does (I’m a male). Now I’m starting to believe that it’s far too late for me to develop the skills necessary to have a romantic relationship. Hell I think it’s too late for me to develop skills just to make and keep friends.

I’ve been going to counseling since I left the army and it has helped me a lot but I often feel like for every few steps I take I end up taking one step back. It’s even worse now because of the pandemic. I’m an American and I know the president hasn’t handled the situation well; it’s come to the point where I think a trained monkey would do better. All of my sessions are through the phone and I feel like it’s making it worse somehow. I understand why it needs to happen to help prevent the virus from spreading but it doesn’t feel the same as an in person session. And now I’m thinking my counselor isn’t helping me either. Even when I was seeing her in person I felt that she doesn’t give me any advice and just listens, smiles and send me on my way.

I’ve been asking her how she feels a lot and I might have inadvertently pushed the subject too much, showed sadness for her and accidentally partially claimed her struggles and reminded her for her internal battles.

I’ve been realizing some tendencies to turn situations to myself when they have nothing to do with me, and I am realizing how insensitive I’ve been in the past.

351,"Ok so Ive always been insecure in my level of competency but I’ve been especially self conscious lately now that I just graduated from college, will be moving, and have to begin applying for jobs and join new social circles. Conversing is something I can do decently because I compensate for my lack of knowledge on topics with my bubbly laugh and a feigned enthusiastic smile. People typically enjoy my company and probably don’t realize my conversational incompetencies as much as I do.

There are two things specifically that I want to change: 

1. I want to be more knowledgeable in a variety of popularly discussed categories like politics, sports, pop culture, movies/shows, environment, etc. 

2. My vocabulary. 

The issue with the first one is that I have a lack of interest in many things. I don’t see all the hype about sports, politics bore me to death, and I can’t pay attention to a movie/show long enough  for it to start peaking my interest. I feel like I’m so far behind society in terms of all these categories but I would like to begin forcing myself to learn about these things so I can better contribute to conversations. How does one suddenly learn in a vast array of areas ?? 

With vocab, I have always been poor with words. I catch myself repeatedly saying “what’s the word....” at least once a day. Because of this and the fact that my brain always feels so unorganized, I’m awful at conveying my ideas to others. Im not much of a reader but I started picking up books about 2 months ago hoping that it would help (every avid reader I know, is a phenomenal speaker) but so far, I’m still left stuttering throughout my speech. 

Note: I am skeptical that I might really have undiagnosed ADD which is contributing to these issues. im considering seeing a doctor soon because I think medication would restore my attention span for the things that don’t interest me and would improve my working memory as well and make my thoughts more organized (although I’d rather not have to resort to taking a medication...) 

What can I do to actually learn and start retaining the information so I can improve my social skills and contribute better to conversations around me? 

For example, I’m looking for visual news sources that convey the news in a fun, memorable way and maybe some specific upcoming sports events to watch  or subreddits to follow ? Book recommendations ?? Other topics I should involve myself with? I just want to be a smarter person to talk to!! What does everyone else do to know so much??? Looking for small things to incorporate into my day.. 

Thanks!! 

TLDR: I feel incompetent because of my underdeveloped vocabulary and my lack of general knowledge about the world. I’m interested in finding out ways to improve this. What does everyone else do to know so much and how many books do I have to read before I start speaking more smoothly and intelligently?",19Jul2020,1
354,"This may come off as a rant but I do need advice.

My Gf(F21) and I have been dating for 4 years. I really love her but we have had issues with trust (which we have worked on and has gotten really great). 

My issue is with one of her ""cousins"". He's actually a really close family friend which she has known since birth and he's our age. Both her and her family have always talked about how as kids they would pretend to date (which I'm fine with, they were kids). Her dad and even some of her family had always expected them to get together. Not that they say this directly but they imply it. Quite recently her parents have allowed him to sleep at there house 1-2 times a week so he can drive to his work. I find this weird, are all white/small families like this?

It may be a culture difference as I have a very large family where all my cousins are related by blood and even still would never sleep at our house (especially at our age).

To make matters worse she has been acting like she wants nothing to do with me and for the past couple weeks. Her affection seems very forced and I feel distant from her. I've brought this up with her but I just get met with anger and her bringing up random things.

355,"hey guys, i’m having a hard time lately with knowing if my boyfriend is controlling or not. i’m sure confused and in really big need of advice.

our relationship started off fine but it got confusing by fast. we will be together for 6 months tomorrow. but i’m really questioning him. 

corona was decently bad but almost done this time around. and i don’t know what this is. we were having a conversation and i said “i’m gonna invite a couple friends over” he told me if i do that he won’t see me until it’s over because his sister can get really sick really easily he said “so pick your friends or me” so that was the first red flag for me. and i’m really at the point where i can’t tell if that is being controlling. for a little bit he was trying to take me from my family a little bit isolating me from them so i called him out. we fought about it, but then it was over. things changed for a little bit. then he started questioning my past relationships. if i don’t tell him a bad experience from them. he gets really upset. and i’ll admit i do some wrong too. so i’ve questioned if i’m the problem... there were times where he wanted to come over and i told him i was hanging with my mom he would get really mad and say i was leading him on and wasting his time. because when he does come. he will outside with me and my mom for a bit and then get all grumpy and then go down to my room. and then get upset at me when i don’t go downstairs to my room. one time i was hanging out with my friends. and he starts going on after i tell him i am! about how upset he is and how he needs someone. and how i’m a horrible person because “i would of dropped everything for you” was his words so then i get him to come over and he doesn’t even TALK TO ME and says “well i didn’t know you were actually hanging out with the them o thought your brother was i’d appreciate if i knew your plans”. he always thinks i’m cheating on him For example: there was a stain on my pillow. and he was asking me what it was. (it was RED juice) so i kept saying that. and he’s like “no that’s cum” we argued for 30 mins and asks me if i’m cheating on him. he gets upset with me that i don’t want to lay in bed all day and want to go upstairs or something. he gets upset when i take a little longer. he constantly watches me when i’m on my phone and then will try to peak at what i’m doing. i have a bad relationship with sex. so there is a few times we were doing it and i couldn’t continue and he convinced me it was fine. and then the other day said that it makes him sexual frustrated and he hates when i do that and that it makes him feel bad. and every time i bring up an issue he thinks i’m “making him out to be the worlds worst person” in his words. but he can tell me mine all the time. he plays 2k the basketball game alll day! and if i go on tik tok he gets upset and tells me how much he hates it. there is so much more. it’s so confusing because he has so much good as well... he makes me feel like the only girl in the world. maybe it’s just me. the other day i was listening to old music i used to listen to and was brining up some memories. and he told me he didn’t wanna hear it because it made him think of his past (he has a good past his life has been super good) but i told him a memory i had and he was like “well are you sure it wasn’t actually bad and you just were euphoric because of the adrenaline” he tries to make my good memories bad ones. and i don’t know if that’s controlling. so i called him out and he got so upset i said “i have a past sorry but if you wanna be with me you have to understand that” and then he’s like “well i wild ask you to turn it off but that’s controlling” so i do and then he’s upset with me. and then the next day i was looking through picture memories. and he was so mad because i commented on how i’ve gained more weight than i wang. and he tells me it makes him so mad when i say that stuff because he “thought i wasn’t even good looking then”. idk i’m just confused. and need help.

In the past, caffeine has always genuinely made me tired. 

I'd like to preface this by saying that I struggle with severe anxiety as well as extreme paranoia, to the point of believing that loved ones have poisoned/spit in my drinks etc. I also have nighttime hallucinations sometimes where I see shadow people but none of this has been diagnosed because I'm very against seeing a therapist/psychologist for unrelated reasons. 

So at about... 12:00 AM, (it's 3:30 AM now) I decided to drink some coffee that is six years expired. Not brilliant, I know. After this, I took 130 mg caffeine from a different source. 

About twenty minutes later I started sweating profusely. Then I began to write, probably important to mention that I write often in my spare time. 

For about an hour and a half, I proceeded to write complete nonsense of about 3k words that made no sense whatsoever while shaking very much. I began to feel very nauseous and developed a rash on my right wrist as well, which has since gone away. 

At about 2:00 AM I came upstairs, extremely hyperactive and agitated planning to exercise for some reason and I am still exercising but it's not going very well, I still feel very nauseous and both of my legs are shaking very very much as well as my left arm and I have no control over this. I cannot exercise because I am shaking too much and I have no strength. 

About thirty minutes ago, I happened to come across an album cover for a popular band and started seeing eyes where there were no eyes. I have since stopped exercising and am not quite sure what to do.

358,"My (M19) girlfriend’s (F20) cousin (F19) moved in a week and a half ago, and she is already irritating me. We’ve lived in our apartment for 8 months, and it’s been great. Recently, her cousin started coming over frequently and her living situation has not been the best (brother has people come over to smoke constantly, takes care of all the kids in the house, pays more than her share of household needs) so we told her it was okay if she moved in. 

The day she moved in she’s got Tinder, and went on a date with a guy (M25) two days later. We were gone last weekend and she had him stay over, and we weren’t bothered by it at all. She had him over during the day early on in the week, and he mocked that I made music and a joke about the fact that my friend died two weeks ago. A couple days ago, she left and didn’t come back until after we were sleeping, but my girlfriend woke up and saw him walking around our living room without a shirt on. The next morning, I was super upset, but I just carried on and went to work. When my girlfriend woke up, she told me that her cousin left him there and her cousin just texted her, “don’t go in my room, there’s a naked body in there.” This made my girlfriend and I super uncomfortable, and it ruined our entire day. We don’t know this person aside from the one conversation where he made the joke, and she barely knows him. (We don’t even have locks on our bedroom doors.) On top of this, she’s had her cousin (F16) who is not related to my girlfriend in any way, stay over every other night here, which makes me uncomfortable because we have alc*h*l and w**d in the house.

We decided to talk to her last night about it, (that he couldn’t be here when she wasn’t, that he couldn’t stay until we knew him well enough) and she said everything was cool and she understood everything. BUT earlier tonight, she told me he was coming up for a little bit. I told her it was cool and they just hung out in her room. They eventually left, but she came back with him two hours later. My friend was hanging out w me in the living room when she got back up, and she had a very guilty look on her face. They went to her bedroom, and turned the lights off. I figured they were just going to hangout for a little bit longer, but I wanted to make sure so I texted her and asked if he was staying. She never responded back, but I could hear them talking in the room. 

My girlfriend told me not to kick him out right now, but I was very tempted. She literally told us that everything we said was okay, and lied straight to our faces. I don’t know what to do, because my girlfriend is very anxious about the situation and I am very upset. I’ve never been so blatantly disrespected and I don’t feel comfortable in my own house. It’s not as easy kicking her out because she’s family, but I don’t know how to approach tomorrow morning, because we’re not okay with this and don’t know what to do.",19Jul2020,1

This has affected my sleep and i’m just afraid to be here. My parents won’t do anything about it, they just tell me to kill the bugs. 

I’m writing this right now at 4am as I have just killed a scary bug (i can’t even identify it) because it buzzed near my ear and the sound of it was terrifying and it keeps replaying in my head and i think i’m gonna cry. I think i have insomnia because of this",19Jul2020,1

Summer school in class history. I'm (16M) sitting in between my to boys, and diagonally behind me, there is Marissa 16F (made up name of course.. or is it?) I thought she seemed chill, she was cute as hell too.

But here's the thing she's from a rival school, biggest rivalry in the area (Calgary) so I'm let bet, I'ma pull some Romeo and Juliet shit, 

But that isn't the issue

The issue is I don't got the guts Romeo has and it's due to many reasons.

But here's the background, we've been talking the past few days, we both seem interested in each other. Our personalities match, hobbies and more.

So I was thinking bout asking her out, yet my main issue here is transportation. I sold my car recently (2016 civic) as I didn't need that new of a car and could use the extra cash. So I can drive but don't got a car, she has access to a car, but I don't want to leech a ride off something I invited her to. And we all know public transportation is just awkward and dirty now. 

The other issues, I'm a little bitch that is too scared to make a move aswell and I don't wanna screw things up

363,"My brother and I especially have been struggling with this since Covid started in the US. It feels like people we know and love are suddenly losing their marbles over the mask thing specifically. We’re religious and have gone to the same church since we were kids and it feels like these people that we’ve known most of our lives, who in the past have been 100% reasonable and kind and loving have all of a sudden turned into “anti-maskers.” We also live in the south (KY) so it’s super rampant around here. Someone literally hung an effigy of our governor with a noose in a tree on the capitol lawn during one of those “I want to get a haircut” protests a month or so ago. (And KY is one of the states that’s handled it the best so far.)

It just feels like a bunch of people I know and love are repeating the same “I don’t wanna wear a mask because of MUH RIGHTS” rhetoric. My dad is a pastor and he got a lot of hate for closing the church, 2 families left the congregation and someone told him how he was a sinner and a sheep and it feels like everyone is losing it. 

My boyfriend and best friend have health issues that make them not wear a mask so I’m not on the “wear a mask or I will personally manifest in your home and murder you” side of things. I understand that there are medical exemptions and that’s totally understandable. We also have a church family who have autistic kids and they can’t wear masks because of the sensory issue. I totally get that 

I just feel like within the population that is completely able to wear a mask but refuse to, the rationals (for everyone I’ve talked to) are 1) masks are the mark of the beast i eat essential oils in every meal and don’t vaccinate my kids or 2) I don’t want to and I don’t care about how my actions affect others. It feels like every conversation with that group ends up with me being like that meme “I don’t know how to make you care about other people”

It feels like a betrayal in a way, I guess? Like I’ve known these people for years and they’ve done incredibly kind things for me and others and then this happened and they show their “true selves.” But it’s SO MANY PEOPLE! Like if it was two or three of my friends I’d be like hm that sucks that it turns out these people think like this. But it is genuinely so many people I know and I just don’t get it.

367,"This is my 2nd attempt at writing this out. The 1st one was so full of grammatical errors and other issues I deleted it. I have some brain damage and it's very hard to write stuff out in full detail cause I miss so many words. Anyways

About 3 weeks ago I had ordered something pricey, that I have been a
wanting for about 2 months. I tracked it on usps tracking and since I live in an apartment building they are bad about delivering packages too large for the mailbox to the door and will take them back to the post office. I dont drive for obvious reasons so I cant get there. I went outside and waited for the postman to come. He pulled up and removed 3 packages from his back seat and put them in his trunk while he grabbed other mail. I walked up and asked told him I am expecting a box and i was concerned it was too big to fit. He said he didnt have anything that was too bug to fit that day. I spotted something I also ordered from amazon sitting there plus my box I was waiting for. The amazon package was on top of it on an angle. So I thanked him and walked away so he could do his thing.  

I waited for him to leave and retrieved my box from my mailbox locker. (a larger mailbox on the bottom they put a key in your box for) my amazon package wasnt there but it was marked as delivered. I still havent gotten the original package. He stole it and I know he did. Bastard. Keep reading. 

The same mailman is my best friends mailman. About 2 weeks later he had a bunch of very expensive items stolen. They were marked delivered but never were. The neighbors said they had been outside the entire day and say the postman came and he went to the box and left. A couple days later my friend was talking to his neighbors and the mailman came up to their complex mailboxes and the neighbors said he was the same guy who came that saturday,the day the packages were due and marked delivered. 

We reported him at seperate times and nothing was done. He is still out there stealing peoples mail. Os there anything else we can do?

my mum and sister are hard core manipulators, and impossible to be around 90% of the time (the other 10% is in public if i’m lucky) i often find it difficult to have any time go myself, without being yelled at or threatened. this means that over school breaks i make sure all of my time is working, and it’s meant i’ve had a lot of good work ethic and been liked by my bosses, as i’m “always available” and don’t rush out the door, and make sure i’m putting in 100% effort. 

i’m concerned when i move out next year, when i have a safe space to go back to after work and higher education, that i won’t have the same work ethic, and will begin to become “lazy”. did anyone else who left toxic households feel this way? i only stayed for “appearances” and to finish schooling as any form of housing in my area is constantly inflated. so the closer i get to the dorm halls of college the more nervous i get that i won’t consider work and education a priority (even though def care is, i just don’t know what that looks like in my world just yet)

Im 55 kilos and height is 5'3 BTW. in my country it is already called ""fat"" i understand the fact that im beautiful the way i am no matter what size but its hard because of people constantly judging me, calling me names and bullying me just because in their eyes im 'FAT' 

i also have stretch marks which even lowered my self esteemed. because of rapid weight loss and weight gain... i have a lot of stretch marks in my calfs and butt cheeks down to my thighs. when i say alot.. i meaaan like alooot
i tried putting some ointments, lotions and even therapy but I think its not even working  

eyebags because i can't sleep at night and mostly because of 2am breakdowns while comparing myself to other girls who look so perfect and wishing i was like them too. Girls with high metabolism are so damn lucky and not even care what they eat. 

i dont look good in mom jeans,sleeveless, croptops which most girls wear. honestly i don't look good in any clothes i wear or i just don't have any fashion sense 

to be honest the longer i see myself the more i hate it

 if i talked about this types of things to my sooo called friends they'll think im ""over dramatic"" that ""im just looking for attention"" and stuff... i don't really know if they ever see me as a true friend or not... that's why im reaching out to you people and get over this phrase

edit :
yes i tried exercising before it didn't work, guess i lack motivation or just lazy HAHA

Its.. Its what it says on the tin, really. I've been through multiple abusive relationships, and it feels like my friends no longer care about me anymore, like I'm old hat. I can't even really tell, because I've been so thoroughly screwed up through the years.

I've become unable to tell them how I feel or even able to speak, the spirit leaving me the moment I try to open my mouth. I've started talking to the doll, feeling like they're the only person who understands me. Even if they can't respond.

 I feel like I'm going insane, making up friends who can't leave me because I'm terrified that every single person I know will inevitably leave me. But the doll can't move, so they can't leave me. Right?

I feel like I'm snapping in half. My friend won't listen to me whenever I try to confess this to him. Whenever I try and tell him how much he means to me. Whenever I try and ask for help.

How do I know if I'm going insane, and how do I talk to him about feeling used and underappreciated?

Edit: I have no history of mental issues other than mild depression and autism, with a tinge of anxiety. No medications, since most of those can be managed well enough on their own most of the time. I'm also a young male adult.

Edit 2: I should note the doll is actually animatronic, but its also broken in such a way to where it can probably never move again without me fixing it. I do not keep batteries in it, and by all accounts, it should not be able to move.

Edit 3: I should also note that I had my childhood stolen from me by years of parental abuse and other situations and I struggle with having to be an adult daily, having been forced to be a miniature one as a child and never getting a chance to have the formative experiences that actually make one an adult.

384,"I (f20) got pretty drunk last night celebrating turning 21 in a couple of days and wanted to go out to meet a friend around midnight, I was too drunk to go out elsewhere and I wanted to go , got ready booked a taxi and my parents ended up like locking the house so I physically couldn’t leave, so I tried climbing through the window (something I do often when I’m locked out etc) . I was pretty loud during this whole process and obviously pissed everyone off , especially my dad who had work in the morning . I’ve reacted similar before (being loud /inconsiderate / stubborn) so understandably everyone is pissed and won’t talk to me. To add insult to injury (literally) my mum hurt her ankle a couple of days (yet won’t go to A&amp;E) ago , so hobbling after drunk me didn’t help much. 

My mum and dad do binge drink on a weekend together , so it’s not like they aren’t used to being drunk etc.

My parents are pretty overbearing and as much as I know they are looking out for me , they still kinda treat me like I’m 16 and have know where I am all the time and I feel like this was me reacting to that.  We do have a pretty good relationship and I know they are looking out for my best interests/safety but it is frustrating being told what to do like a child.

Clearly they were in the right here and I was just being a dick. They also have provided a home for me during my last year of university (graduated this summer) and don’t charge me for living there . I do work abt 30 hours week just as a bartender , so every argument comes down to ‘after everything I do for you’ . I offer to contribute to bills and tend to buy my own food  etc but we own the house so no rent &amp; they tend to refuse.

I didn’t drink crazy amounts ( I don’t think,maybe 200ml / 4 gin doubles and two glasses of wine), which for a night out doesn’t seem crazy to me. Drink clearly just makes me act weird and stubborn. Obviously an arsehole move and I was just clearly throwing my toys out the pram bc I didn’t wanna be told what to do.

Now for the actual question, I’m pretty insecure and so I unconsciously apologise for everything I do &amp; therefore the word  ‘sorry’ is kinda meaningless from me . My parents don’t appreciate me spending money on them bc they’d rather I save . How can I show I’m sorry and that I mean it in the short term w/out gifts or  a lengthy apology?? 

I know I need to work on my relationship with alcohol, I’m a small girl and I can’t drink much w/ out it affecting me. Obviously I’m also a bartender so alcohol plays a big role in my social life , like I’m 20 and I just finished uni . I tend to do a lot of daft things like this where I’ll put a pizza in the oven and fall asleep etc and I don’t want stuff like that to ruin my relationship with my family. Or order food and sleep etc.

Some details are going to be kept vague to avoid identifying me I'll clarify as much as I can if needed.  


So my grandmother acts without regards for others in a lot of situations to the rest of the family. She is around 80 years old. My mother is 55 and has health issues and she is generally non confrontational so she has vented to me about things told bellow but done nothing else on it. My sister moved out and avoids all contact with grandmother as much as she can. I still live with my mother and grandmother to help with the family business.

 If you tell her a story or something you did you are going to get an insult although it is masked as a joke by her followed by a light ha-ha-ha. If you call her out on it she either cries or doesn't talk to you for a day or sometimes simply says that's not what she said.  
If she doesn't have chores to do she complains that we don't let her do anything in the house and if we let her do something she complains how hard it is to do it.  
She loves talking to other family members but the talk generally ends in the same way if you tell her something with an insult.  
The worst part is if someone who is not family is around she acts like the sweetest grandma ever so no one who met her would believe us if we told them this story.  
We wanted her to see a psychologist with us to maybe get some help but she under no circumstances wants to go see a psychologist or anyone of the sort because she knows she is well.  


Recently my mother has gotten hospitalized for a relatively light issue but is away from home for two weeks and sadly things were going on as usual with grandmother she went on one of her I'm not talking streaks and I guess I've had enough and decided to not even try to speak with her until she starts talking again.  


So today I started wondering if what I'm doing is a childish way to deal with it and if there is something to do about this since at this point I honestly don't know how to deal with her without frustrating myself to please her",19Jul2020,3

388,"Hey guys, 

So I’ve been friends with, let’s call him Mike, for almost four years. Mike is overall a cool dude, we went on trips (traveled) together, went to the same college together, and just overall had a great relationship. My other friend, let’s call him Sean, is also really close with both of us. I’d say we’re the dynamic trio when it comes to activities and all sorts. Sean and I are very open when it comes to talking personal things because we trust each other, and will bring up personal details if needed, but Mike doesn’t. Mike is very secretive, and Sean and I have talked about this. Mike does not share a single glimpse of his personal life and up front told us he doesn’t trust us, even after all the experiences we’ve had. Each time Sean and I would attempt to ask him even what he did before hanging out, just even small things that don’t seem like a big deal, Mike would reply “its none of your business” or laugh it off or change the topic. Mike doesn’t even tell us why he can’t hop on to play video games with even a basic generic detail. It’s upsetting after all this time, I feel like Mike is truly a nobody, than a friend. Like Sean and I don’t truly know him as a person and we wish we did. Mike always avoids the discussion. Mike also up front told us he *insert group of friends here* trusts them more over us even after all Sean and I went through with him. Sean and I also think by assumption Mike does this either subconsciously or he is very insecure. Sean and I also think it’s pretty childish in a way like hiding your favorite toy from other kids.

How do you deal with a person like Mike? Is he really a friend? 

Tl;dr
My friend after 4 years admits he doesn’t trust me and my other friend at all and bluntly says to our face he trusts other people more than us. He doesn’t tell us anything about his life, even small details.",19Jul2020,1
389,"Hiya to anyone who may be awake. I quit my toxic job of 4 years back in March. I ended up being able to take some time off from work altogether and had a lot of time to reflect and think about what I want to do next. I’d been wanting to make a career change and decided on a certain career that I wanted to switch into. Apparently, it’s a pretty difficult field to get into, but even still I interviewed at a company this past Friday and received a job offer today. I had also interviewed for another job on Wednesday that pays quite a bit more, but it isn’t in the industry I want to be in and also has a pretty far commute. My dilemma is that I’m struggling to decide if I should stick with my original plan to go into the industry I’ve been wanting to get into at a lower starting pay (I would eventually work my way up to almost comparable pay as I’d get starting out at the other place) or if it would be wiser to just take the higher paying job with the longer commute. I don’t want to make a dumb decision and take the job in the industry that I want to be in with lower pay rather than the other job with higher pay, but I also want to ensure my mental health and overall happiness/fulfillment with my career. Does anyone have any experience with this type of situation? Any advice is appreciated.",19Jul2020,2
391,"Hi all, hopefully you can give me some insight here. A friend of mine and I are planning to move in together in early August. We're in our mid 20s and this'll be our first real rental outside of college. We're not trying to buy, just looking for something around 1,500 a month with 2 beds and 2 baths in ATX.

My soon to be roommate's friend recommended a local realtor she went to college with. We were scheduling viewings fine on our own till then, but since a couple of our friends went the realtor route and found success, we thought we would go and signed an agreement with her.

However, all that's changed now is that we go through the Keller Williams website's search engine instead of Zillow's, and we need to work around her schedule for our tours. I figured she would be able to negotiate rent prices or repairs, but today she told us she can't even request the owner repair the broken gate before move in.

We're both very new to this process, and maybe we didn't know what to expect, but is there some benefit that going through a realtor offers that searching on our own doesn't, or are we not asking the right questions? Any advice would be helpful!",19Jul2020,3
392,"This is hopefully going to be pretty short. 



In the past, caffeine has always genuinely made me tired. 

I'd like to preface this by saying that I struggle with severe anxiety as well as extreme paranoia, to the point of believing that loved ones have poisoned/spit in my drinks etc. I also have nighttime hallucinations sometimes where I see shadow people but none of this has been diagnosed because I'm very against seeing a therapist/psychologist for unrelated reasons. 

So at about... 12:00 AM, (it's 3:30 AM now) I decided to drink some coffee that is six years expired. Not brilliant, I know. After this, I took 130 mg caffeine from a different source. 

About twenty minutes later I started sweating profusely. Then I began to write, probably important to mention that I write often in my spare time. 

For about an hour and a half, I proceeded to write complete nonsense of about 3k words that made no sense whatsoever while shaking very much. I began to feel very nauseous and developed a rash on my right wrist as well, which has since gone away. 

At about 2:00 AM I came upstairs, extremely hyperactive and agitated planning to exercise for some reason and I am still exercising but it's not going very well, I still feel very nauseous and both of my legs are shaking very very much as well as my left arm and I have no control over this. I cannot exercise because I am shaking too much and I have no strength. 

About thirty minutes ago, I happened to come across an album cover for a popular band and started seeing eyes where there were no eyes. I have since stopped exercising and am not quite sure what to do.

Please help me, don't suggest doctors or psychiatric help because those responses will be ignored

393,"   Throwaway account.  
 To begin, medical weed is legal, and recreational weed is decriminalized. But, if you have a certain type of amount you can get fined. I always have the lower amount and I'm safe with it.  
I am 20 years old, I recently moved back with my parent to finish my last semester of college. She said it was okay, and I did. Now today, my girlfriend (she spends the night sometimes.)  found that the bag of weed is gone. Now its strange because we both smelled it in the morning, its pretty loud inside the car. We had to go to the store in the morning, bought a pizza then went back. I told my mother to tell me when the oven beeped if she didn't mind. She never did (she usually does), and we heard the door open/close. I didn't see her for a few moments, until I came out of my room again and saw her. I forgot my shorts in the car (Got it from girlfriends house, forgot it in the back.), I saw that the Grinder was out away from my bag (The bag I keep my weed in), I found it odd but put it back. I usually put it back or my girlfriend double checks for me and does. Anyways, we wanted to smoke tonight. (We smoke at night ONLY in my car, always on the weekend. We also make sure we don't smell like it.) My mother is a deep sleeper, and we stay quiet whenever coming back. But this time we didn't find it. And we looked around and it was no where. My mother also asked me a weird question about my car later on the day once she came back. I'm not mad, but disappointed. Also she snooped in my car. But she lets my older brother do whatever he wants, yet whenever it comes to me she's always suspicious. Yet I honestly don't do anything, I get good grades in school, and I keep up with everything. I just want advice what to do. I feel like this is a trap for my mother to admit I smoke weed, yet she did it when she was younger as well. And she's fine with marijuana being legal, and etc. I won't confront her, but I just want to know why.   
More context: My family is huge alcoholics, she gets drunk every night. Sometimes aggressive but I just take it, and I make sure she's okay. Been this way my whole life, but she always tries to find a problem with me and always wants to control me. When my older brother can drink, and fuck up in college. I'm on the other hand, have mostly A's and B's. I passed all of my certs, besides one which I didn't need. Also any questions about my girlfriend, she is going to college as well. I hope I don't seem like I'm complaining much, thank you for reading though!",19Jul2020,1
394,Had to move home from college and quit my job. My day consist of basically nothing. I stay up all night watching tv and sleep till 2 or 3 pm dread anything work related. Anything and everything seems like it’s not worth doing or boring. What should I do?,19Jul2020,3
395,"Hello everyone! I’m 18(F) I recently moved to South Carolina under the intent that “We had better support out here” but I believe it was for other reasons here’s why. It’s gonna be lengthy, not to long but I promise it’s worth it. :( :( :( 

I’m original from another state (which I prefer not to state) We Up rooted my whole family and moved to South Carolina not to long along (Me, my mom, stepdad, and my siblings) which to my understanding was because we’ll have better support out here (From my stepdads family) since we have none back home. My mom and step dad are currently going through a nasty divorce right now but that’s another story for another day. The whole point of this is because I found out my mom has interest in someone else that she met OVER TWITTER. She’d bring up him up every once in a while before we moved but I never thought to much about it.
LETS FAST FORWARD TO WHEN WE MOVED 

Ever since shes gotten this Twitter account that’s all she ever talks about, Shes always in her phone more then she Has EVER BEEN. Apparently she met this guy on Twitter she always talks about him and come to find out he ALSO lives in South Carolina. Apparently he lives 10-15 mintues away but he’s BARELY Around, if anything if seen him only a maximum of 4 times out of the MONTHS we’ve been living here and out of 1 of those times IVE SEEN she has given him money THAT WE DONT HAVE. This is the second time it’s happened but the first time I’ve actually been there when it Happened, the other time I’ve heard her say it otp with her “Twitter friends”. This is only twice that I KNOW of but i know for a facts it’s been more times then that. I’ve brought it to her attention she just lied and got so defensive when I literally KNOW she gave him a large amount of money, Which leads me to believe he’s just using her. 


She say they’ve been together for an YEAR (Long distance) but I think he’s just using her and she’s letting it happen because she really likes him. With her REALLY liking him it leads me to believe we didn’t move here for “Support” we moved here so she can be closer to him. When she’s otp with her “Twitter Friends” I hear her saying how there gonna move in together and how he’s in this gang and that gang and trying to transition from the streets to a family man but I really doubt thats the case I STRONGLY believe he’s using her. 


Now I know this may be wrong but, I’ve went through some of their messages ON Twitter they’re NEVER otp there never on a video call they don’t even have each other’s phone numbers to text on there. it’s more so her typing more and being more affectionate. For example she says “I love you “ and he says “I ❤️ u” or simply just puts hearts. And she’s always telling him she wants a baby with him so they can be locked in forever (Her exact words). I just don’t know what to do anymore, even besides him she’s always on her phone always on Twitter. Everything is about Twitter. 

She always mentions how he’s gonna come over, Etc etc but he never does he just sends her off. She makes it seem like he’s giving us money or doing thing for us but it’s really her, for example my stepdad gave her $100 cash. that same night she went to the store ACTED as if he met her there( which I know he didn’t because I was watching it messages from another phone that she left her account logged in and she was texting him) she came back and said “ here he wanted me to give you $50 for your hair” I knew it was from her and not him so I just said thanks and sat it on the counter. 

The next morning I went and looked and it was gone. So it’s like she’s doing these things and making it seem as if it was him just to get me to believe everything but I won’t fall into the trap. She also does that with him she always tells him that I’m always asking when he’s coming over and I miss him Etc etc BUT I NEVER DO I DONT EVEN KNOW THIS MAN. 

She’s missing 10,000 red flags and she doesn’t she it because she’s stuck in the fantasy land BUT I DO. All in all I just blame myself for this because I introduced this app to her now it’s fucked over my life and has taken over hers and I don’t know what to do because shes my mom and I don’t want her to take it the wrong way if I FULLY bought any of this to her attention. It’s way more to the story and that goes deeper into my life and I rather not. 

If you guys can give me ANY advice on what I should do it would be extremely helpful😔❤️",19Jul2020,2
396,"When I was 15 years old I was sent to a psychiatric hospital for the first time because I told my chorus teacher I was gonna kill myself. The school counsel or told my mom that CPS would get involved if she didn’t take me to the hospital recommended. That hospital was the worse place I’d ever been and made me 10x worse than I was before. But now I was medicated. So I started gaining weight pretty rapidly. Going from barely 100 pounds to now 235 (from the last time I weighed myself months ago) all in the time span of 4 years. I started getting therapy and psychiatric treatment and was prescribed Zoloft. I took Zoloft for a couple months until I was hospitalised again for another threat of suicide, basically begging for help and answers. This time to a new hospital, one I liked the environment of but treatment was shit. Spent another week there I was diagnosed with more shit and given more pills. Prozac, Atavan, and some kind of sleeping pill. 

At 17 I had missed a lot of school because my ex was harassing me and sending around nude photos of me from ages 14-17 and eventually was given an ultimatum from my schools principals. Drop out or they kick me out. Obviously my mom chose drop out and so did I. 

Christmas 2018 rolled around and my grandparents who were never in my life or my mothers came to visit. They offered to let me “stay” with them for a while in the state they lived in. I thought of it as an amazing thing. New environment. New state. New life. No one would know who I was there. They wouldn’t know the rumours spread about me. Living with people in their 70’s is way more different than living with people in their 50’s. You’d think old is old until you live the change. My grandfather is a mentally ill man who served in the marines in Vietnam. He has PTSD, Parkinson’s, and Bipolar disorder. He is also addicted to pain killers and alcohol and often mixes the two. My step grandmother is a narcissist who is only ever been into my grandfather for the money he was given through the VA and state. I quickly learned how unstable that side of the family was. My grandfather soon became belligerent and unreasonable. Calling my mother drunk, cussing at her and saying horrible things for no reason. My mom then took that out on me and stopped talking to me for two days. Later on that same week my grandfather threw something at me. To be honest it was either a clock or a toaster I genuinely don’t know. About a week later he snapped and woke my step grandmother up while he screamed at her about me living there. He then slammed their door and walked up the stairs toward my room and I woke up to ask if he was ok and he told me to “Fuck off, shut up, and go to bed.” Around 6 that morning he woke up me grabbing me and yelling at me that my step grandmother was gone and it was my fault. He handed me a folded, wet note. It was a pity party in a paragraph. My step grandmother talked about how she tried everything she could to help both of us and she just wasn’t “enough”. The paper had holes in it from the tears soaking through and making the paper weak. It looked like suicide note. Calling her phone lead to the Bluetooth linked landline to ring, that told me she or her phone was still at home. After a couple calls she answered saying she was downstairs in the guest room. Going down their she seemed unphased, reading a book on her tablet. 

About a month or so later my grandfather snapped again but at me more so than last time. He stormed into the house and demanded my cell phone, a phone he did not pay for in any way. I refused and he ran at me. This lasted for about 10 minutes before he got tired and guarded the room I was in so I couldn’t leave. I called my mom who never answered then my dad who told me nothing could be done and I couldn’t be picked up because it was about a 3 hour drive. My mom finally called back and said the same. I was stuck. I was trapped in this house with a man who was unpredictable. I was terrified. He’s proved his violent tendencies and how he is very willing to hurt those who love him. 

About an hour later I was upstairs finally with my step grandmother (who watched the entire ordeal while reading a book calmly.) she was helping me pack my bags and was telling me she would take me home. My grandfather soon came upstairs. Babbling and sobbing like a child. He was stuttering and unable to form even one word. I fell for his tricks. I allowed myself to be manipulated once again, this time by a man who was over 70 years old. I was not his first victim and I will never be his last. This man has manipulated everyone he’s ever met. He cried to me on how he was going to kill himself and run away. Like an absolute fool. I believed him and cared. My step grandmother and him, now, very obviously planned this. She started crying and told me “I couldn’t do this to him.” And told me that she didn’t feel safe leaving him alone while she drove me back to my home state. So once again I had a small taste of freedom and it was taken from me. 

March came around. I found an excuse to go home. Saint Patrick’s Day. The day after I got home my mom took me for lunch. I cried to her in the diner that I never wanted to go back and I never wanted to see them again. I told her everything that had happened to me and she showed remorse and guilt. She told my step grandmother I wouldn’t be going back. My step mother replied bringing up the gift they had bought me a bit before I went home. A car. A 2015(?) jeep renegade. It cost my grandpa 15,000 USD. He paid in cash. No loan, his own money from his bank account. They said they would sell the car but my mom argued that they had already put the car in her name. 

April. I attempted to kill myself and was hospitalised for the last time as a minor. My mother grew cold towards me and stopped treating me like her own. I suddenly became a burden. At least that’s how I started being treated. 

May. My 18th birthday. No card. No call. Silence. A couple days after we got a letter in the mail. My grandpa is suing us for 15,000 USD. For the car. 


Now. I’m 19 and my family has turned against for good. I’ve never been the perfect kid but I guess all the drama that came with every stage of my life got too much for them. I no longer have a therapist as she was telling my mom to kick me out and also was informing her on certain topics I was talking about. Nothing that needed to be told. Every other therapist I’ve tried to see says they don’t feel comfortable talking to me through zoom and would like to wait until their office could open. So I do nothing. I sit at home. I’m 19 years old. A high school drop out. And a disappointment. My family and I constantly argue. They all hate me. My sister (26) still lives at home. She threatens me with violence almost daily. If she isn’t out all day with friends drinking. I am LGBT and living in a southern, conservative, republican house. I am mentally ill, living in this house. I am hated. I will bawl my eyes out to my mom who will laugh and roll her eyes and tell me I’m “wrong”. What am I wrong about? My feelings. Me feeling like they all hate me is “wrong”. When I talk to people I meet online I’m ridiculed by my parents because they’re just “freaks online who know nothing about me or anything” but I can’t find a therapist and I can’t talk to family. I have a screenshot of me pouring my heart out to my mom just for me to be ignored for an hour. Then she finally responds and asks me if our air unit is working. Completely disregarding me and my concerns. 

I’m writing this all out to you because a friend suggested it. I don’t know if anything will come to this. I’ve left stuff out I know but it’s very hard to put together all or this at 4:44 am. If needed, I will clarify certain things. Thank you in advance.

401,"So I’ve been entertaining myself using my phone or my laptop for the majority of lockdown. The only time when I’m not on a device is when I go out for my (sometimes) daily walk that lasts from 30 mins - 1 hour. Then as soon as I’m back home I’m back on my phone again.

However recently I’ve just been having normal non-digital fun with friends and I guess I’m starting to realise I’m getting bored of the internet. Shocking, I know, but apparently possible. The same kind of enjoyment I felt before just isn’t there, it just feels like I’ve got some kind of boring addiction (which I suppose I probably do). Even watching YouTube seems like a chore. 

Yet because I rely on the constant stimulation of the internet or games, I’m very used to it. My hobbies outside of this sphere include: books, art, crafts, writing, sewing and exercise. 

It’s irritating because whenever I get off my phone it’s like my brain is itching for something more exciting and life without it seems dull. Even when I work out I can rarely stick to a routine. My focus is awful. 

I can turn my phone off and put it in another room, it’s just how dull reality is that gets me and eventually brings me back to my phone. 

It’s also hard because when I’m off my phone, I’ll just think for way too long. I’m prone to ruminating on things and upsetting myself in the process. Or when I’m not on it, I’ll either nap, eat or masturbate because literally any other activity feels like too much. 

I can’t distract myself without it, it’s like a safety blanket for me and I can’t seem to find a good replacement. 

I have cut down on my phone usage before (down to about 2 hours a day). It didn’t stick. I went cold turkey (didn’t work). Nothing lasts. They say to break a bad habit you need to replace it with a good one, but there’s nothing good I can replace it with. 

This sounds like a very generational problem I know. But how do I start finding enjoyment in my life without turning to technology?",19Jul2020,2

I really want to move out with my 2 best friends. I'm in college, I'm young, things are great for me right now, I'd be close to campus. I lived on campus last year and my parents paid for it, and moved back home due to corona.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been hell. Some weeks definitely worse than others. Multiple fights every day, my mom is a narcissist and my dad is borderline a sociopath. They belittle me, don't respect my time, and often the house is exploding in an argument. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad has graciously agreed to pay for 450 a month for nine months a year to live anywhere. This is because I have a full scholarship to my school and that's what they would pay to live on campus anyways, so they are letting me choose where to live (living on campus will be a wreck with coronavirus and I don't want them to shut down school again).

&amp;#x200B;

I found a beautiful apartment to move out into, 450 a month each including utilities, really a steal for where i'm looking. I would only have to pay for rent in the summer (\~1350 for the entire summer). Great! I make around 1500 a semester with my research job and have made \~3000 this summer. That means I'll spend around a fifth of my income on rent, and with a grocery budget of 100 a month, I'll be in great shape. I hope to save around 40% of my income, and spend the rest if needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, my dad likes to hold money over my head. He says if I stay home, commute 40 mins to school every day, eat the groceries they provide, He will pay that 450 a month to stay, a 5000 dollar net gain (with groceries)... sounds golden, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Am I stupid not to take the offer??? I just feel that I'm going to absolutely hate it. I hated it in highschool, I hated it over summers, I can't concentrate now, and idk if it's because corona that I'm unhappy, or if it's because I'm here. Is my sanity worth 33% of my salary???

412,"I feel like this needs a bit more backstory behind it but I'm really stuck on what to do. 

I'm 17F and my friend is also 17M (Sid), we both have mental health issues although his are different and can cause major issues for us both. He's diagnosed with multiple personality disorder, and he knows I would stand by him through it all, despite some of his personalities setting off my PTSD etc. 

Once schools closed and lockdown started things started to go downhill, it was fine at first but then Sid's mental health started to decline (mine as well but I just wanted to help him) eventually he basically stopped answering me, for nearly 3 months he barely spoke to me, took hours to answer my messages, always said no when I asked to call or socially distanced meet up (he said his parents wouldn't let him out yet). After a while it really started to upset me, I just felt so unwanted.

I kept trying to keep our relationship for a while longer and then another friend who I had spoken to about the issue messaged me and said she had just seen Sid out with another friend (Sara) which meant he had been lying to me. I decided to message him just to tell him he never had to lie to me, which at the start was fine. He said socially distancing with me would be too hard because he misses me so much (I'm really strict on the rules because my mum is at risk). The conversation eventually turned into an argument because I explained he was just making me feel really rubbish and he started to gaslight me about how he's got all these problems I don't know about and I just told him so do I. After, I told him I wasn't answering him anymore because he was upsetting me right now, he sent me a long message basically saying all the reasons Sara was better than me and poking at all my insecurities. I decided to block him on Snapchat once id sent him a long message explaining that I needed time to myself. 

Looking back he didn't treat me the best throughout our whole friendship. He never let me discuss my problems and would always gaslight me or make it about him, and I couldn't tell him he'd upset me without him getting angry it was always his fault. I always ignored issues because I knew he had problems. 

The issue is. He owes me nearly £70 for various things throughout our friendship, I don't know if I should ask for it because I know it'll cause a lot of drama. But £70 is a lot of money especially for someone my age. And I really don't know what to do ?",19Jul2020,1

I won’t go into too much detail about myself- I’m a teenage girl who is a lesbian, I’ve got a step brother (I’ll just be referring to him as Brother though) who’s the same age as me. We’re really close and like best friends. That’s really all you need to know! 

Alright. About 1 year ago, my brother had his nudes leaked. Yikes. A girl in our class attempted to blackmail him and get hundreds of dollars off him to take the pics down. She also happened to put them in the worst place- her Instagram story. We had a class chat and she mentioned being hacked, so I popped over to her insta story to see if anything was there- boom. My brothers... dick. First of all: HES MY BROTHER. That immediately disgusted me. Secondly, I’m a lesbian who has always been pretty grossed out by penis stuff, so that amplified the grossness. It was a really upsetting experience, especially for my brother. It all got sorted out after a bit, police were involved (as he was a minor) but it still kinda haunts me, I guess? 

I now find myself feeling sick to my stomach at the thought of a penis. Anything mentioning them makes me feel ill. Sometimes I find it hard to sleep just thinking about everything that happened that night, it was around 4 am when it all happened and I was just a kid who never thought this kind of thing would happen to someone I cared about.

I have no therapist or counsellor to ask, but I just want advice. Is what I’m experiencing trauma, or just unpleasant memories? I know dicks are sorta a part of life, and I hate being absolutely repulsed by them. I don’t want to assume it’s trauma because 
1. I’m definitely not educated on the front of trauma!
2. I don’t want to be the stereotype teen girl who claims to have “depression and trauma and anxiety” and etc for attention while being perfectly fine! (I do get that there obviously are actual teen girls with depression and trauma and anxiety though haha)

If it is trauma, what do I do next? I feel so lost- I thought over a year after all of that happened I’d be over it or something, especially since the main awful things didn’t even happen to me.

Edit: thank you for letting me know it’s not trauma! I actually feel a lot better now. I’m very glad I didn’t assume anything and came here for advice first. 
Have a wonderful day, everyone! &lt;3",19Jul2020,1

I’ve been seeing her since but due to outspoken racism by my parents, I chose to hide my relationship for about 5 months until it recently came to light. Ever since my mom does not allow me to leave the house without messaging me, when she knows I’m with my girlfriend especially during the night she calls and messages me non stop. She has threatened to harm herself and has even told me that I’ve been causing her major health issues which may or may not be true (I don’t know what is true at this point). She claims I ruined her family and that my siblings and dad also hate what I am doing as I will disgrace the family by bringing in someone who is black despite her being carribean too. Recently I told them about my mental health and what her words mean as she told me not to come to her funeral and threatens to disown me and things were better. However they started up again when she starts to ignore me and the rest of my family when I go out with my girlfriend and she knows about it. She continues to tell me that I don’t care about her and that I should tell her I don’t want her in my life anymore. Today I watched her hit herself repeatedly and slam the back of her head on the wall. I feel broken while choosing between two people I love and I can never understand how an ethnicity has this effect on my mom. My head hurts and I know harming oneself is not a healthy coping mechanism but I now understand why people do it. Frustration and anger are building up and although I love my mom and family I am starting to resent them which hurts me even more. I sometimes feel like isolating myself from everyone as I feel like a burden and a disappointment to everyone. Tbh I don’t know what I feel all I know is that I’m hurt and emotionally destroyed.

429,"Hey everyone.

I (21/M) have just been talking with my girlfriend (21/F)  about our relationship to try and hash some problems out. Been together 3 years now, and we are going through a rough patch, and tonight I decided we'd talk about it.


Most of our relationship is fine, I can deal with those things without advice. The things I need advice with is her relationship with her friends.

My girlfriend and I were never part of the same friend group, and if Im honest I think they're kind of a sucky group of girls anyway. But tonight she bought up how she feels like a loner with her friends, because they always hang but never ask to take out my girlfriend.

I have bad anxiety myself, so I understand how difficult reaching out and organising a hang can be. I tell her that she is always welcome to hang with my friends, because they all really like her, but I think that she really wants that girly kind of friendship, which my mates (who are mostly men) don't offer.

Tonight I messaged a few of the friends telling them shes dealing with anxiety, and feels left out a lot of the time. So Im hoping (but not expecting) they will ask her out to hang. I carefully worded it and I thibk it was the right thing. But I dont know how to get her to either meet new friends, or be more out going etc. But I feel like she doesn't take mt advice, and doesn't want to change anything becaus of her issues with anxiety.. 

I guess im just wanting to know,

My mother constantly reminds me of how I need to get a 4.0 GPA every time. To ensure that happens, I mostly study the entire day during my exams.

I don't ask her to do anything specifically for me. It has been more than a week, and whenever I go to eat food with them, she stresses me out really badly by complaining about my behavior. She asks me what is this study that takes your entire day. Sometimes, she compares me with my cousins as to how helping they are in comparison. At other times, with my siblings.

Then, she constantly bombards me with the fact how my face is small and thin. It is not, in fact, I get complimented quite a lot on my facial features and my body structure. She constantly body shames and compares me with her old self(when she was of my age). She tells me how much more beautiful.

I was holding it all in till today, when I burst up in front of everyone. I reminded her how I had a talk with her prior to my exams regarding this. In response, she said that she never asks me to help her with anything(which is not true, as you can see from the complaining above).

Honestly, I am starting to develop immense hatred for her and myself. I was a fairly confident person, and now I hate my looks even though there is nothing to be hated. I can't look at myself in the mirror. I cannot dress(modestly) according to my choice.

I don't know what to do. Also, I cannot move out until 2 years when I will finally leave for higher studies \*hopefully, forever\*

We also used to chat a lot during that period. After we finished high school we didn't chat at all. I didn't want to bother her because she was preparing for college and I did as well, so I didn't want to distract her and myself. After we joined college we exchanged a couple of texts about joining college went and for the next 3-4 months we didn't hear from each other(to make things clear, we were not that close, so it is not big surprise). When we started college I contacted her to see how she is doing and until New Year we didn't talk/text. At New Year's eve I wished her all the best and she appreciated it. Then next 2 months we texted a little. I was not the one who needed to reach out first all the time. She did it as well. I was planing to invite her to see each other and catch up, but we went into quarantine. She invited me to play some video games with her and her friends during quarantine and it was fun. Then one day she randomly texts me and says that she had an situation which reminded her of me. 1 month forward and we are here. We texted about our finals and I mentioned when mine final exam is. Night after exam day she randomly texted me with wishing me good luck. I was shocked. She remembered that date (which I told her 15 days before). After that my birthday came. All of my friend wished me all the best vie text, but she knew that I like programming and made effort to code custom birthday wish for me.

434," TL;DR: My 13 year old bestie, who gets influenced VERY easily, said to our best friend group that she likes vaping and that she will probably start vaping whenever she gets the chance to. She wants to buy a vape when she turns 15 and this has made me and our other bestie really concerned.

To start with, we are a best friend group which consists of 3 girls, me (15) and other the 2 girls (13 and 14).

I am strongly bonded with my 13yo bestie because we both know each other for more than 8 years. My 13yo bestie looks A LOT more older than her age. She acts and looks like a 16 year old girl. This is why we are so close together even tho our 2 year age gap.

Her parents divorced when she was just 7 years old. Her mom is a nurse so some days of the week she is on duty and is not home. Her father has moved out to London. She gets influenced VERY easily by others. She does stuff that she is not allowed to such as inviting friends over when her mom is not home etc.

Her mom is smoking but she used to vape a few years ago. Her mom has hid the vape somewhere in the basement. Somehow, my bestie found it out and when her mom was not home, she would start vaping. A few days ago, my bestie accidently dissasembled the vape, and cant fix it. She said to us that in 2-3 years she will go and buy her own vape.

Me and our other 14yo bestie, dont agree with that. You know how it goes. First you vape, then you want more and more. Then you are curious to try smoking normal cigarettes. And without reallising, you are addicted to nicotine.

Today, she invited her boyfriend (16) in her home. He brought with him an Electronic cigarette and she sent us a video in the group chat of them vaping. Her mom wasn't home.

**What I need help for is that, I don't know what to do as her best friend. Should I explain her that she is way too young to vape and try to change her mind OR should I just let it be? Maybe am overeacting and it's not such a big deal? What would you do in my situation?**",19Jul2020,1

Yesterday was the first time in a while I've been out drinking with friends since lockdown began and so was a pretty awesome day, but when I got home (pretty late) I wasn't tired and I thought, oh you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to head to Omegle (lol) because I remember that site from years earlier and I was more curious to see what it was like now than anything else. I'm definitely not the kind of girl to do anything on it, fyi - but I do like talking to people from all walks of life and alcohol gives me more confidence to.

So I log on and all is fine at first, lot of expected d-cks but nothing too surprising, have a quick few conversations with a group of girls about how quarantine has been for them in the USA and move on, and then I get placed with this one dude. We say a few words and I ask, ""how old are you?"" and he tells me ""how old do you think I am?"", I said, ""I have absolutely no idea - I'd guess nineteen"", he says, ""No I'm fourteen"" - I said ""You should be careful on here - lots of scary things that can stick with you when you're that young"" and then he says, ""why how old are you?"", I said, ""I'm 24"", and he just kind-of stared quite furious almost at me. And then he said, ""No, you're part of the problem, pervert. What a pervert. You're a pervert"". I was so stunned I kinda just ... didn't reply and then he left the chat. But he reiterated a few times how much a pervert I was.

449,"Hey guys, I’m struggling here. I’m going through a custody suit with my son’s dad over our 1 year old and I’m so scared of what’s to come. Any advice/inspiration would be so appreciated. 

Backstory:
I met my son’s dad through mutual friends a couple of years ago. We got to know each other slowly over a couple of months and little by little we just clicked. Once we did, we were inseparable. He was saying things like he knew I was meant to be in his life forever and that no matter what happened between us, I changed his life for the better. One night, as things were heating up between us, we were hanging out with friends and one asked him about Katie. He brushed off the question and didn’t answer. When we were alone later that night, I also asked him about Katie. I was told that Katie was his ex-fiancée. She’s still in his life because they had been friends for a decade but he was definitely single and interested in only me. I was convinced...for a while. At one point, he changed his social media profile picture to a picture of them. I took a screenshot and sent it to him like “cool, guess she’s more than a friend again?” He assured me she wasn’t. It was their first picture together 10 years ago, he said, (the picture was clearly older) and she was going through a hard time and he wanted to remind her that she had people in her life that have been in her corner from day one but that I didn’t need to worry because I was the one he wanted and he was too old to be playing games. If he wanted to be with someone else, he would be. He wouldn’t be wasting either of our time. I didn’t talk to him for a week but he was persistent in convincing me that things between them were over and that he wanted to pursue things with me. He even took down his profile picture. I was convinced.

I’ll fast forward but I wanted to set the scene that I was thoroughly convinced that this man was pursuing me, whether he actually was or not. I had suspicions about Katie, but every time I asked, he gave me an answer I believed. It didn’t take long - a couple of months from the time we started exploring being more than friends - for me to find out I was pregnant. Before you get judgmental, yes, I was on birth control. I also had been diagnosed with PCOS several years earlier and was truly, truly convinced I could not get pregnant. I had been engaged to someone else a few years prior and he and I had tried for 2 years to get pregnant, with no success. So to say I was shocked is an understatement. I told dad 2 days after I found out. But things had already grown complicated between us. The week I found out I was pregnant, dad told me that Katie was going to be moving into his spare bedroom. She needed help. But things between us didn’t need to end. I asked if he was going to get back together with her and he said maybe but that he wanted to see if things between us worked out first. So this is the timeline of how things went:

Wednesday - dad tells me Katie is moving in. 
Friday - I sleepover at dad’s house. 
Saturday - I find out I’m pregnant. 
Tuesday - I tell dad I’m pregnant. 
Next Friday - Katie moves in. 

Those few weeks were a whirlwind. When I told dad I was pregnant, he started to cry. Then began the intense pressure to get an abortion. It lasted for weeks. Let me say that I am pro-choice but supporting a woman’s right to choose and making that choice are completely different things. I understood the realities of having a baby with not only a man that didn’t want it but also who, it was becoming clear, didn’t want me. To add insult to injury, about 10 weeks into my pregnancy, dad tells me he is getting back together with Katie. He tells me I can keep the baby if I want, but he has no plans to be a father so to understand that while I’m deciding what to do. I do ultimately decide to keep the baby - I am educated, stable, well-paying job, own a home. I could do this. 

Dad and I didn’t talk for a while but eventually, he got curious about the baby. I was about 6 months pregnant and he and I and Katie all ended up at the same social event. At this point, I was completely hiding dad’s identity. Only dad and I knew the truth. He introduced me to Katie and neither one of us said anything about him being my baby’s dad. After that, he started reaching out to me. Asking if I was ok. Apologizing for his behavior. Shortly before my son was born, he told me that he wanted to be a father. He said it would be complicated for a while but to trust him because he promised that, no matter what, he wouldn’t let his son grow up in a bad situation. Even if that meant leaving Katie. 

So the baby is born and dad and I are on friendly terms for a while. His identity is still a secret to everyone but us, at his request. He starts to say things about how his relationship is suffering and how he doesn’t want to announce the baby before he decides what to do about his relationship because why rock the boat more than it needs to be if he’s going to leave Katie anyway. I let that slide for a few weeks. At the same time, he’s starting to try to pursue things with me again. I indulge it more than I should have. But I was lonely and scared with a newborn by myself.  But it was all talk. We texted all day everyday but he never came to see us or meet the baby or pay any child support, despite his promises to do so. After a while, I lose my patience. I told him to either step up or leave us alone. If he was going to leave Katie, leave her. If he was going to stay, stop flirting with me. If he was going to be a dad, be a dad. The next morning, I get a call from Katie. 

Here is what I learned in that call - and over the following weeks. He and Katie were never broken up. He made up wild lies about me and about us to explain how I ended up pregnant and why we hid the pregnancy and the baby (including that I knew about his relationship status the entire time). He was going to let Katie tell him if, when, and how he was going to be a dad. Katie believed she could say and do whatever she wanted to me because I deserved it after what I did to her (she blamed me for not telling her when we met while I was pregnant). And she was saying and doing awful things. Things that put me in fear of the safety of me and my son. Dad participated. I honestly can’t tell you who was most mad in this situation. Emotions were high. I said and did things I regret. We all did. Dad and Katie disappear for a couple months and, honestly, I’m relieved. 

During this time, I sporadically reach out to dad and offer to get a parenting agreement in place. I tell him our son deserves for us to act like adults, regardless of how we feel personally about each other. The requests are ignored for a while but eventually dad agrees to meet with me as long as Katie can come too. She had decided to stay but she was still angry. She spent the entire meeting telling me about all my boundaries with her fiancée and how she wanted to raise my baby. For my son’s sake, I was humble and cooperative. I agreed to all her boundaries and told her she would be welcomed into my son’s life. 

We leave the meeting and I don’t hear from them again for almost a month. It turns out Katie wasn’t sure that she could be around my baby. She was going to stay with dad but she wasn’t sure she was going to let him be a dad because it was really hard seeing me and being reminded of what he did to her.  

Fast forward - we eventually begin visitations but I’m cautious. Katie has temper issues and she and dad seem all too comfortable with walking in and out of my son’s life. Unsurprisingly, Katie gets angry one night when she feels dad and I are getting along too well and makes dad cut off contact with me again. For months. But it was different this time because I wasn’t reaching out anymore. If he wanted to walk away from his son, fine. I wasn’t going to chase him. He had never paid a cent of child support so I didn’t need him for that. And my son didn’t need the instability. Well, then dad’s parents get involved (they’re religious) and pressure dad to step up. The only way he’s allowed to do this, per Katie, is to pursue joint custody because she wanted this baby to be as much hers as it was mine. Because she was the one who was supposed to make dad a father. (This is not all just speculation. These are literally things she said to me). 

That brings us to today. We are in the middle of a custody battle. It’s so dumb. I’m not fighting visitation at all. I have offered it liberally. I know that if dad is consistent, it’s in my son’s best interest to have him around. But he is dead set on joint custody. And on top of that, he’s now spinning the tale that he *had* to take me to court to see his son because I cut off contact with him and was keeping the baby from him. This man has - by his choice - seen his baby 5 times, total, in 2020. I have never said no when he’s asked. But Katie is still uncomfortable with the situation because they have to see me to see the baby and she gets no say in decisions. He thinks it’ll be different when he has joint custody. Oh, and he and Katie have since gotten married. No, my son was not included in the wedding. And he wasn’t invited to meet his family while they were all in town. Most still don’t even know he exists. 

For the record, there has never been fighting in front of the baby. At the very least, for all our shortcomings, the adults in his life have managed to respect that boundary. Also for the record, Dad and I have no semblance of a romantic relationship anymore. We actually get along just fine when we talk in person but he has to run all texts and emails through Katie before he can respond and has to take all calls while she’s around and they have to be on speaker. So things stay tense and I feel like they’re always one step away from erupting, which they do from time to time (over the simplest things). 

So my question is, how do I co-parent in this toxic environment?",19Jul2020,1
450,"I'll just be totally blunt and honest and say I hate a lot of what's popular today. I wish I didn't so I'd actually have ways to connect with people and maybe someone my own age would even be aware of what I was into, but this isn't the case. 90% of new music I come across is god awful, I love sitcoms but only the old ones are funny, most new TV shows and movies I see suck. 

I've been called a goody-two-shoes, a prude, boring, etc. I might be, but I hate the way people are shallow and ignorant, and I think that's worse. People preach positivity and acceptance nowadays, but I feel like I'm always judged for how I look - I don't wear makeup, I don't do much with my hair, I have a very basic wardrobe. And I do feel judged for it.

I guess I'm a bit judgmental too. It doesn't take much for me to drop someone. I don't want to associate with people who are vulgar, dress revealing, do drugs/drink alcohol, are sexually promiscuous...all of which seems to be huge with people my age (20). Right or wrong, I just can't overlook stuff like that and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. It's a contributing factor to why my best friend and I, who I've known since I was 13, drifted apart. She's done all of the above and I just can't deal with it. I hate that every time I try to connect with someone, I can't and wind up feeling like I'm the weird one. I get that I am, but I'm tired of feeling that way, and it's just made me angry and bitter.

Is it me? What's wrong with me?",19Jul2020,44

457,"Hello everyone I think I am in a toxic relationship with a friend. Unfortunately he lives quite close (legit 1min away, around the corner) so I kinda feel nervous about ending it directly, so I guess I need some validation.


TLDR; Vents a lot, obsessed with gossip, never lets me say no without a debate and unwilling to accept fault


I’ll call him M for simplicity. This friend M has done some weird things recently, and while he’s always been odd it’s got worse as I got closer to him (although now I’m distancing myself). We are both 19 yo males and I’ve known him since HS.



M loves to gossip, reveal secrets, and talk shit about everyone. Of course when I told him to confront those people about issues he’s having, or to drop them as friends if he dislikes them he would come up with some excuse that he just can’t do it. And so the cycle would go on and on, talking a lot of shit and then acting normal when among them. We go to different universities though so I’m not worried about him talking shit about me to them cuz I don’t go there but I wouldn’t be shocked if he did talk shit about me.


M is passive aggressive and unwilling to resolve issues. So here’s a recent example, I had missed M’s calls over a span of 2 days. Most of them was when I was sleeping and only 1 was when I was legitimately busy doing other work.


Justification aside, he proceeded to text me some msg about how I was ignoring him, I told him I wasn’t and I was sleeping during those calls and then he responded I should’ve at least returned his calls (don’t know why he wouldn’t just text me to call him when I wake up but whatever.)


I told him my sleep schedule did not align with his, and that I never purposely intended to ignore him. He never responded to my text, leaving it on seen. Then he calls me once again at 12am knowing full well it’s when I’m sleeping, I picked up the phone half asleep and he just wanted me to play fortnite. Like wtf?



After that day whenever he called me he would keep asking if I was sleeping, or if I had just ‘woken up’, I told him to stop that and his excuse was that he assumed I must’ve woken up because he had just woken up. Very passive aggressive, and also that reasoning makes no sense.


There’s been loads of other weird stuff but I’ll condense it, he always vents to me about random stuff in his life, most of which aren’t even serious topics that I’m not sure why he needs me for. These calls go on for way too long as well.
He never allows me to simply say no, there always must be some reasoning or debate over why I said no and why I shouldn’t say no. It’s stupid and exhausting.



He tried to interrogate me over my own finances when I told him I didn’t have enough money for some item he wanted me get, and tried to imply I was lying. His logic was that since I offhand mentioned product prices to him I had bought recently, then he could calculate my bank account total or some stupid shit like that.
Yeah and there’s more if anyone wants to ask. This is just the ones that stick out to me.",19Jul2020,2
458,"The business that I work for closed during our states’ stay at home order, for about 2 months. When my fellow employees and I came back to work my boss had us fill out a W4 form again but didn’t really explain why we had to do that. So, I was wondering if anyone else has had to do that? And what does that mean - did the business technically close (possibly for good) but then my boss decided to reopen?

Depending on the answers to the first questions I had another one. When I started working for this company 5 years ago, I signed a non-compete contract. If the business technically closed during that time, does that mean the contract is no longer bound? I didn’t sign another contract when I came back to work after the stay at home order.",19Jul2020,1

461,"I have a feeling I am being stalked by someone. 
It all started around a year ago on one of my nightly walks. I typically walk up a large hill along the roadside. At the top of the hill is a main road. This one night while I was walking, a white four wheel drive/truck turned off the main road and onto the road on the hill. However, the car immediately stopped at the top of the hill and switched on it's extremely bright headlights (which illuminated the entire hill) directly at me. Two men got out of the car and seemed to be communicating with someone else on a phone. I thought the situation was weird and turned around and as soon as doing so the two guys jumped back into the car and aggressively sped off. 
The situation gave me a weird gut feeling but I shrugged it off and forgot about it. That was until the past two weeks. 
As usual, I was going for my nightly walk, this time the truck seemed to emerge out of my street (I live on a corner), it drove and stopped around 100 meters in front of me. Two young guys jumped out and seemed to be inspecting the side of the truck. Once I got closer to them, both quickly got in and again drove off. 
This was the same truck as the one I had encountered last year, I know this because the lights are nothing like I'd ever seen before. During that walk, the truck drove past me a total of 4 times (within a 30 minute span). The truck stopped a second time during that walk and both men got out again and seemed as if they were pretending to be inspecting the side of their truck, as if they were waiting for me to get close to them before speeding off.

Skip a few days, I was sitting in my room after sunset with my window open. A similar truck drove past, the truck slowed down almost coming to a stop and pointed an extremely bright light directly into my window. This last for no more than 10 seconds. After that, the truck immediately sped off.
The night after this happened, the truck came past my house again and turned into my street and waited for a while before leaving.
The truck also drove past last night and stopped for a while in front of my house at close to 1am. They stayed there for a minute or so before once again, aggressively speeding away.
I can always tell it is the same truck due to its extremely bright headlights and the sound of its engine being very distinctive. It seems to be some type of modified 4 wheel drive that has some type of police paddy wagon on the back and bright red lights across both sides of the truck. For some context, I live in a semi-rural part of Australia, there aren't a lot of people on the roads at the times I go walking.
Any advice would be much appreciated as these encounters are becoming very regular now and are getting scary, really hope it's just a coincidence or something
Thanks",19Jul2020,1
462,"Hi! I have been very stressed out lately because i had to friendzone my friend, because i noticed he started to act really different around me and he was really flirty around me, but I’m just not ready for any relationship and I see him as nothing more than a friend. So when i noticed his flirty behavior and we started to hang out with only the two of us more often, i felt like i could avoid any awkward situation like him asking me out on a real date kinda thing by calling him bro and stuff more often, and talking about my other guy friends. I know this isn’t the proper way to do anything like that, but I have a lot of other problems to deal with at the time and I’ve just gotten out of a depression, so I need a lot of time to focus on myself. I feel super bad though, because now he seems to be very down around me, and I feel kinda uncomfortable talking to him. I feel like we need some space for a while, so we can just be friends again without anything romantic going on, but we have the same job, so thats just not an option. Other people have gotten involved aswell, so getting out of this whole situation just feels impossible.

471,"Dear (girl’s name here),

I know this letter will sound strange, but it feels like I need to tell you this so you understand the reason why I’m asking for this favor I’m asking for later in the letter.
I am a victim of child abuse. My dad, when he gets angry, tends to yell and scream and sometimes do worse things. To let you know how bad it got at some points in my life, I had an argument with him when I was in 7th grade and I stormed off, I went to our kitchen and I tripped on something in the floor and hit our clothes dryer. My dad, when he heard this, figured I ran in and broke something. So he responded by storming in and started to choke me until he realized I tripped (thanks to my sister explaining what happened). He then walked away. He has done worse in the past but I don’t want to talk about them. Instead I’m going to explain that because of this, I started to agreewith my dad on everything and if I didn’t agree, I just walked away before another argument would happen.
The reason this is important to let you know is because my family hates gay people. Anything a man does that is considered feminine, is gay. Well I’m not gay, but I do like feminine things like makeup. My family obviously doesn’t know or else I might not be here today. Because of my family’s intense hatred combined with the fact my dad literally once choked me because he thought I broke something, I’ve kept my interest a secret because I’m afraid of what will happen if they knew and it has caused me a lot of anxiety. Remember last year when I had my nails painted, well I almost passed out because of the fear of how people will react that has been placed upon me by my family. However I found out that people either don’t care, they liked it, or the didn’t like it, so I calmed down and kept the painted nails a while.
I bring all this up to you because of one reason. I think your amazing at how you do your makeup. I admire it greatly and would like to know how to do it myself. But because of the anxiety I have developed from what has happened, I cannot ask you aloud, so I’m having (her friends name) give you this letter because I don’t think I could give it to you myself either. 
Now what I’m asking is that, would you please do my makeup for me. I know makeup is expensive so I’m not asking you to use yours. Whenever you are free, could you go to the store with me to help me pick out everything I need. Once we get back then you can do it.
Also, if you agree, there is a possibility that I might pass out when we start, but that’s not cause of you. It’s all my anxiety going overboard, because I’m still afraid of how people will react, makeup is much different than nail polish. When I passed out when I got my nails painted it only lasted for a few seconds and I was fine. If you are uncomfortable with this then I understand. You have no obligation to do this at all. I’m just asking because I really want to learn and do it myself but I can’t follow the makeup tutorials I watch, and when I tried to set up an appointment at Sephora so they could teach me, I was unable to (I assume because of COVID they might not be letting people come in for appointments anymore).
I understand that the anxiety I have really should be dealt with by a counselor or something but I also can’t do that either because of the anxiety. I’ve literally tried to go several times last year but I would panic to much and leave before I could be seen.
So would you be willing to teach me makeup please.

Sincerely,

(Space for my handwritten signature)

(My name typed)

Now Reddit, I don’t know if I really passed out or not when I had my nails painted, all I remember was that I got super dizzy, everything went dark, and I fell. But I was still awake throughout the entire thing so I don’t know if that was really passing out or just coming close to passing out or what it is considered, but luckily I was sitting down so I didn’t fall far enough to hurt myself. If anyone has passed out because of anxiety please let me know if this is what happened to you.

But please let me know if the letter is ok or if I should change the story to the time where I was at a boy scout camp and my scout master asked where we went to church at, I answered honestly saying that we didn’t go to church at the time and apparently my dad (who was sitting next to me) didn’t like that so after I went to bed he eventually walked into the tent woke me up with his whisper yelling he does saying how I apparently embarrassed him and then when we went home, he beat me with his belt.

Those are the two stories I am comfortable sharing and they both happened in middle school. Once I got in high school I got a lot stronger and he left me alone. I assume cause I could actually hit back but it could also be because I started my agreeing or leaving policy I mentioned in the letter.

The reason I added the story is because I feel she should know where my anxiety is coming from and if I don’t explain what happened when I was younger she won’t really understand if I just say that my family really hates gays.

So Reddit is the letter good or should I change it? Also if you read the letter would you help me with my makeup or would you say no (just so I can know what to expect from my friend).",19Jul2020,1
473,"I'm 15 but I worry a lot about the future and having at least some money saved up if I ever need it and perhaps even some experience would also be great before I'm an adult. 
My mom has always told me that I can't get a job until I get straight A's or turn 18 which yes grades are important but I feel like figuring things out right now before I have to take things much more seriously would be helpful. 
My mom is also not someone I want to be around because of how quickly she can snap. I don't want to sound like the dramatic teenager but when I say my mother is narcissistic and almost dictator level controlling, I'm not kidding. I'm definitely not happy here and I feel the sooner I can learn how to do stuff for myself the better. I want to learn how to be my own person and get out of here.",19Jul2020,2
474,"TDLR at the bottom. Ok so I started this job as a first year teacher. I was finishing my certification through an ACP and my first warning should have been when he refused to finish my letter of recommendation to the state for an entire year. He then got mad at me and said that a “last minute request on my end doesn’t constitute an emergency on his end” even though he literally had the ENTIRE year. 

So fast forward to my second year and he’s upset because I haven’t gotten my ESL supplemental certification added yet. Now in my state I have to have a certification number (meaning you have to be certified) to sign up for new tests. But since he was late, I couldn’t be certified until October 1st. He wanted me to have this test done by August 1st. Then he pulls me into his office with someone from HR to write me up. When I said I didn’t want to sign it he said I could just leave my job. I didn’t do anything wrong so I thought that was unfair but he said “if we can’t fire you for this I’m sure we can find something else to fire you for”. 

So now this Karen (the principal) goes and tells my evaluating AP that I left his office that day and laid on the floor outside of my room bawling. Which, as seen by the security cameras, never happened. And the. He threw a hissy fit about how it’s unprofessional of me to behave that way and that he suspects that I’ve been spreading rumors about him. 

While I’m sure that I didn’t handle things perfectly by saying I didn’t want to sign the write up and not communicating with him beforehand about the delay for the ESL test, I still can’t help but think that he’s a dick. I’m about to start my third year at this school and I’m wondering if you guys would stay for the year or if you would break your contract and leave?

TLDR: my boss is a fuckweed and I hate working for him, but I signed a contract until May. Should I stay until May or leave?",19Jul2020,2
475,"hey, recently i've been feeling pretty lonely and bored and i've been trying to meet people, but i feel like it hasn't gone too well, and that is definitely my own fault. i feel like trying to deliberately meet people just isn't for me.

i know that people are going to suggest hobbies and all, and while i definitely do agree that it helps a lot, i feel like my hobbies might just be too niche, or i don't exactly know how to make friends with the same very niche hobbies as me. i feel isolated sometimes yknow? and i feel like i just can't connect with most people. maybe it's just mental illness, but i don't know.

i do know a few people with mutual interests from artists i follow, but i feel afraid to really talk to them, i guess i'm afraid of rejection. me and these people follow each other and respect each other's art, but i just feel afraid to try to talk to them. like, what if i'm not good enough, blah blah, you get the gist already.

and just... i don't know how to find other people like me, really. it feels like there's nobody who shares a lot of my enthusiasm about certain things, and it can get really lonely at times.

478,"Okay so my friend set me up with one of her husbands friends. He probably wouldn’t be a guy I’d go for but he was kind, funny and successful so I was excited but it ended up going no where and I’m not sure where it went wrong. 

He first texted me in April, pretty general surface level conversation. He went ghost a few time from April-June. I few times I thought he fully ghosted me.

Anyways, he mentioned twice going on a date but no plans. We are in the pandemic but thing are pretty good here in June. Well in July my friend who set us up was gonna have a few people meet on there boats for the 4th of July and invited us. I was excited, he wasn’t sure he wanted to be around so many people and I kinda felt the same but we wanted to meet each other. 

Fast forward to that day - it was fun on the boat. Great conversation etc. we all ended up going to his house where he grilled out and was the biggest gentlemen. But I got a little drunk, I’m not a big drinker and I’m kinda embarrassed that I did that. I think that’s what ruined it.

We did make out and we’re very touchy feely all night. It felt great. This is the first guy I’ve kissed since my heart break a year ago. But the next day nothing. He texted me a few days later and it was back to casual talk. I brought up that night and maybe a date because I was so over this texting for 3+ months but general response. We haven’t texted since and it’s over. 

I’m sad. I saw potential and think I ruined it by getting drunk. This was my first time dating since my breakup and don’t want to make this mistake again.",19Jul2020,1
479,Hi reddit! So i was friends with this person and we would always hang out. She was a really good friend because she was open to discussions about anything any time and i could talk to her about anything because she was patient and understanding. There was kinda a problem which was that i hated talking to other people but she was social and talked to everyone and had so many other friends so that was really annoying but other than that it was good and we were basically best friends. So i said something in a school presentation about how china normally eats bats (because they do right?) and she is chinese so she called me and just asked me how much research i put into it. I hung up on her because i could sense that she was about to talk to me like the person she is who always confronts people nicely when they do something wrong but why would she do that to me since i was like her best friend ya know? i ignored her texts for two days where she told me that she just wanted me to know what i said wasnt true or some shit and she apologised twice but i was still annoyed. I replied to her evetually and told her that i didnt want to talk about it because i thought that was clear! and long story short i ended apologising just like she so wanted but she hardly talks to me anymore and she talks to so many other new friends and she looks happier i guess? meanwhile i dont have anyone to talk to because she was supposed to be my best friend but i guess not anymore. It's been months and she still gives me smiles and says hi to me as if she didnt fukin abandon me but she was the only person i had to talk to so any advice on how to get her back? thanks reddit!,19Jul2020,1
481,"Hello. So, a few months ago i lost my job, and i've been filing for unemployment here in my state. I normally wouldn't qualify for unemployment due to not meeting the hours worked in the base year requirement, but i qualified for the special COVID unemployment payments. I've been waiting almost two months for my claim to be approved, and it was just approved recently.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for some background before i continue. I'm almost 23 and still live with my parents. They're very, very nice about me still living here, but honestly when i get new money i think they see me merely as a source of income than anything else. Don't get me wrong, i'm ALWAYS willing to help them with groceries and what not, and in the past i've even paid rent when they've asked for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my unemployment was weird. My most recent weekly claim got approved before the other ones, so i told my parents about that claim getting approved when it happened. The rest of them were approved a few days later, but i haven't told my parents about those through fear of them asking for even more of my money. In fact, with the one unemployment claim they know has been approved, they've asked me to spend upwards of 250 to help get the windshield on their car replaced. I agreed to that, because they can't safely drive their car with the windshield compromised and it has to be fixed promptly, but now my mom is going beyond that, asking me to help with other things wrong with the car (broken heating/air conditioning elements, broken side mirror, etc), and if they find out how much money my payments total up to, they're going to ask me to help pay to replace the busted shocks as well (which is serious money). They're also asking me to help pay for my dad to go on a trip to see his father (who's not doing well health-wise). Those are things i'm willing to help with, because i love them, am thankful they let me still live with them, and i want to help out. But where will it end? I'm worried that if i do tell them that all my other claims got approved, they'll just sink their teeth further into my bank account.

&amp;#x200B;

It's frustrating because, while i want to help out, there are things i want to do with the money. I'd really like to spend some money to buy a good computer and setup to become a Twitch livestreamer. Or, if that doesn't work out, i have a friend in the midwest who has offered to let me live with him if i can move out there. With either option, i can either start making revenue as a streamer, or i could move away and start trying to get a life together, leave the nest as they say. It's also hard because whenever i do buy myself something, even with money i'd gotten when i was working and earning it honestly, my mom gets mad at me for spending said money. Why should i not be allowed to spend my money on things? 

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice. I've had a few friends say i should tell my parents no, and either spend my money the way i want to or save it altogether. But i'm thankful for my parents letting me stay here and i want to help out...what's the right move here, Reddit? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",19Jul2020,1

Eventually, i moved in with my other gran and she said something to me the other night that i cant shake, she said that im not as depressed during quarantine as she thought id be, and that im not even that depressed anyways, that i never had it all that bad in the first place and honestly that is confusing me, because im unable to feel therfor dont feel depressed, so now i think that im just faking the whole thing. When i told her i think i might have bpd she said that bpd is nothing.

491,"So, I'll just give names that aren't real. I (16m) have a friend, Natasha (18f), who I've really liked for nearly 2 years. I don't really ever like people very much, and especially not for this long.  


Natasha and I sort of had a thing last year for a couple months, we never really did anything but we certainly both liked each other. She ended up getting back together with her previous boyfriend Chad (20m), who she had broken up with because he was trying to cheat on her.  


Her and Chad are now engaged, and their relationship seems somewhat toxic. Chad is interested in other girls, has nudes of women he has opened recently, nudes from years ago, and sometimes vulgarly flirts with his and Natasha's mutual friend. All in all, he is certainly interested in other people.  


Natasha and I are still friends, and she comes to me with her relationship troubles asking for advice, which I don't mind her doing. She has said that she feels dumb for staying with him, that she will probably always forgive him, that something new will always come up even if one bad thing gets resolved, that he doesn't really apologize for doing anything. She has also expressed that she has low self esteem.  


One of these times talking with me she told me that she still had really strong feelings for me, and that basically she sort of wants to bang me. She also said that she likes feeling like she's being chased. I told her that I still like her too.  


So, basically, what I am asking is what kind of advice do I give in this situation? She still very much wants to be with him, but has basically accepted that he probably won't change. She also doesn't want to cheat on him or anything.  


Like, man, I totally want to get with her but I don't want to manipulate the situation so they break up or anything, I want her to be happy.

502,"Well I'll keep this sort. Basically every time she (my only parent) snaps and goes into Shadow mode she tells me lots of ugly things and compares me to her mother whom she absolutely resents. Her bro does the same thing to me. They literally circle-jerk about me ""being after their mum they both hate so much"" and I double dare you to assert, ""it's just a joke haha"".

I don't understand why is she destroying her relationship with me, her only daughter, cuz of her past hurts. I don't understand why we can't normally talk about that, hell, even family therapy for all I care (better to have a 3rd person otherwise she twists things). But she won't cuz ""therapists crazy, me crazy"" etc. And ofc everyone is a bad/insane person but her, she knows the best.

She especially got resentful towards me after I failed my studies (due to mental health reasons). She never said ""I am sorry I know how you feel for failing"", she just got at me for failing and went on about ""how everyone else will think bad things about us cuz I failed and how we could've been rich if I didn't fail and how she can't afford anything thanks to me"" etc.

I am okay wtih her not liking me 100%, she doesn't need to like everything about me, but I am sick of her personality-reversal where she calls me all kinds of negative traits AND esp. telling me I'm like her mum (worse ""name-calling"" in our family). Then her negative energy is gone and she might even deny she said those things (the way she did) and again turns it against me, like I am the bad one who needs to become better. She never apologizes to me after those ""anger episodes"".

Just idk what should I think or feel about this situation. It was a year ago when I visited my LDR SO abroad and I actually felt something seeing his harmonious relationship with his mum. Like wow, they didn't get angry at each other and they kept discussing things like adults, without forcing opinions on the other person down the throat, very respectable to ppl of different opinions, it was sooo wholesome. On the other hand, my mum wants me to be just like her, have same political opinions and what else not - everything else is unnaceptable. I of course can't discuss things with her cuz she immediatelly snaps that ""I am like her mother and I am wrong in my head, I should go get a shrink"" (I ironically have one for social anxiety &amp; sensory triggers). This blows.

I am looking for an outsider's opinion on my situation because I am biased in what I should think or feel. I don't know if what is happening is right or wrong and to what extend I shoul dbe getting myself involved.

In my current position, I have spent four years living with my family with my wife and two kids, from having it all for years ago. To start off, and I was 20 I had a daughter with another girl, I had only known this girl for about three months because we had met each other on an online dating site. I didn’t want to have a child with her because I barely knew her, but my mother intervened and said it wasn’t right to take a life for my actions. So we decided to keep it. Emotionally I had no connection with my ex, so we ended things and we’re on and off for a little while to try and make things work for my daughter. It never did. Moving forward, I found someone i actually knew back in middle school and we started talking. Then dating and got married. Been together for 7 years now. During The dating I had moved to my wife’s home state to try and build a life there with her, I left my daughter with my mother in hopes that I can get a job quickly, fight for my daughter and win because her mother was in no position to take care of her. Six months in My mother is crying begging me to move back saying that things are not the same with my family (grandma had stage 4 cancer, mom had a stroke, brother not doing well mentally) and that I needed to help. I did just that. My pregnant fiancé coming with me. Immediately when I move back, I felt I had been played, Nothing was like it had been explained. It was... much...
Much worse. And my daughter in the middle of it all. I went to court to fight for my daughter, lost the case and settled on a split custody. From there trying to step up and take role as a dad, my mother constantly interjects and feels that she is superior to what I can say. My ex giving a hard time because she wants all the benefits of my daughter but doesn’t want to spend a dime on her, and my wife and son (now 3) being around all this have become witness to My family falling apart, becoming extremely manipulative, condescending, and hypocritical. My family also plays a huge favoritism roll for my daughter, and barely give anything to my son. This has been noticed by my wife and I and even my son who has questioned it. Mind you he is 3! Skipping ahead to the past week as this
Should give some insight on how fucked this all is... 

My wife had planned going back to her home state to see her family for the week for her birthday. I could go as i just started a new job that would finally put my income over $100k annually, two weeks into my new job, and at the beginning of her trip, I can’t work for a week because my appendix needs to be removed.. (still home from leave as I type this) my wife wanted to come back but I insisted her to stay out there and that I would be find amidst the chaos. In that week I reflected upon myself, my family, kids, wife, job, everything. Upon observing my wife out there.... i saw the light that had been gone, shining through my wife. She was the happiest I’ve seen her in 4 years of having moving up here.. and today she’s currently driving back to me and... i couldn’t be sadder. Knowing her and my son will be back in this hell. The light of happiness she had for they week will fade again.. and no matter what i do. I can’t bring it back. I’m finally getting on my feet financially after these 4 years, but it seems the time has already ran out? What I need advice on... what would you do in this standpoint? If i move back to my wife’s home state i know we will all much be happier, but i can’t take my daughter and that’s why I haven’t moved... and my wife has stuck beside me through it all.. i feel torn between having my wife and son happy and being able to actually be a dad without others interjecting or talking shit behind my back and on the other side, I feel like I can’t because I’d abandon my daughter and I’m not that type of man. Some have told me that it’s okay... that my daughter will pull through and though she might not be perfect. I have to save what I can save, but that sounds so wrong to me... sorry if this doesn’t make sense. I’m still on meds and haven’t really slept all week. I just need guidance or someone’s unbiased stand point for what i gave for info... thanks again.",19Jul2020,1

518,"My girlfriend is constantly bullied, harassed and abused both mentally and sometimes physically by her mother. I've been with my girlfriend for 10 months now and I've seen and heard her mum talking sh*t about her myself while I have been at her house and while over the phone the majority of which is through Facetime. This has also been happening before I started dating her as I was told by her older brother.

 Her mum has said many nasty things to her over the time i have been with her and I've personally heard the following....carry on and I'll kick the shit out of you, look at you youre a mess, if you're depressed then kill yourself, you arent depressed you want attention, slut, slag, ugly, dirty, bitch, fat just to name a few. This has been going on for years. Which has only given her a very harsh judgement on herself, her personality and how much she values herself. Her mother has threatened her with a knife on more than one occasion and constantly bad mouths her behind her back to her own siblings. Her mother has hit her before multiple times but I've never seen her do it she only hits her and her older brother who's is a year older than she is.  My girlfriend has 4 other younger siblings that are shouted constantly and at odd time she will call them names too. 

But as bad or as selfish as it sounds they arent my concern I want my girlfriend to be safe. she's nearly killed herself because of her mum and I talked her out of it thank god but it's got to the point where she is terrified of her mum. With the constant threats and constant bullying that goes on she is too scared to do anything. She wont stand up for herself or even try and fight back she stays in her room most of the day just to avoid her mum which doesn't help with the very little eating she does anyway. She is constantly depressed and has told me that I'm the only person that makes her happy and I just want her out of that environment. I have talked to her on multiple occasions about trying to let me help her or even calling the police or social services but she is against it even though I know it would help her and her siblings. Her family has encountered social services before with her dad hitting her mother. 

As for moving in with me. My mum wants her to stay with us as she knows everything that's happening because I've asked her what I should do and she suggested social services. However my girlfriend cant stay with mebecause the house is too small my stepdad says no because the house is too small also which i agree with but i have no problem with her staying in my room and moving things for more space for her. I live with my mum step dad and 2 younger sisters.

Bottom line is I need advice on what I can do to help my girlfriend through this , what I can do to put a stop to it and if possible convince my parents to let her stay at our house. At this point I'm just desperate to help and I dont want her to get hurt or for her to hurt herself. I've tried coming up with a solution myself but nothing so here I am.

Before that i wasnt really that bad,i was complimented  about my looks here and then or recieved sublte flirt but in which i didnt respond at all cause again i was insecure.

This girl idk why but when she saw the way i looked she just started laughing out loud in front of everyone and sayihg ""Look how he is"",her friend i heard her friend liked me but she just tried everything to dissuade her from doing something.Her friend group saw i was alone and knew my issue and she just pursuated everyone to not even talk to me.When her friend called me ""cute"" she just mentioned about how i just become ugly the next day because of my issue.I went to a physchologist once and this girl seemed to have overheard the conversation i had with my mother,she just called me a kid with imental issues because of that,and again used that as a way to dissuade others.

Im alone,i have no friends for support,and i just cant understand why this person puts me down or dislikes me this much,did i somehow do somehting without knowing it,a girl hates me because i dint respond to her flirt or somehting in the past?As i said i wouldnt pay much attention to my surroundings and even if someone smiled at me i would be to hesitant to do the same cause of the way i feel about myself,but to me this is just too absurd,im i really such a horrible person to be hated to this degree,i never did anything and always kept my distance from people during my time here in university.",19Jul2020,9

531,"TW; rape, abuse

TL;DR some girl on my Facebook (never met her, but we’ve got mutual friends) is dating an ex of mine, with a very long, extensive history of abuse &amp; drug use.

Sorry I’m advance for the formatting; I’m on mobile


So I met this guy when I was like 17, he was 19, we met through social media. Ended up dating for like 5-6 months. He stole things, he broke into houses, I had to pick him up from jail several times, in the short time we dated. He was abusive, threw me down a flight of stairs at his apartment complex, gave me several black eyes and bruised ribs any time I’d try to leave, forced himself on me after I told him I wanted to wait to have sex, he jumped into the back of my truck one day when I was trying to leave and kicked my back glass in, and choked me until I almost crashed. He came to my school (we went to diff schools), found me, threatened me, tried to swing on me until a teacher had to intervene and called the cops. He then choked the teacher and was arrested after being escorted off campus, where he never should have been in the first place. He abused his mother on several different occasions, as well as his brother. He was a severe alcoholic who dabbled in meth. And I’ve heard from several people that he’s now consistently doing meth, heroine, and whatever he can get his hands on. Has never had a job, never had a license, never had any direction in life. Basically he was very unstable.

He’s messaged me at least 2-3 times a year for the last 8 years, through fake/new social media accounts that I have to block constantly. He followed me home one day from the grocery store and stood outside my apartment for about 6 hours until my neighbors got uncomfortable and called the cops, this was about a year ago. I didn’t know, I came home and immediately fell asleep. Saw his face on the county mugshot page &amp; asked my neighbors what happened. He’s messaged my family and friends threatening them so they’ll give out my information, place of work, type of car I drive. He’s messaged a friend of mine and told her he was going to “r*pe her until she bled,” unless she gave him my phone number. It’s been constant for the last 8 years. Not only me, but he’s done this to dozens of other women. I’ve had girls approach me for advice on how to deal with him. I’ve gotten no contact orders, restraining orders, and done as much as possible to keep him out of my life. I’ve helped several other women compile information, screenshots of threatening/abusive messages from him, and take it to the cops to get help as well. About a dozen other women have come to me, shared their stories, and I’ve helped them the best I can.

So this girl on my Facebook, who I’ve never met, has recently started seeing him. I don’t know her personally, but we have mutual friends. She’s very abusive herself. She’s uploaded videos to her social media of her spitting in her moms face, and abusing her. She’s got a long rap sheet for battery, assault, arson, and is generally violent. She’s got an 18 month old son, and my biggest concern is for him. She’s kind of a “no fear” type of person. Conflict doesn’t scare her, and she will put hands on anyone. She’s known for calling people out on Facebook and airing everyone’s, including her own, dirty laundry. She screenshots and shares the messages in her inbox all the time, and has a ton of friends just like herself, who will show up at anyone’s house to kick ass.

My thing is; should I tell her about him? I want to send her a message and just be like “hey, this guy is no good” but I also don’t want any conflict. I don’t want her blasting me on social media, showing up to my job, or even telling him what I said. I do NOT wish to deal with him, or her aggression and anger. I am concerned for her, and mostly her child. I’m kind of scared of her, and her friends tbh.

I am super conflicted, and feel like I should just mind my own business bc she’s a grown woman. But at the same time, I don’t want to see anyone else go through what I went through with him, or getting hurt.

536,"17F. I've had concentration problems for as long as I can remember and can't focus on anything for the life in me. One day when I was ranting to a friend, she mentioned that I may have ADHD and sent me several links about it. As I read through the symptoms, I realised that I have most of them.

I first talked to my 24F cousin, who is very close to me. She told me that I'm probably over-analysing all of this, and it's probably just because of the lockdown. She also said that at my age it's natural to not be able to focus, and it's probably not a problem since I've got good grades all my life. When I told my dad, his reaction was more or less the same. I also offhandedly mentioned some of the symptoms to my other friends, and most of them said that they sometimes feel like that too. 

Recently, it's got even worse for me and I'm afraid that I'm ruining my future since my absolute lack of concentration is not letting me study. At the same time, I'm conflicted whether I should approach someone for help. What should I do? Should I force myself to sit down and study or try and talk to my dad again? Any advice is welcome.",19Jul2020,2
538,"I went to a university the following months after I graduated on a poor financial estimation that I could afford it all. In August I moved in, but it became quickly clear that I couldn't afford it. Finally in February this year I dropped out and moved back in with my parents regretting everything. 

I'm almost certain my student loan debt that I owe is only about a couple thousand, because I wasn't in college for very long, but I also owe rent for my dorm. I'm not exactly sure how much I owe in rent, so after about 5 months of cooling down and being unproductive, I got a job and emailed my university's housing staff asking them about my rent balance and how I should repay them. I'm assuming that it was partially cut because when covid got bad back in march, the students had to leave and university refunded them the remainder of their rent for that semester, so I'm certain I benefited from that as well.

Well, about a month later and still no reply from their housing staff. I emailed another contact and still nothing. I can't check my balance or make a payment because my account for their housing payment website was deactivated. What should I do? Should I just let it slide and hopefully they won't notice? Maybe the epidemic confused them all enough not to care about my money. After the partial refund, I'm sure I only owe a little over a thousand anyway. As long as they don't reply to me or fix my inability to even repay them on their website, I can't do anything even if I wanted to. What would you guys do?

I'm pretty certain the student loan debt I owe is an entirely different story, because it's obviously more official and more well-documented and government-involved. I'll be paying that back more than likely, but what about the housing rent?

Thanks for any response!",19Jul2020,1
540,"We have this neighbor that yells and growls (yes, like physically growls) at my parents when they are out walking. I have never physically heard or seen her do this. Apparently she also hugs and talks to trees. My mom was out running and was about to cross the street when our neighbor started to cross the street perpendicular to her. My mom waited for her to pass, which made her angry I guess? She got angry and said something along the lines of, ""I don't have COVID, so stop staring at me!"" (she had a mask on, context). My mom never said a word to her and maybe just looked at her briefly, she said she wasn't staring at all.

Then, this morning, they were out walking our dog when she came up behind them and started growling at them. My dad felt threatened by this, so he decided to cross the street. Our neighbor didn't like this at all I suppose and my parents told me she started yelling at them, telling them to ""pick a side of the street"" and ""stop taking up the entire street"" and whatnot. I guess she said some things about our dog too.

Before all this, I guess my mom had been waving at her in a friendly gesture whenever she would see her. Then she stopped because she never waved back. I don't know if our neighbor is mad at us and only does this to us or if she's like this with everybody.

I'm actually kind of worried about her because she doesn't seem mentally stable. My parents feel threatened by her, so they want to call the cops on her next time she tries something. I don't feel like this is the best option, given how cops are in my state, but I'm not sure what else we could do if anything? My parents never talk back to her, never provoke her other than just existing lmao. I don't feel like my parents should just stop walking in our own neighborhood because of this person.

542,"Myself and my partner live in a rented property in the Uk and we don't exactly get along with our neighbours next door. We try to remain civil but they don't like us over arguments with regards to parking outside our home, with that they try to grass us up to our landlord but we have spoke to our landlord is understanding and knows what they're like. 

But long story short. They are horrible people. They've got 2 young kids both probably under the age of 6, and are contesting arguing. We have heard arguments and not having enough cuddles, money and cheating. They are screaming arguments enough that we can hear them from half way into our flat. 
We can heard them slamming doors, punching/throwing things and they have their children in the house. 

They were also arguing the other week (I apologise if this causes any offence to anybody, I wont write the whole word but im going to include it Purley for the understanding of how serious this is) after one had been called a ""P**i bastard"" we heard a loud crash against the wall like something had been thrown at it
Next day there was a broken chair out the back of their house (shared parking area to rear, we arent just snooping through their garden) 

We can hear them can hear them screaming ""fuck off"" at each other. 

One night we heard him telling her to leave then when she was going to leave him telling her he was going to kill himself if she did. 

Again all of this is while kids are in the house. 

Unfortuantly however we are the only house connected to theirs so we feel should we get in touch with the police theyre immediately going to know its us.

We really don't know what to do, because as far as we are aware if we report it as abuse nothing can really happen unless one of them decideds to speak out against the other and as this has been going on for a while we highly doubt that will happen. 

We are also tempted to get in touch with child services because this is not fair on the children seeing their parents argue first hand like this at all. I've grown up with a nasty divorce and it wasn't nice for me to watch parents argueing even at a older age so god knows how these kids must be feeling. 

Again if we report them to the police or child services. Its obvious is us thats reported them and like ive said if they speak out we could be doing the whole family a favour in the long run and hopefully the kids will be okay in the long run. But if they don't speak out and deny everything we've got to live next to these people afterwords and im not the sort of person to think twice about defending myself should they come around and start a fight with us for reporting them. 

I'm really not sure what our options are other than report them or don't report them, we can't just talk to them because they don't like us and they'll deny all of the fighting to us especially. We think they live in a rented house too but we arent sure who their estate agents are so we arent sure if the landlord can do anything because they're smashing doors up in their house (we assume) 

We feel that everybody in that house is in danger from each other and weve no idea what to do or what the right option is, if anything was to happen to the children then we feel that it would be on us for not speaking up, but again if we do and they deny all knowledge weve got the bonus of the kids still being in danger and 2 pissed off neighoure who appear to have no problem fighting each other who will then turn on us.

I forgot to mention that we have heard sounds of what very well may have been him grabbing her and hear screaming for him to get off, so it does seem like they've no problem with beating the shit out of each other. 

they're constantly leaving bags of rubbish outside their front door on the main street including used nappies. They don't do any recycling at all, leave their bins outside all week long (until we started moving it around the back we had their overflowing bin left a meter away from our front door stinking out the place) and around the back there is constantly smashed up things like chairs and doors that appear to have been punched/kicked holes through. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated, Thank you for taking the time to read.",19Jul2020,2

544,"I think i should try to provide as much background information as possible to give you proper context, so forgive me if this is a bit wordy. Also im not interested in legal advice. Quite frankly there already legal consequences happening right now that i will not disclose here for privacy reasons.

First, my parents marriage. My dad and my step mother have been married for about 16 years. They’ve been together for roughly 20. They love each other, but they hardly ever get along. I wouldn’t go so far as to say either one is an abuser, but both have the capacity to be abusive towards the other. Since the start of the pandemic, its escalated out of control. My parents and my two younger sisters have been stuck at home since March. My stepmother, who is typically a stay at home mom, found a job to get out of the house. My father, who works in NYCs entertainment industry, will be unemployed for the foreseeable future. 

Second, my little sisters. Theyre 14 twin girls and they are an absolute nightmare. They both have 0 respect for their parents and are undoubtably the root of my fathers, my step mothers, and my own personal misery. One sneaks out at night, sends nudes of herself to pervert adults, and is a typical teenage nightmare. Sincerely i love her, and i feel like if she had been an only child going through all of this, it wouldnt be so bad. I myself was an extremely rebellious teenager, and her and I can bond when we make the effort. My other sister is the devil himself. Shes only happy when shes bringing other people down. She bullies her parents, her sister, her teachers in school, and when im not careful, myself. There is not a doubt in my mind that being quarantined with her is whats driven my family to such misery. Plus she is obsessed with inpatient care. Every day she threatens suicide because shed rather be in inpatient than fo school work. Shes actually said that to me. That is her real view on inpatient. Its a vacation for her. And she knows the words on how to guarantee she goes. Shes manipulative and for years, i have been the only one to call her out on her bullshit. Quite frankly i hate her. But we’re still family and that means i have to be there for her, even if i want to kill her. 

Myself. Im a 26 year old female. I moved out a very long time ago, but i make it a point to try to stay close to my family. Seeing them all in such constant pain brakes my heart, but the more i get involved, the worse things get. 

My job. So i actually left a job i was building my career with for three years for the current job im working now. My step mother told me about a job that was paying double my current salary and was in my field of study. I jumped on the opportunity. After i had been working there for 1 week, my step mother decides to get a job there herself. We both work in the same department and are very close to each other. For the last 3 weeks we’ve been working together, things have been going great. So you guys dont have to math, ive been there 1 month. So i dont exactly have a secure position there, but im hard at work laying down a foundation for a promising career. 

That brings us to friday night. I get a call at 2:30am Saturday morning from sneaks-out child. She calls both me and my husband, but neither of us answer because we were asleep. The next morning we wake up, and i was concerned, because, well who wouldnt be? So i call her. No answer. I call her sister. No answer. I call my step mother. She answers but is forced to hang up because demon child is screaming “hang up hang up hang up” at the top of her lungs. So i text my step mother and ask what was happening. She tells me my father kicked them put of the house last night. Demon child is going to the ER because shes threatening suicide... again. Sneaks out child is staying at a friends house, and step mom is going to police station to get a refrain order (which i thought was just upset short hand for restraining order. I didnt realize refrain orders were a thing.)

So naturally i was furious at my father, and drove to their house to give him a piece of my mind. But when i got there, i found myself sympathizing with him. The man just wants to stop being lied to by the people he supports, and since they wouldn’t stop lying to him, he chose not to support them anymore. So i told him his decisions would leave him lonely, and asked him if thats sure thats what he wanted. He said he did. So i told him about the restraining order i thought was coming, told him if he needed to, he could stay with me, then left. About 30 mins later he texts me apologizing, then sends me his “final words” because he was threatening suicide by cop for when they attempted to serve him his restraining order. Then my stepmother texts me, stressing it wasnt a restraining order, and telling me all i did was make things 1000 times worse by telling him.

That was all yesterday. I got a text from my dad this morning informing me that nothing has happened since last we spoke. So it seems the situation has deescalated. Quite frankly, idc about demon child or her obsession with being in inpatient, and sneak out child is like me, so she’ll be fine with her friends until a living situation can be sorted out of the rubble.

Im going to try my best to bow out of the situation because i was clearly in way over my head. But my plea for advice comes from this, how do i go to work tomorrow and see my step mother? What can i say to her? What should i say to her? Should i just pretend this weekend never happened? I took such a gamble leaving my old job for this one, and now she also may need this job if shes going to need a new place to stay.",19Jul2020,1
545,"TLDR: should I take my cat to the vet if he’s pooping out of the litter box? And how to convince step dad if I should?

Idk if cats pooping outside of the litter box is unusual but I think it is. He’s been doing this for 2~ years now. And I’ve never lived with a cat before then (it’s my stepdads cat).

I was also wondering if it is unusual any way to convince him to take the cat? Jinx (the cat) got bitten on the ear and it got all swollen. I told him to take him to the vet but he refused and said the vet won’t tell him anything new. His ear shriveled up and he got a yeast infection in his ear. Now he only has 1 ear. 

We figured out he had a yeast infection because Jinx started peeing blood. That was the only time he took him to the vet. 

So as you can tell he doesn’t want to take him to vet unless he’s bleeding. 

Any advice on if i should take him to the vet and if so, how to convince a stubborn stepdad. I would take him to the vet myself but I’m 16.",19Jul2020,1
547,"I used to work at a port cleaning bathrooms instil 2 months ago. the bathrooms had brick walls with concrete floors. occasionally in a couple of them, I would have to use a house to spray the floors to clean shot off the ground. I never dried the floors off. didnt think I was expected to. in another bathroom, i was required to spray it down with a hose every friday. never dried that either. I'm mostly worried about mold, and people who use the bathroom getting sick. also, in one if the bathrooms, the counter around for sing is a wooden counter. if I look under the sink, I can see were the water leaks through, and I can see some mold. I really dont want to call my old employer about this, but should I? am I overthinking this? Also, in one of the bathrooms, when there was shit on the toilet seat, I would just spray it with the house, and I'm sure I got water between the toilet, and the brick wall, and I'm afraid it produced mold, and anyone who uses the bathroom is being put at risk. Also, in one of the supply rooms behind the bathroom. It is connected to the bathroom, it's just not accessible by the general public. When I was filling up the mop bucket, I would often get water on the floor, and it would make a puddle. I would usually push it outside with a squeegee, but I still left it wet. It just didn't think i needed to worry, seeing as the floor, and walls were concrete, and not drywall, or wood. I'm worried because I could be putting everyone at risk who steps in those bathrooms.

My schedule was dominated by classes that go  back to back requiring me to run out of one classroom only to show up a  minute or two late to the next. After classes I had to go straight to my  minimum wage job. The upshot is that even before the pandemic hit, I  didn’t have the opportunity to exchange pleasantries with the students  around me anymore.

Trying to get  involved in sports has been tough. Each year so far, I have tried  joining one of the university’s clubs. Untill this year every one I  tried was entirely composed of people who had competed in Highschool,  usually longer and were interested in taking beginners. The exception is  this year when I found archery. There were 10 of us when I started in  the fall, of which about half were total beginners. I broke my arm about  a month before the final exams, so I couldn’t practice untill after  winter break. Fast forward to this spring; four had left/graduated, and  four more had paired off into relationships. At competitions, practices,  or after-practice hangouts, the three girls all hung out together  because they had become tight friends, the two boyfriends came along,  and I was the odd man out.

I lived  in the dorms my first year, and formed some good friendships there, but  the last of them graduated this spring. Because I fell in with  international students, they are on the other side of the world, where  9+ hour time-zone differences make keeping in touch tough. Outside  practice, work, and school I don’t really have time to pick up a new  hobby and do it well.

Every few  months I gave the online dating thing a go for two or three weeks before  stopping to pick up the pieces that once were my self-esteem.

That  was all before the pandemic hit. I haven’t seen a friendly face I am  not related to since early March. I got word last week from my team  captain that all non-varsity athletics have been called off for the  year. I feel like I am not only back to square one, but glued to it. How  does one find friends, when it is unsafe to hang out? How does one go  on a date, when you can’t read the other person’s facial expressions?  How does one approach people to form a study group when everyone is  rightly on high alert about coming into contact with new people?

I  don’t mean to sound bitter because I am not. I am happy for everyone  who has a solid friend group and/or relationship. I just wish I could  have it too. Where am I going wrong reddit?",19Jul2020,2

So when I was 10, me and my parents moved from Bulgaria to the United States. Obviously, Bulgaria doesn’t practice circumcision so I wasn’t cut at birth. However, when I was 12, on a yearly check-up, the doctor said something was going wrong (I can’t remember exactly what, I think it was phimosis but I could pull my skin back fine...) and I may need to be circumcised. Obviously my family and I put a lot of trust in the doctors and went through with it. My circumcision was botched. Any other country and I wouldn’t have been recommended to have this done because I remember being fine. They just wanted our fucking money.

558,"So I have been planning out getting a tattoo since about a year. I am sure I want it and it won't affect my possible business life. 

To the tattoo: I want a smal 42 with minimalist flowers, about as big as a 50cent coin on the end of my collarbone near my shoulder in all black 

About myself: I am 18 y o and an legal adult in my country, I don't need permission to get a tattoo. 

My struggle: I am still living at home, making the transition from school to university in September of this year if everything goes as planned, I will probably move out around December/ January. I wouldn't want to tell my mom about getting a tattoo, because she is strictly against getting any kind of tattoos. I have an inner conflict because I planned it through pretty good, and I am not usually the person to make impulsive decisions but I don't know rather it is betrayal if I don't tell my mom that I got one made while still living at home.

So I’m 24 living with my mom and since COVID is running rampant, I have been staying home, social distancing, and not hanging out with anyone.

However when I told my mum about this she said it wouldnt be fair for me to take her somewhere when she said she couldnt afford it as then she would need spending money.

583,"(My first post here and I am on mobile. Please excuse my grammar).

I live in a third world country; Let just get it out there. Nowadays, there are these crazy confessions trend going on (basically people share their confessions on a website and the confession page posts it on facebook anonymously). I am a really private person and I don’t post nor share anything on social media, but this post really triggers me. 

Today I came across a post that make me lose my shit and I have to say something. (This is a full translation; the original post is mixed with English). 

“I am just a 16 year old who is studying in grade 11 and he is 25. He works at his brother’s company. We have been in love for about a year and a half already but there are some people who always said to me that &lt;You eat (enjoy?) older men (this is an old saying that is the opposite meaning of ‘old cow eating young grass’), You only see his money, You are dating him for the money...&gt;
This is too harsh right??I don’t know why they think like that;))
Should I continue date him or end this love??”. 

The most shocking thing is not the post at all. No, no, it is the comment section. Everyone was saying shit like, “don’t let people tell you what to do”, “you have a great bf”, “there’s no reason to end it”, “why would you care about their trashy opinion. prove them wrong. there’s nothing holding you back”, the whole “you do you, boo”. I was speechless. They all seem to be so supportive that an ADULT is dating an UNDERAGE. They didn’t care that the OP started her relationship with the man when she was 14 and he was 23. It totally blew my mind. People tend to overlook this creepy ass shit that’s going around and be so supportive of a potential pedo. I wanted to help this young lady but the confession was submitted anonymously, so there is no way of knowing who posted that. The third world country does not care about a potential pedo, a rape victim, an abuse victim at all. Our system are unreliable, judgmental, and corrupted. People value their status and refuse to report their cases. I am so disgusted and angry that I cannot be a part of a solution. Is there something that I can do in these situation?

(P.S, I am not against a big-age-gap relationship. If you are a 25 year old and you are dating a 40 year old, that is okay because you are an ADULT. If you are an underage and is thinking about dating an adult, please, please, please don’t.)",19Jul2020,1

And certainly, one of the most problematic aspects of my life has been that, even if I'm skilled, if my actions are not acknowledged or praised in some way, I lose motivation and can't progress. I know this makes me sound like a spoiled brat and that it's a probably a deformation of my own personality that needs to be explored further, but I thought that rather than overhaul this whole aspect of myself (at least for the time being) I could seize it and canalize it as a motivator in a healthy way.

Hey all, I (28m) am a bartender. I’ve been doing it for a little over 3 years now and have loved it in the past. Right now though, not so much.

When COVID hit, (I am in the US) I was immediately unemployed for obvious reasons. Recently I’ve gotten my job back and have been extremely conflicted with how I feel about my job.

When we started back up (in early June), my bosses and the owners had all these righteous ideals about how we could do it safely. I had my reservations about how safe it could really be, but was eager to get out of isolation so I came back. I’ve hated nearly every moment of it. As soon as people have two drinks, they forget about the global pandemic we are in and walk around without masks, talk loudly, and converse with strangers. It’s so incredibly stressful. Just last night, I felt I was on the verge of a panic attack with how incredibly packed the bar was and how few people were properly social distancing.

On top of me on my own being uncomfortable about everything, I will be moving in with my girlfriend shortly who has a mom who absolutely cannot get sick. They are incredibly close, and even for the last two months while I’ve been working, she and I have taken a lot of precautions to social distance (minus a camping trip we took where we kind of let loose).

So there it is. I’m leaning towards leaving my job. I had been saving for the past year or so towards buying a home, and have tucked away about enough to cover my rent for the next year. I’m just really scared about taking a leap from my current job (the hourly pay sucks but I make quite a bit in tips), especially in our current state of affairs, but I can’t fathom how what I’m doing can go on in a sustainable way.

Any advice would be rad. Mostly just feel like I need to get everything of my chest too.",19Jul2020,1
588,"Alright, so when I was a kid, I was not allowed to participate in music and forced to participate in organized sports. When I finally got out of the house, I took up drums. I've been playing for a while, and have even taken lessons and been in a couple of local bands. 

However, playing music has always been very frustrating to me. Part of the reason, I'm sure, is that I'm still upset with myself for not resisting the sports and finding out a way to learn an instrument/instruments anyway. Some of it is probably cognitive/setting the bar too high. Like, I know that if I had started as a kid, playing an instrument would be much more natural. Also, although I'm far from an expert, I have enough knowledge to be able to perceive the gap between my playing and the pros'. I get that there are plenty of people who play music or whatever as a hobby, but for me being a hobbyist musician feels very hollow. Then, it's sort of like all of these things come together: I sit behind the kit and just feel angry and depressed over how much control my mother exerted over me in this area and others.

My thinking here is that I'll pack up my instrument, etc., so that I could come back to it if I ever decide to do that. 

On the other hand, I've also found that sometimes it's best to make a clean break with the past. I'm sure if I put my kit on the curb, it would be gone in five minutes.

I know that ultimately this is a decision only I can make, and there's really no ""right"" or ""wrong"" here. But I would appreciate anyone's stories, insight, etc.",19Jul2020,1

I was hoping that someone had some advice for me regarding the process of immigrating to either Iceland, New Zealand, or both from the U.S.? 

To give some context, I'm a 22F, and I'm a senior in college at the moment. I'm going to be graduating this upcoming spring, and for a while now, I’ve been thinking about where I want to live afterward. 

I haven't done much traveling, but I'm ready for an adventure! I looked into other states and other countries, and I fell in love with Iceland and New Zealand from afar. 

I've been looking into how to immigrate on my own, but I wanted to see if anyone had any advice on resources, things I need to consider, which one I should start with, etc.? 

I really would like to go to the University of Iceland for a BA in Icelandic as a Second Language or a university in New Zealand because I'm interested in furthering my education. 

A few complications I'm having :

I have a 3F German Shepherd, and I love her more than life, but I know that creates additional steps with the pet quarantine, pet travel, and then finding places to live with her. 

I am a college student, so I don't have a lot of money, but I'm starting a second job next week to begin hopefully saving for my journey. How much should I shoot for? 

If I do get accepted into a university, will I be able to get a visa to live in the country after my student visa is up? 

All I know is I would like to live in both these countries in my life and maybe gain citizenship if possible!

592,"Hi! So, if possible, I wanted to get some advice/feedback on what’s going on in the following situation. Or feedback on how I handled it/should handle it moving forward. My main goal is to make sure I didn’t do something wrong or to offend anyone, and I’ve been wracking my brain trying to figure this out. 

Long story short, I (27F) recently finished my first year in my PhD program. I’m in a cohort of 4 women, and all of us became fast friends in the Fall 2019 semester. We hung out all the time, both at school and outside of school. We had nicknames for each other, baked for each other, and supported each other through the difficulties of the program. 

Thanksgiving 2019, we had a Friendsgiving at one of the girls apartments (I’ll call her Kelly, 27F). It was us four, my partner, and her partner, because the other two women were single. The party was a blast, and I never thought twice about it, but that seemed to be a bit of a turning point. I’m not positive, but after that, and even more noticeably after Christmas break when we came back for the winter semester, Kelly’s behavior towards me changed. I noticed on one of the other girls laptop screens (during a zoom meeting where we were both using her screen, I wasn’t trying to creep haha), that they had a very active group text just the three of them. Our group text had pretty much gone dead, while it had been super active and fun in the fall. 

I also noticed Kelly would change plans if I ended up involved, like even if the group planned to walk across the street to get coffee, she would get awkward and weird when I was invited or asked to come along (which was totally normal, we used to always tag along with each other for coffee). She also stopped replying to my texts/real life conversations with more than a word or two. 

At this point, I guess I was kinda worried it was all in my head, and I didn’t want to be « crazy » and assume it was about me. Maybe I should have said something sooner, but I suppose I was worried I’d seem like a crazy person haha.

Anyway, quarantine hits and we all start doing school from home. I noticed during a class or two that Kelly or one of the other girls would make a comment that implied they had done their homework together via Zoom, just the three of them. Not gonna lie, that hurt my feelings a bit :/ To be clear too, the other two girls would always be super friendly and chill with me when Kelly was not involved, and we would still reach out and talk relatively often. I don’t have any reasons to feel like they don’t like me necessarily, because they have always treated me like a friend and still do today. 

Anyway, fast forward again a week or so (maybe in like April now) and Kelly starts making multiple posts on her instagram about how much she loves her « cohort », Jessica and Samantha (made up names for the other two women). She would make personal « I love you » messages to each of them two individually in her instagram stories, and say nothing about me. If we’d never been close I wouldn’t really think twice, because of course we can all choose who we are friends with, but I used to be included in all the « cohort » posts and plans, and suddenly I wasn’t. So I feel like something must have changed? 

At this point I did reach out to Samantha, and ask if everything was okay between me and the cohort. She seemed like she genuinely didn’t have a problem with me, and said that as far as she knows everything is fine. I kind of left it there, and hoped for the best.

Finally, a couple days ago, I see on Kelly’s Instagram that they all hung out for a « cohort » goodbye party for Kelly (she’s leaving the state for the semester since our classes are online anyway). Again I guess I was just shocked and hurt. I felt like I wasn’t considered part of the group anymore. At that point I felt certain something must have happened, so I tried to write the kindest text possible to Kelly, saying that it seemed like there was a reason she didn’t want me around, that I missed her, and that if something happened I’m more than willing to talk about it and apologize if necessary. She responded with a very cold, generic text along the lines of « thank you for reaching out! I’m totally comfortable with the relationship we have. » 

I responded by saying that I guess in those terms I wasn’t comfortable with it, because we seemed to stop having any relationship at all. I also said that I felt like I was not being included in the group anymore and that I felt hurt. I said I hoped we could talk about it more one day, but that I understood if she didn’t want to. She responded with a very defensive text saying that she was quarantined so how could she have included me in plans, and that it’s not on her. I was a little hurt again that she ignored me expressing my hurt feelings to a friend, and she just made excuses instead of acknowledging my feelings. I sent basically a « its all good, don’t worry about it » text, because I basically gave up on having an honest conversation from her. 

That’s pretty much it, but I’ve still been trying to figure out what went wrong. I can’t think of anything, and we were all seemingly getting along great until Kelly and I weren’t. I don’t know if I should try to bring it up with Jessica next time I see her (she and I have become more close over the past semester), and just ask in the nicest way possible if there was a reason I wasn’t invited to the goodbye party. I feel like they must know something, otherwise they would have been like « where’s *my name* » lol. 

A friend of mine who I talked to about this (she doesn’t know the cohort group) said that it could be that Kelly was making comparisons between my life and hers at the Friendsgiving party, since that’s the first time our partners met, etc...she basically implied that Kelly’s behavior indicated she was somehow threatened by me. I’ve had silly thoughts like maybe it’s because her boyfriend liked the dish I brought, but everyone liked everyone’s dishes, so I don’t know 🤷🏼‍♀️. I feel like an asshole even saying that because I never thought of myself as better than her or anything, and I thought we were friends. I guess it’s possible something about my personality/life threatened hers. I’m just writing that part to try to give a full picture. I really hope that doesn’t come across as conceited. That’s not my intention at all, I just want to understand what happened 💚

Another sore spot is that this has happened to me a couple other times in similar groups, with similar personalities to Kelly. It seems in hindsight that her personality is very « queen bee », for lack of a better term, and I’m not really the personality to « follow » in that way. Not like I actively oppose people, I just kind of do my own thing in terms of my opinions, what I wear, etc. This is due to years of therapy to build my self esteem; I wasn’t always a confident person. So maybe I didn’t fit into the social pecking order the way she wanted me to? That’s what google implied anyway, haha. I truly thought she was my friend though, and I thought I was being a good friend. I would help her with homework assignments, I baked for her all the time, she would buy my coffees, we laughed and had so many memories...I thought things were okay. 

At the end of the day, I guess I probably don’t want to be friends with a person who treats me that way, but I seem to always lose the Jessica’s and the Samantha’s as collateral damage 😔 I don’t know if there is anything I can do to help this not happen again, or what the best course of action is to make sure I do right by Jessica and Samantha moving forward. I’ve been trying to be honest and address things instead of keeping ignoring them, but any feedback would be so appreciated. Thank you for listening 💚 Happy to answer any questions too if that helps!",19Jul2020,1

596,"Hi. I got Reddit in hopes to find a place I can vent to or find some sort of advice. I’m 16f and I have to take care of my mother who has stage four cancer. Her and I live alone. I apologize for such a long message, but I only have one person in my life who I can vent to who will understand my feelings about this situation.

I never had a good relationship with my mother. I didn’t shed a tear learning about her diagnosis, and I could barely find it in me to feel sorry for her. It almost felt like it was deserved. I don’t want to go into detail as to why I dislike my mother so much, so I’ll face the hate of being so terrible to the woman that birthed me. 

From the start of her diagnosis, I was already taking care of her before she needed it. I know she had already started milking her pain, and now that she’s in real agonizing pain... I barely flinch. I feel like a sociopath or something. 

When she was diagnosed, she didn’t go back to the doctors. Despite being extremely anemic and obviously needing to go to the doctors because she had fucking cancer, she stayed at home for months. She was in so much pain by the end that she would scream and yell as she bled everywhere. No matter how much I begged her to go to the hospital, she ignored me. One night, I yelled at her for sitting there in pain when she could easily get help at the local hospital. She yelled at me to not disrespect her and continued to writhe in pain. I didn’t think to call 911. That was stupid on my part, but an ambulance bill is so high and we couldn’t afford that. 

Luckily, my older brother happened to be there the same night I yelled at her, and she finally asked him to take her to the local (we live in a very small, rural town) hospital at around 1 or 2am. 

The state she had stubbornly put herself in caused the hospital to fly her via helicopter to a big city’s hospital in order to be properly treated (the city being 2 hours away by car). I don’t remember how bad her condition was because I was so grateful that I could sleep again and focus on my schoolwork (this was about a year ago, long before COVID-19 happened). 

She stayed at the hospital for months before being able to come home. For the most part, she could take care of herself. But, she had to get nephrostomy bags, (catheters that connected to her kidneys through her back to drain her pee) and I would often change the dressing for them. It was no problem. My life was seemingly normal, but then the financial problems hit. 

Before her diagnosis, my mom and I often lived paycheck to paycheck. My mom was a bartender and also an impulse buyer, so it wasn’t often that we had the luxury to not worry about money. My school life warranted me to be too busy and I would visit my father in the summer a few states away, so I couldn’t get a job with flexible hours. 

After diagnosis, I had to set up a GoFundMe in order to get some help. My mother then spent most of the money on frivolous things. It was beyond frustrating and extremely selfish that she wouldn’t think to save money so that we could eat and pay our bills. My father also helped out financially the best he could, but he, too, struggled so I didn’t put it past him when he couldn’t do much but raise child support. 

When people stopped donating to the GoFundMe, we were left relying on family members. We still are. I want to get a job now, but her condition is so bad that I can’t even take a day for myself and stay at a friend’s house to get away even if it’s just for a night. And with COVID, there’s no reason for me to leave the house unless it’s for groceries. I feel stuck. I don’t know what to do.

The reason I’m posting now is because it’s reached a point where I can’t do anything. She no longer listens or responds to me when I ask her what pills she needs to take or that she needs to empty her bags. She just lays there and yells. And yells. And yells. She’s doing it now as I type this. I’ve lost sleep over this and I can barely get out of bed myself with depression weighing me down. I forced her to take two Tylenol because I don’t know her pill schedule, and although I very much dislike her, I’m not trying to kill her and have her overdose. 

She can’t hold any conversation. She’ll mumble nonsense when I ask her to do something or try to help. I have no idea where she keeps her pill schedule and all she does is tell me to go away. I’m so desperate that I’m confiding in strangers on the internet. She told me a while ago while she could still think coherently that she can’t get a nurse without being on hospice. That in itself feels cruel. I don’t know how to contact her doctor or anything. She had done all this herself when she still could. 

At this point, it’s gotten so bad that I often think about suicide. Without school or a job to keep me busy, I’m left with my mind and I just feel stuck. I don’t know what to do. Please give some advice, reassurance... something.",19Jul2020,2
597,"My husband is a smoker. Met him as such when we were dating. Doesn’t bother me, I don’t smoke. He was raised by two smoker parents who smoked indoors his whole life, therefore once he picked up the habit, he started smoking indoors too.
Before we moved in together I asked him to please not smoke in the apartment as I don’t like smelling like an ashtray and I believe in second and third hand smoking being harmful. 
In theLast  year or so I have caught my husband smoking in the living room. (Mind you we live on the first floor of a building, so there are no stairs to climb to get outside) Most times I couldn’t prove it, I could just smell it. But he’d deny it, exasperated telling me he isn’t smoking cigs indoors. Then I found them; rolled up in a damn paper towel well underneath the couch where he thought I wouldn’t find them. I found them on multiple occasions and asked him to please stop. He has apologized and told me he wouldn’t do it. Until last week when I caught him AGAIN, but at this point I’m fucking sick of it.

Hello, I am in year 10 this year and completely torn between staying at my current school (all boys catholic school which I just moved to this year) or moving next year (to a government school) for my final years of schooling. My parents keep pushing me to stay being that the school that I may attend next year is completely new and my year level will be the first year level to complete year 11 &amp; 12 there. This is the main thing that is holding me back from moving, the school may be unorganised with teaching and assessments. The school that I’m currently at is fairly good and all the students are extremely friendly and do their work. I commute an hour to and from school everyday and am quite tired throughout the day and I don’t have much time in between arriving home and going to sleep. The new school is within walking distance. I am the type of person who needs 7+ hours of sleep to stay concentrated (I have only met those hours once or twice this year excluding remote learning). I will not be given any free periods if I choose to stay since I am obliged to choose a form of religion. I already know quite a few people at the new school. Do you think I should move considering that my year will be the first year to graduate? I will be extremely grateful for your opinion!!",19Jul2020,2

His friend is like a son to me too though, they've been friends since they were 12 and he practically moves in every weekend and holiday, since he doesn't really get along with his folks. Especially with the quarantine, he basically lives here now, for the past few months at least, because apparently they're afraid he caught something while staying with us and will give it to them. But He's a pretty shy, softspoken kid.

I've picked up some odd behavior though, like he'll be in the living room and i'll be in the kitchen, cleaning, and he'll just stare at me. But looks away quickly if i catch him. Or he'll insist on helping with the dishes or anything he can, to spend time with me.

Now, today, he had a birthday. Just turned 19. But his parents completely ignored it, they didn't even call him. He was upset by it, like really upset. And i figured, since he's like a son to us, we'd do something, take him out to eat where he wants or something like that, whatever he wanted. He said he'd think about it.

Later, i was washing dishes, there was nobody else but us and he came up to me. I asked what he wanted us to do, he said it's something only i can do. I told him to keep in mind that i don't have a lot of money. But he said it wouldn't cost money. I asked what it was and he started talking about how he's been trying to find a girlfriend but can't seem to get one, because he's ""Too Ugly"". I told him he was handsome and that i'd help him groom himself and dress better, maybe it'd help but he said no. He just came out with it and blurted it out. ""I've been thinking about it. I want to be intimate with you."" I almost hit the floor when he said that. I just couldn't believe it, i thought i made a mistake, that i misheard him.

My brother and sis n law have less extreme views as my parents, but their classest rascist-ness, conservative values still shows, and I'm saddened to see that because they are raising two lil ones.

I've spoken to my family countless times about harmful things they say, and I make sure to talk to them in the moment if I hear them saying something fucked up/racist. This usually results in defensiveness, shutting down, or ""I won't say that around you anymore"", and then sweeping everything under the rug and ignoring the problem.

I don't exactly know, why there is so much yearning for love. Sometimes, i think it is my addiction toward pornography. Sometimes, i think it is because I didn't interacted with anyone till I was 15 yr old. 
Since childhood, I was alone creating senerios and porn was the solution I choose to have more vivid memories of emotion and love. I have suffered from epilepsy when I was 5 year old. Depression and mood disorder took my life when I was 16.

I just need some suggestions to
1. lessen this desire, or
2. what should I think before I sleep?
3. what should I think generally?",19Jul2020,1

632,"Hey! I'm 17F, a couple months away from starting college and in this quarantine I've been going through a mental checklist of things I want to improve upon myself. One of these things is self love.

To put it shortly, I hate myself. I genuinely would rather be anyone else I know. I'm not looking for pity, this is just a problem I have to solve. It's exacerbated by the fact that for as long as I can remember this has been the case, even as a child. I never put steps into loving myself because I simply thought I was too ugly/overweight/bad-personality-having for it to matter, but I really want to change.

To everyone on the outside, I seem fine and confident, and put together. I don't want that to change and I don't want to make any big changes that'd make people notice that I changed. I just want the internal self-loathing to end.

It's a hard habit to break, and I don't know where to start. Do you have any ideas? Things I can do to start genuinely loving myself?

634,All my friends and I are 17 or 18. We live in the suburbs.,19Jul2020,1
637,"hiii I’m not sure if this is the right place, please lmk where i should go if it’s not, I’ll probably post this on another place too. 

hi there, I’m 21 (f) California. 
I’m constantly worrying about how I’m supposed to provide for my parents when I get older, such as pay bills, housing, food, etc. and have a life of my own.
	⁃	I know people have it worse than me and I’m so sorry for what you’ve been through and I truly hope you’re doing better now and not losing hope) 
	⁃	I’m conflicted because I want to help them so much that I think about it all the time and do try to help by buying them things etc. but idk what to do. and the reason I’m conflicted is because I kind of don’t like them. ( please hear me out, I know I should appreciate my parents, I don’t want to sound ungrateful I’m sorry, please hear out some of what I have to say and hopefully someone understands) 
I know they want me to provide for them because they tell me not to put them in a retirement home and my dad says a lot that he’s going to live in a tiny home in my future backyard and wanted to know my partners future education plans in order to know his future income level and such. My partner wants to be a biochemist or some sort of lab scientist and I’d like to be a social worker.

There’s so much that I could say, that i really don’t know where to start. 
It’s complicated because I like them and also resent them so much.
I have chronic stress ( i didn’t know that was a real thing until i went to the doctors a couple years ago, so diagnosed if i need to say that) that sometimes I don’t know I’m stressed until all the symptoms get worse( if you where to google chronic stress I get all the symptoms) 
I have PTSD from situations that took place.
I honestly have so many stories and so much to say that I don’t even know what I’m supposed to explain. won’t go into to many details, but such as being bad at saying no and disappointing people,  because you would deal with the consequences if you said no to my dad.
My dad is especially emotionally abusive to my mom and twin sister rn. 
I tend to naturally forget things ( because I don’t want to remember them), but a recent situation i remember, a few days ago we visited my parents, bc haven’t spent much time with them. ( used to live 6 hours away ( depends on traffic) and now we live 2 hours away.  My dad got super drunk and sat next to my siblings and mom and just went off about random degrading things that are wrong with all of us, whatever, but he said really messed up things to my twin. Stuff having to deal with basically calling her weak for having trauma and having to go to therapy ( for his actions.). Idk there’s a lot to say but this post is long. 

It’s complicated because our relationships aren’t always bad. I sometimes have good times with my parents but I’m not exactly comfortable around them. I tend to just deal with things by pretending they didn’t happen because it’s easier that way. 

My siblings and others agree that my mom ( not to sound rude) has lost her independence. My mother is from japan and my dad brought her over because he was working there for a little bit, he used to travel for work etc etc. my grandparents told her not to marry him, she did, they’ll forever be upset that she “ weltered her life away”. I know she’s depressed, it’s very obvious and she says so, she says things such as “ I’m depressed, nobody understands,” “ die” “kill” that such in Japanese randomly under her breath. honestly I’m not one for cheating, but I wish my mom would find a new now Japanese husband and just be happy and live her own life. I’m not sure if she’s fixable at this point because to this day us kids are still trying to tell her to become her own person and she doesn’t always have to do what he says. My mom does anything my dad wants. When my dad would abuse my siblings and do weird stuff my mom would be quiet or just yell some things but not know what to do. We resent her a lot for this, because we think she could have left him when we were younger but she was in a hard situation I can see. 

There’s alottttt to this part of my life story but that isn’t the point of this post 

I was very suicidal during this time, he would take my phone away so i had nobody to talk to and nothing to do, He caused me to have a concussion, 
now I’m dating someone who’s the opposite from my dad and my ex and things are going good, but my point is that I also feel bad for my current partner ( he wants to marry me and treats me well etc so it’s serious etc.) because I don’t want him to deal with my parents burden and having to help me help them find a place to live, financially support them and such. Sometimes I push him away and get mad just because I don’t want him to have to deal with my mess of a life. 

My dad says degrading and racist things to my mom. I grew up wanting to be white washed because I didn’t want to be made fun of by my dad, my parents used to be my favorite people when i was in elementary school times, I was extremely quiet, to the point where I wouldn’t speak at all unless I absolutely had to, and to the point where people would bully me ( because I wouldn’t talk back) and I was a weirdo, and “ a mute” etc. whatever idk I haven’t spoken much about this to anyone, it’s complicated. 

Growing up:

There’s so much that I didn’t realize until I got older ( and that I still am realizing as I get older) that I feel like my whole childhood was an absolute joke of a mess. Ex: I thought my mom would take us to the library because she was being nice and thought it was a fun place, but it was because my dad was drunk out of his mind and abusing her. ( he didn’t abuse us until we were older and could realize things we didn’t like)( I didn’t realize this until my older sister made a joke about this while I was driving past a library, and I swear I saw a big part of my perspective change that day). My dad would always pick me up from school drunk out of his mind, he would say one thing then change his mind when he was sober, and I was often in embarrassing situations, especially when people came over( I don’t want to talk about that lol). My dad would buy things then not remember, along with a lot of the abusive things he did which he also doesn’t remember so therefore “ can’t” apologize for. This caused us to have a lot of financial struggles growing up because he’s literally drunk approximately 27/30 days in a month and I wish I was joking. He has his own company it’s hard to explain that, but that’s how he gets his income if you’re wondering, but basically if he’s super drunk he doesn’t have to go to work bc he’s the boss. So growing up my parents neglected us and so often we would have no food : 
my twin sister was just really skinny,  looking back it’s probably because she didn’t have access to food. In middle school I started to steal food from wealthier friends houses ( I know stealing is bad I was just super hungry)
My friend in highschool would share some of her food until I was old enough to get a job and buy some, and same with my older sister and her friends, my twin sister had dropped out of hs at this point because there was just a lot of pain going on for her at home and at school. ( she has a story of her own and I care about her wellbeing very much.). 
they didn’t raise my siblings and I much growing up, CPS would come to my highschool and never do shit, social workers would visit us but they didn’t seem to have our best interest, they sided with my dad a lot ( idk he’s a Caucasian male and a smooth talker), and my mom is foreign, has an accent and all that so I guess she wasn’t taken seriously, I also grew up in a very Caucasian area of the South Bay Area hint*hint.  
At times I get really hopeless but idk my mind is less of a “ I just want to end it all” and more of a “ how the fuck do I deal with this”. 
I used to have a lot more suicidal thoughts ( failed suicide attempts, letting abusive bf hurt me, self harm, self destructive behavior etc. than I do now) I used to be a bit of an alcoholic for a couple years, including in hs because there was always easy access to alcohol in my house, it was to the point where I’d take shots every morning before and at school because i wanted to be numb ( alcohol makes me care less and I’m actually a happier person when I’m drunk, but i don’t drink much anymore and neither does my current partner( that’s a long story)) idk what keeps me going except that for some reason I have a tiny bit of faith that life might get better and I might want to stick around to see that. 

	⁃	my siblings have mental health issues as well, all of our stories are very different but at the end of the day we know some of our problems came from situations that happened growing up. 
	⁃	I’m not sure what I really need help is, I just am stressed etc. 
	⁃	I wonder if anyone else is going through anything similar because I feel alone 

Anyways, how do I help them when I get older when I also don’t want much to deal with them and have a lot of resentment. 
I have so much to say but there’s just too much. I left a lot out I’m sorry. I’m sorry if this story is long and hard to understand, basically I’m just stressing please help me with some hope?",19Jul2020,1
638,"Hey,

So, basically what the title says. I (M21) am not a person that uses social media too much or checks how many likes a post gets in terms of personal pictures etc, but as an artist and my artwork, I care a bit more, since I want my art to be seen. There was a time my art blew up which landed me multiple job offers for my dream job, but still, even now I look at the numbers, even though its slightly important for my art, it shouldn't be important for me as an individual and/or effect my mood. I try to say to myself 'why should I care if someone gets more exposure than me' but another voice still cares.

Recently a friend of mine blew up on twitter. But Instead of feeling fully happy for him I feel slightly jealous and want to be on top of that, which is a horrible thing to think. I want to be happy for him!

This is a bad habit and even though I'm taking steps to get rid of it, I would like to know what else I can do to basically don't give a fuck about the number anymore and be happy that others get the exposure i got that led to my dream job.",19Jul2020,2

I had an LDR (different countries) which ended up badly due to the distance and misunderstandings. We always had chemistry and a great connection when we were at the same place, but when we were separated, misunderstandings were simply the bread of the day causing problems.

I can genuinely say that I no longer have the hope of getting back together with her. I have no negative feelings towards her. There was no cheating nor lying in our relationship. Regardless, my therapist has advised me to remove her country from my list. He said that to keep the country on the list is to keep the ghost of the relationship alive.  I completely understand his point of view. I also agree to some extent.

However, that country is a very good country to make my master's degree.  Being honest, initially, I had included this country on my list because of her. Once I experienced the country, even without her, I really came to like it. Because of that I really don't want to remove it from the list.

I will be applying to several countries. Whichever gives me the best scholarship, that's where I will go to.

647,"During the pandemic I (26/f) had made a trip to California to visit my boyfriend while still paying my rent on the east coast (I share a two bedroom apartment with my uncle and didn’t want to uproot him). It became exceedingly difficult to send the money home and when travel restrictions hit I was fortunate enough to transfer my job to Cali temporarily and was able to barely skim by on the bills. All the while I was open and accepting to the idea of one of my new(ish) (28/f)friends renting my room for half of my rent cost because she sounded interested and kept expressing interest as she knew I was only gone temporarily. The plan kept falling through so I just ate the ticket and kept paying my half. She started having family problems and asked if she could stay in my room for a few weeks. I agreed to let her stay for a little (under the impression that she was planning on taking over my uncles room when the lease ended). The apartment is fully furnished with almost all new everything.. My room was MESSY because I left in a hurry but everything was in good condition and by no means dirty/soiled. 
She ended up staying for about 2 weeks and bailed on taking my uncles room (fine.) she didn’t offer to pay me anything and I wanted to help so I didn’t ask/expect anything from her. I asked that all she do when she leaves was to strip the bed and lock the door.. 
fast forward about 2 months later and I’m home. The door to my bedroom is unlocked and there is (seemingly) clean sheets on the bed. I jump right into work and it’s mid summer so I sleep on top of the comforter anyway. Today I strip the bed to find a massive dark brown stain covering the entire upper left corner of my new mattress (against the wall). It was a moving in present from my Mom and it’s my first ever non hand-me-down mattress/bed. 
What bothers me is whatever was spilt on the bed had leaked through TWO different covers I had put on to protect it (I was paranoid and was right to be before leaving). Meaning whatever she had spilled was then covered with clean sheets and then left to sit until I came back. She never mentioned anything of it so I decided to ask her (maybe my room was used after she had left the door unlocked? Maybe something had leaked from the ceiling..? (No marks on walls or anything) I just wanted to ask to be sure. 
She admitted that she was very clumsy and that she may have spilled coffee or tea on it.. why she would be drinking or eating in my bed while visiting is beyond me.. much less spilling something and giving no mention of it. 

Anyway I discovered the stain around 3am when I decided to strip the bed and change the sheets because I was getting cold (I’m very particular about sleeping in a clean bed.. and had already cleaned my room so it was time). Also COVID so. It’s taken me about 5 hours and two different stain removers/sanitizers to help my mattress recover. I’m VERY annoyed and tried to help her understand how messed up that was. Her response is asking what I want her to do about it. She is sorry but she hasn’t offered to pay for the damage nor the time she spent here. I know she was having a hard time but I feel very used. I don’t want to directly ask her for money and I feel that the “what would you want in my situation” route would just cause a lot of unwanted drama and tension because she seems to clearly be evading any sort of compensation to me.. 
I can’t afford to replace the mattress on my own much less get it professionally cleaned if that’s even an option (it’s on an adjustable base and is made for it.. my mom went all out it’s honestly the best ever). I don’t want to be shallow but I’m ready to end the friendship over this.. Idk if it matters but we are both Filipina and I find this ultra disrespectful.. she could have told my uncle (or anyone that has my back) and they would have helped clean it so the stain wouldn’t have set in so deeply and destroyed it :(. I would have rather paid $50 to a family member months ago than be in the situation I’m in right now. 
Should I even bother asking for compensation or take the time to explain how disrespectful this is when I was doing her a favor? Or am I overreacting?",19Jul2020,1
648,"I've lost most of my life-long friends after college. These aren't people that I met during college, but people I've known since I was younger than 10 yrs old. To be specific, I've cared a lot about my financial wellbeing since moving out of my parents, and that seems to be a touchy subject. 


I have some friends who are still living with their parents, and they talk about wanting to move out. Whenever they ask me about what they should do and I give my opinion, they state ""how lucky I got"" in order to be able to move out. They never take my advice and complain about their situation frequently. We've talked less and less over the years.


I have other friends who are in a similar position as I am (good paying jobs, living on their own), but they balk at the thought of trying to do something bigger and better. Whenever we talk about starting a company or selling a service to gain passive income, they'll be serious about it at first. Then when it comes to actually working on the company, they'll go ghost for weeks at a time. I feel like I might just not have any friends with the same aspirations, and it's frustrating me. I want to have my friends come along with me for the ride and do well with their lives. But they don't seem to care as much, and they act jealous when I do well and succeed.

The rest of the people are from coming from different unis but there's one girl from my uni staying and doing it with me, and she's not very nice. I think she's incredibly non self-aware so I didn't really have much to do with her at UG and it was big enough to avoid her, but it won't be come September. She's really boastful and obviously well-off so she makes lots of comments about money and wealth and stuff that 'normal' people can't afford, and tries to copy other people's work all of the time (like messages with long excuses as to why she doesn't have enough notes), but still does really well (and feels the need to announce her marks all of the time). I do about the same, if not better, but I just don't see the need to show off about it. I've tried to be very polite to her until now but my patience is just wearing thin when she says stuff like 'oh I'm so depressed the uni gym isn't going to be open because of corona' or 'I might just take all of the same modules as last year but the MSc level ones because I want an easy life' (I guess that's fair but whatever), and I don't really know her well enough to say 'shut the f\*\*\* up' when she makes ignorant comments and has this whole ditzy act when she's actually smart.

So last time we met (Friday) we were cuddling for an hour before I had to go. It was dark outside and pretty romantic and stuff so I thought It would be a good moment to have our first kiss. So I kissed her. She seemed to return the kiss so After I gave her a first kiss I waited for a few seconds to see If she reacts in a negative way. I gave her 2 more kisses since she didn’t say anything and she returned the kisses. But since Friday she nearly writes me back. The way how she responds is like always but she needs 3 hours to answer although she told me that she is just at home doing nothing. Before Friday she answered me within an hour. So basically my question is if I kissed her too early? Should I have waited? Should I ask her?

665," Im new to this website and would like to use it as an outlet for advice, problems, and things I want to know about. I have posted this to other reddit pages too, so I hope that isnt a problem.

As you know, I am a gay man. I am in a relationship with someone, and I need some advice. Usually in a relationship, most couples remain exclusive unless discussed by the two (open relationships). The guy I am with now claims that he loves/ is happy with me, but he is on Grindr still. I do not hook up, but I had a weird feeling to log on. Upon opening it, I checked my favorites page and it said that he was online. I checked it after a day or two and he continues to go online. I'm not trying to sound like a toxic person, just a concerned one. When were in person, he acts like a normal lover with hugs, kisses, and the normal I love you. It all sounds genuine, so should I be worried? He even goes as far as buying me gifts occasionally, which are not a factor in a relationship to me. I want to talk about this to him, but I don't know how. I would like to approach this in a relaxed manner. Any thoughts?

I have formed a question here. I don't want to seem like I'm confronting him in any manner. Just to state that I am worried

May I ask you something? This isn't meant to be a confrontational question, but I decided to check grindr one day and noticed you were on it. I noticed that this went on for a few days and it has raised a concern with me. As I have told you, I like/ love you a lot, so I want to remain loyal to you. So my question is, why do you get on it? I thought we were happy together.

Any thoughts on this?",19Jul2020,1
667,"Hey , so I’ve always been the ‘golden’ child of the family so this would all come as a huge shock to my Christian parents... I graduated Valedictorian of my class and they sent me off to an out-of-state school where basically fucked everything over . The first semester was ‘ok’ I guess - I got all ‘A’s’ and a ‘C’. The next semester though, I ended up failing all my classes due to laziness and for hanging out with my now current bf.

It’s not his fault , he has always been under the impression that I’m doing well in school.. my parents do too. Anywho, my parents and I agreed a few months back that I’ll be transferring for this next semester, but I didn’t apply to any colleges till this past June which is late as hell. Added to the fact that the chance of me getting accepted is basically 0 with my 1.2 GPA. But they DONT know that . No one does - they trust me so much because I’ve always been the reliable type. I tell them I have all A’s? They believe me. They’ve never even looked at my transcript.

Moving on, my bf and I agreed to meet up this week in July ( he’s in NY, I’m in SC) I told my mom I was going to my cousins house and see didn’t mind. The problem though, is that she checked her bank statements and since I’m attached to her account , she can see everything I’ve brought.. She hasn’t caught on to the fact that I’m in NY yet because I keep saying that I just let my ‘friend’ use my card. Also forgot to mention that she doesn’t even know I have a bf and would freak (along with my dad) if she knew was in a hotel room with him.

On Friday , she called me and I told her I’d be home by Sunday ( today) , but my bf convinced me yesterday night to stay an extra day, so I booked a flight for tomorrow and my mother just texted me telling me to come home today, but there’s no way I can since i’m 500 miles away. If she finds out , I am dead. She and my dad would be so disappointed and my ‘golden child’ image would be crushed. My extended family would no doubt find out and i’d be too embarrassed to show my face . I procrastinate so much and I know that is most of the reason where I am now, but I can’t bear the look on my parents face if they were to find out ..

The only thing I can do now is text my mom back with an excuse saying I’m staying another day, tell her I’m in NY and suffer the drastic consequence, or run away.. please give me advice",19Jul2020,1

Gradually for the past two years my mood towards certain things in my life started changing. 

Everything seems fine at glance (my relationship with my partner is amazing, I have a steady work and income and a roof over my head), but my joy towards my hobbies are fading and there other things also becoming grey. 

A few things are bothering me that I cant figure what is causing it is: 
- I get anxious the moment I start gaming. I used to be so excited when I get to my PC after work, switch it on and game for hours. But I still get excited and want to game,but the moment I get to the point of gaming a sudden wave of this weird anxious feeling creeps over my body. And I feel kind of scared? (Its not a scary game).
- The same feeling counts for other fun things that I used to do eg. My sketching, photography and woodworking = I want to do it, the happy mood of going to do it builds up, the moment of start the happiness disappears! 

- I used the be incredibly schedule driven (In the way that everything used to be almost to the moment clockwork) Wake up, watch a few YouTube videos, Shower, get dressed for work, Drink coffee, drive to work, work (which I enjoy), get home, study, exercise, eat dinner and the chill (stay home with my partner or go out for the night with my partner and friends) 

- But now I can’t even exercise everyday anymore, it feels as if all my gears are turning so slowly when I’m trying to workout 

I feel weird the past months (it has been like this before covid/lockdown), and I just dont get excited about thing anymore

675,"**My story:**  23 years ago I've been born in Austria, near Innsbruck. I had a pretty  good childhood, apart from having an alcoholic as father, did good at  school, had a decent amount of friends and ultimately graduated  gymnasium (the european equivalent to high school). After my graduation I  had some downtime and I began to apply for universities and there were  also a couple of promising opportunities ahead of me. However, my life  took a serious turn during this time. I faced money issues so I wasn't  able to transition into university. I had to cancel all my applications  and fell into a mental downward spiral... I started doing a couple of  different drugs, specifically weed and LSD, because they would make my  life sufferable and give some ""meaning"" to it, whatever that even  means... I was never really addicted to drugs, I only took them cause I  had nothing else to do, so it was quite easy for me to become clean  after 2 years of drug abuse. During that time period I had several dead  end jobs, mainly in construction. I've never held onto a job for more  than 6 months, until I got the one I currently have I held onto it for  about 2 years. It pays ok, but it is very hard labor and I hate it. In  about a month my contract runs out and I really don't want to continue,  so I will deny another contract, if they offer me one. The work I'm  doing is physically and mentally exhausting and it makes me hate every  single day of my life, the only way for me is to look for another  opportunity in my life, but I have no clue whats next. Im 23, about to  become 24 and thats quite old for someone who hasn't done anything in  his early 20s. Im basically forced to start all over again and I've been  out of school for 5 years now. There aren't really any opportunities in  my life and I probably landed in a so called ""dead end"". Nothing ahead  of me, but theres still a glimpse of hope. Any advice on what to do  next? I've already thought about ending my life, but I've sworn to  myself to atleast try something else, before going down that road. Ive thought multiple times about becoming a nurse or getting into computer science. Anyone of you had a late start in life and still managed to have a sucessful life? Do you know anyone? Sharing some of your own experiences or advice would be helpful...

So this guy and I have been talking/dating for over a year now, but he goes to college away so we only really talk during the summers. It’s casual but also not just a hookup thing you know?? But we ended up doing the deed for the first time a few days ago, where he had a bit of trouble getting it up for the longest time. It kinda worked out in the end, and I left his house on a good note. I messaged him that I was home and we texted very briefly and then... nothing. We haven’t talked for like 2 days now.

I’ve been telling my parents for weeks that they should just go back to sleeping together, so that my sister and I could have our rooms back (the house has 5 bedrooms, with 3 being unused, including the master’s bedroom). My dad keeps arguing that this is to minimize electricity costs, but I think its weirder that he doesn’t give a straight explanation why he won’t just sleep in the same bed with my mom. I, for one, know that they have a good relationship, since they’re both very religious and believes in tight-knit families (I think they’re going too far though). I’ve gotten used to living on my own since I’ve been away for college for the past 4 years, and frankly I hate how I’m stuck in a room made for two people, lest of all three people.  I also stay up late into the morning, and my parents keep going on and on about how I need to have a regular sleeping schedule (which I do have: I sleep for about 8 hours, 10 at most when I’m particularly tired.) I find it counterproductive whenever my dad wakes up to use the toilet only to find me camping out in the study room since the stuff I do may wake my mother (can’t I call my friends in peace?) He gets mad at me for staying up late and it pisses me off since I’m 21 and hardly a child anymore.

I put high importance into my own privacy and I’ve told my parents as such. My dad’s “counter” to that is “why don’t you find a job first THEN you can have your own room,” which I admit is understandable, but also believe is a Dumb As Fuck argument. This is supposed to be my home, where I know I’m sure to have privacy, but my dad takes that same comfort away by using the “you’re a freeloader in this house, so you have to live by my rules,” argument. I just finished college, and because of this pandemic, its difficult to find a job (and get a stable income from it), and I have no way to pay the bills my dad is talking about. 

I know I started this question by asking if my parents sleeping separately is weird, but that’s because its what I think is the root of why my parents won’t give my siblings and I our privacy. At this point, I’m just angry and mad that my parents aren’t trying to understand why I want to stay in my own room (for fuck’s sake, the reason why we have so many bedrooms is exactly so each of us gets our own room) without parental supervision. What should I do to get my dad to go back to staying with my mom, and finally giving my siblings and I the privacy we need?",19Jul2020,4

699,"My brother, his girlfriend, their kids, and their dog have been living with me and my parents for about a month now. During the month, I have observed that their dog is being mistreated. They rescued the dog who was supposedly abused by his previous owner (I’m not sure where, how, or when the got the dog). The dog clearly has some sort of PTSD or anxiety, which makes matters way way way worse. Anyway, here are things that I’ve noticed that I would consider mistreatments:


They put the dog in her cage whenever they are gone, and when they are sleeping, and even when they are awake and don’t want to deal with the dog. Luckily for the dog, I live in the house and will not allow her to be in the cage if they are gone. Unfortunately, I cannot take her out when they are home. She would be in her kennel for the vast majority of the day if I don’t take her out. 


They use a shock collar. I’m not sure whether or not shock collars are abusive or not, but I do know it is abusive when the kids shock her as if it is a toy or joke, which is what they do. I’ve hid the shock collar remote from them. 


They don’t take her on walks. This is pretty minuscule compared to other things, but it’s still not right. 


They will not potty train or even take the dog outside to go potty. Again, luckily I’m here or else the dog would never go outside. Not only will they not potty train her, they will punish her if she goes potty inside, which she does often. 


Speaking of training, they have not done any basic training. Again, they will punish her if she is “naughty” when basic training could teach her. When I say “punish,” I mean they will pretty aggressively drag her in her kennel and maybe a slap to the snout or the behind. 


Speaking of aggressive, my brother is far too aggressive. Along with the things listed above, he will scream at her. And it’s to the point where she is very visibly scared and anxious around him. She will pee a little whenever he yells. She will also hide. She will run to me for safety (because I’m the only one that treats her nicely). His girlfriend also yells and is a little aggressive but definitely not as much. I think she is very scared and anxious because her previous owner also treated her poorly, so she might have PTSD or something. They are clearly not fit to take care of a dog that needs extra care (or any dog really)


Speaking of being aggressive again, their kids are way too rough and aggressive with her. This mostly applies to their oldest son (9yo). He will “play fight” with her by pushing her around and slapping her and holding her to the ground and making noises. This will cause the dog to play fight back by biting (not hard) and growling and getting a little aggressive, which is normal. But the kid will then punish her for being aggressive WHEN IT IS HIS FAULT. He will literally slap her hard in the face more than once and yell NO at her. This is where I drew the line. I grabbed the kid’s arm and told him that it’s not okay to do that. He doesn’t listen.


There have been days where the dog wouldn’t have been fed if I didn’t feed her. They have also waited a few days to buy more dog food after they ran out, which meant she wasn’t fed (I gave her dog-friendly human food to hold her over). 


I’m sure there are more examples of mistreatments when I’m not around, but this is what I have observed. From the things listed above, do you think I should call the humane society to try to get the dog taken away from them and put in a better family? Here’s the thing - the dog doesn’t show any visible signs of abuse or neglect. I’m not sure if that is needed for the dog to be taken away.

702,"Am I in the wrong for hooking up with a girl that my friend is friend zoned with?

I’ve had a good circle of friends for a while that like to hit the bars on the weekends. As a consequence of partying a lot, we end up attracting new people to our group. Around a year ago we met a girl that took a liking to our group and started hanging out with us a lot. Over this period of time, one of my male friends started to catch feelings for this girl and hid them for a while. After a couple months passed, my alcohol fueled friend confessed his feeling to our new friend which he in turn got friend zoned pretty hard. She gave him the same old story of “I like you, but as a friend” and he seemed to accept it pretty quick.

A couple months later it seems that my friend has forgotten that he got friend zoned with this girl and is still as he says “passively” trying become something more with her. For a better perspective on this, this girl has said multiple times that she’s not looking to have a relationship like that with him. 

So here comes my dilemma. This weekend my friends and I got an Airbnb a couple hours away from home and hit some bars and had a lot of fun. After a lot of drinking, me and this girl that my friend likes hooked up. 

Although my friend doesn’t show that he’s upset, I’m sure he is definitely not happy about it. Would I have done this while I was sober? Probably not, but I honestly feel pretty guilty about it and don’t know if I’m actually the asshole in this situation. Is this girl supposed to be off limits to everyone that is a friend of the guy who likes this girl? Even when she has stated that she doesn’t like him that way? Or am I the asshole for being inconsiderate to my friends feelings for drunkenly hooking up with this girl?",19Jul2020,2

I’m a 19 year old trans man and I’m not out in my dads house but I am out in my mums.

It’s really uncomfortable for me because hearing my dead name is really hard and upsetting, especially when not boyfriend is over and he hears it it just makes feel so dysphoric. 

I’ve told him how I feel and he kinda acts like a terf about trans stuff and says trans women are predators which we argue about a lot but he still pretends to be supportive of me (he bitched to my mum once saying I was ruining my life and is worried about me getting top surgery as he feels it is “mutilation”). 

My parents are separated because he had an affair and I know ive painted my dad In bad light so far but this was years ago and he has genuinely been mostly a great parent. He is still dating the woman 
She comes from a rural part of Poland (famous anti LGBT laws rn in place there too )
He won’t let me come out because of her because he worries she will be rude and unsupportive. 

She’s also been incredibly rude to me esp during quarantine as she worked in the kitchen on her laptop I’d catch her watching me make food and staring with evil eyes
She always sighs when she sees me cooking my own food, as it’s a mess but I genuinely don’t mind cleaning and do it always 
She’s made a few comments On my weight too which makes me really insecure that I don’t feel ok to talk about online in detail

transphobic and uneducated has learnt so much and become a great support and helping me with gender clinic stuff but he just wants to control my transition it feels and even sabotage)

705,"Tell me if this is actually for r/legaladvice. Hopefully it's not.

My roommate and I are discussing move-in plans to our off-campus, but there's been a major problem. She comes from a state doing considerably bad in terms of virus mitigation, I do not. My mom has suggested that she get tested and quarantine herself for two weeks before I move in, something she finds reasonable. Her guardian, who controls a lot of her financial decisions, does not. The guardian okay with her getting tested before she moves into the apartment but doesn't see a need for her to quarantine two weeks before I move in, mostly because my roommate has a job and she wants her to be there for as long as possible. As her current move-in date stands, quarantining herself for two weeks would make my move-in date the night before classes start. Furthermore, the day my classes start, my family is moving my sister in to her first year of college. Even further, I've been having family issues that are best resolved by me moving out.

In my roommate's words, my guardian doesn't care about me and my need to settle in, only her daughter's. My roommate wants to come in earlier, but her guardian makes the financial decisions and won't let her fly up early enough for her to quarantine.

Some extra details:

* We both pay half of rent.
* I live within driving distance, but not within commuting distance.
* I already have my keys to the apartment. She does not.
* When the virus hit, I helped my roommate out by bringing all of her stuff off-campus and to the apartment.
* My roommate's guardian has no trouble bringing in legal action.
* The state we're moving to has a travel advisory for her state, but not for mine. The travel advisory asks for a two-week quarantine.
* I can't move in earlier because my parents won't let me.
* Yes, all of our parents are that strict.",19Jul2020,1

It is not my dog but I am often cleaning after it. We both work full time but i still find time to hoover, dust, mop, wipe and do what I can around the house.

708,"I’m having serious problems with feeling very guilty about my home life. 

Backstory: my sister in law and mother in law have lived together, splitting costs, for a while now. The harsh economy makes it easier to do this but they are very much like house mates. My father in law and husband bought a business together in June last year, and my father in law moved up to our city for the business. So, he found a bigger house and him, my mom in law and sister in law moved into the house. After a month he mentioned that he always assumed we would all be living together to cut costs and to run the business. My husband and I were living in the same city, but in a lovely home of our own. 

Since buying the business, my husband has taken a salary once. I was basically paying for a lot of his operating expenses out of my own pocket. Up until December, when my salary ran out, he would borrow money from his sister for food etc. I paid back all the money using my Christmas bonus, a massive chunk. 


So in December, my sister in law wrote me a letter suggesting that my husband and I move into their home with them, so that WE can save money and cut down expenses. I had no idea they were struggling financially. My mom in law had lost her job and her final paycheck was in December. Anyway, in the letter she stated an amount including food, rent, electricity, cable and WiFi. From month one I paid nearly double, and consistently more than we discussed. More than when we lived alone. My father in law went back to his city for another work opportunity and assumed it would be ok because we had moved in, but the original amount was calculated taking his share of the rent into account. 

Fast forward to Covid - the business isn’t running anymore, I’m owed tens of thousands that I’m hoping to get when the business is sold, which is in progress. I have 3 jobs, working 14-16 hour days. I have no life, I sleep, eat and work. My sister in law has had a paycut and my mom in law is unemployed. I’m paying thousands extra on rent, towards my mom in laws bills, and on groceries. We have got everything we need food wise, and then some, but I am fortunate to still have money. I bought myself some things that I’ve wanted for a long time, because I’ve picked up extra work, and haven’t had spare money for the last 3 years because of the business and carrying general expenses. I’m immigrating when travel bans are lifted and my money won’t go too far once converted, and I really just wanted to feel like all the work I do isn’t for nothing and can have something to show for it. 

My question is, am I garbage for buying myself stuff while my household is struggling to pay their own personal bills? I give all the money to my sister in law to distribute and thought all the important things were covered but today realized my mom in law had ran out of antidepressants, which I thought was taken care of. I feel like a terrible person knowing that I bought things I didn’t need this month and that she didn’t have enough meds to last the whole month.",19Jul2020,1

712,"I'm not even sure how to approach this so this may be kind of scattered. If you want to skip the drama, skip to the bold paragraph. My mother and father separated in 2009 with additional legal considerations which had a subsequent trial. Full custody was given to my mother.

In the summer of 2011 I went to stay at my father's for a week. I hated living with my mother, and didn't want to go back. So I stayed at my dads (I was 12 at the time, so technically not old enough to make my own decisions).

That summer I was set to go to a summer camp which was paid for by my grandfather. I had been there once before and it was a blast. It is by far one of my most fond memories from my childhood. The second time I was to go though, because I decided to move to my dads, my mother decided to tell my grandfather that I decided not to go.

Years later when I brought this up to her she insisted it was due to a lack of communication (although she never reached out to me, which she could have done through facebook). This isn't really important to the thread but it shows her vindictive nature.

Fast forward to now, I am living again at my mothers, as living with my father wasn't much better in some respects. The main reason I moved here was for my two younger siblings. Since I've moved here my mother has become increasingly emotionally abusive, and me and my two younger siblings all noticed this independently. When we try to talk to her about it, she blows up at us and spins it around.

COVID-19 has put a lot of pressure on things. My mother has always been anti-vax, but since this pandemic started she's become anti-mask too. I went for a rural road trip by myself to get away from her, I was gone for just over a day. When I got back she tried to kick me out telling me to self isolate citing a non-existant law. Mean while, she was going to parties with 20+ people including those in the medical industry.

This caused a lot of drama between me and my mother, as well as my siblings and my mother. I tried to keep it separate. I don't want my issues with my mother contributing to my younger siblings emotions. They look up to me and I don't want to inadvertently influence their decisions. I want them to make choices in their own best interests.

**Because of this drama though**, my younger sister decided unbeknownst to me at the time to go through my mothers documents, and facebook messages. She uncovered quite a few concerning things. When I was living with my dad, there were multiple bizarre occasions, such as having our mailbox shot with the bullet trajectory pointed towards our house, coming home to obvious signs of a break in with nothing stolen. In the messages my sister found one instance where my mother was talking to an old friend who said something along the lines of ""I've been thinking of going to his house to fuck him up, I'm pretty sure I know where he lives"" to which my mother responded with our exact address.

Another concerning thing that my sister found was documents related to my sister's physchology evaluation by the school. My mother tried to paint the picture of ""emotional dysregulation"" and attributed it to her father, and to her older brother (me). She said that I intentionally set the woods on fire with gasoline. There was an instance with a fire when I was 10, but it was not at all intentional, and it scared the shit out of me. I called my mom crying when it happened. I was also home alone when it happened, so the only way it affected my siblings was the stories my mother repeatedly told. The fact that she twisted the story so intentionally just to make it seem like my sister was troubled is really what fucked with me the most.

My mother has constantly painted this picture that her children were messed up. She would verbally abuse my little sister, following her through the house screaming at her, and when she'd do anything back my mother would flip out and act like she was a violent criminal, and would kick her out into a group home. My little sister hasn't lived in a place longer than a year since I've moved out because my mom keeps kicking her out and then bringing her back.

What I'm concerned about now, is my mother has always seemed to have a way with cops. She always has used them to her advantage. There were so many instances where we'd be driving home and there would just be a random police checkpoint along the backroads near our house (we've always lived really rural. There's never police checkpoints on those roads) that would leave as soon as we went through. She's the type of person to feign being shoved if you try and walk past her and she's blocking your path. She's threatened to call the cops if I drive my little brother (13) around anymore. We've been stuck at the house for nearly 7 months. We go for drives to break up the monotony of things. My brother and sister both want to move to my dads, and both are old enough to make that decision. Yet I find myself scared. I'm worried of what my mother might try and do if we all leave. She seems to hate her kids yet simultaneously needs control over them.

Furthermore, I'm concerned about having interactions with the police. Being around police gives me extreme anxiety. I'm not sure where exactly that comes from, but it's something I've always dealt with. I don't want them to even know my name.

I realize parts of this probably sound paranoid, and that's part of the problem too. I feel myself almost going insane. I don't know even who to trust anymore, and I feel like I've been stuck with a lot of responsibility that I'm not equipped for.",19Jul2020,1
713,"/Sorry for my bad English./

So, one of my best friends (F) who's 15 years old is dating this man who's in his 30's. She's been dating older guys in the past and says older dudes attract her the most (she got some bad habits from them like drinking and smoking), she is really sexual (especially for her age) and she has recently told me that she already lost her virginity.
They met online and have been dating for at least 3 months, she would take a 30 minutes ride to the other city to meet him and was telling me they ""hang out"". She trusts me a lot, we've basically been friends for our entire lifes; she constantly tells me how she gets wasted and how she tries to hide it from her parents when she gets home. She's suffered through mental illnesses, had trouble eating and self harmed, some of her family members are very aggressive and arrogant (from what she tells me, they're pretty nice around me, though I've heard them shouting at eachother through mic when we were playing videogames). She still has family issues and doesn't want to talk it out with her parents, like, at all, and is sure they are devilish people who hate her.
At some point I stopped caring about her underage drinking, I was more concerned about her mental health and was supporting her at everything, I'd make sure she's happy, we were spending lot's of time outside together, having full day walks and stuff. And once, while we were sitting on a bench at the park she took something out her bag and tried unpacking it. I saw some black belts, I asked her what is this stuff and she told me it's a fucking BDSM set, and that it's going to be used on her by that old dude. I didn't react and we eventually stopped discussing this subject. I remember her sometime telling me how she wants to be abused and humiliated.
It's just so confusing to me, her being sexually active at her age; she told me some disturbing shit like ""it's okay for kids to have sex if they're using protection"" and stuff like that. I want her to be okay and she doesn't even care about having a job when she grows up, saying she won't not able to work (???) and that she's rather just live with some guy who'll make money for her. I also noticed that she began overreacting to any tactical connection, like when our hands meet when we're walking or when a stranger's shoulder meets hers. I don't know, at one point she acts like a perverted rude asshole, but then she's like the most loving and supportive person I know and I'm really confused if I should do something. She doesn't really seem happy with that pedophile, she told me he reads her texts when she leaves her phone somewhere, that she shouts at her sometimes, that he's rude to her and shit. If I tell her parents she will most likely think I betrayed her, and we'll be studying in the same classroom for the next 3 years. I want to help her so she doesn't have trouble socialising in the future, or get sexually assaulted by one of her boyfriends. What should I do??",19Jul2020,2
716,"My mom is 68 years old. Last winter (around January 2020) she had a horrible bout with the seasonal flu. I caught her in the living room slouched over not able to breathe. She could not walk more than a few steps without feeling like she was going to pass out. I was screaming for her to say something back to me when she slouched over and she was unresponsive outside of her trying to breathe and it really felt like that was the end. When she got to the hospital, her oxygen levels were extremely low. She ended up having flu and a sinus infection. It took her between 3-4 weeks to recover. It was the worst I've ever seen her.

She got better. But, my entire family pretends like this never happened. And Im worried now with everything that's going on. She's constantly goes to various places. She's wearing a mask but, you should really only be going out to get food or groceries. Last month, she accepted a part-time job where she drives a man (an acquaintance she knew beforehand) to his hospital visits as well as driving him around to get various things he needs. Im obviously not cool with this but, my family or my mom doesn't listen to anything I say so, there's nothing I can do.

Today, my mom's doctor called and asked her to come in for a test for pneumonia. My mom does cough everynight when she sleeps but, that's been going on for years. So, I'm not sure if the doctor wants to check that out or if my mom is feeling bad and called the doctor. She wouldn't explain and when I inquired further, she got mad at me for stressing her out. I know she HAD to go to the hospital but, I'm worried she's going to be around a bunch of sick patients and put herself more at risk.

My aunt (who works at the hospital) said I was being ridiculous for being upset with her taking a job to drive the man around. She said I was being a child and not a real adult for wanting my mom to stay in the house all the time or for me wanting to stay in the house all the time. Which I don't. I just don't think you should be going anywhere that's not needed. And I've slowed down going out to not bring back a virus to someone who's nearly 70 years old. She said I was stupid to be worried about her going to the hospital today. Lastly, she said I was stupid because I won't build ""immunity"" if im stuck in the house.

It feels like I'm in the Twilight Zone. Its like none of them remember I found her almost comatose in the winter. And my aunt (not really my aunt, she's my mom's niece but, i call her aunt because she's decades older, she's really a cousin) really irritated me with her comments. If something happens to my mom, she's not going to give a shit really. She'll go on with her life. But that will destroy me and my siblings. I have no desire to talk to my aunt right now because I know Im going to say some really evil things to her.

717,"Okay, so I know all the rd flags that are gonna pop up here. I met a girl online through okcupid, who apparently doesn't live in my area but Alabama (I'm in Cali). We started talking and after about two days she started talking about money and stuff. That she's been out of  a job for 7 weeks, doesn't have money for food and asked for groceries. Times are hard and corona is a real thing so I sent her 75$, no problem. The problem that I'm asking for advice for is when she started to ask me to pay her over due rent and rent for next month, a total of 1300$ and is claiming her landlord is harassing her for sex in exchange for rent. Now I've only been talking to her for a couple days, so I don't know her. I ""can't"" call her to talk cause she sold her iphone X for rent money and now has an old iphone 4 thats on 2g, and can't video chat because it doesn't ""work"" or something. She sends photos through the messaging on ig but they're older photos and that's about it, so I have no real way to confirm if she's the actual person or if it is her and she's just scamming me.

I've struggled with not having friends/ relationships, bullying, anxiety, financial/ family in the past, but from a wider perspective, like people struggling to put food on the table, it's been good.

727,"so, i’m a 16 year old girl and all my life my dad has been not only my hero, but also my best friend. I have this special bond with my parents, and i literally can tell them everything which i’m really grateful for. Now, 2 years ago, i saw a message on my dad’s phone pop up from a random woman saying:”why not?” i freaked, and from then the only thing i knew was to overthink. 

In those two years for a few more times i saw on his snapchat a woman icon, once he deleted an instagram message (pretty sure of it) and that was about it. 

Now this year, i saw (in my mum’s phone, accidentally while going through her gallery) messages between my dad and some random woman, well i guess they were flirting, but they never met up because he regret it all immediately. These were messages from a year ago(funny thing is i saw them a year later on the very same date.)he’s very open about it and when i wanna talk to him about it he’s more than willing to do so, and once he told me:”when u realize what u can lose from doing something stupid.’ 

And i fully respect him for realizing that, well the first time i ever saw him crying was when i talked to him about it, saying:”do you really think i would ever genuinely cheat on ur mum?” And he said:”if u were curious u should have just went into my phone to see the chat”(he said that when i was talking about the first time i suspected)basically, fast forward to now, this year i only got mad because again, i am pretty sure i saw a woman’s icon on my dad’s snapchat, but i think he deleted it, maybe it’s because he knows i would overthink it like i overthink everything, and i got mad at him for that, he deleted snap from than cuz he was kind of tired of me always being paranoid and all..for all i know, it could have just been a friend, it doesn’t matter anyways. 

i guess keeping quiet for almost a year and not knowing what it really was caused a lot of trust issues, but now i openly talk to my mum and dad about it. When i talked to my mum, she said:”u don’t get some things right now, you’re still a child but as you grow up you will realize not everyone is perfect, no marriage is perfect, but your father is an amazing husband and man” and she added: “do you ever think i would stay with your dad if he did cheat on me?” my mum literally doesn’t have a problem with that, because she knows her self worth and would really leave him if he did cheat ever, he’s also not the typical dad, he’s always been there for us, and i could always tell him everything, weather it was any girl problem, my mum is pretty much free almost always when my dad is home because he stays with us so she can rest, etc, all in all he’s amazing, really, and i have this special relationship with him. 

And this all hurts me, i know i should believe my mum and dad, and i think he never did cheat, possibly flirt, yes. 

I know everyone has flaws, and i know i’m the kid here, i shouldn’t really have to interfere in these stuff because my parents seem happier than ever yet i’m afraid for some reason. From the moment i first saw this (those woman or whatever, weren’t the same person) i felt like i couldn’t look at my dad the same way and it hurts because he’s amazing and i know for a fact that everyone has flaws, and i don’t know why i can’t get over everything yet my parents are just perfectly fine, as my mum says, maybe i’m just too young to understand. 

But i don’t want to look at my dad a different way because of these things, i don’t want to feel this way because he really is my everything and i really hope i can soon get over all of this, especially because this is a very unclear situation, sorry that this is so long😂",19Jul2020,1

730,"For a bit of backstory: after lockdown started in my country i got really anxios about going outside, so I pretty much stayed in my room for 4 months straight. Of course this affected my health, i started being really nauseous all the time, i could berally get out of bed in the morning and I was eating way too little. My grandma heard about this and said that I could come stay at her place for awhile, since no one will come into the backyard so I could exercise and just stay outside. I ended up going to her place and everything was going pretty well, untill a few days ago when she started yelling and getting really angry from the smallest things and having breakdowns for no reason. I talked to her about how this is bothering me, but she just told me that im ungratefull and overall denyed everything. Fast forward to today: i have spoken to her about how i want to leave since im feeling really stressed out with her. At first she made passive agressive comments, nothing I couldn’t ignore, but then, while I was packing my bags she called me into her room and said that she’s sorry and that her house is my house also and that if i want to come back I allways can. She also started crying. I know me saying that this is manipulation sounds like im not giving her room to grow, but I know the kind of person she is and that she never takes accauntability for her own actions. I cant help but think that she started crying so that I would think twice about leaving.",19Jul2020,2
731,"Hey guys! Hope you're well! How's your summer going?

I'm currently majoring in Accounting, doing super well .. but just not happy. I've studied STEM based learning in all previous years of higher education (Grade 11 and Quebec college). I took a bet on business school as I wanted to learn some general principals of accounting and finance for life, so if I'd ever start my own business, I'd be ready to implement the knowledge I've gained. 

Turns out, I'm not super interested in what I'm studying. I'm getting lots of As, but I don't like what I'm learning (I'm one year in). I also don't like how heavy a part group projects have in the overall course grade breakdown (somewhere between 30-60% overall). I often have to carry my group. I know it's representative of life, I'm cool with that, I just hate the volatility of my grades, as my overarching goal is med/dent school. Moreover, my faculty has a curving policy that forces our class averages to remain between B+ and B-.. really depends on how much the prof likes/hates us! 

I've been really interested to transfer back to sciences. The mere thought of going back to business makes me fee a little sick.

I'm interested in transferring to the following programs, to give me an employable major along with the opportunity to proceed to med school at a later date (possibly). 

1. CS/BIO joint major -&gt; I'm fairly strong at math, haven't really coded anything other than HTML/CSS/PHP, and bio is somewhat interesting to me. 

2. Civil engineering -&gt; I liked physics a lot in CEGEP. The idea of planning working in an office environment along with field exposure and experience cool to me. I love construction sites. I think I'd be pretty good at this major. I'm strong at math.

3. Kine -&gt; easiest major of them all, a lot of easy-A courses, most likely my best chance to get a 4.0 GPA and a small bit of knowledge for med school. It's not employable, and I'd most likely need to pursue another degree of med doesn't work out. High risk, high reward, but low difficulty. I'm super interested in physiatrist type jobs. 

4. Stay in the business school (McGill).

For CE and CS/BIO, I'd have to beg the faculties (at McGill) to let me in. I have a very strong academic record, even stronger volunteer + work experience (currently run a family business at 21). 

Essentially, I want to get past this stage of insecurity, of not knowing where I'll be in a few months time. I just want to love what I study, to wake up in the morning and be down to learn. 

I'm the first one out of my family and friends to go to uni.. I don't really have anyone to ask/confide/discuss this with. What are your thoughts? 

Thanks!!!

&amp;nbsp;  

About a week ago I broke up with my GF of five years. We still live together and it's been a hard week. We're trying to figure out how to remain friends and live as roommates for now, which is a challenge.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Enter my best friend.  
&amp;nbsp;  

After we split my friend started messaging my ex asking if she needed to talk and such. It seemed sweet at first, like he was trying to be a good friend to her, but the messages gradually took a weird turn over the following days. He eventually told her that he has an open marriage and even had his wife message her to confirm that fact. It's blatantly obvious he was trying to hook up with her.  
&amp;nbsp;  

I didn't know that my friend and his wife have an open marriage although I had suspected something was going on for a while. Finding out for sure helps connect a few dots, like why he once asked a coworker of mine if she had any single friends. Supposedly he once told me when I was drunk and I didn't take that news well. I don't remember any of it though and my reaction seems weird because I'm one of the most open minded people I know these days. Maybe it was a long time ago, when I was still on the fence about such things? Who knows?  
&amp;nbsp;  

Anyway reddit, I'm not sure what to do with this and could use some advice. I've caught him up in some shady shit before and let it go because, well, everyone has their faults. I let him have his and pretended I didn't notice because it wasn't worth our friendship. This is a whole new level of messed up though and struck me as downright predatory. I mean, trying to get into my emotionally vulnerable ex's pants less than 72 hours after we split? Who does that?

738,"I’m 21, I live with my mom and stepdad. For my whole life I have hated being touched. I don’t hug my friends, I don’t like to hug my family (though I see them once a year so I do just to avoid being rude). The only time I like physical contact is from my romantic partner or my pets. 

So for 21 years of my life I have asked my mom to not touch me, not poke me, not to hug me or touch my hair when I get a haircut. She doesn’t listen and just continues to do it. It’s absolutely never sexual of course, I just like my personal space and she doesn’t take no for an answer. We used to get in physical fights, if I was being told off she would barge in my room and throw her weight around so we used to get in a lot of physical fights. Most of the time those started when she would push her way into my room and I would get so enraged I would lash out. She’s no better and when she gets angry she breaks things, throws things etc but yet when I get angry and slam a door I get told off but she doesn’t think it’s a problem for her to do the same. I don’t know what to do about it. Recently we’ve been arguing about it. I think she’s very emotionally manipulative, if she doesn’t get her own way she cries and guilt trips me to do whatever it is she wants. If that doesn’t work she threatens to kick me out even though I have no where to go, or she used to take my stuff, cut off my phone bill, break my stuff. I honestly just think she’s pathetic, and the older I get the more I think that. She has no self esteem, has never been single the whole time I’ve known her, engaged 4 times to anyone who will have her and I just look at her and think she’s absolutely pathetic but I don’t want to think that about my mom. 

I think she hates me, she often says she does when we argue. My dad was abusive to her while she was pregnant with me and living with my dad and my brother (who wasn’t his kid) and was 5yo in Canada. My dad threatened my family with poison and threw my brother against a wall and said my mom has to move to England (where we live now). She left my brother in Canada and moved here when I was 10 months old. After I was born she became pregnant again with my sister who was stillborn because of the abuse from my dad while she was pregnant. And every damn time we argue she says I’m the reason her life is shit, it’s my fault she left her son. She’s never said it but I think she hates that I lived and my sister didn’t because maybe my sister would be more loving. She moved out and left me with my dad who was abusive to me too. My earliest memories in life are my dad making my bedroom into a weed farm and I had to sleep in there, him holding me up against the wall by my neck and him using my toothbrush to clean the bathroom, all of which happened when I lived alone with him. 

Maybe I have residing hate for my mom for leaving me with him when she knew he was abusive? But I’m a very forgiving person, I never have issues with people and I’m always happy to get along with them after they did me wrong so I doubt that’s it. I think my real issue is the aftermath of when I moved in with her. She had a boyfriend for 8 years who’s kids would pinch me and write stuff in my handwriting to get me in trouble, and her boyfriend would do stuff to get me in trouble too (an example is fill the bath with toilet roll and say I did it). Her and said boyfriend would go on holiday all over the world, my mom has over 100 stamps in her passport from the time she was with him and I have 2 because she would leave me at friends houses because he didn’t want me there and she was okay with that. They split up and she wasn’t with anyone serious for a while but always had flings and I had loads of guys in and out of the house every few months there was a new one. One she got engaged to, the 8 year partner she was too and she was married to my dad so that makes 3 times she got engaged. 

Well along comes number 4, and I hate him more than any partner before. I’m transgender (I was born a girl) and he is homophobic, and always says I transitioned because I was threatened by him being the man of the house, and he has some weird masculinity complex where everything is a competition with me. He’s bigger, stronger, more superior in every way to me in his mind and it’s so boring to me? I literally don’t care about him. I tried to be nice in my older years as I was 14 when they met, but he holds grudges like his life depends on it. At 21 he still hates me for the way I talk to my mom when me and her have always had the kind of relationship where we swear and argue because we both have very big personalities but it’s normally not an issue and 20 minutes later it’s like nothing happened, yet he still brings it up 2 weeks later. He always gets involved. He talks about me constantly, goes in my room when I’m not home and looks around it, follows me (as an example he will poke his head around the garden door while I do the recycling to “make sure I’m doing it right”, he puts me down, calls me a ginger cunt, used to say I wasn’t a real man and he’d never see me as one and a bunch of other problematic things. But his excuse is he “hates how I talk to my mom” when she talks to me the same way, the reason I speak to her like that is because that’s how I was brought up and me and her don’t even think it’s rude half the time, AND he talks to her horribly? Says to shut up to her, calls her fat when they argue and always talks down to her. Those are minor problems to the fact that he’s assaulted me 3 times and threatened me waaay more. The first time he physically assaulted me I was 17. I wasn’t taking testosterone and I still had boobs, but I get hot and my room was on the top floor and they never came upstairs. So I would lay in bed shirtless because I would overheat and I get claustrophobic in clothes. One day I found out my surgery to have my breast tissue removed (that caused lots of emotional upset as well as ruining my back by being compressed in a binder) was postponed and would likely take a year longer. I was upset, and my dog had died a few days before, so I took our other dog to my room to cuddle her because I was crying. He knew my surgery story and why I was upset but came upstairs and started pulling the cover off of me, I told him I was naked underneath and he still kept pulling the duvet to get the dog. Eventually he got very close to seeing my bottom half so I kicked him to get him off of me. He then grabbed me by the leg and pulled me out of my bed and onto the floor. I got up and pushed him out of my room and slammed the door on him and he couldn’t get it open. (He’s 6”1 and very big and I’m 5”9 and of course born female. He climbs those electricity pilons for a living so is strong too. He wears an XL and at the time I wore a M for size reference). This was the first time we had a physical fight and he was surprised I was able to hold my own and actually stronger than him. He told my mom I swore at him on the phone and left out the part about him seeing a biologically female under the age of 18 naked because he used force to remove me from my bed after knowing I was naked. My mom forgave him for this about 3 days after the incident. Fast forward 3 years and we moved house. I was up a ladder, which is 10ft high as we have a 12ft high ceiling home. He decided to push me off the top of the ladder and started tilting it when my mom walked in and saw and he stopped. I don’t know what would have happened if she didn’t come in but he claims it was a joke. We don’t joke because we don’t look at each other let alone speak. About a week after the ladder incident we were hanging a new ceiling light with like 10 bulbs on it and he put it up and has no idea about interior design so he put them in a big cirlcle and it looked weird. So I said I would fix it and because of his masculinity complex he wouldn’t let us as “he’s the man of the house he makes the decisions”. Well he went out so me and my mom changed it while he was gone but he came home while I was half way through. We got in a verbal argument which led to me getting up and saying in a calm voice “go away” and I lightly shut the door on him. It’s glass so I saw him charge at the door so I pushed it to keep it shut, and after about 30 seconds of pushing it he got through, grabbed me and threw me by my neck into the solid brick wall where I smashed my head into it. I didn’t fight back I only pushed him off of me, and he grabbed at me again and threw me into the adjacent wall and again I smashed my head into that one too. Then he stood up and said he didn’t touch me to my mom even though she saw the whole thing. He just stood there saying “I didn’t do anything” “I didn’t lay a finger on him” “he started it” which got me angry because he was lying to my face gaslighting me, and I hadn’t even fought back. But the way he was stood there laughing and saying he didn’t do anything made me so angry I punched him in the stomach. I can’t remember why happened after that but there was a hammer waved around at someone my either my mom or stepdad (can’t remember much after hitting my head and it was all a blur) and eventually the police came and made him stay somewhere else for the night. They asked if he had ever done anything like that before and I lied because I didn’t want the fact that I pressed charges to affect my moms marriage. He still a year later hasn’t apologised to me at all apart from once in front of the police, which he then came home and argued with me the next day. I wanted my mom to leave him. She should have left him, I sure as hell would have the first time he assaulted me, never mind the 3rd time, and between the 3 assaults there have been raised fists, he’s told my mom he wants to kick my head in, he’s said he was going to push me down the stairs etc. The reason I told you that long story is because it gives context as to why I hate my own mom. 

I hate her because she relies on men to make her feel complete. I hate her because she chooses men over me repeatedly. I hate her because she is emotionally manipulative. I hate her because she doesn’t understand boundaries. I hate her because she blames me for choices she made when I wasn’t even born. 

I don’t want her to touch me because I hate her. 

I don’t want to hate my mother, if she actively set out to be a good parent to me, listened to my needs, didn’t try to emotionally manipulate me, listened to me when I talked to her, didn’t disregard boundaries I set about myself I wouldn’t hate her and would be happy to forgive and have a good relationship with her. We still get along, we watch movies and go shopping together, have a laugh but I don’t want her to touch me. I’m repulsed by her touch. Hers because I hate her deep down even though I try every day to give her another chance and every day we end up arguing. I hate other people’s touch probably because I was abused. But she doesn’t listen and insists on poking me, touching my leg or arm or hair and tries to guilt me into having a touchy relationship with her when that is unnatural to me after not doing it my whole life. I tell her it’s my body and I am the only one who gets to have a say in what happens to it but she thinks her need for physical contact providing her comfort is more important than me needing to not feel uncomfortable. I get it and I would hate it if my kid didn’t want to touch me when I have one but I would still respect that boundary. 

What should I do to get her to understand? She doesn’t listen when I talk to her and her and my dickhead of a stepdad are both telling me to move out if I don’t like it and that I’m being rude for getting angry about my boundaries that she very clearly knows exist because I tell her on an almost daily basis not to cross them.",19Jul2020,1
739,"Me and this girl have been talking through out the day for the past like week and a bit, and I’ve told her that she’s very pretty and we should hang out sometime which she’s agreed too, she lives about 2 hours away so not too bad. Anyways we both say that we’d like to hang out and get to know each other better, but she told me if I’m looking for a girlfriend I shouldn’t with her, I explained my reasoning and just said that she seems really cool and that I just got outta 3 year relationship where my ex constantly cheated on me and she’s the first girl I’ve talked since and shit, she then explained that she’s wants to get to know me better and she’s going through a really hard time and doesn’t want to jump into anything and she wants to start out as friends, so I’m not sure if we have the same thing in mind because I told her I didn’t see it as a rejection and we’d just work towards something when we’re both ready or am I getting friend zoned, this was about 2 days okay and we’re still talking just fine, now she’s been reading my messages and not responding until way later, and doesn’t seem as interested in hanging out, maybe I’m reading to far into it and getting too attached but idk, she lives about 3 hours away, but when I do my tarot reading and shit, like it always seems good for us because I’m very spiritual person so idk anymore",19Jul2020,1

743,"I went to a pool party recently (everybody's temp was checked beforehand, and yes I know I probably should not have gone), and my (F) friend (let's call her A) invited her new girlfriend (I'll call her K) over as well. When we were in the pool, K was constantly holding/touching A. I've known A for quite awhile and I know how she is, and when K was constantly grabbing onto her she seemed unsure about it but went along with the touching/holding. K's behavior made me and I think a few others in the pool uncomfortable. This went on the whole time.

Another thing is, I was one of the only straight girls in the pool. K at one point said, ""Honestly, lesbian relationships turn out waaaay better than heterosexual relationships.""

744,"I've been told to post this here.

I'm a 25 year old guy living alone in Austria, I don't have any friends IRL and I don't have a partner. So basically all of my social interactions that don't involve work, happen online.

I have multiple online friends from all over the world, Australia, America, England, Russia etc. I have about 5 people I talk to every day online. I've met most of them here on Reddit. One of them is a guy and the rest are girls, it's not that I specifically decided to have more female friends, it's just that most guys I've met online lost interest in the friendship and we gradually grew apart. They're all between the ages of 20-27,  The longest I've known one of them is about 17 Months and the shortest one is 5 months

Now, I myself do struggle with some issues like anxiety and years of depression, so I don't expect them to be 100% okay all of the time. But I would never consider suicide, that has never been an option for me, and I don't understand anyone who seriously considers it.

Now I don't mind listening to peoples issues, and I do care about them. I take it very seriously when they mention suicide and it really weighs heavily on me, it instantly makes me extremely worried for them and it makes me feel like every word I say/send will be the last they'll ever hear/read. I'm extremely afraid of saying something wrong and making everything worse and ""causing"" them to go through with it. I would 100% blame myself if it ever happened. I've read through many guides on what to say to suicidal people, but a lot of them involve physically being there for someone and doing things with them, but since i live nowhere near them, I can't really do that. I've suggested doing things with them online like playing a game or watching a movie together, but they usually just decline when they have these moments.

They don't always just straight up say they'll commit suicide, it's often just a small reference to it. But I have asked them all and they all said they do mean it on some level.

It's making me dread every notification I see from them since I always imagine that the next message could just be ""goodbye"" or ""I just took a bunch of pills"" or whatever, it's just making me extremely anxious most of the day, and I don't have anyone I can talk to about this because I don't have any friends besides the online ones. I've tried making friends IRL too, but it hasn't been working out. I've considered talking to my parents about it, but they probably don't think that online friendships are Real anyway.

I don't know what to do. One part of me just wants to distance myself from them, but I can't do that. I don't want to leave my friends alone with their issues. Can anyone help me out here? I'm lost and I don't know if I can keep doing this, I'm becoming more anxious and worried by the day and it's starting to affect my work performance because it's just occupying my mind.

I hope this post is at least somewhat readable, I appreciate any advice.",19Jul2020,2

746,"When I was 14, my dad found out that I saw my first sexual image online. It was more softcore than hardcore, just to be clear. I remember him returning home from work on a school and angrily storming down the basement steps. I could hear the steps rumbling with every step that he took. He approached me on the couch without saying ""How was school?"" or ""How are you doing?"" or anything along those lines and immediately berated and belittled me for seeing my first sexual image online. He made me feel like it was unnatural. After 2 minutes of him yelling nonstop, he left without allowing for any discussion.

Was his parenting okay or could he have handled that situation differently? It was years ago, but that incident still haunts me.

He never was the kind of parent I could turn to for any kind of emotional support. When I was bullied in middle school, I told him about it and he laughed and said, ""Good. I would've laughed at you too."" What kind of a parent takes the side of his own child's bully?

Even when I went to him for help with homework, he always made me feel stupid and discouraged, so I stopped going to him for homework help eventually. When I told my mom about how discouraged he makes me feel, she replied, ""That's just the way he is.""",19Jul2020,1
748,"I had been in a couple of abusive relationships and got pregnant the year after I graduated from university (the relationship had been a couple of years). The father ended up being physically abusive and I left for good when our daughter was about 3. 

I had been friends with 'Jay' since school and we started a relationship and got married two years later. It's now been over ten years.

So basically, Jay has a physical disability. He now admits that he thought he would never be in a relationship. He admits that what he did was to pretend to be a certain personality so that we would get married as we were already friends. Do cute surprises. You like Star Trek? OMG me too!! We were not living together so I guess it was easier to keep up the charade. Maybe I shouldn't have been taken in, but how could I have guessed someone would do that.

Before we got married we had a couple of sessions of marriage guidance and a couple of sessions of individual therapy to make sure we both knew what we were getting into getting married. He admits now that he just said what I wanted to hear.

We are from a conservative place and after the ink was dry on the marriage certificate he basically flipped the script and what he wanted was a 1950s housewife. The 21st century guy was gone. His family are the most awful people I've ever met, he allows them to be rude and cruel to me but thank God we haven't seen any of them since Christmas due to Corona.

He has zero communication skills. His tool of choice is the silent treatment. He will never talk about anything to do with feelings or anything. If you talk to him he will literally sit and watch you cry and say nothing. The next day he will pretend the conversation never happened. He is always fake jolly, saying 'rise and shine' and 'opsie daisy' , 'new episode of X show tonight, yay!' Dozens of times literally this pattern has repeated, so I've given up trying to talk with him.

Long story short it turns out that since he was 18 he's been using prostitutes as he thought he would never be in a relationship due to his disabilities. He just carried on when we were married. I never withheld sex or anything but I think he just liked the dynamic of never having to give and to only take pleasure in bed. A very selfish lover.

I found out. He cried and promised to change etc.

He has been to therapy for about a year. That's all we could afford. Fuck knows what they talked about but he's the same.

It's been three years since I found out and since then we've barely had sex because he says 'he is ashamed'. I don't think he is a still seeing prostitutes. 

It all came out when he had a nervous breakdown. He said it was from the stress of keeping the secret. That's why I believe he has stopped, simply because he doesn't want to risk another breakdown.  Even in lockdown he's been home 24/7 for months. His parents blamed me. They found out because he had the breakdown when they were there. Crying on the floor and everything. Luckily my child was at a summer camp at the time.

I refuse to do housework. I tidy up after myself, no more. I said basically I didn't get what I wanted from the marriage, so you won't either.

I know the usual Reddit answer is 'divorce!1!' but there are several reasons why I can't.



- I can't afford to live alone with me and my child. When I left my child's father I remember shivering cold, and trying to keep the little one warm with a coat on the bed and skipping meals to buy food. I ended up back with my mother who is a whole other set of problems. I am never living like that again.  At least here we are in a home, food, warm etc.



- I am not entitled to any government help (my visa is *no recourse to public funds*) Even when my daughter's father gave me a black eye, the shelter said they could not take me in as my visa was *no recourse to public funds.* I had to go to an uncle's house and felt really humiliated and ended up going back on the advice of a pastor. (Don't worry, I don't go to church any more)



- he said he would kill himself if I left. I 100% know that it is not my responsibility. I don't know if he would even do it. I don't think I could live with the guilt if he did.



- loss of 'face'. I'm from a culture where public image is paramount. I already 'shamed' everyone by getting pregnant after university and for leaving the child's father eventually. I don't think I'm strong enough to face that humiliation again.



- fear. I'm just not brave enough. I have never lived independently outside of college dorms and a few months with my child which was hell on earth. I've never even been single for more than a few weeks since age 17, just serial monogamy.



What have I done so far? 

- Tried to have a hobby. During lockdown its been reading and writing fanfiction. I used to go to a community choir once a week but obviously that's off. (I can't sing well, just enjoy it.)



- gone to therapy could only afford ten sessions and it felt like a waste of time.



- antidepressants for several years, but I stopped because they made me feel like a zombie, and plus I'm not unhappy due to chemical imbalance - it's because my life is shit.


I hate him.

I don't want him to see me exercising, or drawing or doing things I like and I'm not sure why. During lockdown I've basically just watched TV. 

I wish I knew what to do.

TL:DR I hate my marriage but feel I'm stuck and want to improve the situation.

Edit: oh, and I can't cheat or have a side relationship. I believe in ethical polyamory but he would NEVER agree and I think it is morally repulsive to cheat. I know he wouldnt agree due to comments he's made in the past. I would not feel good about myself, thus no benefit in doing so.",19Jul2020,1

758,"(sorry this is so long) 

Some time ago, I started pulling away a group of friends that both me (F32) and my partner (F30) are friends with. It's a group of about 9, us being two of them. I had previously lived with one of them, let's call him Dave. Dave and I had been friends for a few years and got on well enough that when he had to move out his previous flat (apparently him &amp; his last flatmate had had a series of fights) I told him he could move into my spare room as it seemed like the old flatmate was being unreasonable. That opinion has changed. 

Within three weeks of living together, I noticed that Dave's girlfriend was keeping A LOT of stuff in his room (things you wouldn't have just for an overnight stay), including a full shelf of food in the fridge. His girlfriend had also stayed over every night for a fortnight. This went on another week so I asked Dave if everything was okay with her and he said that she had needed to move out from her residence and Dave had been letting her crash here but her new place would be ready in a couple weeks. He said he was sorry for not telling me and she was going to be chipping in for bills when she next got paid as thanks. I told him it was okay and I'm glad she felt safe here and I was happy for her to stay until her new place was ready, however after that I would appreciate it if they could split their nights together between their respective homes. Dave told me he was happy with this and that would be what would happen going forward. 

It was not. 

Dave and his girlfriend spent pretty much every night at my flat (I think he stayed a out 9 months total) and she never chipped in any money for bills. They would argue and I would be caught in the middle, usually having both of them looking to confide in me. It was exhausting and I hate arguments so eventually had to ask them to keep me out of it, which was horrible because I pride myself on being a person my friends can come too but this was happening weekly, sometimes more. Through this, I also found out that Dave lied to my face on multiple occasions. They also left trash across the kitchen, stuffed down the side of the couch and on the floor. One time I was invited into his room (even though it is my flat, I never went in his space without permission out if respect to his privacy) and found it covered in moulding dishes, food stamped into the carpet and piles of straight up trash. Dave also screamed at my partner and insulted many of my friends over this time. If I raised any concerns about the state of the flat or how Dave was acting towards my loved ones, Dave would gaslight me. I also am very triggered by a certain topic, and Dave would constantly bring it up, even with me asking him multiple times not too and explaining why. It was absolute hell. 

Despite all of this, Dave was introduced to some friends of mine and my partners when we were still getting on. These friends became fairly regular guests, however they didn't see Dave the way I saw him and didn't believe me when I told them this was how Dave acted behind closed doors. When Dave FINALLY moved out (to a place with his girlfriend), the group of friends have only wanted to hang out as a group. I now can't be around Dave at all as I become triggered because it reminds me of all the aforementioned (I also have chronic anxiety).

My partner still has some really good friends in the group and is desperate to see them, however every time she says she can go but I can't make it (I mostly work night shifts now so I genuinely can't most times) the group say that they will only go out if all of us are there. I have barely seen any of them in the last 6 months and whilst I am sad I have lost some good friends in cutting off Dave, my mental health is so much better and I finally feel secure and happy in my flat again. It's allowed me to make new friends who are real salt of the earth folk and so supportive of me and my mental health. To make clear, my partner is putting NO pressure on me to see them but I can tell that she is sad that's she's not been able too and that makes me feel awful. I want to be able to tolerate Dave for a night so I can do this for her, but my anxiety is peeking just thinking about it. I have tried to come up with alternatives with her based on seeing the other friends without Dave but she doesn't want to stir drama by making Dave feel excluded. I have told her she can share why I don't want to be around Dave if that makes it easier to organise something but she would rather have that conversation in person and of course, she can't see them in person without Dave. 

One of the member of the group also reached out to my partner and asked if there was an issue with Dave and she said no, neither of us had an issue (she knows I do but was doing what she thought was right so I don't hold it against her but it's certainly made it more complicated). 

In conclusion, Reddit, I have no idea what to do. Do I try and commit for my girlfriend and undergo massive amounts of anxiety? Do I send a message into the group chat saying I don't want to meet up and whilst I wish them well, they should plan without me but risk my partner being excluded by extension? Do I continue to politely decline one event at a time so I don't run the risk my partner being excluded and insist them going ahead without me? Am I missing something obvious? 

I dunno, I just want the love of my life to be happy but I feel my anxiety is in the way. I don't think their particularly great friends at this point and I try to encourage my partner to make plans with her other friends too but I know she's still hurting. Ugh.",19Jul2020,1

763,"I’m taking my dog to 1 on 1 training but he’s ruining my mental health. I had him for around 2 weeks. The first 3 days were my honeymoon phase now I’m crying 5 times a day and having a panic attack at least once a day.  He’s house trained and somewhat crate trained as long as I’m not in the same room as him. 


Don’t get me wrong, I love him and if I rehome him I’ll always think about him. But if it’s him or my sanity/mental health I’m putting myself first.  I just feel so conflicted. 


I went from having maybe 1-2 panic attacks a month to having 5 in the 1.5 weeks I had him. My depression and anxiety got so much worse since I adopted him. I have epilepsy so I already feel trapped due to not driving (i walk, take buses, Uber, I do all I can but trust me it’s still isolating. I know why I can’t drive, I’m not going to buy a car out of nowhere until I’m legally safe to drive, just saying it how it is) now it’s even worse. 


I enjoy his company I guess, he’s adorable but I feel a lot better when I’m not around him all the time. Currently I live alone. I can’t crate him without worrying about my apartment neighbors. I can’t afford a “dog sitter”, I’m a college kid. He’s ruining my intimate and sex life and no matter how hard I teach him where his bed is he jumps on mine.  I don’t mind all the money I spent on him, but I know I’ll miss him and always think about him if I rehome him. But I know what’s good for my mental health, it just sucks knowing that I might have to do this. 


I can’t have sex anymore with my boyfriend, we can’t have dinner dates at my place due to my dog screaming bloody murder in his cage or begging for our food.  I feel bad for leaving it alone for more than 4 hours. We can’t cuddle or he intimate because my dog will jump up and claw my boyfriends face or mine. 
I try to redirect his attention and all he sees is “oo hands, oo nose, oo face” and I turn and face a wall (line suggested) whenever he starts biting and he barks and screams. My bathroom is a mess due to hiding everything in there to “puppy proof” my tiny downtown apartment. 


I told people how my dog is causing me panic attacks, crying and ruining my mental health and they gave me disgusting remarks about how I’m a terrible person. 



I really thought I could do it, but I can’t. I feel terrible for this. I feel forced to keep him because if I rehome him people will make me look like a villain. I’m sorry I can’t keep living like this. I’m sorry I can’t have panic attacks everyday. I’m sorry I’m sick of crying 5 times a day. 


I really hope I’m not able to get past the “dog needs to be one year of age to pass the FHA” requirement in my apartment so I “have to rehome him”. Don’t get me wrong, I love him at times but I didn’t know I couldn’t raise a puppy on my own.",19Jul2020,1

My GPA is 2.43 and I am considering this whole thing a failure. Any thoughts on what I should do next? I really wanted to be a nurse but realistically I don't think I would be accepted.

I've been struggling from weight problem ever since I got both my tibia and fibula (bones in leg) broken, I was hospitalised for 1 month and was 5 months on wheel chair but this all happened when I was 17.
At the age of 19 I was 110kg , had no relationship , was alone as I was preparing for a test for a reputed university in my country.
Now at the age of 21 I find myself at the exact same place I gained 15kgs and went from 95 to 110kg in last 4 months since lockdown. I'm no longer in a relationship, I was toyed with. I have no expertise in my field nor I am making progress towards my dream.
Im really sorry for this sob story but can you slap me on the face with some reality? 
I'm becoming scared of people now, little by little I'm going on a downward spiral.
Don't encourage me unnecessarily but sharing something will help me and also I can't stress this enough , if you can slap me do so.

772,"Its Sunday, about 3pm and I realize something. Whenever I'm done work (or spending time before work when I work afternoons) or on my weekend, I'm kinda in ""timer mode"". Counting down the hours before I go back to work. It leads to everything just feeling... unappealing. There isn't a whole lot of joy to be had in my free time anymore. It makes everything I used to love doing generally just feel like a waste of time. Everything I do just feels like draining the clock until my next shift comes around. It makes nothing feel enjoyable because no matter what I'm doing that feeling of ""I have to go to work soon"" or ""x hours until bedtime and my weekends over"" is always looming over my head and draining my emotions.

This has been a problem across all jobs I've worked, so idk if this is a problem finding a different job will fix.

773,"So I've never posted on Reddit before but I just really need some advice and figured it's worth a shot here. I signed up for the Army about two months ago for a six year contract because I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life and I wanted to get out of my hometown for a couple years. I wanted to be a combat medic but I ended up settling for a nurse contract because that's all that was available at the time. When I signed up I was excited to just get away from everything and start a new life but now I'm having second thoughts and I'm getting cold feet. I'm only signed up to go to boot camp im not active duty yet so if i don't go there won't be any legal consequences. I'm just not really excited to be a nurse or passionate about the profession, and six years is a long time to be doing something I'm not really interested in. I've always sort of wanted to be a cop but the other day I realized its truly what I want to do and that instead of going into the military for six years doing a job that I'm not interested in, i could get my associates degree and once I'm done in two years ill be 21 so i could apply to departments around me. I'm really stuck trying to decide what to do and i would appreciate any advice you guys can give me. If i go into the military or i stay here and pursue law enforcement my life would go down two completely different paths. I just don't know which way to go.

When i told my parents i was thinking of not going through with my contract they freaked out and kicked me out. They are very unsupportive of me pursuing law enforcement instead of joining the army. So right now I'm staying at my girlfriends house until i can find a place to rent near me if i do decide to stay. Everyone around me is telling me its a bad idea not to fulfill my contract but i know what i truly want to do is law enforcement and i don't want to waste six years of my life not striving for that goal.

But for those months i never received a raise for becoming manager and taking on new responsibilities.

776,"For a bit of backstory, him and I met through a steam help board about the puzzle game ‘Grim Fandango.’ He needed help with one specific puzzle near the end of the game, and couldn’t find anything online that was clear enough for him to understand, I messaged him and we exchanged Instagrams. I helped walk him through it with some screenshots and videos until he got it. He thanked me for my help and I assumed that would be the last time we would talk. 

He started following my Instagram a few days later and Dmed me about my art, he saw I did fanart for a video game that we both really enjoyed, the ball just started rolling and from then on we were talking pretty much every day. We had a lot of similar interests and he gave me suggestions for books, movies, TV shows, and video games and I genuinely enjoyed everything he recommended to me.

We never really talked about family or personal life, and if we did it was usually just funny stories, and I just assumed that we were around the same age. He told me what date his birthday was but never told me how old he was actually turning. His profile was mostly memes and his own artwork, and his bio was blank with no indication of how old he might be. I celebrated with him each year and usually drew him something centered around whatever he was interested in at the time. 

His birthday was about 2 weeks ago, and when I sent him his usual birthday piece he posted it onto his instagram with a bunch of hearts in the caption, telling people to go follow me.
It was only when I was checking the comments on the post that I saw one of his IRL friends write 
‘Happy birthday [blank]! Can’t believe you’re 15! ❤️❤️❤️’

Ive been thinking about this a lot. This means that when we both met he was 12, and I was 17. This has made me feel very weird, I see a lot of posts on websites like twitter talking about how adults shouldn’t interact with minors online. He’s a very good friend and I care about him a lot, but I don’t know what I’m supposed to do that could be considered “the right thing.” I don’t want to have to stop being friends with him, but if it’s the case I will.
Do I just stop talking with him? Or let our conversations fizzle out?",19Jul2020,7
777,"My relationship with my dad has been rocky ever since the divorce 10 years ago, but we always somehow made up. To me dad was the one person who I thought I could trust and be there for me no matter what. 
But recently with the lockdown I’ve just been getting hurt. He goes everywhere with his girlfriend and I do understand and not butt in, but he doesn’t invite me along anymore. He once even lied to me where he’s going just so that I wouldn’t come. 

The only time he invites me is when his girlfriend is gone. 
And I’ve been getting more upset but am very very scared to tell him my true feelings in fear that he will deny them.
Afterwards, I just started coldly replying to him and he did come to my room to try and resolve things. But I just couldn’t bring myself to talk and I realized that I couldn’t bring myself to believe him anymore, that his love is twisted and I’ll never get what I want from him.
I even went as far as simply not talking or greeting him anymore, I was scared and bitter that I had just wasted 10 years of my life believing him.

I know it was childish and petty and I am in the wrong.I wanted to talk with him and sort things out finally and just find out that he left for the whole weekend to be with his gf and her daughter.

I feel like I’ve been replaced.
I know my behaviour wasn’t the best, but I tried before and would be nice to his gf and never ask to go with them and leave them be and include his gf in conversation even though we speak different languages.
He just returned and gave me a cold hello.
My younger sister no longer speaks to him as well.
I feel as if I was replaced because of my behaviour.

778,"
Mobile formatting etc etc.. TLDR at end

Okay so, my older sister and her 1yo is moving in with my mum due to her partner working away for a while and not wanting to be home alone during the pandemic.

My sister and I have already fallen out over social distancing rules as my grandparents are high risk and my sister would be meeting up with partners family during pandemic and then visiting our grandparents and then returning to my mums.

This was before the whole ""household bubble"" thing and was only at the meet people outside at 6ft apart.

I told my sister I understand it must be difficult to be home alone with a toddler with no support so staying at mums is no issue. I told her I was concerned about her visiting other people without adhering to the 6ft/2m and then going to our grandparents and allowing my neice to be hugging/kissing my grandparents before changing clothes /washing hands etc.

She then told my mum I was being unreasonable and I explained that I'm just concerned /anxious over our grandparents being at risk of the virus when my mum has been doing their shopping since March due to them isolating. 

This basically caused WW3 which resulted in my mum and sister both saying they understand the risks and resulted in me and my sister not talking for a month or two as she said I wasn't taking into consideration her mental health, which I replied to her saying as someone who has been working as a nurse in the hospitals in covid wards and ICU I said it feels shitty to me to have not even being able to have seen family in person since February due to it that I feel my own family aren't taking the pandemic seriously. 

Obviously I am in no place to tell my sister how to live her life and what she can/can't do with her child.

As lockdown rules are being eased, my sister is planning on coming back to my mums to stay for a month or so, and with my grandma recently being discharged from hospital (non covid related) I feel that although rules are changing the risks are still high and she should still be considerate of our grandparents health now their health has deteriorated in the last month. 

I don't know how to approach the situation without my sister once again making me feel like shit for trying to express my concerns. I've already approached it with my mum and she said she would talk to her but I still don't feel like they will take notice, but I understand it is completely out of my hands whether they socially distance or not.


 I've already said it would kill me if my grandparents or any family member got seriously or critically ill fom the virus when it could be easily avoided , which is why I still haven't returned home. She interpretated this as me saying I would blame her if either of them got the virus which idk if it was maybe implied by the way I said it. at this point I was really worked up and angry. 



TLDR : sister and 1yo moving in with mum, not adhering to social distance, visiting high risk grandparents. Fallen out once before due to no social distancing when visiting friends and then visiting recently hospitalised grandparents. How can I express my concerns without falling out. 

How can I have a word with my sister as I really don't want to go another 2 months without talking to her over it like before?",19Jul2020,1

787,"I have been feeling extremely lonely lately, to the point where I feel my depression growing back very strongly. I think it is being caused by multiple factors: my fiancée's death back in April, living alone for the first time in my life (I've always at least had roommates before), and the pandemic.

I ended up having to move recently because, after my fiancée's death, my parents drove me to their place across the country and proceeded to abuse me. So, I decided to go to graduate school on time instead of taking a year off to grieve so I can financially support myself and be 1,000+ miles away from them again. It's been really hard giving myself time to grieve while doing graduate school but I feel better than living with my parents.

However, I have been feeling extremely lonely. I feel like living alone isn't an ideal situation for me, even without the pandemic. I'm somebody who is pretty extroverted, generally, and I try to have 2-3 really close friends I can see in person every day, and I have always lived with at least one of them. However, I already signed my lease and my place is pretty small, so there is no chance of having roommates for at least a year. I didn't really think that not having roommates would be so stressful for me until I started living alone. 

I do have a cat, so I am lucky in that regard. As silly as it sounds, I've been talking to him and I carry him around a lot more often. This does alleviate some loneliness, but not a lot. 

I do have people from the town my fiancée and I lived in that call me throughout the week. I actually look forward to these calls and video chats because it's like I am with them, but it also doesn't give me the full fulfillment of talking to them in person, but I usually get to call someone at least every other day, if not every day. It's usually as follows: one of my professors at my old school calls me twice a week, my fiancée's mom calls me once a week, I video chat with my therapist once a week, two of my fiancée's aunts call me once a week each, my fiancée's best friend calls me every other week, I have digital support group once a month, and my fiancée's senior capstone advisor video chats with me once a month. I also email my fiancée's dad every few days and talk to my friends over Discord chat every few days. My parents also call me too, but it always ends in them being upset with me or screaming at me, so I don't really count them because it makes be feel a lot worse after talking to them than before I talk to them.

When I think about how much people call me and talk to me, I feel guilty for feeling lonely. These people are very kind to me and helpful, but despite being able to call them on the phone for 30 mins to 1 hr each, I still just have overwhelming pangs of loneliness. I think not seeing them in person is adding onto the stress.

So, I just wanted advice on how to handle my loneliness during this pandemic while I live alone and then even some advice for when the pandemic is over, because I might still be living alone then. Thank you in advance.",19Jul2020,3
788,"For context, I am taking my OSCP test in about a month. I love this field of work and I have learned a lot through online classes (Udemy), HTB, and the PWK prep course. However, I want to know your experiences and if you wold recommend I continue with college.

I cannot express how much I detest schooling. I have an Associates degree right now and I am struggling to not get dropped from the engineering department (my grades just balance on the minimum for the field. I have B's pretty much across the board with the occasional C and A) in my school due to my lack of motivation when it comes to many of the ""unnecessary"" classes (unnecessary to my major, but required for me to take I mean).

I know I could very easily be called lazy and then people would tell me I shouldn't be in this field if I am. However, I would like to add that when it has come to the PWK prep course and all of my learning with pentesting and CS as a whole, I have worked my ass off. No matter how boring it may be at times (networking models, I'm looking at you) nor how hard it may be at times (rooting machines).

He's always been pretty vocal about being trans and experiencing gender dysphoria, was out at school, however wasn't out to his parents, thus didn't take much further action. People knew he was trans, but didn't refer to him as a guy or use his name (not from transphobia, but for his own safety.) His girlfriend identifies as bisexual, but with a strong preference for women, had always imagined marrying a woman, only really wanted to be with a woman. 

A few months ago, my friend came out to his parents (they were very supportive, luckily.) With that resolved, he was able to start socially transitioning properly, using his name and pronouns, that sort of thing. He did understand that his girlfriend wasn't 100% on board with it yet, but she said she just needed a little time, so he was okay with it. It's been months, she still refuses to respect his gender, and whenever he tries to talk about it, she says he's being too demanding or controlling and that he's being unreasonable. I offered to talk to her, but he said she won't let him get anyone else involved as it's not their business, despite getting people involved who she knows will be on her side. 

My friend is really unhappy now. She broke up with him once but came back, and he's just waiting for her to accept him. But it... really doesn't seem like that's happening. I've already, in the gentlest way I could, suggested he break up with her. He wasn't opposed to this. But also made no further action towards it.

I'm being shut out of projects i absolutely should be consulted on. However, I am a very passionate, forthright and direct person. I think of it as being honest, i like it. These people are...not. They cloak everything they do in about five layers ""I love you so much honey"", ""thinking about you!"" and  ""You guys are my family,  i love you SO MUCH!"" Its very sweet. Very kind, very loving. I'm certainty not saying anything against them, i have enjoyed my time there. And like i said, they are crazy talented.  I just want to say ""If you actually liked me, you'd respect my time"". And i can not. So, if i quit now, do you think  it would be unfair? Do you think I need to give them more time? What would you do?

 I thought it was a bit of a shitty joke, so my mood dropped and I told her if what I did bothered her as much as hugs bothered me, then I'd stop, and then she got upset at me, accusing me of getting upset because I heard something I 'didn't like' and I don't understand why she got so hostile.

804,"Lately I've been thinking about a crush I had on this girl in school. We never spoke, but we both had such a strong connection to each other (I know it was reciprocal). It's been 8 years since high school, and I have gone through the process of sorting my life out and reworking myself. I never paid attention in school, and I never spoke to her because I was shy and wasn't in the right mind. Years later I am in uni and I'm finding the right parts of myself that I think fit me most, and she came to my mind.

Over the lockdown I have been figuring out my sexuality, and I landed on the idea of being gay. I do find men attractive, but I also don't see myself in a relationship with them. I have recently come to understand that of all the people that I have felt comfortable and attracted to are... women with red hair. This crush of mine had red hair. This isn't really part of my attraction to her, just a coincidence.

I feel like sending her a letter and seeing how she is, maybe connect. But I think I would be digging up the past, and its unlikely that she would care anymore. Another point is that we never spoke, just had this really strong attraction to each other, but is that enough to warrant a letter? Also people change and move on with their lives. And lastly, it could be that I'm just lonely, especially considering lockdown.

What do you think reddit?

805,"Muslim dude, here. 

Sometimes I get in arguments with Islamophobes on the internet. Mostly I win, but sometimes the other argues better. That sometimes gets me mad.

I recently learned of a saying of Muhammad that said that good people always avoid arguments even if they know they are right, to avoid speaking or acting out in anger. So I've made up my mind. I will not participate in any Islamic argument or any argument in general. I will enjoy a peaceful existence on the Internet, away from hateful people saying vile things.

But I still get burned up with anger whenever I think about those horrible words. I know that I shouldn't pay much attention to them, but it gets me angry. I don't want my faith, something that has always been a source of comfort for me, to become a source of anger and bad memories.

So is there a way I can calm myself, and not get angry even when I think about those bad things? Can I stop myself from getting angry over these things? And if anyone that replies happens to be a well-learned Muslim, can you please give some advice from the Quran?",19Jul2020,2
807,"When I meet people at a gathering or even for work, I’ll be very nice to their face. Even when they make me feel uncomfortable. 

For example, I was at my friends place last night at a socially distanced bbq.  Someone was there that just wouldn’t stop talking. Anytime someone would try to change the subject, he’d chime in and dominate the convo again. It got to the point where the host’s SO literally went in the house for an hour and came back when we were about to leave.  

Afterwards my friend who hosted called me to thank me for coming by and I told him about how the dude just wouldn’t stop talking and the host said, “Yea he can be cool but sometimes he just doesn’t know when to shut up.”  

Another time I was at a conference.  There was a guy who is a good dude but just has very intense opinions about certain things. He also is the kind of person to get wild. For example, he had cocaine and was offering it to people at some of the after parties.  The thing is he came by himself and I had known him previously but I didn’t feel to comfortable hanging out with him. But as I was organizing an after party for people to hang out, I invited him cuz he was around and he knew I was inviting people and I didn’t want to be that guy to exclude someone. 

He turned out to be okay but with some periodically awkward moments throughout the night. But I was just not really wanting to hang out with him. I ended up sharing this with a mutually friend who I think told him cuz the next day he seemed kind of distant. 

I’ve noticed that I do this a lot. When I feel weird around someone I try to be nice to their face, but later on I end up basically talking about them “behind their backs”.  

On one hand, I’m just sharing how weird the interactions were for me because these people are a bit eccentric.  On the other hand, I can’t help but think I’m being two-faces and can understand why the other person might think I’m being fake when really I’m just trying to be nice. 

TLDR; I’m nice to people to their face when I fee uncomfortable but end up talking about it with other people. Am I being two-faced? Should I be more honest about my feelings of uncomfortability to their face?",19Jul2020,3

I push people away then cry like a bitch saying “I have no one, everyone leaves.”

I shut down and I push people away. Even when it’s at a time when I need someone the most. And as much as I don’t want to, for someone reason, I do it anyway. I isolate myself and suffer in silence because I feel that’s what I have to do and I don’t help.

809,"So I got out of a toxic relationship a couple years ago, and throughout those years till today, we decided to remain friends. Our friendship had gradually grown to be even more toxic than our romantic relationship, so I ended up blocking him on social media and that gave them the general message to stay away from me.

During those years of trying to be friends/getting blocked, we were shit talking each other (obviously). This wouldn’t have been a problem if my ex hadn’t also been in my IRL group of friends, so that complicated everything. (He did have a different group of people to go to, but ironically I was also in that group). Although my ex had done some shady things to lead my friends to end up being indifferent of him in their own ways, I still felt like my gossip was still a reason why he’s not in the friend group anymore. I also want to add that everything I had told my friends were not lies (take that however you want). 

I also talked about him with some new people that wasn’t involved in the drama at all (so like 2 years later), and I do feel bad about that because I was name dropping.

I (16F) took on a person to our 6-member online team I run about a month ago. For that amount of time they have done nothing towards project goals and I was planning on removing them, but they were notified of this and have now become more active. They have now begun working but their work has been, well, less than terrific. I've now spent more of my time fixing their mistakes than doing my own work.

I get that people are busy, I have stuff I do too but how hard is it just to say hi? I do it all the time so why can't anyone else? Why do I have to be the one to always put in effort in order to keep my friendships going? These are people I've known since middle school, they say great things about me to others and swear they wanna keep in contact now that we're graduated but it certainly doesn't feel like it.

This isn't just the case for a few of my friends, no it's the case with every single one. Even the two people I would consider my best friends never really talk to me first. Once again, I'm not exaggerating. I can't remember the last person who contacted me first and actually started a conversation with me.

816,"So first time ligit posting sorry for spelling or grammar mistakes I am just not good at either and first post so sorry if a bit rambly open to any and all questions 


 I got engaged only a few months ago  have to hold off on the wedding due to the rona and I'm stuck in a predicament 

Backstory 
I have a dysfunctional biological family.  Consisting of me my mom my bio father and my sibling. 

My father was a in better words a liar and a skirt chaser according to my mom constantly not wanting to work either wouldn't take care of us got sent to jail while I was young and a whole lot of other things. I was too young to know if any of this is true and my mom when I try to talk about my father besides a story here and there gets very emotional and upset almost in inconsolable  at times if I ask to many questions about him. She hates his guts and kept us away from him as well as she could.

   I grew up good my mom married my adoptive dad who I see as my Dad and wouldn't have it any other way hes awesome and I love him. 

Important to the story :
  My mom when I was growing up would  be critical of what I wore all the time not because it was skimpy or anything because I have a serious skin picking problem due to anxiety but she made it worse by trying to have me cover them up and would  look me up and down and make comments like ""I think you should  change."" and would  veto any look I wanted to try including  shaving my head all the way because she thought my head wasnt  a good shape for it she makes me feel bad for how I look everytime I see her and had a very bad eating disorder  when I moved out and it took me a while to get to normal. We have a good but strained relationship and are low contact. 


After not seeing my Father for years and only talking  to him very little in high school because as said before  my mom got very upset When i told her I was speaking to him. In the beginning of 2019 I moved to my hometown he also only lives 30 min away so I decided  to meet with him and rekindle our relationship. When I met with him I got to see my grandfather I hadent seen in years and got to see my grandmother who I never got to say goodbye tos urn.

I also got to meet his family he met a woman when he lived in another state and they had a kid together I love his wife and my brother they are so amazing and sweet  nice and my brother  is the most adorable  thing in the whole world and even though  my mom told me all these horrible  stories I found out alot of things from his side including the reason he had to terminate his parental rights (Child support was taking so much from his paychecks that he couldn't afford to live on his own and had to be helped by my late grandmother which my mom didnt like and wanted him to live on his own before he could spend more time with us.) 

So now you know you know all the things I do I need your help I want to invite my Father and his family to my wedding but my Mom said she won't  come at all and neither will my sibling probably.

There's more I could go on and on about he said she said I'm really confused I love them both and understand why they dont get along but for like one day can you tolerate each other. but I dont know",19Jul2020,2
817,"(18 y/o, Female) Hii, my problem is that I have always struggled with making choices. From what I want to eat at a restaurant, to whether or not I wish to go out on a Friday night; regardless of what it is, I spend a lot of time pondering on outcomes.  I was always able to deal with those kinds of decisions and the tedious process in my mind that comes along with them, until now.

Recently I haven't been able to function because of a choice I need to make regarding my career path. Here it goes: I can't decide between SFX school or a career in Biotechnology. It may seem straightforward but hear me out; if I take SFX Makeup school I would have to move to Vancouver (I'm from Mexico) which will put my family in a lot of economical strain. It will also be risky since it's not guaranteed that I will be able to make a living from it. (as my parents see it since here in Mexico art and film careers are seen as useless) I have investigated and I could make good money as an MUA but the path to getting there is very risky.

On the other hand, I could stay here in Mexico, study a career in Biotechnology, get a job in a lab or something, and make a decent living. Honestly, it doesn't sound very appealing to me ( except for the part of ""college life""), yet I still feel like I need a degree to not only make my family proud but also to prove myself. I feel like if I don't have a degree, that I'll fail in life.

I have also been considering getting that degree and THEN move to Vancouver and study SFX makeup (its a 2-year course so I will still be in my 20's when I'm done)

What should I do?? please help and thank you for reading my thoughts.",19Jul2020,1

824,"  Sorry for any mistakes, English is not my main language.

Yesterday I (20m) was talking to some friends on an online call, we were celebrating the departure of a close friend of mine who is moving to the US to continue his studies, he wishes to be an engineer and someday work in the aerospace industry. The party was amazing, we were laughing all the way to the end, but a conversation popped up with some girls, they are both 2 years younger than me, and they too are leaving the country, one of them is going to Italy in a few weeks forever, and the other is planning to study medicine in Germany.

We live in Chile, far away from the US and Europe, and I too wish to leave, I want to stop faking my life, I want to take off this facade that makes me look happy, I want to stop lying to myself. Since I was a child I've been dreaming of being an astronaut, but considering my birthplace and the law, I can't travel to space, and it is unlikely that they will allow people born in Chile to become astronauts. 

My question is, considering that I have the Spanish nationality, should I start my life over?

I'm sick and tired of this shithole I live in, I have a great family and even grater friends who I do not wish to leave behind, but at the same time I feel like my heart is begging me to leave, to live and try to be happy for once in my life, to stop faking. 

Since I was a child I've been moving every 4 years to different countries, and I somehow ended up back in Chile. I want to leave, and my Dad is on board too, but he is in the middle of his PhD, and I am also in the middle of my studies (got about 4 years to go more or less), yet it is not a career that makes me happy (I don't have a clue what would make me happy).

I don't think I can take it any longer, I've asked my friends for advice, but they all keep telling me to stay, I don't want to live the rest of my life here, I want to travel the world, meet extraordinary people from around the globe, and I know I want to live in a fantasy with no worries, no problems with money, no problems with toxic people surrounding me. I sincerely want to be free.

That is why I come to reddit to ask for advice from people I've never met and never will meet. I've tried everything and I can't take it any longer.

I don't want to keep dreaming, I want to fulfill those dreams, those expectations of greatness. If I have to start over I will, but where to start?

From my point of view, I don’t think I was being unreasonable in the argument, but his attitude towards me was unacceptable. I was rude, and I’m willing to apologise for that, but I don’t think I said anything outrageous.

We’ve had arguments before, none as bad as this one, but every time I’ve been the one to go back to him and apologise, whether I was in the wrong or not. I am certain I am not in the wrong in this argument, but he doesn’t see that. I want to wait for him to be the one to realise his attitude is completely wrong, and for him to come and apologise to me, which I would of course accept, and apologise back.

You’re probably thinking, this is not a healthy relationship, and you might be right. But I can’t keep things going this way. I’m experiencing really bad anxiety about it, I hate the idea of upsetting or pissing anyone off. I don’t want this to ruin our group of mutual friends, or to make him feel pushed away from that.

I can’t have this friendship go out this way, but I also think if I go and apologise first, he’ll never realise his behaviour is wrong, and the relationship could just get worse for me. I really need advice, I don’t know what to do.

Do I priorities my own physical as mental health but at the cost of him not learning anything, reinforcing his terrible behaviour? Any advice would be appreciated.",19Jul2020,1

Hi all,

My ex (31 M), and I (28F) have been together for a little over a year. When we met he wanted to have kids and a family but lately he has been saying he doesn’t want a child. 

We recently decided to take a 14 day break from each other. He wanted the break to figure out if he wants children and a family. However, I’m in last year of med school and I have the worst days where I just need to be around him cause the days are stressful. He has been interpreting this me being selfish and the lack of my ability to give him space to make a decision.

Two weeks ago, we started seeing each other again 4 days in a row and there was no hint of us breaking up, but I come home and he suddenly tells me to leave his premises right away (he is the sole renter of the property), we made plans to spend the 4th of July weekend together and he urged me to leave right away. I kept stalling, I was just hanging out and watching tv. My stomach was hurting from being on a period and he kept asking me to leave his house. 

I was still around 4 hours after he asked me to leave cause I was pissed that he invited me over and he now he was asking me to leave the house. He was getting angry and he threatened to call the cops on me. I got pissed cause he said I’m an immigrant and that if anything goes on my record, it’s not good for me, so I better leave. I think overall our emotions were running high and I shouldn’t have escalated it, but I was on fucking period and I was so irrational. 

I kept insisting that I won’t leave until he hugged me goodbye (stupid, I know) - next thing I know he called the cops on me and they chased me out. It was so so so embarrassing. 

So it’s been three weeks, I’ve dated around but I’m starting to realize I still love him and he’s the one for me. Can I do anything to fix it at all? He is saying now that he has trust issues cause I was refusing to leave the house and I’m kinda scared cause he was so quick to call the cops on me. But I love him and I feel stupid for being irrational. 

Also, we lived together for a year and I moved out to be closer to school. Also, for reference- I moved to the US 4 years ago, I grew up in a culture that didn’t teach me to really respect boundaries. I also understand in retrospect I was depending on my ex a lot to help me with my emotions.

841,"Hello everyone, I made a reddit just to ask this, so please feel free to criticise if I have done something wrong.

I am 18M, and about to head off into uni come September. I would like to know what healthcare/lifestyle items are worth investing in/ worth the extra money, as well as tips and suggestions on how to improve my general hygiene. I think that I am pretty good when it comes to hygiene, but would like to know if there's anything more I can do, whether it be do something new, recommend a type of product, stop doing something, or general feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

**FACE**

I wash my face twice every day, exfoliate with a scrub about twice a week, and moisturise after every wash. I use aloe vera and serums on blemishes and spots. I also use face masks once a week, if possible. My ex told me that a chemical toner/exfoliant is better than using scrubs and told me about some daily serums, but I can't remember what they were. In addition, my hair often gets in the way of washing my face, so I will be getting a headband. I have tried both charcoal masks and pore strips and they don't work; either i'm not using them correctly, they don't work or I am extremely unlucky. My face does get quite oily throughout the day, especially on the nose.

&amp;#x200B;

**SHAVING**

I shave my face (moustache, beard, sideburns) about once every 3 days, and other \*parts\* once a week. I replace my blades about once every 3 weeks and use gel when i shave, and a cream balm afterwards. I have been thinking of waxing as shaving does irritate my skin a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

**HAIR**

My hair is a medium-ish length and is very thick. I shampoo every 3-4 days and on that day and the day after I condition, leaving the last day as it is. i use an anti-frizz serum on my hair, and I leave my hair to air dry, sometimes using an old t-shirt to soak up excess water. I don't straighten it, but I occasionally use gel to style it. I am not sure if gel is the right product to be using. 

&amp;#x200B;

**ORAL**

I brush my teeth for 3 minutes twice daily. I use an electric toothbrush but I use the more cheaper toothpaste. I floss and use mouthwash twice daily, and use a tongue scraper after. I chew sugar-free gum too, I'm not sure if that's needed to know but oh well. I don't smoke, or drink or anything of the sort.

&amp;#x200B;

**SHOWER**

I shower once every day. I use a general shower gel that smells nice with a loofah, and use both every time. I shower in a slightly warm water, getting colder as the shower goes on. I have a separate towel for my face, but use the same towel for the rest of my body (hair, body, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

**GENERAL**

I use anti-perspirant every night before bed; I only really use cologne when I go out. I sleep on a cotton pillowcase but I will be getting a satin one soon, so don't worry about that, and I change my bedsheets every 1-2 weeks. I don't really have the need to moisturise my body, but it is something that I will get. I also drink plenty of water, at least 4-5 glasses a day, so my pee is almost always clear. I have been trying to improve my diet too, as well as work out.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if this is very specific and nit picky, I am just interested to see if there's anything I can get to help with my hygiene. I like to think I am good with it but I really do the bare minimum. I might seem a bit more feminine when it comes to hygiene and style when comparing myself to other guys but I think it's normal to want to feel good and feel clean.

I live in the UK if that helps too. Once again, thank you for stopping to take the time to read this mess of a post, and I appreciate all criticism! I think I've covered everything, but if you think I've missed anything important just let me know and I'll try to come back and correct/explain myself.

Thank you very much!",19Jul2020,1
842,"I grew up being very babied and pretty entitled being the baby of the family and it has really stuck with me into adulthood. Im now 24 years old and as hard as I try to be better in terms of maturity, i still fail. It almost feels like i just lack a total amount of common sense and i have a disregard for people's feelings a lot of the time. I lack awareness in how i treat others at times. It's not that i don't have feelings or care about others feelings, as i do care very much, but i just lack the ability to realize when i'm not being considerate. Once it's pointed out to me that i was being ill mannered or inconsiderate, i immediately apologize and honestly i go into a deep depression because i feel like a complete moron for not having better common sense or respect for others at this age.

An example of this is recently i was having my family help move me into a new apartment and my aunt specifically helped me a lot during this entire experience and she's always there for me when i need her. While we were moving my stuff, my sister face-timed my aunt and once she showed me the phone, i grabbed it instinctively and walked away with it and i'm not quite sure why i did that. I was excited to talk to my sister on facetime, but i lacked the awareness that it would upset my aunt that i just grabbed her phone out of her hands and walked away with it. I did think i shouldn't have done that AFTER i already did it, but i didn't even think to apologize to my aunt.

I didn't realize how much i upset my aunt until she texted me today and told me that she didn't like the way i grabbed her phone out of her hand, how it was VERY ILL MANNERED OF ME and how after everything she has done for me she doesn't want to talk to me right now.

I was shocked when i read this text from her just because she has never gotten mad at me this way and i felt so guilty and sad that i acted that way towards her. I immediately apologized and told her that i was wrong and thanked her for helping me with everything. She hasn't responded, which i don't really expect her to.

I just really want to stop making the people i care about feel as though i dont care or appreciate them and im tired of not caring or appreciating them enough or realizing how lucky i am to have them. It just sucks not being able to do anything about it. It feels like im hard-wired this way and i just want some clear advice on ways to stop it.

I guess i just have this mindset that i can do whatever i want and people shouldn't be mad at me for it because i don't have bad intentions or im not TRYING to be rude. I HATE having that mindset and as hard as i try to get rid of it, i just can't do it. I really need some strong advice on how to handle this as it's taking a toll on me and my relationships with friends, family, significant others at this point. My significant other constantly tells me that i'm inconsiderate, unaware, and disrespectful at times. Please help!",19Jul2020,2
843,"My mom (43) was talking with me (15F) the other day about how one of her friends told her that she didn’t believe in vaccinations. She then told me she was kind of on the fence about it herself because when she was vaccinating me, she noticed that before she did I was perfectly fine, then after she did I instantly got a sickness. She said even now she’s gone some time without vaccinating me and I’ve been fine. Is there any information I need to know before I talk with my mom about it? Vaccination isn’t a topic I’m very educated on.",19Jul2020,1

845,"I’m 24, female and I’ve been single forever. Never dated, never kissed and still a virgin. I’ve known for a few years now that the likelihood that I’ll be able to enter into a healthy relationship is is next to none. Unfortunately several factors at this time stand in my way. In an unbiased and straightforward manner I can say that I am unusually unattractive. Most folks in my life view me as a sex-less blob because of this. I don’t dislike the way I look but I am aware that I’m not even slightly conventionally attractive in any aspect. 

The other discouraging factors include: Mental illness (PTSD, depression, anxiety, BPD), aspergers, poverty, being a lesbian and being black. 

Most of these factors narrow the playing field before I even get the chance to have ‘standards’. I get it, I have baggage. I’m not begging anyone to date me despite these thing, I am fully aware that I am the only one responsible for myself.

As for the last one some would argue that this is untrue and I’m being self-hating. I’m not. This is statistically proven that black women are generally viewed as less attractive than other races and are asked out less often. I also know this because I was raised in a 99% small white town by only white parents. I know how other people view me because I viewed other black women the same way, as not even in the running. I no longer feel this way, but that is because I’m consciously rejecting what I was made to believe. Other people wouldn’t even register their bias, they just wouldn’t even see us as an option. As an ‘other’. Even after moving to a bigger city, this is Canada. There just aren’t that many black people and I personally still haven’t met any. 

Regardless, as things have gone I’m overwhelmed lately with the desire for emotional and physical intimacy/closeness that friendships cannot fulfill I literally have dreams about just holding hands or hugging Im so touch-starved. I’ve felt this way for years but whenever I bring this up with therapists to learn how to just cope with it, they always throw my request back at me with “well I know a girl who's mixed and she gets lots of guys” or “have you tried Tinder?” Cool good for her, and yes I have but if no one swipes on you, you get no matches.

TLDR: I’ve excepted I’m never going to experience a romantic or sexual relationship, now I need to know how to overcome these intimacy starved (non-sexual) feelings for the rest of my life. I genuinely want to know how to be ok with being alone.",19Jul2020,3
846," **Tl**;**dr** Does anyone who is / was a late bloomer feel they need to have a wild phase before they are ready for a relationship? I feel I need one to get out of my head and to help get over feeling of a lost youth

**My answer:**

I'm  24 never been in a relationship or had a wild phase and I'm not taking  having a relationship off the table I just feel like I need to have a  wild phase for various reasons:

1. I'm  not getting any younger most girls around me are already settling down  (I live in a small town) and as I get older they increasing get less  adventurous, more serious, and less sexually experimental.
2. I've  been alone my whole life while most other people have been dating and  or hooking up since middle school from past experiences they have a  general overview of what kind of girl or guy they want as a partner I  have no idea
3. I'm  horny all the time I'm 24, but in my head I feel like I'm 18 I want to  be able to focus on other things in life rather than just sex. I have a  lot of trouble getting things done, because I'm always thinking about  how lonely / sexually frustrated I am (also have a lot of regret  feelings that I missed out on my youth)
4. I'm  fine with being with older women though I'm getting older. Older women  will always be there, but as I get older it will be looked at as weird  to date or hookup with an 18 - early 20's girl. I feel I'm losing / lost  my youth like most other people have so many stories of relationships,  hookups, and or memories with friends.
5. I'm  going to be honest I hate my self and I know I need to love myself  first before I get into a relationship and except someone to love me  back
6. I  lost 60 pounds so far went from 280 to 220 pounds at 6ft 2 I have a  degree in exercise science, just started personal training and looking  to go to grad school next year. Sex is a huge motivation for me to get  fit and it would also help me work on my mental health &amp; physical as  well as help in my career since I need to look the part.
7. It  would help me work on my mental health. As I stated earlier I don't  like myself being able to get laid will help take the edge off so that I  can start working on myself. I'm not looking for happiness out of a  wild phase I want to grow from it so that I can start working on my  mental health instead of not being able to focus on anything, because  I'm always thinking about how lonely and sexually frustrated I am.",19Jul2020,1
847,"Okay, so you know when you stand up too quickly and sometimes see black spots or black out for a second? Well, that happened to me last night but it was extreme. Everything felt like it was closing in on me. I regained a little balance and wobbled to the bathroom across the hall. I sat down, and then suddenly, everything turned white and fuzzy. I couldn’t see. I didn’t know what to do, so I hobbled to the kitchen hoping to get some water. When I entered the kitchen, everything started to turn black and fuzzy. I had no balance and I fell over. My vision went away completely, I could barely even feel my way out of there. I miraculously got back to near my room. I literally could not see shit. I knocked a painting off the wall and when I got to the corner by my room, I knocked a vase over+another painting, simply bc I couldn’t see. A few minutes later, it went away, but my ears were ringing intensely. Has anyone ever experienced this?? I don’t know if I should go see a doctor, I don’t know if it’s normal? It’s never happened to me before. I ate a couple hours earlier so not a food thing...what the heck happened and what should I do? I was really scared.",19Jul2020,2
850,"24 years old, living at home. Full time job, not very well paying, but generally stable. I've been having trouble doing basic things like making friends and being sociable because... well, I'm living at home, and it just feels awkward. All the friends I've made during my time in university have all moved far away or even abroad and I'm beginning to feel like if I'm going to make a social circle and get a life of my own, I need to move out.

Except, my family is in the middle of a divorce. Mum works full time, all the time, and 11 year old young sister needs taking care of, the house needs to be cleaned and looked after. I pull my weight and do all the normal things, but I'm living out of the same bedroom I did eight years ago and it's weighing on me.

Even moving somewhere nearby would be a major blow to the family, especially my younger sister. I love them both, get along with them great and don't want to abandon them, but the mental strain of just living at home and having very little control over my life is getting a bit much.

853,"Good evening everyone.

Quick word: I have troubles in english language so please do not judge me if I made some misunderstanings in my text. It is hard writing it down for me and just I try my best here and I hope you get me right. I am very thankful for any advice you can give me here.Okay, as I wrote in the topics name, I feel falling down a big hole. It reminds the Black Hole, being impossible to escape. It seems that nobody has an answer to me, so I do ask here in hope.

It began in 2012, I finished my school, moved to another city and started studying at an university. A year later something broke in me.  I noticed that my study goes worse and worse even I seemingly do the same to uphold my stuff. But I failed and my attempts to restart again a couple of semesters later ended in an totally fiasco and I decided to get out before I get dropped out.My relationship went downhill in the same time and I could not save it. She was gone and I couldnt get anything back again. So I fell into a hole. All I did was lifing with myself and waste time and money, becoming a parasite.  My appartment got messy, my friends were gone and all I had ""achieved"" got disappeared. I ended calling my parents to get me the hell out there, thanksful I always had their advice and they always said ""we won't will be poor if you come back, there is always a meal and bed ready for you!"" God bless them!

A few years later I ""returned"" to my original mind and behaviour. I got out of university, lost all I had in contacts, moved back AND regained my life for a bit but not completely. It was big damn a struggle to get through my new studies and my job training and after a big big time of mobbing, hate, harrassment, psycho games and fear of losing the job and my only chance to repay my parents for all, I finished it. The degree was taking too much toll than it should. But hey, who would give someone who failed in his studies a chance to show off his true powers...

I mean, learning and working isnt a struggle and my grades were okay BUT the things earlier made me falling again. I had almost lost new aquired friendship to old classmates for a time. My works became unsatisfactory for my boss and he and all the colleagues (a big number of people) demanded to know what is going on with me.. My parents were also wondering what is going on because my part of the house we life in was chaos and total mess again. I COULD NOT bring myself back to normal as I always were. It was a pain to get all my disordered things to bring into the order and manage my personal life for damns sake.  After a small fight and the yell from parents I got ""back"" and restored the order in life for a while..

Again a time later I declared to move out from my parents to a cheap appartment in a city nearby. They helped me with my moving, they gave me good tips and advices on how to life. They were not happy with my decision, but I needed to move out because I felt ashamed by them carrying my life. I needed to get on my feet like every grown human older than 25 does (you know what I mean).

And it went downhill again and staysas such. While I do good on my new job, I become worse at private. Everytime I come home, I can not get myself to clean or bring order into my appartment. It is partly messy, my personal table looks like 200 office people laid their entire paperworks on it. Most of my free time is spent by sitting or lying around just powerless there.

For everything I try to do, I simply CAN NOT bring it to an end or finish what is there. For example yesterday I did not manage to sort and throw out some old clothing I have. Instead I ""gave up"" on it and fell asleep for a few hours before proceeding to watch some YT weeb stuff..Like some magic hand stops me from finishing all I want to. From time to time I manage to free myself of the powerless state and like a weekend in June where  I cleaned up the whole appartment including the car and the basement. But it doesnt keep on, it vanishes and I fall again.

Surprisingly people at my new work do not know anything of it. In a small talk and opinion exchange with the boss recently I got out as a ""confident, responsible and helpful man who does his best, even in hard times for all (corona and stuff)!"" The job is something I love and keep up even it costs me much power every day. But I fear that it will turn me down and crush under the pressure becoming something weird lime in my last job..

Even my 3 closest friends are asking for advice from time to time and it works at them. But it does NEVER work at me. I fall down the damn hole over and over again and I can not get back up. I confessed to them that I need help and they firstly though that I was broken and sui cidal (I AM NOT and I LOVE MY LIFE and all I have even it seems that 90% are blocked by my issues). We did anything together like imagining doing it ""for a girlfriend"" (I have none since I lost my first and last one in study and didnt manage to get one), doing for my boss who is ""about it break in in some time to check on me"". But it failed. They are puzzled and I asked them to leave it as it is because I did not want them to put their own problems aside for something like me. I mean they have soo much trouble with their stuff that I dont want to burden them with me!  At least I am thankful they dont sent me to hell and dont see me as useless piece of s...., we are still being a bunch of friends and they still come to me like nothing happened.

My boss decided to send me to an extra long  course related on my work. And there comes the fear that I am not able to make it out there. I fear that the course will make me struggle like I did in my university time. Not even sure how to tell him that I maybe cant.

So, long text and a simple question: What the hell is going on with me?Why cant I just be like everyone else and keep my life simple and clean without my issues, while I am able to help other people? Why am I so powerless to help myself instead?  Please give me some advice how to free myself from it and start having a normal life.

Sincerely  


&gt;EDIT:   
 **While not required, we encourage you to include your age and gender**. A man in his 40s will likely need slightly different advice than a 14 year old girl.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;I got this in my email. Well, if it helps you to give me an advice: I am a male in the end of my 20s.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;EDIT again: I have thought about visiting a psychiatrist but it is hard to wait for  a year. In general I am totally disappointed by them because I had tried to seek help earlier in study aswell. It turned out in talks and talks but in the end they talked about pills and stuff. So I said ""NO! "" and got out there.",19Jul2020,1

My friends are fully aware of this because we discovered it recently but yet I feel underappreciated because I don't see them planning a party for me.

855,I am 21F and I am in a very unhappy relationship. It’s very toxic and I have to be my boyfriend‘s mom (23M). He won’t even bathe regularly and I’m so tired of it. I tried ending things but he’s forced a relationship to go on. We’re stuck together too because of the pandemic. Anyway I’ve been giving nudes to anyone who asks that is 18 or older on hook up apps. Mostly older men have asked for them and they have been making me feel a lot of confident about myself. I crop my face out but one time I sent a woman more pics and she almost blackmailed me into doing more sexual things until I almost exposed her. I just have no value anymore and feel worthless and strangers liking my body makes me feel better. I also have no money and I am thinking of doing porn. Am I doing anything wrong? What should I do?

860,"I (25F) moved into a new apartment with one female housemate and one male housemate. The guy showed me around the first day and explained how things worked. We chatted for a a half an hour or so. 

He's developed a crush on me and is doing little things that make living here difficult and annoying. We share a bathroom and the kitchen. Whenever he hears me in the kitchen, he immediately comes out of his room to pretend to get water or wash a dish to say hi to me and talk. He keeps trying to get me to interact with him. I am NOT interested in him at all, in fact I do not like him much or his politics (which came up in our first convo). I just want to live civilly and I like to keep to myself. I have made it clear and dropped hints that I don't want to talk with him, even as far as ignoring him and leaving the room as soon as he enters even though I was eating, and he still doesn't take a hint. 

It feels like being followed by a puppy - multiple times a day he'll come out if his room when he hears me, and now he knows my work schedule so he'll hop into the bathroom right before he knows I usually use it to shower after work. He seems happy when we ""run into each other"" when he does stuff like that. He even takes my mail and slides it under my door, which is weird and not something I asked for. 

I had a talk with him face-to-face about this yesterday and asked him to stop all this (to stop purposely trying to run into me and stop touching my mail). He pretended to not understand me and he also declared that he didn't know my schedule when I brought that up. Today, he's doing the exact same things again. 

I know he's not doing anything technically bad, and we both have access to those common spaces, but this is driving me crazy and I don't feel like I can have any privacy once I leave my room. I'm also annoyed he can't take a hint (or chooses not to) and won't leave me alone. Talking with him face to face didn't make a difference. Any advice?",19Jul2020,3
861,"Quick disclaimer: This is my first time really using reddit ;(

1: My friends and I were at a small birthday party. Only about 10 people were there and we were spending the night at the place. I went with my couple friends S and A. While we were at the party they left out to the car. I was kind of drunk but not wasted, just felt a tad warm but nothing mind altering. When they went outside they didn't come back for about an hour. K ( another guy at the party) invited me over to the couch he was on to watch anime with him. Being extremely lonely i went over and watched with him. He then began to touch me, which i said NO to due to there being several sleeping people surrounding us and i'm not the type of person to enjoy hook ups. He still kept trying and i said NO about 4 times before going into my head space and just reluctantly accepting what was happening.  

The next morning i woke up really early and began to cook for everyone, anything to avoid talking to K. I don't want to consider what happened to me as rape due but i did not give consent, but also didn't fight him anymore once i went into my head space. I told my friends about this when they woke up. They seemed to care a tad. Although, I wanted to get out of there ASAP like before K awoke. They had different plans though. When everyone woke up someone had rolled a blunt and offered and they wanted to smoke. S and A were my only ride so i had to wait. By this time K was up and i had to sit in the same room as him while they were smoking. He kept looking at me. After, we left. I spent the day with them but around 6:00pm one of the the birthday dudes mom called and wanted A to pierce her nose. He accepted because she gave them Vodka when they left me alone for an hour. I thought K would still be there and began to get nervous and asked to go home. I had family movie night that night anyways so i told A that. A then began to question me in a strange sarcastic manner, ""Oooohhhh what movie are you watching,"" as if he didn't believe me. I found that disgusting. About 2 months later i told my other friend P about the situation. He then messages A and S about it. They told him they were drunk and i did not tell them about it. You can't be drunk 10 hours after drinking. You can be hungover but not drunk after a full 10 hr nights rest. Plus i remember telling them about him touching me, not about the actual full thing because i was embarrassed. So basically A tried to lie about the whole situation and still to this day has lied about it all.

2: This one is definitely not as bad but i consider it wrong still. Basically I have an Autistic friend J. I met J in highschool. Shes a sweetheart. Basically i wanted my friends to meet J because she smoke and i thought we'd get along well. She has a place with her boyfriend and we all still live with our parents. Basically they didn't really talk to her, they called her pretty a few times but never had a full on convo with her. They'd constantly ask to sleep over there because she had a place and always had weed (well most of the time). I bought this up once like maybe we should actually talk to her because i felt as if we were using J and S and T (T is another friend part of the group) began to get really mad at me for even bringing that possibility up. Even though it was true, they rarely ever talked to her and always asked to go over there just because she had a place and possible weed. On top of all that shes disabled shes fucking autistic so not only were they using a person but this was a disabled person who couldn't quite understand mannerisms as well as someone without autism or an autism like disorder.

3: T was dating a guy named W. She was in a relationship with him for 2 months before this situation happened. W was a anti-physical fight hippy. They got into a verbal fight and she ended up beating him up and going to jail for it. Then lied about what happened. As a domestic abuse survivor she always was kind told me about my situation, she always told me i was valid. Then  she went along to beat her boyfriend to blood and got charged for it. If you don't believe me i have her mugshot. 2 of them for the same crime actually.

4: While being at Js house J asked her neighbor to come over and help us. Her neighbor was this old southern guy. He was kind of creepy but you could tell he wasn't a WEIRDO. Just a old lonely guy who wanted to help out. He bought pizza for us and was just going to stay till the pizza was delivered. S and T ignored this man, were rude to this man, etc. S has a past of child abuse with her father who isn't nearly as old as this guy was. I also have experienced child abuse, not as bad as hers but i still have. She used that as some sort of excuse to be extremely rude to this guy. The old guy went on a sad tangent about his wife dying and war stories. Just stuff ive had old people talk about with me in the past. When he was in the middle of the story he asked S what time it was. S ignored him at first then told him the time in a rude sassy manner. Moral of this story is that they were judging a book by his cover, i told them not to worry and to be kind to him. S excuse made sense at least a little, T had no excuse, she just wanted to be rude to a sweet lonely old man.

5: T went through a time period where she would never invite me to anything only A and S. Shes only nice to S because A used to be her boyfriend. T actually once handed A her SEXTOY!!! S though still is okay with T. I guess S rather have a boyfriend than morals.

6: The only reason we all became friends is because i had a 24 year old boyfriend at age 14 who could buy them drinks and cigarettes. After him and i broke up when i was 16 they were still my friends. A still sided with him but whatever.

The only reason im still friends with S, A, and T is because i have no one else. I don't go to school or am able to go to places without having a panic attack. Plus i've known these people (besides S) since highschool. Is it the right thing to do to still keep these people as my friends even though they don't really care about me in the slightest?",19Jul2020,1
862,"When we were together I had no problem with her having guy friends or even hanging out with them. I was confident that she’d be respectful to me and I never wanted to be one of those insecure, controlling dudes I’d seen around campus before. But now, after all this, and the subsequent dates I’ve had, it’s definitely opened my eyes to a few things.

“Guy friends,” are always trying to fool around with your girl, and she’ll probably give into it every now and again because it boosts her self esteem.

College age women lead consequence-free lives, and no matter what decision they make, it’ll be seen as righteous by their friends and peers.

Love is always temporary. She’ll forget about all the effort you put in to make her happy when something new and shiny comes along. Focus on material gain. Practice classical elegance. All those dates you paid for while she was sleeping around behind your back could have been put towards tailor made suits, hunting trips, or a country club membership. 

This isn’t 100% universal, but after four years at a university and one relationship where I thought I was truly loved and cared about, I realized it’s all a lie.

Keep to yourselves. Be decent, respectful, don’t antagonize people, but do not show excess compassion, especially towards young people, they are indulgent and entitled and lack the ability to empathize.",19Jul2020,0

I feel this really sore pain in my ankles, and then it shoots up my calves and stays there until I stop thinking about what started it. I’m not sure if anyone else goes through this. But then it’s like my brain tells me I’m in more pain than I actually am and then it gets super painful. Does anyone else have this or know what it’s called?

I am not happy with not being good at things I like or interested in. growing up, I perceived myself as being good at or 'talented' at almost everything I did, but over the years I have discovered many things which I am not particularly good at. This bothers me a lot, and every time I discover a new interest and find out I am bad at it, it frustrates me so much that I end up committing way too much time and even money to it even when it is not in anyway worth it. It's like I just want to prove to myself that I am good at it and then quit because it now becomes boring. 

The latest is a video game, a fucking video game. It's not even that I enjoy playing it a lot but that it angers me not being high ranked, by that I mean Grandmaster or Challenger, which is like 0.1% of a game with millions of players. It's so stupid and even unnecessary and yet I find myself compelled to keep doing it. Before this was basketball, which I spent over a thousand dollars on in just a few months till quarantine put a stop to that and before that was another.

No one was the first to ask people to hang out so I ALWAYS took it upon myself to do so because I loved them. It got to a point where I got sick of being the only one asking and trying and that friend group eventually fell apart.

This new one has been great for years. Since lockdown though planning has been rough. We haven’t seen eachother in a while and the first time we did my friend (let’s call her Alice) asked to make plans. We all did something together and it was fun. Then after that we went to a friend birthday. And Alice has been the one to make plans for a while now which was fine and it worked but i think, like me she got sick of it. 

Last week she asked if we wanted to go out for food since restaurants are opening again. We all agreed and it was great. Come to this week when Alice asks which day we should do it, one friend says “sorry I can’t anymore I’ve got a lot of online classes this week but you guys can go without me.” Another friend said “sorry I’m babysitting my brother all week and I don’t feel safe leaving him home alone but you gus can come to my house!” 

I said that was great but Alice said “I wanted food tho...” and I added “Yeah well Im personally fine doing anything so long as it’s with you guys but if (friend who’s babysitting) can’t go out then we should go to hers.”

Alice left the group on read and both me and the other friend asked more and she still ignored. After 40 mins she replies but says “any movie recommendations?” I just want her to give an answer idc if it’s “Sorry I don’t want to do that” I even suggested “Hey maybe if the three of us go to (friends house) this week then next week when were all free we get food that could work right?” But she still refuses to reply to that. 

I get it though and I’ve been meaning to text her (and I will tomorrow) apologising since she’s always the one to make plans and I’d explain why I don’t and also explain that I’ll do it more often and that jsut because I don’t plan things doesn’t mean I don’t care about her. I jsut want her to be straight with us about shit. 

What should I do with this? If she says no it’d feel weird to go to my friends without her. I feel like that would annoy her more idk.

886,"So as a kid I always hated my first name. I was always 1 of 4 and no doubt had to go by (Name) #2 or (Name) (First Initial of Last Name). I never felt special and always resented this about others. 

I stopped turning around in the hall (no one who called my name was ever talking to me). I searched for a few years, determined to go by something else in college. I found a name I'm happy with! I'm still mulling over a middle name, but, the reason I posted this....

My dad's family is kinda toxic and he's been loving but dismissive of almost every issue. He negates my problems and made a joke of me wanting to change my name (I haven't told him what I chose for college bc of this). He's said I was using my depression as a crutch for laziness (diagnosed and understandable, as I suffered childhood trauma!) When I came out (I'm a lesbian) he said he was ""traumatized by my announcement""?? It's totally fine now on this front and he's since tried (painfully) to show he accepts me (but I don't feel it). Oh, and he guilt trips me when I don't want to do things with him.

Sorry, this feels like I'm dumping everything about him. What I mean is all of that, the fact that it's a ""peanut butter name"" (mouthful and usually misspelled), and I don't resonate with it make me want to change it.

However I feel bad because although I won't be legally changing anything for a while, part of me feels guilty because it's a ""family"" name. I've never felt close to any of my family (apart from an older cousin--around dad's age) whose name I was thinking of taking.

The thing is, my mother lives on the other side of the country and visits maybe once a year. In addition to all this, I have anxiety issues and my psychologist says having a pet could be a good thing for me. 

I'm really not sure what to do. I know getting a dog would break her heart (and she takes any slight against her as a personal attack) as she would not be able to stay in my home while visiting.

897,"Not sure how to best word the title, but here's my issue. I have really good memory when it comes to what people say or do or little details about events. I'm also good at visualizing and seeing easier solutions to problems than what another person might think. My problem, which is mostly with my family and some friends, is that i'm constantly arguing or going back and forth with them when they don't remember something, but I do. Several times I'll have a discussion about something with a family member, come to an understanding, and several days or weeks later get into the same discussion and they'll talk and bring up points as if we never had the discussion before. Happens on many many occasions sometimes the same discussion will come up 2-4 times and every time it's as if it's the first time we're talking about it.

Other times something will happen, I resolve the issue and explain how to do it, but the next time it happens they'll have no clue of what I told them. I'm still trying to determine if it's really me  who's operating outside of what's normal for people to recollect and reference, or if it's that most everyone around me is having serious lapses in memory. I gets hard to sit there and listen to a story that I've heard the person tell me twice already and they're acting as if it's the first time they're telling me. Or when I remind a friend or someone of something and it takes quite a bit of concentration for them to finally remember.  I constantly have to debate with myself if I should act like I don't recall or if I should stare at them and see if they realize why I'm looking at them.

Now with doing work or problem solving, many times I'll think of an efficient, less costly and less physically demanding solution to a problem, but the person I'm working with will be convinced that the harder solution is better. Here's an example ( this didn't happen, but it's just to show what I mean), we have an hour to finish a job, we have plaster spackling tools and paint on hand and there's a small hole in the wall that needs to be repaired. My solution, patch up the hole with the plaster and paint it, we have everything we need, it'll be done quick and the hole is going to be behind an appliance so it's not even that critical. Their solution: no, lets rip out the sheetrock, drive to home depot get a new sheetrock board, install it, then plaster the seams, come back the next day and paint.

In situations like this it's really hard for me to concede after arguing about which one is more practical especially knowing that everyone including myself is going to have to do so much extra work that isn't necessary. This same sort of thinking happens with all sorts of situations around me. Packing boxes, shopping, moving furniture, prepping food etc. I constantly feel like I have to dumb myself down for those around me and It's starting to get to me.

I am an “apprentice” in the health care profession, at this point of time, my apprenticeship had been going on for a year, and I had one left. I worked at a nursing home where I didn’t thrive at all, it was so bad that I was on a sick leave for 3 weeks and I had to report it to the labor inspections. I began loosing weight, got a really bad short term memory(still do, 6 months later), constantly bad stomach and began to eat smaller and less. I stopped functioning and the only thing I could do was to clean in my apartment because that didn’t require too much focus... well, after three weeks I got away from there and started someplace else. I ish thrive, I don’t want to work there when I am finished with my degree, but it’s ok when my mentor is with me. 
I have a boyfriend who is amazing, he does everything for me and absolutely supports me in everything that I do. And when he joined my friend group, they were amazing at welcoming him, but with his friends, it is the complete opposite, barbeque? Only him. Swimming? Only him. Just casually hanging? Him. Now, I do get that they want some alone time, but it’s just that I never get invited. As with his family. I know that his family is special, like they all have aspergers. Nothing negative about that, it’s just a tiny bit hard for me to constantly adjust myself to them, when they don’t even try... I don’t thrive with them, and I can’t always point my finger as to why... I am not particularly fond of his brother as he is the worst, also a narcissist... but when we go to PIL’s house, they are always happy to see bf, but not so much me... and I can’t help but think that there might be something wrong about me? There must be something they don’t like about me, and I am trying to change and to be reflective, but they don’t seem to notice... i am rather extrovert, so I am all smiles and stuff, but I feel like my head is a mess... I don’t want to bother my bf, because I don’t know what I am bothering him with... he knows what I feel about his family and friends, and he is trying to be supportive, but I feel like it is not enough... 
well, lately I have been suspecting I might be depressed, but I don’t know what that is like as I have lived a rather sheltered life. Now, I have used Dr.google and searched up some symptoms and I have low energy levels, constantly tired, I don’t feel interested in anything, feels like giving up and just go to bed and sleep, I feel like I am not enough, wondering why anyone wants to be with me, I feel worthless... and I sleep a lot, wake up to go to work, come home at 4, sleep till 8 and then do nothing lying in bed...

But in these uncertain times things get a little stressful. I am unemployed with no return to the restaurant in sight and I don’t really care. Long story short, is there a trade or profession or online courses or school that would be good to get into right now? Or is there some other alternative out there to make a decent living for yourself? Besides selling drugs or other illegal shit I guess.

TL;dr lucrative trades or degrees to get into?",19Jul2020,1

Now, I don’t want any drugs in my life, and knowing he was against them made me feel that I could trust him even more with that. But today, he asked what would I do or what would happen if he did vape? Last time, he had asked what would happen if he did marijuana. Now this makes me feel like my head’s going to explode. I don’t want to control him but I don’t want him going down that path. I understand some drugs aren’t harmful and some may not be addictive but I don’t want it. I had asked if he wanted to try vape? He had said I don’t know. So I said, I just thought you never wanted them. And he said, no of course not, and then he had told me he didn’t want to talk about this any longer. I feel very confused.

908,Hey reddit the last month or so has been really tough for me because me best friend broke up with me. Ive been trying to hang out with friends but she is in the same friend group now it its been making it much harder to move on. Any advice?,19Jul2020,1
909,"Context: I am 17. My dad and his family (my sister, my grandma and my uncle) lives in a place far from my home (I live with my mom, 1 hour flight). I see my family every time I don't have school, about 5 times a year, most of the times I stay a week or so. This year I just could go see them once, in January. My dad is poor, he works 12 hours a day on a taxi and he had to take a 20k credit to pay his stuff bc he couldn't work bc of the Corona virus. He is pretty fked up

Now I'm in summer, and I used to stay a month and a half in my dad's house, last year I just stayed a month bc I didn't want to stay all that time, and this year I just want to stay 3 weeks (that's the problem I've got). My dad and my sister are EXTREMELY PISSED that I just want to stay 3 weeks there and not a month, but from my point of view, it's reasonable. (this is the first year im really creating friendships and hanging out, last year I didn't have many friends) 
1. All my friends are from my moms region
2. I don't have any friends in my dads region (not a single one) 
3. I don't see my dad very often when I am there bc he works too many hours, I spend more time with my grandma
4. I don't have money to do a single thing, not even have a coffee or hang out
5. Yesterday, their region entered in something similar to quarantine again (they just can leave their houses for important activities)
6. Due to the virus, I didn't have the chance to hang out with my friends this summer, we started hanging out about a month ago, so I still want to stay more time with them and have fun

Due to what I've been through during my life, I'm pretty mature for my age, and I try to see all points of view when I have a problem, and by doing that it has worked out every single time, but in this occasion I can't find a solution, or I stay more time there and lose my summer, or I stay the time I want and my family gets pissed with me.

I want to have fun, I am on the age of having fun with friends, I don't want to stay there all this time. Most kids of my age would just say ""fuck my family"" and do whatever they want to, but i don't want to make them feel bad.

What would you do if you were me?

910,"Hi Everybody,

I am 24M right now but there is a moment which pains me everytime when i am alone since i am 8 years old.  (actually its a start of a one big chain which made me hate the word called friend )

I got beaten for years in my elementary school (for 8 years i was the only Turk in Kurdish school and i had no father) i got beaten every day,and sometimes they even made a ring for me to get beaten while highschool or upperclass students bets on us. But i am not writing for this there was a moment which was harder for me even getting beaten every day. 

When i was 8 one day our teacher had to leave school early and she said nobody should move from their place and do the work she gave to us. She also put someone from upperclass as a monitor.  I was a very bad student one year before this (Because i had to fight everybody since i am 4 years old other than 3 friends of mine, i didnt even know how to communicate other than that ) but stopped with the help of my teacher that year. 

I made my work and sit quitely.Tomorrow our teacher came back and she had a list for students who made a noise when she was away. I was at that list for some reason i dont know (she probably wanted to write the person who was infront of me and mistyped) .I said i didnt do anything this time. She didnt believe at first but i never said a lie when i did something wrong so when i talked back to her .She stopped .I called my friends name and said Saliha(she),Nurullah(he) you were here to did you see me ever moving yesterday ? The answer i got was nothing. One of them was just completely silent and the other one said he saw me walking at class.  After that everything i explained before just continued until the day i graduate. Years later whenever i take bath or i am alone i still remember that moment, and i still hate the word friend. i hate it too much and i want to punch somewhere when i have to use it.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any advice for me ? If possible i just want to forget this pain, i dont want to remember this fucking childhood whenever i heard the word friend or i am alone...",19Jul2020,2
911,For the past week I have been fighting with my own mind about finally writting and posting my family's situation so that maybe we might find our own miracle. I've read so many stories about families having the courage to tell their story to the world in some hope that someone may be able to help guide them to a better future. Recently our world came to a hault and after doing everything that was possible I spoke to woman about our story and she suggested I wrote down exactly what i told her and post it on gofundme. The problem is I have a problem with the fact that people abuse those sites and there are so many people who don't need help that misuse it and i feel like there are so many people who truly need help that I don't want to seem like i feel that our situation is worse or more important than anyone else's. I have till the end of the month to figure out our situation and i would just like some advice as to whether or not i should stop being afraid and just try to explain our story the best I can and hope for a miracle or if I was right to think I'm being ignorant to ask strangers to help us.

933,"Recently I was waiting in a line in order to catch a ride to meet someone (the machine is constantly revolving and people load themselves on-and-off of it). On this line there were four different lanes— one was an accelerated lane for people with special permits, one was for non-grouped people, and the other two were for grouped people. I was standing in one for the group people and a person would regulate which group gets to load. My group was standing for a very long time, and then I noticed that people who entered the other grouped people line *long* after my group entered ours were being let into the machine, and my group was still waiting to be allowed into the machine by the person regulating the line. I know he knew my group was there because I looked at him right when he was looking at my group. I ended up talking about the waiting thing with my group and asking if I should try to get his attention (they said no so I didn’t). After a longer time than normal we were allowed in

The problem is that I reflected and realize that this is a pattern I’ve been having, not even with this particular situation— I’ve been getting really impatient lately and I want to improve myself so I don’t grow so irritated over waiting. That time today felt way longer than normal but I was still very negative (to be clear, I never made any comments about the line creator or saying they were doing a bad job or anything like that, it was just the actual “wow this is taking far longer than normal do I speak up/uggh this is loonngg” type of thing) and I don’t want to be a conplainer like that anymore.

Today I decided to

1. Remove Tiktok and delete my accounts from there (I suspect that maybe during the lockdowns instant gratification by loading videos on that app has made me more impatient) to see if that was the cause

2. Start a journal on my phone where on days I catch myself being impatient or generally irritated I write it down to see if there’s any cause I can find for it

But, I just don't like to do it. I struggle really hard to motivate myself to do it. And I'm not 100% certain why.

Funny thing is, it isn't the actual act of research itself that bothers me. If my favorite video game came out with an update, I could research that in a heart beat no problem. But when it comes to topics that are important to know, such as what is going on in the world, I flander. Even funnier, I sometimes struggle to research topics I have a mild interest in, for example besides video games I am also a mild fan of Astronomy and programming, but cannot muster up the motivation to actually research the later two at least some of the time.

I have a few ideas as to what could be wrong. Maybe I just don't like to hear things that make me uncomfortable. Or maybe I'm afraid I'm not going to find the research I need, forcing me to spend hours of my *free time* looking. Or maybe it has nothing to do with any of this and its just a mental state that I get stuck in. Or a combination of these things.

I want to write a letter to my Congressperson advocating an issue that's important to me but I don't want to put forth the research needed to make it good.

I hate that i find it hard to relax and dance, or worse - sing. When i get to the dance floor i feel like frozen, unable to even move so i always seek a way out and thinking “everyone is looking at me because i cant dance and everyone thinks how boring of a person i am for it etc”

I really hate being like this and for years i was wondering why am i not like the others, why can’t i enjoy dancing like everyone else. I would really like to be able to enjoy dancing but I simply cannot move. No matter how much i think to myself: “no one cares how you dance, just relax” I can’t bring myself to do it. I also think I would look weird and silly dancing.

Beacuse I never really dance at parties I feel like if I would - just by some miracle - start dancing, everyone would talk about it and look at me weird since i never danced and I would be even more uncomfortable.

Also, in one of the bathrooms, when there was shit on the toilet seat, I would just spray it with the house, and I'm sure I got water between the toilet, and the brick wall, and I'm afraid it produced mold, and anyone who uses the bathroom is being put at risk. Also, in one of the supply rooms behind the bathroom. It is connected to the bathroom, it's just not accessible by the general public. When I was filling up the mop bucket, I would often get water on the floor, and it would make a puddle. I would usually push it outside with a squeegee, but I still left it wet. It just didn't think i needed to worry, seeing as the floor, and walls were concrete, and not drywall, or wood. I'm worried because I could be putting everyone at risk who steps in those bathrooms. That's thousands, maybe millions a year. I'm sure those bathrooms will be around a lot longer then me too. I'm afraid to call because I'm fairly certain they wont care, and then I'll have to call OSHA. Do you think I'm onlogated to Go and try to get rid of the mold myself? Also, a couple times when I was spraying down the walls in the showers, I got water on the cieling. I'm bit sure exactly what the ceilings mad of, but it looked like pained drywall. I never saw any mold on it though.",19Jul2020,1
962,"For the last couple years I've been developing the idea and the urge to leave my home late at night/ early in the morning to be outside, explore, and spice up my life. My parents are overly protective and shield me from most events in life. I know it's for good reasons but I want to get out an experience the world by myself. I believe it would be better if I experienced this while I'm still young as I'm only 15 (yet I look like a early 20 y/o) yet, I'm an African American male which I believe makes it much more risky. You may be wondering while the sun isn't out? Mainly because I know my parents wouldn't let me be out there by myself period, so while they're asleep would be my best opportunity. My idea of ""late night exploration"" would be going out of my neighborhood and just walking around seeing what I could ""find"".

971,"Sry if this is confusing, the whole thing is confusing for me as well.

I date a guy for 2 months now.
At the start it was all perfect, we met like 1 time a week but with sleepover, so we spent 2 days together in a week. From the Start, he told me he needed much to get in a relationship. He has trust isssues and he would want development from me in all ways.. then he would Catch feelings. Development in  academic and also superficial ways (he wants me to lose weight and be healthier but also prettier).

When I said I have feelings for him, he said then lets meet only every 10 days. 
Then at some point it just went to once a week. 

Then I broke up one day because in my opinion he was too distant. He was angry that I didnt discuss it before with him and he told me we could meet twice a week.

After that I still felt like he was very distant and I wanted to break up again. Then he AGAIN convinced me, him having so little time for me would change when he won't have so much Uni stuff. Anf that we can meet 3-4 times a week from August on.

Today he was at my place and since the breakup-try (that was 2 days ago) he was very closed and didnt talk much, we almost only had sex and then he went home.. No romance today, no big feelings 😪
But he had to study afterwards, that is tiring him at the Moment.

He wanted to see me less to ""protect me"" he said.
And the losing weight thing is not soo Importen, its just an aspect he said.
And its normally not only about Sex. 
He is so nice actually, I cant imagine him taking advantage of me :/
And he this is ""trying out"" a relationship but we are exklusive, so both arent allowed to see someone Else.

He said also that he was searching for a person with good heart and you can change the Look by time.
Maybe this changes things?


Is it normal that he is even more distant and am I insensitive for not understanding that? Am I the asshole?

Or is he Bad for me?
I don't know right from wrong, I am so confused. 
And everytime we meet, I feel so bad afterwards because he isn't totally ""in"". I am the needy one, and I am crazy for him. But he isn't and he is crazy for no one.

972,"I'm 17 and my sister is 13. We used to constantly argue but I became more aware of my own bratty behavior and started to be nicer to her, but now she still acts the same way she used to. She still has attitude about everything. She's extremely rude to me but i try to tolerate it and either ignore her behavior or respond as if what she said wasnt rude (ig in a way ignoring the behavior but not her). 

Whenever i give her an ounce of attitude (which i only do when i feel like shes being rude to me) she starts fighting with me even though she does what i did for a second CONSTANTLY. And im so fed up with it. I feel like i respect her boundaries (which she'll freak out if i dont) but she doesnt even care to respect mine. 

To be fair, she learned to be a brat because of me. I feel so bad that she feels she needs to act this way and that its probably because of how I used to act bc I was not a good older sister. And maybe I do have attitude and dont realise it. 

Just now I got into a fight w her bc she was mad at me for not talking during a conversation (i didnt have anything to say). 

She said, ""Can you say something, you not talking is making me uncomfortable."" (imagine that but w an annoyed tone of voice) 

so i said, ""what should i say?"" 

she said, ""anything"" 

i said ""why should i force myself to talk because of your problem?""

she said ""you dont have to be a b*tch""

i said ""you are a b*tch about everything"" and walked off. 

She tries getting me to talk everytime i dont have something to say and she says things like ""Youre boring"". But i understand i was in the wrong this time. And this particular situation wouldnt have bothered me if she wasnt like this all the time. 

Dont get me wrong though, she is fun to be around, shes a funny person and we get along well (mostly because I ignore her rude behavior or try to) but i just want a relationship where i dont feel constantly looked down upon. 

How should I apologise for my behavior earlier? And what can i do to improve our relationship? (talking to her about our relationship will not help btw, shes too difficult for that but you can tell me the right way to apologise to her)

The other day I heard him crying in his room and I wanted to give him privacy but knew something was up. He didn’t know I knew so he was acting normal after that but I instinctively knew it was something bothering him deep down. I asked him how everything was going and he said everything was going good and that if he needed to talk to me about anything he could. Anyways, the next day I took him out on a car ride to make sure everything was REALLY ok. He was really nervous and I pulled over for him to tell me that he thinks he’s gay and doesn’t want to be. 

I told him I love him no matter what but he defiantly said he doesn’t want to be gay and that I couldn’t ever tell anybody. I told him there was nothing wrong with being gay but he said he’s going to do whatever to not be. At this point he got really upset and was crying nonstop, being my shyest son he hardly expresses himself in this way. He told me he wants to be sent to conversion therapy which as far as I know is illegal in my state and I told him to stop being ridiculous and that I would never do that. 

I feel terrible because he’s in such a male dominated household and unfortunately my sons will drop the fa**ot line and “that’s so gay” a lot. I think he wants to fit in with his brothers and other boys his age above else so I’m worried about his mental state and idk what to do.

984,"So here’s the current situation: When I(15F) was 11, I needed a new bed. I’d had the previous one for around 7 years before we decided I had outgrown it. After a LOT of deliberation, I decided on a loft bed from Pottery Barn Teen. The bed cost around $3,000 with the matching dresser. Though the bed was listed under the “teen” section, it feels very childish to me. It makes my room seem like it’s not mine. I’m currently 15, and I decided that for my 16th birthday I want a new bed. 

The beds I’ve looked at cost around $200-500 and my personal favorites are on the cheaper side. As my current bed has a built in desk, I’d need a new desk as well, and the one I want (which comes with shelves that would make up for the storage that I’d lose from getting rid of the old bed) is only around $150. So I’d probably end up spending around $400 on the new furniture. 
I searched on Ebay and beds from Pottery Barn similar to mine sell for around $1000. So I would use the money that I got from my bed to pay for my new furniture and be done with it. It wouldn’t cost any money and it’s what I told my parents I want to do. My mom is all for it, but my dad is completely against it. He says that it is a “net loss”. 

I will have kept the bed for 5 years before selling it. It would cost my dad nothing and he still refuses. I even asked if I could get that for my birthday, and my dad still says no. He says I don’t need it. And though he’s right, I don’t “need” it, we don’t ask for things we need on our birthdays. If I hadn’t asked for the bed I would have asked for jewelry, so basically I’m saving him money. I’m asking him to not spend money on my 16th birthday and he refuses. 

The other thing about this to note is that my parents just got a new bed, my dad let my brother(17M) get rid of part of his old bed (it came in 2 parts), and my dad wants to buy a new tv. He also got my brother a new computer for Christmas even though he’d only had his old one for about a year and it worked fine. I’m not sure why he won’t let me get a new bed, and his arguments make no sense. He also refuses to sit down with me and talk about it.

989,"OK I NEVER POST ON REDDIT BUT I'M FEELING HOPELESS AND I HAVE NO ONE TO GO TO ABOUT THIS. I've been living with my roommate (R) and 3 other girls for two semesters until school shut down for covid, and I had never met any of them before. R was dumped by her boyfriend of 2 years during the second week of school, and me and my other roommates comforted her over it. She and I quickly became best friends after that. Around the same time, I was entering a relationship with a girl at my school. While I was in this relationship, R confided in me that she was questioning her sexuality, and told me she felt she could be bisexual. Having been an out lesbian for 6 years, I supported her and advised her in some areas. 

This flipped the switch in my head to develop an attraction to her. I am never attracted to straight girls until the second they tell me they are possibly into women. What developed into an infatuation with my roommate and best friend ended up taking a roll on my relationship, which ended as the semester ended. I went home for holiday for a month and over that time away from R, I fell even more in love and even imagined the possibility of us being together. I was determined to tell her how I felt when we returned to campus for second semester.

However, over her holiday in her hometown, she rekindled her relationship with her ex (who I consoled her over) and told me they were back together shortly after the semester resumed. I had some resentment towards her ex for how badly I knew he treated her during their breakup, and this created some tension between R and I that we later talked about and resolved. But I never revealed my feelings for her, and I hoped they would go away as I sought out new love. 

Our school shut down over our spring break and I went 4 months without seeing R. I became so preoccupied with the other stresses of the world that I forgot about my feelings for her. Until, not long ago, I visited her in her hometown and stayed with her family. I felt so welcome and at home with her and upon leaving, I have spiraled back into the cycle of yearning and pining and crying over her. Simultaneously, since I left her house, she has been keeping more distant from me in small but noticeable degrees. 

I'm (hopefully) going back to school at the end of August and we already made plans to live together again. I want to tell her how I feel so I can hear her tell me it's not a possibility so I can put this behind me. I don't know if it will help though, and I don't want to push her even further away from me by doing so. I cherish her as a friend more than anyone else in my life. I've fallen in love with my best friend before and it went over really bad so I want to do it right this time. 

Do I have a conversation with her about this? How do I move past my feelings for her? How do I stop feeling a stupid pang of jealousy when I see her boyfriend?

Context: 
Moving out of my college town with my gf (referred to as S) &amp; a friend who we’ll call A. Me &amp; A have been looking for places to live together since mid May. Me &amp; S have a lease ending at the start of August &amp; A is couch hopping so time is not on our side.

Problem: 
Me &amp; A’s best friend has been the opposite of supportive due to how they feel about the move. We’ll call the best friend R. R has been informed of our decision to look into living in places outside of our College Town. R still has some time before graduation. R confides in the rest of our friend group &amp; blew up on A when he went to get some of his stuff from her house, as A has been couch hopping. R told A that she can’t wait to be able to say “I told you so” regarding our move being unsuccessful. R never offered alternate options to help us seek housing in the college town. Because R vented to the rest of our friends &amp; updated them on our progress with looking, when it came day to sign a lease for a July 22nd move in date, shit hit the fan. A asked in our group chat, if we could have an open dialogue without personal attacks. R &amp; the rest of our friends felt that because they were kept in the dark, they had the right to essentially, cut ties. They felt they got no info, even though R told them everything she knew, the same day she found out, which was always within 48 hours of me/A/S getting info. So R &amp; friends feel that me &amp; A feeling anxious over telling them news that should be told from us, doesn’t hold up to what they perceive as no info.

Willing to give more context, reasons for moving, rough dates, paraphrasing of convos! Can’t say I will be super active, as S &amp; myself are packing. But the asvice will still help me to move on in the future.

Question: How would yall handle friends who are willing to cut ties over you moving only 5 hours away?

I feel like I’ve been fine but it’s been three months and I saw a video of him singing and my heart just instantly broke and it’s so frustrating that I haven’t been over him yet, because were still quarantined I haven’t seen absolutely anyone except for my parents for 3 months so I don’t really have much to distract myself. 
My ex and I still talk, I think that that does me good because I feel like I haven’t lost him and he still loves and cares a lot about me, so I really enjoy talking to him and I don’t think that’s the reason why I’m not over him yet, but maybe it is. 
I’m just so tired of feeling sad and I want to be able to support his music career without it breaking my heart or just feel alright with myself being single, Idk I just feel so alone and I know he’s doing just fine and it hurts a lot.",19Jul2020,2
1006,"Hi everyone! Would love some advice!

I am a makeup artist by profession, however after much debate, I decided not to do makeup videos on youtube and focus on my other interests instead. I feel like too many people are doing it, and without the new makeup tools and palettes, no one would be able to separate me from other youtubers.
 
I am, however, an avid fitness person. I workout everyday, I’ve trained with coaches and I know a lot of different home workouts, most of which I made myself while being quarantined. This made me want to do home workout videos (ranging from quick 5 min ab workouts to 45 minute full workouts), on top of that, maybe occasionally vlog about my travels. I am also a Filipina that has lived in Los Angeles and Nevada for the past 7 years, left the Philippines by myself. I think I am a bubbly person and people always seem to respond well to me online.

One thing I am worried about is that I am not certified and I am also not in the best “fitness girl” body (but I’m working on it) and it makes me insecure and unsure if I should start my channel. I do not want to be labeled as just a fake because I don’t have the credentials yet, but this is my lifestyle and I want to share it.

Anyone else gone through the same dilemma?? Thank you in advanced.",19Jul2020,1

1010,"When I get really sad I sometimes do this thing where one moment I'm sobbing my heart out, gasping for air, and trembling, and then all of the sudden I just snap out of it and im completely normal with no tears and a straight face, and I no longer feel the urge to cry at all. It's really weird. It's not something I'm trying to do, it just happens. Sometimes I even try to keep crying in an attempt to stay in touch with whatever I'm sad about, but I always just end up snapping out of it (against my will) and becoming completely detached from my sadness. I even kinda forget about whatever I was just crying abt when I stop crying. But then the sadness will hit me again out of nowhere and I'll start crying again. The difference between these two states is super drastic and I alternate between them very rapidly. It almost feels like there's two of me, the deeply wounded one, and the indifferent casual one, and they are in a constant tug of war for presence whenever I get sad. I also kinda laugh and smile while I'm sobbing sometimes (again, not something I'm trying to do on purpose) even though I'm really sad. The laughing can also serve as a intermediary between the two states. Has anyone else ever dealt with this? What is wrong with me?",19Jul2020,2
1014,"My mom and I took in a pregnant stray cat earlier this spring, and she gave birth to some beautiful kittens. They stayed in my bedroom as they grew up, and I became really attached. But we couldn’t keep them all since we already have cats ourselves, so after about ten weeks, we decided to rehome them.

My mom did the work rehoming them, but I have now realized that we were irresponsible about it. She gave them away for free, and we didn’t do any house check or the sort. I should have stepped in and done the rehoming myself. I am ashamed that we didn’t do more. 

We eventually met with a family that was interested in the kittens. They originally were interested in two, but asked if we could bring the rest as well. We did, and they said they wanted all four of them. I was alarmed and looked at my mother, and burst into tears. I should have spoken up. It seemed like a lot of kittens to take at once, and I worried for them. But the family comforted me, promised me that they would take care of them and provide us with updates. 

They have kept their promise and updated us every week. I have received a lot of pictures, and they all seem to be loved and doing well. At one point, one of the kittens had a sick eye, but they took him to the vet for treatment. I am very thankful. 

But a week ago, my mom saw them online asking for another kitten. My mother confronted them about it, and she said their family wanted another kitten, maybe a different color than the others. I was also told that their oldest daughter is pregnant and thinking of getting a kitten for her daughter, so maybe it’s related?

I don’t know. I think about those kittens every day. I am ashamed of myself for being so irresponsible with the rehoming process. Am I worrying too much? Or is there something that I can do?",19Jul2020,1

1017,"Long story short, there was a girl I became very good friends with in a short period of time. We worked together every day, talked all day and night long about personal and mental health issues, she was in my wedding, etc. However, after asking her to be in my wedding I began to realize the friendship was more of a one way street and she had some behaviors I didn’t like (constantly talking about other people behind their backs, shaming people that wanted to improve their lives) and that, coupled with the jealous behaviors she exhibited while planning my wedding I decided to just pull the plug on our friendship for the sake of my own mental health. She didn’t take it well. I admit that I didn’t execute the situation well. It didn’t end well. 

It’s been a year and a half since we’ve really talked as friends and I just saw on Facebook that her sister had passed away unexpectedly. She and her family are very, very close. Her sister also did my hair for my wedding and I saw her in the salon until my ex-friend and I had a falling out, so I briefly knew her as well. I can only imagine how hurt she is right now, it’s a very tragic situation as her sister is leaving behind a one year old and husband, and I would like to reach out to her to express my sympathy.

One of my friends, let’s call her X, was with me when he first messaged me, so in the following days she was always asking me what he and I were talking about and was just generally very interested, so I was happy to tell her. Today X messaged me and told me she did a “social experiment” on him. Basically, after he first messaged me she created a new account, started messaging him and has been talking to him ever since. I think she wanted to “warn me” that he was also talking to other girls besides me, but we haven't been talking for that long and never made plans to see each other or anything, so I think it’s very normal, I’m also taking to other people. While I was reading X’s messages another friend, Y, was with me and she thought her behavior was really weird and that her tone in telling me that the guy had also been talking to her the whole time was kind of smug. I think it came across that way because she used a lot of laughing emojis, but I didn’t see any signs of malice. I don’t think X did it with ill intentions, also because she didn’t really do anything bad at the end of the day, but Y’s words started to make me question why X waited two weeks to tell me and what even was the point of the “social experiment”. 

So, I’m looking for some more opinions. 
Do you think what X did was weird? Should I say something to her or am I just worrying too much about the whole thing and should let it go?

I don’t care that she’s fat. I really don’t. But I don’t want to talk about it with her.

I can’t say, “noooo you’re not fat!” Cause she’s obviously overweight. 
But there is nothing wrong with that (except for health issues of course). 

Or when I eat a healthy lunch, she makes a comment about how she can’t control her eating or eat healthy. I usually say something along the lines of “oh this was just easy/cheap to pack” or “I’m not that healthy at dinner” 
Every single day at lunch she says “I have a real problem with portion size” in a very serious tone. At this point I’ve stopped responding but then she will usually say it again.

1040,"BACKGROUND: My oldest sister (let's call her ""Hilary"") married her husband (let's call him ""Kyle"") in a hurry upon discovering they were expecting my eldest nephew years ago. We had only met him a handful of times but we welcomed him nonetheless. They now have another son and since moved a long way away so we hardly see them but we love them to bits!

Kyle was soon revealed as a manipulative, controlling narcissist who bullies others for fun. His tactic for debating trivial or important subjects involves aggressively talking at you before making personal insults until you cry and/or give up. All under a ""cheeky chappy"" pretence. If you stand up to him, call him out on his behaviour or you offend him somehow, he cuts all contact. He has driven away Hilary's friends through this behaviour and has only recently reconnected with his own family after having cut them off for years. He even hired a lawyer to threaten legal action against some former friends if they attempted to contact him again after a disagreement. I think Hilary and the boys are terrified of him.

He treats my family like dirt. When they come to stay, he:
- belittles my mum 
- demands Hilary or my mum make him food when he is hungry
- is rude to my parents' friends or ignores them completely
- dictates what is on TV
- rifles through our things if he is ""looking for something""
- insults our religious beliefs
- tries to avoid paying for anything while he is there

My other BIL has heard Kyle say that he could ""do anything [he] wanted in [my parents]' house because they know [he] could stop them seeing their grandchildren"" as well as ""when [my parents] die, [he] will be the head of the family"". This seriously scares my parents as they are getting on a bit now and worry what will happen in the future.

As a family, we have just accepted Kyle's behaviour for the sake of peace. We put up with it so we can see Hilary and the boys. We know that if we stood up to him he would make good on his threats because he has with his own family in the past.

CURRENT DILEMMA: When Kyle met my now Fiancé, he immediately laid into him. Fiancé hates confrontation and wouldn't hurt a fly so was very hurt. Neither of us want to invite him to the wedding for fear of him insulting our friends/Fiancé's family or mocking the religious aspects of it. He doesn't care about us and always says he hates weddings. He would only want to go because he thinks he 'should' be there for photos etc. Frankly with Covid-19 restrictions, I would rather have somebody we like anyway! But I know if my parents and I tell him he can't come, he might make good on his threat. I don't want to think that i have ruined the peace of the family or that I might not see Hilary and the boys for years. As for my parents, it would break them not to see Hilary and their grandchildren.

What should I do?

TL;DR My BIL Kyle has been rude, bullying and demeaning to my family for years. He thinks he can get away with his behaviour because my family know he would stop us seeing his sons, my nephews. Fiancé and I don't want to invite him to our wedding in case his behaviour ruins it but also don't want to risk him making good on his threat.",19Jul2020,3

1042,"Where do I begin... please bear with me this is a lot. I'll try to simplify as I can.

I was dating a man for nearly 3 years. It was great at first, then he showed sides of him that were...less than favorable we shall say...

In the course of the relationship I did a lot for him. Gave him a new cellphone, new gaming console, took him to concerts, helped pay his rent, and on three separate occasions got him into a new car, even paid for our handfasting, was even planning our wedding. I didnt mind doing any of this for him because I loved him. 

We now live in a townhouse with 2 other people.

Here is where I need the advice

He had this great job, needed a new car as his old one was not worth keeping. It had become a literal safety hazard. In September of 2019, we went to a reputable dealer. He did not have any kind of credit score, however, I did and cosigned on the loan. I got him into a brand new 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander. Both of our names have to be on the title. 

He ended up losing the job in January of 2020, due to poor behavior at the comapany. It's around this time I call off our relationship, because he pretended for a full day that everything was fine. Even pretended to go to work, when he actually went over to a friends house, then came home in the wee hours of the morning and told me he had been fired then. I do not tolerate lying, and this had been an issue throughout our relationships.

We agreed to stay together until our debts get paid off. Then we can go our separate ways. He agreed to sleep on the couch up stairs and I get my room. 

Problem is he has started to show sides to him that are well...disgusting to myself and our housemates/roommates. Examples are but not limited to: jacking off in the living room on the couch, sleeping in the living room naked, has left SKID Mark's on the couch.  Refuses to exhibit proper personal care/hygiene, gives hell about helping maintain cleanliness of the house. Has taken food that was not his from our roommates. 

It's becoming abit much and its driving my roommates and I... insane. I'm doing what I can to maintain the peace, because he does help financially but that's really it.

Everyone is at the point of wanting him out, however, he has no where to go. Which means if I kick him out he will stop making payments on the car, which will affect me and my credit.

I just want to start over, I'm tired of living with someone that has become very self centered. At the time of writing this, $2000 has been paid off of a $27000 loan. This loan will be paid off in roughly 6 ½ years at our current pace. Is there a way for me to get this off of me, or am I stuck with him?

Edit: I live in United States. Located in Kansas City, Missouri.

TLDR: Stuck in a car loan with my toxic ex, do not want to live with him anymore. Is there a way to break the cosign agreement so that the car is solely on him not on me?",19Jul2020,1

The other bedrooms are used to store junk in. I’ve tried asking my dad if I could just take one of the bedrooms filled with his junk and move it into another room but got yelled at instead. My dad is also emotionally abusive and has dragged me by my hair and tried breaking my leg just for putting a chair next to the pool when I was 8 so I’m scared of what will happen to me if I move his stuff. He rarely hits me anymore but I can’t help being nervous. I also can’t call the cops if something does happen to me for other reasons I don’t want to talk about. I feel uncomfortable sleeping in the same bedroom as him at this age, should I proceed with my plan or just leave things the way it is? This [room](https://imgur.com/gallery/z0itWca) has speakers I can’t exactly move with ease (5’4 and 90 lbs to put into perspective) and if I plan to go ahead with my plans it’ll take some time to do so which I might not be able to go unnoticed.",19Jul2020,2

1051,I have been searching for this for a while and not exactly sure how to go about it. I quite often find at work that people appear to me as immature and antagonistic and it just feels like a huge waste of time. I’ve had this experience at the majority of my jobs and even in college. It’s been years and I feel like I’m trapped under their control and they can do and say whatever they want and there is nothing I can do to rise above it. It feels like an abusive relationship where I’m constantly being gaslighted into thinking I’m worthless and they say whatever they want and people believe them. Nobody will tell me why they are doing these things. I feel like some people have decided to make me a target and there isn’t a anything I can do to protect myself.,19Jul2020,0

So, recently I've really started to buckle down on my writing, and as a result I've become a lot more introverted. I don't really like to talk as much as I used to, as too much social interaction can be exhausting for me. 

I will admit, I have gotten really opinionated, and whenever someone says something that gets me tilted, I have to put in my two cents. 

Sometimes I will get in a conversation with my mother, and in the middle of our discussion, she says ""It's not easy to talk to you anymore"". Of course, when I ask why, instead of explaining herself she just says incredibly vague things like ""you're always so abraisive"". Now, phrases like this really piss me off, for two reasons. 

#1 That is incredibly vague, so I have no idea what you're really trying to say.

#2 By saying ""always"" you're assuming that every time I have ever talked to you I have acted this way. 

When I stand up for myself and just ask her why instead of just apologizing for no reason, she just walks away, not even giving me an answer. I'm not trying to push people away, I just get really pissed whenever someone isn't specific with their wording. She has a chronic condition of not being able to explain herself. 

I'm willing to admit that I may be the problem here, but she doesn't even give clarity whenever I ask her if that's the case. She never gives me a chance to find out what's going on. I'm getting tilted just typing this out because this is so hard to explain because they'res so little information.

Please don't spare my feelings, spare my time. I just want this problem to be solved, and if I'm the source, then that's all the better, since it's in my control so I can fix it.",19Jul2020,2

I watched the first episode of I May Destroy You - a TV show by UK writer Michaela Coel based on her own experience of sexual assault.

The first episode reminded me of a moment in my first year of university (aged 20 at the time). I hadn't really drunk alcohol before then, and I was on a Christmas bar crawl with course mates. I knew people by name but didnt really know anyone well enough to stick with a friend or a group of people.

After we reached the third pub I have zero memory of the night. The next thing I remembered was sitting on some random guys lap in a karaoke bar (no memory of how I got there or who the guy was) and a member of staff in the bar saying I need to leave. 

I was confused and I just stood up and walked out. Fortunately one of the older students saw and kindly walked me home to make sure I got there safe. 

I rolled into bed still fully dressed and when I woke up in the morning I found dried blood dripping down my leg from a scrape on my knee and I felt what I thought was a hangover. 

I wrote it off as just being ""blackout drunk"" for the first time. I felt a little paranoid that I couldn't remember anything but I thought hey, everyone's had that at some point. 

When I returned after the Christmas break a dude from my course said he found some photos of me from that night in his phone, and in some of them a random guy (stranger) had his hand up my skirt. I felt gross but laughed it off and tried not to think anything else about it.

I always looked back on that night cringing and would retell it to people as my ""funny drunk story"" but after watching the first episode of this TV show, I'm wondering whether I was actually spiked? 

It's been six years since that happened and many more nights out drinking, and I've never had a blackout-drunk moment like that since. I've drank to excess but it's never ended up in a complete disorientating blank in my memory like that night was. 

After watching that first episode I've just sat here frozen for like 20 mins feeling really upset all of a sudden. Am I being paranoid? Or was this night actually more sinister than I've thought for all these years?",19Jul2020,1

1058,(16) my mom keeps on asking me this and I keep telling her that I’m not gay and it’s really annoying me. My voice kind of sounds higher pitched like a (gay voice) but idk why else she would think this me and my friends as of right now have one girl friend that hangs out in our group and my mom keeps asking me if I like her. I told her just as a friend which I would think is pretty normal. The last thing she did today is told me to take off of my Facebook that I’m interested in women like wth?

1059,"my fiancé doesn’t know...
hey guys, first off i want to say that i am not proud of this, and i just need your advice on the situation.

okay so here it goes, my fiancé doesn’t know that I’m a mtf transsexual woman. when we first started dating, i truly just wanted to leave my past behind, forget those awful times of suffering where i wasn’t able to live life comfortably. and i of course want to still forget my past because i truly don’t let this aspect of me define me, especially since i was likely born with kleinfelters syndrome which made things so easy for me regarding the transition.

i deeply care about him, he’s a sweetheart, a good man, and i know he will be a good husband and father, but sadly at this time there is no active way that id ever be able to have my own children. im not scared, but i don’t want to hurt him, and that was never my intention. a part of me just wants to runaway but i don’t want to tell him then lose him, even though i wouldn’t blame him.",19Jul2020,5

Really want to look into taking gun safety courses so I can have a better understanding and respect for guns. Maybe take them too. Does the anxiety ever stop?

I'm terrified of 1.) Me being a carrier and getting them sick. 2.) Me being the reason my mother meets up with my grandmother and she gets her, or even me sick unknowingly.

1064,"So my friend started talking to this guy a year ago but he ended up breaking things off with her because he didn’t see a future with and then started dating another girl a week later. and this absolutely broke my friend and she hated him for the longest time. but about 2 months ago his gf broke up with him and he started talking to my friend again.

our friend group warned her of course and said to be cautious when it comes to him. but she ignored us and is now moving to his town a month into their relationship. they recently said I love you and are talking about marriage and kids. but mind you, they haven’t even been talking for a month and a half. 

her bf came to town this weekend and we all decided to go to the bar and grab drinks. I decided I would meet him with my most unbiased face and wanted to give him another chance because people change ya know? 

well what happened instead was the most awkward night of my life and i’m the type of person who gets along with almost anyone. 

I’ll just go over a couple things that he did: he complained immediately about the rules of the bar and how we have to wear masks and he said he is just gonna break them all, (I watch anime and brought that up) and he asked oh are you the type that watches weird anime porn, he asked if the weird slit in my eyebrow was on person or not, said he can’t stand being around women and said he needs to be around more testosterone, called our asian friend “LING LING” (I called him out of course and he just laughed), kept telling his gf (our friend) to shut up, for mad at his gf for making a joke, told us all we don’t have real jobs cuz we have minimum wage jobs (we are all college students), told our friend she’s an idiot for going back to a guy who broke up with her (ironic), kept yelling at me when I said almost anything, made fun of our hearing impaired friend, and a lot more stuff if you can imagine. 

Never in my life have I felt more uncomfortable, nervous, and unable to look someone in the eyes.. and the weirdest thing that happened was whenever we would bring something slightly controversial up our friend would whisper and tell us to be quiet and not bring that up around him. 

So for obvious reasons our friend group does not like him and doesn’t want to see our friend be with him. we have told her in the past he doesn’t seem like a good guy but at this point i’m not sure what to do. 

should we allow her to be with him cuz he seems to make her happy? or should we speak up? and if so how do I go about speaking up?? 

at this point I don’t think I would really ever want to be around him ever again so it will be future issue I think..  so please help! i’m at a loss!!  thank you for reading!

edit: I thought it would be good to add that my friend who is dating him is native american and he always says how if they have kids they will be ugly cuz of her dark skin and he tells people that she is his little indian... ( cannot even fathom how she is okay with his blatant racism!!)",19Jul2020,1
1065,"I live in a manufactured home neighborhood but in the last couple of months one of my neighbors has been blasting their bass or possibly subwoofer so loud that it is rattling my house. It's driving me nuts. I've called the police multiple times but each time the police drive by the noice is temporarily down/quiet. I've complained to my neighbood HOA(the none evasive kind unlike what is normally complained about)  and despite their efforts... Nothing has been done. I'm having trouble tracking the noise to a specific house preventing me from confronting the offending neighbor. 

I've lived here for 35 years and this is the first time I've had to deal with this level of loud neighbors. I typically prefer to keep to myself and don't know all of my neighbors. And I really don't mind loud music unless it's rattling my house. 

As I can't seem to get anywhere with the normal avenues to deal with loud neighbors... I need some advice on what to do next. Should I get petty revenge?",19Jul2020,1
