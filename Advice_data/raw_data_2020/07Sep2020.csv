1,"I have been friends with my friend since the 1st grade. We were in the same resource room so we bonded instantly. It was always hard for her to make friends and people kind of made fun of her. I was always there to be her friend. 

Years went by and I’ve noticed she became super clingy or codependent towards me. And still is sort of today. We are both 24 now. I’ve always felt bad for her because it’s always been a little difficult for her to make friends. She tries to get super super super close to people and clings to them. She also asks a lot of questions to find out more about them. A lot of people notice her behavior and start to pull away. 

Despite her difficulty with making friends and me feeling bad about her, I’m at the point where I have outgrown the friendship. What’s holding me back from ending it, is I’ve known her family for years and also feel bad because she does not have many friends. She can be toxic to me sometimes I feel like. She’s always had a bad opinion about my friends, she never seems like she wants the best intentions for me, and she can be a little controlling. I find she does not really have boundaries. 

For example: I was at a bar with her a few years ago, and we bumped into these two guys. I was talking to one of them who she found cute, and he told me he would hook me up with an internship opportunity! He gave me his number. My friend asked to see my phone, and when I got home, his number was completely gone. It is clear that she deleted his number. 

Recently, this cop in town who I would see at my job (I worked at a diner) would stop by for food. He followed me on Instagram, probably saw me through a mutual friend. I told my friend about him and she asked to see his Instagram. I told her that I thought he was super cute but I noticed a ring on his finger, so I did not message him. She finally admitted to me that for months she has been talking to him. She found his Instagram through mine. And was talking to him, knowing that he was married. I found it odd that she would hide this from me knowing that I was kind of interested. 

She also once was super judgmental of me a few years ago when I would go on tinder dates and how I met my ex boyfriend through there. She said it was trashy for people to meet others on apps and now she has already been on two tinder dates this year...

Last example: I told her recently that I’m thinking about going back to school to get my masters in Education. She basically scared me saying education is hard and that last year I was not trying hard enough with finding jobs (knowing that my father passed away last year - my job search obviously had to be on hold). 

I feel like she does not want what is best for me. I’ve felt bad for her for many many years and I feel like she does not support me after all the support I’ve given her. I’m at the point where I want to cut out her, but I find it hard and I don’t know how.",07Sep2020,1
2,"Around 3 months ago, I started questioning my religion. Did I actually believe in god, or is it just a shadow of what my parents believe in? I’ve never really understood who god was or what is purpose was, let alone if he even existed. I started thinking more and more about it, and the less and less sense it made. To me god isn’t a person, he is a figure of life that someone made up to calm the minds of everyone around them, an answer. Christianity wasn’t a religion until 1 AD, There was BC (before Christ) which means people did not know of it. Anyway, I don’t believe that there is a god, and I don’t see anything wrong with that, I’m Atheist that have a family of Christian, a best friend who IDK what she is, and a Catholic boyfriend. My best friend, and my boyfriend don’t mind me being Atheist, but my family does. I came out to my parents in July, and now everytime they get the chance the lecture me about how god is real, shoving it down my throat. Now my mom is telling my family like aunts and uncles, and grandparents. And they keep shoving it down my throat that god is a real person. What should I do?",07Sep2020,1
3,"TLDR; My brother is insecure with his height and keeps terrorizing me about random celeb's height, how do I make it stop before I kick his ass to the moon.

My brother is insecure about his height, which is 5'6, I personally think that's average height but he says no girl wants to date him if he's that height. I don't see why he would want to date someone who would only date him for his height and I've told him this but he ignored me. 

He's mentioning it every day saying ""I wish I was an inch taller"" and I hate watching anything with him because he makes me search up the casting of the whole movie/series and makes me search up their height one by one. It's annoying as hell because at first I was like ""it's ok bud you're still growing"" to ""get out of my room I don't give a fuck about Mark Wahlberg being the same height as you"". That may seem inconsiderate but he barges into my room (without knocking) to tell me about a celebrity's height every single day. (maxium of 3 times a day I would say)

I know we have insecurities but please don't terrorize your little sister who is just trying to do her homework about it because she will genuinely want to sucker punch you. 

How do I make this stop before I actually do sucker punch him? (I won't actually punch him, just jokes)",07Sep2020,1
4,"So to shed some light on this situation, I work in a large lab housing multiple departments with an employee count of around 60. I’ve been with this facility less than a year and I’m the youngest (23F) and newest employee here. 

Before going into more detail, I want to say that I hold this supervisor (50F) in high regard because she does genuinely give a damn about her coworkers and is extremely knowledgeable and always available for questions. 

Historically, she has been known to latch onto certain coworkers before (two to my knowledge). The most recent one (I’ll refer to her as Cindy) has even moved shifts to get away from her. The night that Cindy informed us she was moving to a different shift, Supervisor cried profusely. I’m talking heaves. Some other examples between Cindy and my super involve her, on many occasions, rubbing Cindy’s shoulders, frequently hugging her, scooting her chair up very closely beside her during slow periods at work, and on one occasion kissing her forehead. All the while Cindy is visibly uncomfortable. She’s very possessive of Cindy and requires her to park beside or close to her in the complex so that she can walk her to her car after work. Supervisor is very intrusive in Cindy’s personal life and often buys her children expensive gifts. 

Our encounters are far less intrusive (so far) but she has begun hugging me, being very complimentary on my appearance, calling me by pet names,  and asking me probing questions about my dating/sex life. I’m unsure how to deal with this other than just avoiding being alone with her whenever possible. I’d like to avoid an HR appointment if able but I need to nip this in the bud before it progresses further. 

Any advice much appreciated!",07Sep2020,1
5,A (used to be) close friend of mine always leaves me on delivered for weeks on end. I live in Arkansas and she lives in Missouri so our only way of talking is through text. We used to talk all the time and now for around 6-7 months now I can’t go 5 minutes into conversation without her leaving me on delivered for weeks. She now expects me to wait on her and I’m Honda fed up but don’t know what to do. Should I just block her and forget about it? Should I just ignore her or leave her on opened? Should I just block her and strike up conversation months later? I know this seems more like a rant but I could really use some advice.,07Sep2020,1
6,"Where to begin?

For context, my fiancé and I are LaVeyan Satanists.

My parents were very alternative while I was growing up. They were open minded, had the sickest music taste, not religious in any sense of the word, etc. Until a few years ago.

My dad is mentally ill. He’s suspected to have bipolar disorder with paranoid tendencies, delusions, and fits of rage. I love my dad. Or who he used to be anyway. He wasn’t very strict when I was a kid, but every so often, he’d snap and take it out on us physically or mentally. I was able to forgive him for that. I’m a very forgiving person. 

He’s been through many spiritual phases. Satanism (ironic), Wicca, tripping on shrooms and meeting deities, meditating and crystal healing, but this by far is the worst I’ve ever seen him.

He now considers himself an “extremist christian” (his exact words) and my docile mother, always going along with whatever he says, also considers herself a christian now. He has become homophobic, misogynistic, and his heart is full of hatred. He’s angry all day. All he can talk about is God, Jesus, The Bible, and how much he hates *this* and *that*.

I can’t even have a conversation with my dad anymore without it turning into a sermon. I miss him. He’s not the person who raised me. My mom is still in there somewhere, buried beneath his oppressive influence. He won’t even let her see her parents or brother anymore. It sickens me.

But, let’s get to the point, which is something I came to find out about an hour ago. I’ve been trying to conceive a baby with my fiancé for about thirteen months now. I’ve cried numerous times about my infertility and expressed my concern to my dad. He always tells me “God has a plan for you, it’s just not the right time” 

Only, he’s been praying, cursing me, really, behind my back. He’s been saying that he wishes for my “womb to dry up”

The second I heard that, I knew this was the one thing I could never forgive him for, and he’s done a lot to hurt me. He’s scolded me, cussed me out, kicked me out of the house, called me names, etc. But this was by far the cruelest thing he’s ever done to me in my entire life.

I believe in the power of manifestation, so if there’s even the slightest chance that he’s the one who did this to me, I don’t think I can ever even speak to him again.

I guess my question is, where do I go from here?

TL;DR My dad has been wishing infertility on me for months because he doesn’t like my fiancé and thinks we’re evil.",07Sep2020,1

9,"At the start of last year, I got a new classmate I became friends with. I do not live in the States, but that’s the place he originally lived in for quite a while and where most of his family is located. From what he had told me, he became homeless at the age of 15 but somehow mangled to end up in my country, where he still was financially unstable. He did manage to move in with a friend of his and their family, and seemed to live a pretty decent life for a while. Before Covid-19 broke out he was supposted to visit his sister in the US, that happened at the end of March and he was supposed to come back in April. He hasn’t contacted anyone since March. I spoke to his friend that he’s staying at, and she’s very worried about him but we have no way of contacting him. It was a consensual decision and he’s an adult, so we have no way of reporting it to the police as well. Some months ago I found his sister’s Twitter account and messaged her, I didn’t get an answer. His friend also told me that his parents may or may not be associated with a cult, I don’t know if that’s the case with his sister. Browsing through his Facebook I also found some questionable post from an organization his friends are associated with, that he was tagged in. I don’t know if I’m overthinking or not, I’m lost and don’t know what to do. He was very special to me and I miss him very much. Is there any possible way I can find him or find any information about him? I just want to know if he’s safe",07Sep2020,1

Its a safe job and I like certain aspects of it but I cant see it being the job I do for the rest of my life. It pays well but I'm just only home at nights and only ever have one day off at most.

I dont want to leave this job until I have something that I know I'll enjoy and have passion for but at the same time I feel I dont have the time to figure that out with how much I'm working.

My wife and I have an almost 6 month old daughter so I dont want to make any poor decisions that would leave me jobless as  I need to provide. Part of the problem too is I never get to spend much time with my family or friends and miss out on events as I'm always at work.

17,"I posted this in the “am i the asshole” group but it got deleted so im posting it here

So ive asked him like 2 times before and he quickly shuts it down without letting me explain that i dont wanna post full nudes or talk to people or anything like that because he thinks i have to be nude and talk to people to have an OF.

 So i asked just one last time so i could explain, so he could have a full understanding before he said no. I just thought he was saying no because he thought i would talk to people on there and be fully nude. I didnt think he would get this offended.

Well he freaked the fuck out and is offended that i would want to do that. I said okay thats fine, i respect his answer, i just wanted to explain to him because he had a different understanding of what i wanted to do on there. 

And the reason i wanted to is because i know some girls make so much money and i know i probably would even without doing full nudes. (Idc if you think i would make money not showing my pussy &amp; naked tits this isnt the point of my post) 

He says he feels like i disregarded his feelings about it because i asked multiple times; but its not like i was begging to make an OF, i literally just brought it up that girls make money and i sorta wanted to try it and he shit it down and didnt wanna hear me explain anything, but i felt it was unfair he couldnt at least just let me explain and then say no; like i dont get why it was such an offensive conversation to have i guess...? Like i made it clear to him if he didnt want me to i wouldnt i just wanted to talk w him about it.

Edit: i do respect his answer and i do not want to do OF so bad to where i would break up with him over it, it was just something that i sort of wanted to try but its not something i want to do so bad that id be willing to drop my relationship for it. Also, the reason i did bring it up more than once (3 times) is because the last 2 times he shut me down before i could even explain, (was not even a 2 min conversation) not that i was begging him for me to have one, i just wanted to explain before he made made up his opinion of it because he thought id be posting nudes and messaging people. The reason im asking if im the ass is because he got super angry and his reaction was just way more offended and angry than i expected as he sort of took it personal... if that makes sense and i was just wondering if asking to fully explain my question &amp; intention to him was THAT bad..",07Sep2020,1
18,"In middle school/high school, I had a lot of crushes/""relationships"" (if you can even call them that since it's difficult to have an actually meaningful relationship at that age, but I believe that I placed value on them at the time) along with some relatively traumatic experiences relating to relationships. 

In 6th to 8th grade, I had as many as two to three crushes at a time, and actually maintained a very simple and relatively enjoyable relationship (kissing, holding hands, but not really talking or connecting) with a boy for all of 8th grade and into freshman year of high school. 

I broke up with him uneventfully since we hadn't gone to the same high school and met a new boy in the middle of freshman year. This relationship was my first sexual relationship, (ie blowjobs, hand jobs, fingering) and unfortunately the boy constantly attempted to coerce me into actual penetrative sex, which I refused, and eventually he actually attempted to rape me. He sort of succeeded, or he would have if I hadn't kicked him and yelled at him to get off. He didn't try anything like that again, and broke up with me that summer. 

My feelings on my assault are not very strong; he barely managed to start before I kicked him off, and I don't feel like I have the kind of trauma that many other sexual assault victims suffer from: I'm not more uncomfortable than most people are with portrayals of rape in books/media, I don't ever feel like I've been triggered by anything relating to sexual assault. It absolutely wasn't a good experience, and I empathize very strongly with other survivors, but I don't feel that my experience has affected me  personally very much. 

When sophomore year started, I was still interested in sexual contact/a relationship and ended up dating an older boy for a month, but he dropped me when he found out that I still didn't want to have actual penetrative sex. 

Junior year I slipped into a severe depression which I don't remember much of, but I do remember that I didn't date anyone that year. 

Senior year rolled around and I wasn't actively looking for a relationship but I found one anyway, a boy who was a sophomore and who seemed to actually reciprocate my affection without being super interested in penetrative sex. We were happy, but things got slightly messy because he had some repressed mental health issues and we broke up mutually around January. 

After about a month of recovery, I decided that I needed to focus on academics and not relationships for the time being so that I could prioritize college. Plus, none of the boys at school seemed to interest me anymore. I could still feel aesthetic attraction, recognize that someone was attractive to me either physically or based on personality, but I didn't have any interest in pursuing anything with anyone. I told myself that I was so drained from the misery of high school that I just wasn't feeling much of anything anymore, and that when I got to college it would be different. 

Well, I started college this year, and nothing has changed. I can appreciate looks and personality, I'm flattered by people approaching me with propositions or asking me out on dates, and usually if someone asks and I think they're cool or I like talking to them I'll try to go on at least one date with them and see if I could maybe be attracted romantically/sexually to them. But nope, nada, zilch. I always have to apologize and politely explain that I don't really feel up to dating right now. 

I still have some sexual drive, although it's not as strong as it used to be and it's never really directed towards a specific person, it's just me being randomly horny sometimes. I still fantasize about sexual situations sometimes, but again never with a specific person. Sometimes I think about actors or fictional characters in a sexual way, but those are just passing thoughts. I don't think about romantic situations involving myself anymore, whereas when I was younger I used to daydream all the time about crushes/boyfriends. I don't remember what it's supposed to feel like to have a crush anymore, and the idea of putting energy into a relationship is unappealing. I'm also not really interested in the idea of putting effort into casual or committed sex, since I've never really gotten that much pleasure out of anything sexual done to me by someone else, and it doesn't seem worth the energy especially if it makes me nervous. 

Everything relating to romance or sex feels muffled, uninteresting, far away. I haven't met a single person that I've recognized as someone that I might actually be attracted to. Even though I'm not really actively searching for a relationship or anything right now, it's still weirding me out that I'm not even a little interested in anyone at all. 

**TLDR:** have had many crushes and several relationships and been sexually active in the past quite happily, but no longer feel romantically or sexually attracted to anyone I meet; have tried agreeing to dates, but just haven't felt anything at all and generally find the idea of sex/a relationship unappealing. 

So, the question: have I lost the ability to feel romantic/sexual attraction to other people, or am I just emotionally burned out? Am I traumatized somehow, even if I don't think that I am? Has anyone else had similar experiences?",07Sep2020,1

The comments all came from my mom but the stressed relationship with my dad came with the fact that he NEVER defended me, never stood up to her for me. He would just stand there silently and  shrug at me. 

Other things happened and in less detail basically they include, responding to me being serially assaulted at my job by saying ""You need to get over it. Its normal and will happen at any job."" They also defended the manager after I reported it (the manager's response was ""he's just a boy. He can't help it""). When I was in an abusive relationship looking for help they said ""you got yourself into this. I thought you were smarter""

Recently they turned my depression around and made it about them when I was going through a rough time. They said my boyfriend was going to leave me because it wasn't fair to him that I was like this. And they told me how I was making things hard for them.

25,"Hi, y’all. I’m going to need to keep this vague for safety reasons, so my apologies if this is foggy. 

I’m in my late teens. A few years ago, some new people moved in next to my house. They’ve got four kids. 

We live in a nice area, and they try to keep up this perfect image of the american dream, but it’s more like american horror story. I used to babysit for them. 

For starters, the house is filthy. They have rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs. The dogs sit in crates or the backyard all day, the small animals sit in their shit all day. It literally never gets cleaned. I tried to clean it when they were out of town and left me a key to the house, but the stuff in the crates was beyond cleaning. The baby’s milk bottle is hardly ever cleaned, so there’s coagulated shit in there. There’s animal feces on the floor, mystery slime, etc. Those are the main things I can think of. 

Aside from the general state of the house, it’s the kids that scare me, too. Their eldest child, who is in late elementary school, is horrifying. She killed their first guinea pigs by squeezing them to death and laughing at their screams. She’s tricked her little brother into drinking her piss. She hurts herself, and then tells me her mom did it. She attacks my little sisters and neighbor’s kids. She starts fires. She pees on the floor. 

She scares the shit out of me. 

When I babysat, she was a blend of distress and pure evil. I don’t know whether to pity her or hate her. Her little brothers are constantly tormented by her. The parents fight violence with more violence. Their dad is emotionally checked out, but the mother is just vile. I know she hits the girl at least, but the girl also hits herself and blames it on other people. I watched her do it. I know her mother made her the way she is, but I can’t help but despise her a bit, too. She’s just evil to me. 

I know this seems cut and dry, but there’s weird complications. 

For one, CPS was called before, and nothing happened. Secondly, since we haven’t been in school for a long time, she will know it was a neighbor who reported her. I honestly fear most for the animals and the younger boys. They don’t deserve this shit. You can literally hear the screaming from her house, so I guess it could be a handful of people who could report her, but I’m afraid for the safety of my family and friends. 

Our other neighbor is currently a single father, and has lots of unsavory experiences with this family from hell, and they’d immediately suspect him as the reporter. He’s got it bad right now already because of court proceedings with the abusive ex, etc. I also don’t want the freak show to come after my family.

I don’t know. I’m just confused and scared. Their mom is really manipulative and vindictive, and I don’t know what she’s capable of. 

Is there any way for me to do this without her guessing it was a neighbor? Can their pets be saved at least? What about the young boys? I have no idea what to do or how to do it. It feels wrong to know this is happening and stay silent. Everyone on our street knows, but no one will say anything out of fear.

27,"I got a new dog a few months ago, she's about a year old and she's an all around great dog, but she started digging holes in our yard after seeing another one of our dogs doing it. The dog who set the bad example has since learned not to do it, but my dog wont stop. I don't know what to do. She seems to know she isn't supposed to do it, she acts guilty when we catch her doing it or scold her, but she won't stop. We have four dogs and she plays constantly, so I really don't think it's a matter of having too much energy. What can I do to make her stop?",07Sep2020,1

29,I am 18 and I don't know why but I decided to go to the dentist to get my front teeth straight. My front teeth were a but overlapping nothing else but I wanted them straight Idk why but I've always been insecure about them. I went to the dentist because I wanted to get braces but she told me that she could make them straight just by trimming my one tooth a but and them putting a white filling. My teeth are now straight but my one front tooth's color is a bit different from others and I am so depressed because of this I think that my whole life has been ruined and I would never look pretty because of this one tooth.

30,"So I (18F) when I was 11 I met a guy online who was 35 and he was constantly telling me he loved me and me as the stupid and naive kid I was I fell for it (I had just moved in my new town and I had no one to talk to, he was the only person paying me any attention so I got easily extremely attached)
But as I grew older I understood that the whole thing was bad, so when I was around 12 I told him that I didn't want to talk to him anymore and he started saying that he would k*ll himself and then he wouldn't log in for some days so I got crazy with anxiety thinking that I had killed someone
So this went on for about 2.5 years (during which he threatened my friends and talked me out of talking to other people my age, so I ended up being completely alone) and he finally just blocked me and I had no one to turn to, so I had many panic attacks and depression symptoms (I hurt myself and was really suicidal)
What happened has really impacted my relationships with people for the worse
Now that I think of the whole ordeal I consider myself extremely stupid and naive and it is taking a toll on my mental health, and I m scared to tell anyone cause they'll think the worse of me

What should I do to get past the mental state this had put me in?

31,"Hey all, I know the title seems odd and I’ll try to keep this as short as possible with as much context. Currently I’m an assistant manager with my company and a manager job had come up(same company/same location I work out of) which is eventually where I wanted to end up in my career(or so I think). So I decided to apply for it, I expected my chances of getting the job were very slim so I figured worst thing that happens is it helps sharpen my skills and get my name out there.

Turns out I did get the job and accepted the offer for it. Now I’ve been feeling this deep sense of regret as I know it is going to be a lot more work/stress than what I was currently doing. As well I did enjoy currently my position as it is relatively easy and I know it quite well. I sort of wanted to get the job as it was apart of my larger plan but this just feels so soon and I feel this sense of not really wanting it but obviously can’t turn back now. The pay is a lot better and this means my family as well can live quite comfortably vs just getting by as before. I’m just worried that because I’m taking this job I will end up not being happy(stressed constantly) and as a result with my career in this odd position of no real options as it is quite a large corporation so once your old position is filled you go forward. This means I wouldn’t really have anywhere to go if this didn’t work out. It’s a scary thought to know if you don’t do it well either. It almost feels like a catch 22 with no good options. 

I guess I’m just looking for people who have been in a similar situation and how they maybe adjusted/dealt with it knowing that this probably the best route but struggling with it quite a bit as weird as that seems.",07Sep2020,1

33,"My friend has this ex boyfriend who bothers her till this day. They dated when she was 16 and he was around 19. They lasted for about 1 year and 8 months; they broke up because he would emotionally abuse her &amp; constantly cheat on her. He would send shirtless pictures and flirt with different girls desperate for compliments while they were dating. 

She told me that even his friends encourage him to move on because my friend is completely over him but he’s in denial. He thinks that she is the love of his life and constantly messages her. (She is now 19) She has him blocked on twitter and he openly admitted through text saying that even though he can’t see her tweets, he goes to google and searches her twitter @ up so he can see what she’s been tweeting. 

She’s blocked him on multiple platforms and they won’t communicate for months... then out of no where he just comes back into her life (at least attempts to do so). He also tells her how he’s tried to get over her by having sex with different girls and being in relationships with them.

34,"TLDR; my job and I aren't really seeing eye to eye on anything anymore and it feels like they want to get rid of me.

I've been employed at this job for a while, I cant disclose it or anything but it's a part of aviation. I've been working here since the beginning of February and I've never had any issues before except some minor hiccups that were fixed after evaluation. But this feels a whole lot different..

Lately, they've been firing and letting people go over small things. First and foremost we have a safety policy that consistently changes over and over on a daily basis. One thing will be okay one day, the next morning it could be totally different. They keep trying to say it's all in the name of safety but I understand the safety policy, and what we're having to do is overkill. I think theres a description of ""too safe"" at one point.

But the real cusp of the matter is I've been trying to get a promotion because I have a new place to live and itd be nice if I got paid extra and i applied for a position that i thought would suit my needs, however it's been a week since I've heard anything and it makes me really disheartened. On top of that I've been training to take on a whole other position that pays a little bit more, but lately I've been working and doing that position without any extra incentive. So it feels like I'm dealing with extra responsibility with no reward. Usually this doesnt bother me, but when I somehow have mistakes almost every day, its somehow a big deal.. even though I'm not in this spot at all, but rather getting trained for it.

Even though I'm being trained for it, I'm still being told my mess ups are still counting as live warrants for write ups, even though I'm doing my best and have never really done most of what they ask me to do. It's starting to really wear me down, and I'm afraid at some point I'm just going to throw my company provided equipment at them and leave.

One of the good things that's come is that I've been looking into other jobs and found one that pays more and seems more up my alley. I'm more heavily leaning towards that job, and hoping that I get it, so that's one good thing to come from all this but yeah, I'm losing morale fast to the point I dont even want to be here any more.

36,"Want to take up a new hobby while studying (and for later too) and among the sports associations at the uni, boxing and rugby seem the most interesting to me. So far I see it this way:

Boxing

 • Pros: would learn self-defence; would increase self-confidence due to knowing I can defend myself; would transfer well into jiu jitsu later on which I could do even when Im older since that is not a striking combat sport

 • Cons: possible brain damage(?); no comradery; builds body less than rugby

Rugby:

 • Pros: Teamsport with great comradery; builds strength and physique

 • Cons: I assume injuries are very common; Probably not something I could do in the long-term; I feel like 23 is probably too old to start rugby; Not sure how I could fit rugby into my time when I start working

38,"This has happened a couple hours ago. Now my girlfriend (or exgirlfriend, I am still getting used to it) is sleeping and I am thinking about it over and over again. *TLDR at the end.* 

Things haven't been great with my girlfriend lately, and she's been at her hometown with her parents for the last couple of months. In this time, we've discussed if it was a good idea to give it a try again and for her to come back to our apartment. Finally she said she wanted to come and move again to our place, and I was so happy about it. She's been here for a week now. 

Today, after I came back from a day trip with my friends, she's sat with me in the couch and has told me that she wants to break up. That I don't give her enough attention, that friends are always first and other, more specific things about the relationship that she doesn't stand. I was shocked about this change, because I thought we were good, and I've started to feel angry and frustrated because of the way she was approaching the situation, more straightfordward than with care, and she was so fed up she also mocked some of my flaws at some points.

I am not trying to justify myself. She has plenty of reasons to be fed up, but I wasn't expecting a breakup after a week of being together again. I don't even remember what she's said that has filled me with anger and frustration, but the thing is that I've gone to the kitchen and punched the fridge several times, denting it nice and good.

I've never been a violent person, never punched anything since I was a kid, too stupid to understand how people behave. Now I feel incredibly ashamed of my actions and of losing my temper this much. Can I make sure I don't behave like this ever again? Do I have to seek help, or just aproach difficult situations another way? I know the answers to this may seem obvious, but I am too confused right now it's hard to think clearly. Thanks in advance for any reply.

41,"my sophomore year of high school was very rough for me, (i'm a senior now) and i only had a few legit friends who were actually friends w me because they wanted to hang out with me. one of these people was ""john"" (named changed ofc) and we grew to be really close throughout sophomore year. he really was a true friend and helped me a lot w my mental health. we dated for about 3 months (lmao) which i think is where it went wrong... after the relationship when he broke up w me he told me he wanted to be friends and i was like ""okay cool"" and got over it with the idea in mind that we'd be able to be friends (at this point i genuinely didn't have feelings for him anymore, i really did want to just be friends). flash forward to about 3 weeks after the breakup, i went to church w/ him (thats a long story, i'm not particularly religious but i went to bible camp w/ him and his church so i could see him because he was grounded, yes i know i went for the wrong reasons, i'm still glad i went tho) and when i went to church, i said hi to him and his family and he completely ignored me altogether. flash forward again to about 5 months later, i had previously texted him once and he never responded, when he texted me out of the blue asking to hang out (as friends ofc). i was obviously shocked, but i said yes and we hung out about a month later (i don't know why so long)   
that night, he texted saying he had a great time and that he would be down to hang again. i was going to reply to him but i'm awful at responding, and he ended up texting me again before i responded asking me for a favor. that made me angry because he had ignored me for 5 months and was now asking for a favor, albeit a small one.   
so my question is, was i petty for cutting contact or was it the best decision in the long run? and should i try for contact with this person again (admittedly i do miss being his friend, he was fun to hang out with and could be serious when necessary, etc) or should i keep contact cut? if i do keep contact cut, how do i not think about it as much?",07Sep2020,1

I know she’s the one for me, and even though I didn’t really know when I’d do it, I knew it was the right decision (since we’ve both had extensive conversations about what we want). She’s coming home from college for a few days in a few weeks. Should I propose then? Or should I wait? I just want some compelling insight into what some stranger with more life experience than I do think. Thanks!",07Sep2020,1
63,"Here’s the deal, I’m a lawyer and this guy’s been my client for 1 year. He is from a family of multi-millionaires and I do make money with him. Problem is he is a drug addict and is MASSIVELY unreliable. This guy will make appointments and never show, will say he will pay the next day and disappear, shit like that. This happens all the time.

This gets me so pissed off I feel like kicking his fucking ass, it destroys my days when it happens- I admittedly have a temper-. Anyways I’m thinking, what should I do? Sometimes he does pay handsomely, and it would be a shame to cut him off. At the same time, this guy makes me want to punch holes through walls. I talked to him about it to no avail.

What now? Is getting payed worth it being disrespected and getting very, very pissed?",07Sep2020,1
64,"How can I step out of my comfort zone? If I can’t without failing a number of times, how do I try again without retreating?

I have ADHD. Some have said that as long as I’m taking my medicine, getting extra time on tests, etc., it’s no excuse for anything, but I don’t know what to think about that anymore, so I decided I’d include that detail. I’m a Sophomore in high school. I don’t know that there’s anything too wrong with me, but on the contrary, here are a few things I just happen to know: I’m not in any sports or e.c.’s, I don’t have any close friends, nor do I hang out with any of my acquaintances outside of school. I’ve been referred to as “quiet”, “too sensitive”, and whatever people may call me behind my back. My problem isn’t the fact that I’m at where I’m at, the problem is that I don’t know how to get anywhere better, and I’m looking for a way to be more productive and social, and I’ve tried just about everything. I played baseball until second grade; I liked being with my friends, but I didn’t enjoy playing the game itself, so I gave up. In fifth grade, I played band but quit for the same reason. By seventh grade, the closest I got to being active was cycling around my town. When I started my Freshman year of high school, I decided I was going to turn myself around. I tried squad hopping, joining the speech club, and even asking a girl out to Homecoming(as friends), but none of them worked out because they were too big of steps for me to even tiptoe the way through. Here’s how I see it: I’m a decent and pretty smart person, but I don’t have the right social health to get me anywhere in life. I want to be a creative writer, but until college rolls around, getting better at it means wasting my hours writing admittedly confidential short suspense/horror stories on my pc. Right now, I’m not going anywhere in life, and it seems every time I try to take a step forward, everything that doesn’t have to do with the step itself trips me and I end up crawling back to my comfort zone. I’d say all I need is time, but time only flies when I want it, not when I need it. I have every reason to believe I’ll never be anything, but like Freshmen year, I’m going to keep going. This time, though, I’m admitting that I can’t do it alone. I’d say everyone can be strong on their own, but I’m tired, guys. I want to have a life and a legacy of my own, so I’ll accept any criticism, any lecture, because I’m not depressed, but I’m scared to go any longer on my own, so please listen when I say: I need help.",07Sep2020,1

I really need opinions on this!! My ex husband has a new girlfriend and they have been dating about 2 months now.

They’ve only been dating a couple months and was recently introduced to my daughter who is only 3. She has sent me pictures of my daughter showing how much fun she is having which is great, I’m happy my daughter is having fun. I just think it’s odd she’s sending me the pictures and not my ex.. she has also sent me texts telling me to give my daughter a hug and kiss goodnight for her..

77,"To keep a long story short,

My and my roommate moved into a 3 story apartment building several months ago, maybe back in May. There's 3 apartment buildings, 1 on each floor.

For the first couple of months things were great (no upstairs neighbor) and then in about June, the upstairs lady moved in. Even after that, things were pretty fine, never had any complaints. Then suddenly about 2 months ago (maybe middle of July) there's been a consistent pounding sound coming from upstairs. I don't just mean ""footsteps"" I'm talking about a sound that sounds like a 300LB gorilla having a violent seizure and running into the walls, and tripping all over the furniture and falling onto the ground violently. THAT'S what this sounds like, not simple ""annoying footsteps""

The weekend in July that these noises started, I saw a new man coming in and out of the building so I assumed ""Huh no biggie, the sound is probably just him moving in with his girl upstairs or something"" so I tolerated it for a few days.

We're now at a point that this ""noise"" has been consistent, every single minute of every single hour throughout the entirety of the day up until about 2AM when it stops (assuming that's when the dude goes to bed) and I can't take it anymore. The noise is so violent that it literally makes our walls shake and my computer chair vibrates at all times of the day. I work night shifts so I don't go to bed until about 4AM, but of course I get to wake up at 8:30AM when the violent pounding/destruction sounds start right back up and continue consistently for the next 15-16 hours. I can deal with ""some"" noise but this is so bad that I'm just waiting for the day that our ceiling caves in and they come falling right down with it.

To make matters worse, they also don't take out their own trash either. We were nice enough to take it out for the girl upstairs the first week she moved in (because she probably didnt know when trash night was) and to this day, they've only taken their trash out to the curb ONE TIME. In two months, they've taken it to the curb ONCE. There are two dumpsters outside, one for us, and one for the 3rd floor. Guess what BOTH dumpsters are always full of? Their trash. Instead of taking their trash out, they've also stolen the 1st floor's dumpster too since it keeps building up (nobody lives on the first floor)

Finally, they left their furniture in the hallway since they moved in and still have yet to move it. An entire couch and a bed just greeting me at the door every single night I come home because they're too lazy to do anything else with it. The hallways are also banged up and destroyed after their furniture was moved in, too. When WE moved in, the hallway was fine, after \*they\* moved in, there's now straight up gaping holes in the drywall, cracks and a ton of other damage too, with the hallway carpet sprinkled with drywall dust (that they still haven't cleaned from when they caused it) and the LAST thing that we want is for our security deposit to be revoked because the landlords will think WE did it.

Just as well, about a week ago the upstairs man literally KNOCKED on our window on the fire escape when it was only my roommate that was home. When my roommate checked, the man wasn't there anymore (wtf?) so I don't know if there's some other shady shit going on with this guy too or what, but I can't imagine what reason he would have to knock on our window. It was about 11PM when it happened too. Still confuses me.

I know what your answer will be, ""just go talk to them about it"" and yes this is always my first instinct, however, I've seen the upstairs man coming in and out and this man looks like a straight up felon who won't take criticism lightly. The last thing I want is to ""talk"" to him just for him to get pissy and start making our lives a living hell on purpose. My next step is to go to the landlord about it, but I REALLY don't want to cause any unncecessary drama. If the landlords talk to them, then obviously they're going to know we said something.

What would you do in this situation? When both ""talking to them"" and going to the landlord is just going to cause unnecessary drama.",07Sep2020,1

79,"TL;DR: Met a guy online, got catfished and entered a really abusive and controlling relationship. When I cut ties with this guy they started stalking me online. He has cyber-stalked and harassed me on and off for the past 4 years and he won’t go away.

I’m sorry this is really long.
For context: I met this guy on tumblr years ago when I was 19, going through a deep depression and had very low self esteem. I was also really sheltered up to that point and I was experimenting with my sexuality online.

It started off really normal. We just talked a bunch but we eventually entered an online relationship that I didn’t actually take seriously- but I kept it alive because I didn’t want to be alone. I should have seen the red flags, but again I was a very dumb and naive 19 year old. This guy never wanted to show his face on video call or send me photos other than the one he introduced himself with- but insisted I send him photos of myself and appear on video calls for him. This bothered me but I sent him photos and videos anyway.

Things escalated and he got very controlling. I didn’t want to talk to him anymore. He would make up excuses and lie about how he was sick or going through a hard time in order for me to pity him. He took advantage of my sympathy. He would constantly threaten to kill himself or say he would post my nude photos online if I stopped talking to him.

Eventually I mustered up the courage to just not care and cut ties with him thinking that he wouldn’t actually act on what he said. And he didn’t. He would bother me every now and then the first month I stopped talking to him but it eventually stopped. This was around the time I met my current boyfriend, so I put that mess behind me. Or so I thought. It’s been 3 or 4 years since I cut ties with my stalker and last year he found my social media. I’m an artist with an okay size following (not huge by any means but I have my own little community of people who I share my art with). I use social media to find work. It doubles as a personal account because I let my followers know what’s going on in my life but there isn’t any sensitive information on there like my real name, address or phone number so my stalker has no idea how to find my private/personal socials. We also don’t live in the same country so if I post details to events and conventions that I make appearances at, the chances of him trying to use that to find me are low.

Last year he started tweeting at me and sending me private messages threatening to post my photos if I didn’t start talking to him again. I would block every account that he messaged me from. I eventually had to put my social media on private for a period of time- which made it difficult for me to promote my work. I got fed up at one point and messaged him back to leave me alone because I was happy and I have a boyfriend and I don’t want him to bother me anymore. It didn’t work. He just started saying disgusting things- asking me to send him my panties, begging me to let him give me money. My boyfriend suggested I try to find his IP address while I was in contact with this person but that was totally useless because he was using a VPN and I don’t think knowing his actual IP address would help. I started ignoring him and blocking his fake accounts. There were so many, it was exhausting. 

I suffer from a lot of anxiety and when I see my stalker pop up anywhere near my social media or private massages and emails I get anxiety attacks.

Eventually he stopped but after a couple months he came back. I just want it to stop. He constantly goes quiet and then when I’m happy and thriving he comes back to harass me and goes out of his way to make me uncomfortable. I can’t have him bothering me on platforms that I use for work and engage with other artists and my followers on. Making a new account isn’t an option because there’s no way I can redirect all my followers to a new one and I worked so hard to make my handles recognizable as a part of my brand. I don’t know what to do. Should I just keep ignoring and blocking this person as much as I can? It’s really taking a toll on my mental health.",07Sep2020,1
80,"Quick backstory and excuse the mobile. 

I (22F) started dating my wonderful boyfriend(28M) 3 years ago. He is in the Army, hence move around a lot. I moved in with him in January of 2019, against both my parents wishes. During the time, I saved up money being a hairdresser so I could go back to school and fully pay it off. Great.

My SO got stationed in Korea. Not so great. I called my parents, told them my situation. They said ""you're always welcome home"". I finally saved up enough cash, and am going back to school remotely starting Tuesday. Save some extra money, do good in school, live with SO when he gets back. Great. 

I agreed months ago to pay my parents rent. I dont nesscarily agree with it, but their house, their rules. 

Today an argument spews out randomly about how I'm not currently working, even though we had an agreement I should focus on school at least for the first semester, since I haven't been in a classroom in over 4 years. I agree again to pay rent.

This circles into how my life revolves around my relationship with said SO. How it sucks to be a military wife, how I will never have stability. They start bringing up how they don't like how we met(video games, weird, i know.  But our familes are only about 2.5 hours apart). 

Basically, this turned into them saying I didn't search around enough ( i was 19when we started dating) , even though he is my literal rock. They love him as well, just not the fact he's an officer in the military. Then turned into how I need to get a job while doing 18 credits in school. Even though I have never asked them for money since  I was 16. I am 100% fincially independent from them, including own laundry detergent, food, etc. 

Basically, I'm at a crossroads. I am sick of hearing my parent's bash my SO. Saying I'm doing nothing in life, even though I worked my tail off to get back to school. My dad doesn't believe I worked at all over the last 2 years I lived away, thinking i basically leached off my BF.  I'm not sure how to handle this 2 year old argument anymore, it's getting extremely tiring. I have debated moving back out, but I was super eager to save a little while in school. 

I know it's a lot. Too much even. But I'm just sick of hearing them bash my relationship even though we are doing wonderful things. If anyone has any, any advice at all, it'd be greatly appreciated. 

Sorry for any spelling errors.  I am a sad buzzed person right now.",07Sep2020,1
81,"For starters I live in rural Virginia. When I say rural, I mean RURAL. The nearest McDonald’s is a 2 hour walk, there’s no mall, there’s no movie theatre, there’s not even a local Walmart.  Nothing delivers, there’s not any form of transportation like Ubers, buses, trams etc.  

I’ve never learned how to drive, my family did not want to teach me.  Currently I am not allowed to wash my own clothes, use the stove.  Honestly the controlling aspect overall is pretty intense.  My family tries to force me to cut my hair a certain way, wear certain clothing to their liking, control my diet etc. you get the point. 

I’ve lost all my friends, I haven’t had a friend since middle school.  I was forced to be homeschooled once I entered high school, and we all know what that does to your social life.  My family is pretty awful, often chipping away at my self esteem, gaslighting me, manipulating me, they do a really good job at convincing me I’m a terrible person despite me staying in my room 24/7 to avoid them.  

I know I’m not a baby anymore, I’m 21.  But I really don’t know what I’m supposed to do.  I have zero resources, or any form of escape.  Tbh I do think of killing myself, but the desire for change is bigger than that.  And it’s why I won’t do that.  

I’ve developed a really bad anxiety disorder over the years. The few times a year I do go out, I can’t even look people in the eye.  I’m socially awkward, and it’s embarrassing as hell.  I go out maybe 2-3 times a year, and that’s for a doctors appointment provided a family member will drive me.  

There’s obviously a lot more to my story, detail wise.  And sharing it would only be too much for one person to process.  I just need some advice guys.

82,"Preface: So I'm [M21] definitely the type of person who can ""fall"" for just about anyone I meet. Usually it's not more than slight infatuation or thinking someone is attractive, but I tend to crush pretty easily.

Anyway, toward the end of the Summer I caught feelings for a girl [F21] at my university who is in my friend group. For a while she was just a mutual friend, and last year one of my best friends [M21] crushed on her hard. They became really good friends and almost started dating, but she took time to think about it and decided against it. He did not take it well, and although they're still pretty good friends today, I don't think he ever fully got over her.

Once quarantine started, a few of my friends and some mutual friends and I started a big group chat, and over the Summer they kind of became my core friend group, including this girl. I got to know her a little bit while we were at school, but once we were all chatting all the time I really got to know her well. As the Summer progressed, my thoughts on her transitioned from ""Wow this person is really cool to talk to and be around"" to ""I think I might actually be into this person"". Like I mentioned, I crush on a lot of people, but for whatever reason this felt more legitimate to me.

Now we're back at school and my thoughts haven't changed. I think I've started to crush a little more, but I don't know if I should even bother trying to start a relationship. For one, I'm not exactly sure just how close we are. We talk all the time in the big group chat, and at one point in the Summer I would text her sometimes, but it's not like I'm constantly talking to her, and she isn't going out of her way to message me either. Despite this I still think we know each other pretty well and get along well. She also has been seemingly looking for a relationship lately, so it seems like it would be a good time to try and see if she's interested in a relationship. Along with this, I'm afraid of making a move, getting rejected, and making things extremely weird within our friend group. There's another friend in the group I asked out a couple years ago, so it's all in the past, but I'm just scared I would ruin things.

My other qualm is how my friend plays into it. I have no idea how he would feel if I did start dating this person, and how it would affect our friendship. On one hand, I know I would probably feel a little uncomfortable in the tables were turned, but on the other hand he made his move and it didn't work out. I'm just very conflicted on the whole situation

TL;DR: Over the Summer I got closer with a mutual friend and caught feelings, but I'm nervous of how asking her out would affect my friend group as well as one of my closer friends who almost dated this person.",07Sep2020,1

Hi! I bought a 2010 Sentra less than a week ago from a private sale because my last car was totaled. My fiancé and I took it on a road trip about 230 miles to bowling green Kentucky yesterday and then to Nashville and back home to St. Louis area. On our way home today, we were cruising at about 75 mph when suddenly it started to slow down and not maintain speed very well. We pulled off to a gas station thinking we might be too low on gas even though we were at a little over 1/4 tank. It started going just fine after that. About 30 miles from home it started to do it again, this time with me driving, going the same speed. I had to push the gas all the way down to maintain 70 mph but even then it would still drop. When we got off at our exit, we noticed a slight burning smell. And it accelerated better at the lower speeds in town but still wasn’t what it had been. Does anyone know what it could be?

87,"My district has appointed a teacher to help with tech support and coordination out of absolute necessity (Our standing IT dept had two members that I know of and were understandably overworked with the whole online platform that’s opened up this year.) Since I’ve worked the past year as a group instructor in a designated class period daily, they’ve charged me with taking over this teacher’s classes. Shouldn’t be a big deal, it’s mostly study halls and one academic class that he’ll still provide lessons for, I will just deliver by proxy. 

Regardless, I had no intentions of working in education until last year when this group needed leadership and I didn’t want the opportunity to missed out by the students. With it being my first year and no prior training, my class was lenient. This was beneficial in two ways, building a trustworthy relationship between me and my students and allowing me to learn through doing. This group is comprised of great students; they can’t take part if they don’t maintain a certain GPA and must have minimal disciplinary occurrences, so it’s always worked out. 

I’m worried that being open to a larger amount of students will be absolute disarray and I have no opportunity to shadow this teacher in this environment as his promotion is effective immediately.

89,"I've _really_ wanted to move for several years now, and stay for ~2 years. (From the US, as a US citizen)

Reached out to an acquaintance who currently lives there, and after some interviews I now have a job offer with the promise of visa sponsorship, yay!

However, the total compensation (while still quite livable) is ~40% compared to my current, give or take (a lot of my compensation is in stock, so it varies).

Normally, I'd say fuck the money and and I'll make it again when I come back, however this company apparently still works in-office, and my options to get to work are: Take the crowded U-Bahn during a pandemic, or: Bike to work every day, possibly through cold winter rain. And even once in-office, it seems they deem masks as optional.

On the other hand of the equation: my anxiety over unrest in the US w/ the upcoming election. I think no matter the outcome, some amount of protesting is guaranteed. But I'm worried about larger, mass unrest or sweeping changes of emerging totalitarianism. I don't want to wind up in a situation where it's more difficult for me to get over there in 1 or 2 years than it is now, either by new competition or some other reason.

And in a few years I'd bet that much older, and making new friends is definitely easier as a younger person, so maybe it's better to go now?

But speaking of making new friends, there's a pandemic on and most social situations are either shut down or severely limited, so that's going to be difficult anyways. And if I'm moving somewhere else to sit inside all day, that's definitely less enticing.

And lastly, as I've been working up to this several years: if I put it off now, I'm worried (even if the opportunity exists and the pandemic is over) that it would become that much easier to make up new reasons to push it off.

So much of this comes down to ""what-ifs"" and possibilities. How do I weigh the options appropriately? Am I missing anything?",07Sep2020,1
90,"I live in a townhouse. New neighbors moved in and now roach nymphs are coming up from the baseboards along the wall we share. I moved in about six years ago when the townhomes were built and I've never encountered any bugs until now. 

I spotted the first nymph around August 21 and now over 26 have showed up dead and alive. I am losing my mind. I have sprayed everywhere including the attic. No signs of infestation from what I see so they must be next door or in the wall. 

Should I talk to the new neighbors about this roach issue? I am unsure how to approach this but I don’t want to offend them. I would like them to spray as well to eliminate this issue before it becomes worse.",07Sep2020,1
91,"So I have four sisters. 

One is 10 years old. 

She tends to annoy me a lot. Today she was meant to sleep early because she has school, but instead she took an hour and more to just come upstairs and go bed.


I had to do her hair, for school tomorrow. I had to do this at night.

So I told her she should be in bed by 6 but she didn’t which I understand. Because she had a bath, but after she had bath, she went downstairs and ate food.

I don’t care that she was watching the tv while eating.

I care that she finished her food, and decided to stay downstairs longer. She came upstairs at 7:21.

So I asked her why she didn’t come upstairs.

It was a simple question, but it took for an hour to give me an answer.

Every time I ask her why, she takes two to one hours long just to tell me an answer she can easily say within seconds.

I gave her multiple chances. 

I kept putting on timers, like 5 minutes to get her to say it.

Then after that didn’t work, I threatened to hit her, I gave her more chances, she still didn’t answer. 


So I grabbed my iPhone charge unplugged it and hit her with it.


Even after I did that, she didn’t have an answer.

I gave her more chances and did timers, still nothing.

So I hit her again. 

I gave her more chances even more. But still nothing.

I even explained the question to her so simple that she can understand it.

I gave her chances, and even delayed the timers because I didn’t want to hit her.

So then I hit her again, twice, she cried so bad.

My heart broke.

So I gave her more chances, I stopped hitting her after that two hits. 

She said she needed to piss I told her she can’t go until she answers the question.

She still didn’t answer. She finally answered at 9:21.i let her go toilet.

The thing is that she knows the answer but never says it.

I told her to stop doing it, that it wouldn’t take longer if she just answered.


I don’t hit her everyday, in my life time, I hit her three times now. 

The first two were one hits or three hits. 

Yes I threatened to hit her, but after she gives me the answers she knows I don’t hit her.

But I only hit her when she gets the piss, she took so long, she sits there, talks to other people, look around. 

Basically doing anything but thinking about an answer.

I didn’t want to hit her. I feel so bad, to the point that I hate my self. And wishing I didn’t exist. 

I feel like a bad sister. 

Today I gave her so many chances,because i didn’t want to hit her. 

I swear on my life I didn’t want to do it. 

When the first time she starting doing this, I thought oh she’s annoying me or messi with me.

But the more she did it, the more I did. This is her way of answering questions.

She says why do I always ask her questions. And that I don’t do it to my small brother and my 14 years of sister.

These days I have been trying to let it go, and not question her as much. 

The thing about my sister is that she is confident, loud and spoken. And that’s why I thought all these times she was doing it to annoy me.

I don’t hit her every time I question her or ask her why she did something. 


I don’t want her to grow up and hate me. I don’t want hitting her to cause trauma for her.

I was hit by my parents when I was younger, to the point when I was bit older me and my dad got into physical fight to the point he had his hands on my neck.

So I know how he feels. But I’m not her mom or dad.

I’m her sister. 

I see siblings hitting each other all the time.

Being from Africa, I grew up around violence. I’m not using that as an excuse.

I know I’m a bad person, say what you want.

I just want to know how I can tell her I’m deeply sorry, or find out when I hit her what she feelings. 

I want help her avoid from growing up to hate herself or thinking she isn’t good enough or anything.",07Sep2020,1

99,"I turn 23 this September. I’m a girl, heavyset, not very attractive but not hideous either, and I’m a hard worker. I’m very friendly. People at work enjoy working with me, I’ve had plenty of casual friendships all my life &amp; I know I’m a good person, but. I don’t have a best friend I talk to every day. I don’t have a partner. I don’t have people I can turn to if something bad happens. 

All I have is my mom and my dad. I’m not stupid enough to think they’ll live forever. I’m sorry if this derails, I’m crying as I type, I don’t know why I’m so emotional writing this. I’m deeply afraid of what happens when I’m finally all alone, I’ve never been alone once in my whole life, I always had my parents around in one way or another. Most of my extended family is dead and I have one aunt &amp; uncle &amp; two cousins. That’s it. They live in a neighboring state but, their family is wealthier than ours and I think genetically, my entire bloodline has never been socially inclined — we have never been a close family. My mother was the blacksheep, her parents died before I was ever born, and her and her sister have always had vague animosity between them. 

One time, I was going to be homeless. I called my aunt crying and begging to stay in her basement, offering her all the money I had, nearly five grand. She told me no ( &amp; mentioned my mother being a bad parent?? ) and then hung up on me. I haven’t spoken to her since, and the situation solved itself and I did not experience homelessness. My cousins are in their late teens and don’t talk to me. 

I have a sister from my father’s first marriage. She doesn’t like me very much. We never bonded or connected, and it shows, because we know nothing about each other and speak once a year. 

One day, they’ll die, my mother and father. I don’t know what to do. I’m crying and I’m so scared to be alone because I’ve never had anyone but them. Where do I go when they’re gone? Who will talk to me and love me? I’ll be alone completey and that thought scares me so much I ... I don’t know. I don’t know. 

I’m an adult. How do I function without them? I need to know these things. I need to know coping skills or adult skills or something, so, when they’re gone and I’m alone, I won’t feel so ... empty? Unloved? I don’t know what to do. I’d like advice of any kind, please. I admit some of my fear stems from the fact I’m not entirely independant yet, and I live at home and I only have my permit and not a license — I’m getting my license soon though, and I’m not childish or foolish by any stretch, just a little hesitant to leave the nest I guess. I worry that if the worse happens, I won’t be prepared. For anything. Or worse, I’ll be alive and alone with no help and no love and that’ll be my existence until I die. 

Sorry if this sounds poorly written. I’m very afraid and upset as I write this.",07Sep2020,1
100,"Throwaway account because you already know.

&amp;#x200B;

Well today was the day, we had another fight and i just told them to get out and leave out of anger and we exchanged words and they left. I guess im typing this just to vent. But I do need advice there is so much fucked up and I just dont want to give up. Ive given multiple years to this relationship and my heart feels as if its locked. So I guess lets start here.

We both are adults and we work together have been and usually we work well together. At home is where the problem is and always have been. We always have fights over the stupidest stuff and it escalates. To the point where I honestly dont remember what started the fight. Im at the point where I dont know if its me or if its her that is the problem, It could be me but I see all the things she does to start the fight (in my opinion) and I guess I dont see mine because personal bias or something. After fights we sit down and talk about it and we work it out and it feels happy. but it just repeats weather it be a week or months, I just want it to be over and I want to be happy with the person that I first met. She says its me, and I can see some of it because it makes sense.

 First off lets start here. I play online games alot and I do get toxic with my friends its just how the guys are. we all joke and mess around. I feel as if that is seeping into my actual life some and im just not noticing it because it seems normal to me. We work alot, and I do have alot of stress at work (Im the main and only supervisor) and our sex life is basically non existent, and that does bother me alot. I dont know how to say it without sounding like a dick, but I feel as if I need sex or something for release and I want it with the person I love. 

As for her, she always mocks me and it infuriates me. She is very sensitive and I respect and understand that but if she can be so sensitive then why does she say some of the things she say during fights because that really does leave a mark. and Im guilty for that aswell. She doesnt respect my stuff at all, when In fights she has broken some of my things. The main big thing is. It gets physical. we made a bad habit of it when we always play fought and it turned serious when we got into an argument. Im not talking about fist fighting or anything but Like pinches and pressure points. 

Its just a big mess. And Im just looking for advice on how to fix myself or how I should go about talking to her and asking her to change. Like I said we have talked and discussed how we would change multiple times.",07Sep2020,1
101,"So it's been for a while now, but recently its been brought up more in conversation. I (17M) just kinda of don't ever want to spend time with family unless I really really have to. My younger brothers beg me to play videogames with them when I don't want to, till one of them cries to where I will give in. I only really do spend time when we are eating dinner and spend the rest of my time doing homework, studying, or on my computer. 

Quarantine started Marchish this year and was near the time where I was very loaded with work and ap exams. It was just during my junior year where I felt very stressed with work and extracurriculars and wanted to exclusively spend the time I had free just to myself and on things I enjoyed. Now. it is the same, I have college applications that I have little to no idea where to start on. The same amount of ap classes, but in a completely different online environment that I am struggling to learn in. I feel like my problems are so big, but realize there is so much worse and feel so conflicted with how others have real problems. God, I already feel so small and insignificant each day. This post is such a mess. I am sorry.

 I just feel like being alone is much more comfortable and I am not so stressed in here. While when I am outside, my sister (19F) seems to always be slightly upset at me for some reason, even though we have been able to talk about topics such as mental illness and the things we have gone through. It just so often feels so passively aggressive with her when I am downstairs and I hate it.

Tonight, it was brought up to my younger brother that if he ate dinner without taking a long time, he would be allowed to play videogames and watch a family movie afterwards. He said only if I went. This ""only if (me, 17M) does"" is said a lot. When there are plans to go to out or to the beach or what not. But I just always prefer to stay in. I don't want to go out with corona and I understand they just want me to spend time with them, but I really don't want to.

I just don't know what to do at this point. I feel like I will just end up having a poor relationship with every single one of my family members at this point and would prefer not to. 

I am sorry if this is repetitive a lot and was all over the place. Please just let me know what I should do or consider or if you guys have any questions or anything at all really. Thank you",07Sep2020,1

104,"Ok. Well something about me; I’m 19, mexican-american, I’m a pretty well known guy in town, and I live in south Texas. My fathers a nice guy, though for whatever reason he really really likes trump. I personally could care less about politics, I don’t judge people political ideals .. though we know most people do judge...  HARD 

Ok well the point is... I live two minutes away from the border.. In a town that’s 98% Mexican, and my father thought it was a good idea to place not just one, but two “Trump 2020” sign outside our house. 

My house gets a lot of traffic, my friends know where I live. My closest friends wouldn’t stop being my friends, though I know mutuals would judge me hard. I don’t even like or dislike trump, i just can’t stand his attitude. I hate politics, I’m registered to vote though Ive already told my dad I’m not going to vote this election. 

The point is I really don’t want a bad name, wether you like him or not, it’s not in good light to advertise this when your entire neighborhood essentially hates trump. I don’t want my house appearing on Tiktok, I don’t want to get vandalized, I don’t want to get outed; I’m just afraid of my image. 

Just this weekend this girl I graduated with got outed on Facebook for being a trump supporter, she got fucking flamed online. Wether you agree with his policy’s or not.. I’m sure you can agree having this sign in a 98% Mexican immigrant pop. is literally just asking for trouble. Screaming for trouble. And to be fair Some people do like him, I know a few, though the majority don’t and WILL react.

I was thinking of throwing the signs away myself, though I thought if I should just hire my own friend to steal them for me (with pay of course). I know this sounds selfish, but once again, my father is literally just asking for trouble. Trouble for not just our house, but for his children (my brother and I). 
He’s already said he wouldn’t be surprised if they were stolen, so I thought If I did, then I should wait a few days to execute this. 

It’s giving both my brother and I a “bad name” (since everybody hates him here) I’m trying not to be political, just being truthful. We all know how cancel culture is, and I don’t want “bad light” to be shed on me for something that’s literally out of my control. 

My literal biggest fckn fear is that I’ll be at a function and I get outed, how do I even defend myself from that? All of the people around me are Mexican, everybody including myself speak fluent Spanish. We’re two minutes away from Mexico... There’s literally no coming back for ME from that.

121,"Hi, this will be long, as it is necessary for me to go into a bit of backstory. I'll keep it as brief as possible.

So I am an 18 year old female getting my bachelors degree, I'm a freshman but I am a full time student and I will be for the next four years. My plan was to stay at home and work as hard as possible in school while I work on weekends and evening shifts.  I live at home with my father, stepmom, and two little step sisters. my bio sibling visits on weekends and has to share a room with me.  a teeny tiny room... HOWEVER. we are moving to a bigger house in the next year, so there's a high possibility that that wont be an issue anymore.

I have lived here for 3 years, and everything is wonderful for the most part. we go on family outings, we spend time together, we are a real family. something I wasn't used to for a very long time because I lived in a very unpleasant household.  so keep in mind, i love my family, i love this home, that isn't the issue.

Ok let me list off some of the reasons id like to move out, in no particular order:

* my room gets overwhelmingly messy when my sibling visits, there isnt much i can do other than wait the visit out. its not their fault, its both of us, they have almost no space for their bags and stuff. it stresses me the hell out, ESPECIALLY while i try to do school work.
* my sibling and i get along great for the most part, but i feel guilty when i want to be alone in the room after stressful days at work.
* there is no privacy for my boyfriend and I, i respect the"" leave the door open ""rule. i dont pay the bills so its not my place to make rules like that, but the lack of intimacy is slightly straining our relationship. he is apartment hunting at the moment and saving up to move to this city. ( he currently lives over an hour and a half away) and no, we cannot be intimate at his current place because i cant even get there. i have a junk car and to get me, drive back, drop me off, and drive back again would be a 4+ hours... yeah. sex just isnt work that and im not... allowed?... to stay there as far as i know.
* I feel like a burden in a way. im an adult, I pay my car insurance, i pay for my own phone, i buy most of my necessities... but i feel kind of like a bum. i believe that stems from my past home though.
* the youngest child infuriates me to the point where ive had to leave the house, she never gets in trouble and i have to fix her fuck ups. i feel like im constantly cleaning.
* i feel like im not viewed as an adult, my dad and i had a chat after i made a mistake soon after turning 18. and he basically told me that i wont be treated like an adult unless i acted like it, fair. so now i constantly worry that im acting immature and im not adult enough. ( i turned 18 in June)
* i feel like i neglect my boyfriend. it makes me nervous to be super close to him with my family around, and since we cant just relax and snuggle or anything... it just bothers us and is creating problems. we like to lay and cuddle in my room but imagine doing that in a room that leads directly to the livingroom and a 12 and 13 year old constantly barging in.

Here are some of the reasons i'd like to stay:

* No rent or anything, all im asked to do is work and do my chores. and ofc do my best in school
* my family, they aggravate me but i love them dearly. I didn't get to see my dad a lot as a child, not his fault btw, and a part of me really wants to stay and make up for lost time. I love my dad, so much that im deadass about to cry while i type this.
* the ability to save money. the job im going to school for requires me to move. and i planned my whole life on moving to California anyway. it has ALWAYS been my dream to move there, and i am going to school for animation and Cali has a HUGE job market for animators. ( ive always wanted to make cartoons, designs, effects, film work whatever) i currently live in hickville usa
* im scared ill hurt my dad and stepmoms feelings. especially since they  have done so much for me.
* i am terrified that if i leave ill set myself up for failure. I need to finish school, but i need money, being an adult is hard and i dont know what im doing...
* moving in with my boyfriend feels so final... if i ever decide to go back home where will i stay? they wont have a room for me. why would they?
* i feel safe and protected here, like i always have a safety net.
* my boyfriend hasnt found a place here yet, and he just got a new job. he makes good money, weekly pay, and he could definetly afford the bills. but i feel bad because i know i just wouldnt be able to contribute much. i can only work two days a week at the moment. im doing college virtually and thats hard enough, especially when i start to commute 30+ min to campus and stay at school until the afternoon. ( no we cannot move there, it is ridiculously overpriced to live up there, hypothetically we could move there but it would take even more time and more money and only just cost more. im fine with spending simply a bit more in gas to commute)
* im scared that my dad will feel kind of betrayed. i dont want to offend him or make him feel as though he isn tdoing a good job, he is, truly. i just want to improve my relationship with my bf and have more control of my space. i need cleanliness and quiet, and im not exactly getting that here.

my stress has just been building, and i feel stuck. i feel lost. i feel like im not doing good enough. i feel like im missing out. 

   my aunt who i work with thinks i should move in with him, my family likes him, he is a hard worker and treats me very very well. a lot of my co workers believe that i should move in with him, my friends want me to do what i think is best, but... i dont know what is best. what do you guys think?  i need advice. hopefully from other adults, thank you so much for reading. today has been exhausting. sorry for typos and all...  im really tired. this doesn't get into everything obviously. i just really need to decide if im staying here, i just dont know what is best. feel free to tell me your experiences with this.",07Sep2020,1
122,"A bunch of my friends and me are going to the pool tomorrow. I want my roommate to come, but she is not confident in a bikini even though she’s in good shape. This has prevented her from going to the pool all summer, and I really want her to go. Many of the friends that were going to go with are overweight, but they all have no issues in bikinis. So like especially by comparison she would look great. I’ve offered to go buy her a cute coverup, a new bathing suit, stay in the water the whole time with her, etc. 

I really want her to come, but I know this is a personal struggle that she’s dealing with. I really wish she could come and enjoy herself. 

Are there any people out there who have the same struggle? Is there anything your friends or you could do to make yourself more comfortable and confident? Should I push her to come or just let her stay gone alone?",07Sep2020,1
123,"Here’s all the jobs I’ve had: 

Fast food place, pizza place, skateboard warehouse, plastic injection molding factory for like a day, paint factory for like a three days, a school, another school, a thrift store, a banquet hall, and currently a retirement community. 

I’m 23 years old. I’m currently going to school and I’m majoring in pre-social work but I’m not even sure if I want to do that. 

I only work part time. 4 days a week and 7 hours a day. Yet, I still hate getting up in the morning and going into work. I think most of it has to do with not liking myself and not being able to change things about me. 

Yes, I go to therapy. I suffer from depression, low self-esteem, social anxiety. Those are the things I talk about. And so when I’m at work, I feel very tense. I mumble a lot. I barely talk. And I try to avoid people. Talking to residents when I don’t want to drains me. When I hear someone coming down the hallway, I’ll try to hide to avoid interaction. I don’t like myself. I don’t like the front I put on. I drain me. And I can’t change these things immediately. I don’t like my face or my voice. The way I am actually is beginning to frustrate me. But I can’t change it. So that’s another reason I hate going to work. 

I don’t know what to do. If I change jobs, it’s not guaranteed that I’ll be comfortable at the next job. I’m just kind of lost. What advice would you give me?",07Sep2020,1
124,"I understand that race, mental illness and other things considered ‘edgy’ or ‘dark’ aren’t ok sometimes but this is only because, we put to much power to these topics and make them these unspeakable things like that bar fight in the beginning of Rush Hour when Jackie Chan’s character misused the n word. 

I just want to start a bit of a stand up comedy routine but when I asked people online how to perfect a Chinese accent, people got pissed and offended. They thought that it was just going to be blatant racism and asked me if I was Chinese thinking that’s only way I would be allowed to do the accent. I’m a Filipino and I have nearly perfected my Russian accent without anyone getting like this. So why does it change like that? Why do people get so butthurt about these things? Why do we give these topic so much power and influence over what we as a society consider normal?",07Sep2020,1

127,"I was told about a sexual assault. It was horrible, but it didn't involve actual intercourse or sexual contact beyond touching with clothes on. Either way, the victim is traumatized by what happened.

However, she's not my family member is afraid to tell her dad or anyone else that she was assaulted. I don't want to intervene in her life and go against her wishes by talking to her dad behind her back. I also want to give her the time to process what happened and hopefully gather the courage to do it herself.

With that said, I think her dad ***has to eventually*** know what happened and that a police report needs to be filed. So considering that I heard about a crime, can I be held liable if I never report it even if the victim never reports it herself or tells anyone else? Do I have to go to the police?",07Sep2020,1

130,"I had two female friends of mine over to my house tonight (they're in my very small college program; we're in the same bubble). I just drove them home and came back. When I used the bathroom, I noticed a red stain on the mat in my bathroom. It's a soft foam material, kind of like memory foam, but I'm not exactly sure.

I tried smelling the liquid (there was a little bit pooled up) but didn't detect anything. In the trash can were some wads of toilet paper that had bright red liquid on them. Neither of the girls mentioned anything, so I'm guessing one of them had a period-related incident and was too embarrassed to mention it to me.

Just to clarify: I am in no way judging this; I completely understand, but I do need advice on cleaning this up. I'm not 100% sure it's blood, but I don't know what else it could be and I don't know how to clean it up.

So far, I kind of swiped up excess liquid (trying not to rub it in anymore) and I've sprayed stain remover on the spot. Maybe I made it worse? I don't know.

If anyone has advice on how to clean this up, that would be greatly appreciated. I think I'm set on friendship advice: I'm just not gonna mention it.",07Sep2020,1

I couldn't calm down. I got more and more upset that I let out a scream at the top of my lungs. He then said he was grounded and immediately hung up.

His parents really don't care when I'm upset. It's just ""their way or the highway."" Whenever he tries to help me and then his parents want him to do something else, he tries to help me as much as he can but then he ends up getting grounded. It's important that you're nice to your friend's families, but also that they do the same back... and I feel like that's not the case.

He gets grounded often when he's just trying to be my best friend and help me. The fact that his parents are constantly taking that away is really breaking my heart.

135,"I (21M) have never had a girlfriend in my (almost) 22 years of life. I’ve only dated one girl my whole life and she ghosted me after 6 months despite having said that she cared about me and wanted me in her life. It left me utterly heartbroken. 

Things have been downhill since then. Roughly 8 months later and I still think about that girl a lot. Additionally I can’t stop thinking about if/when I’ll find someone. It gets a lot worse when my younger family members tell me about their relationships. 

Out of my 3 siblings, I’ve always been the most introverted. I don’t have very many friends at all, likely due to me having attended 3 different colleges until I found the right fit. My first year at my dream school, however, was ruined by this girl I dated and the pandemic. I was a shell of myself. That made it hard to really get to know new friends much less find a relationship. But even then I’ve always just had a hard time getting to know people, it’s like my mind goes blank when I’m around someone I’m interested in. 

I’ve been told I’m handsome by many people, but I have a hard time believing it. I workout a lot to offset the lack of confidence I still have in myself. Lately I’ve been alone a lot due to the pandemic, and I find that these thoughts and feelings really get worse when I’m by myself. I can’t stop feeling like a loser, with no friends and that I’ll never find the right girl. That’s led to me using dating apps somewhat obsessively (checking them multiple times a day, getting sad when I have no new activity, etc). 

I know this can’t be healthy, and I’ve tried to cut back on using dating apps because they just make me feel worse. However, when I’m not using them I can’t help but feel like I’m running out of time to find the right girl. I always try to tell myself to ‘focus on myself and work hard’ but that positive mindset always seems to wear off after a few days at most. I really want to move forward with some hope that I won’t be alone forever without having to think about it all the time. 
I just want to enjoy the point in my life I’m at now without worrying about my love life. 

Any advice? 

TL;DR: I (21M) have only dated one girl in my life who ghosted me after 6 months of dating. It left me completely heartbroken, and has me thinking that I’ll never get a girlfriend. I’ve been using dating apps obsessively and letting them affect my mood when they don’t work. The pandemic is making my loneliness even worse. I know I need to change. Any advice?",07Sep2020,1

Usually, calling the Police solves the loud neighbour problem which is what we did last night but it did not solve anything for us. The unit above ours has been making loud noises which can be described as dragging and dropping things on the floor regardless day or night. Sometimes, we even hear screaming, shouting and loud music.. It's ridiculous. The key thing to note here is the offending neighbour also knows we are the ones who contacted the Police since we have been kindly telling them to stop. They always respond with ""Okay"" but sometimes end up making even more noise.

The Police got back to me and informed us that the household has a child with Autism. But this does not take away the fact that they CHOSE to ignore the Police officers warning and advice while not making an immediate effort to solve the problem. I even gave them a simple solution... Our units have two floors and we sleep on our second floor which means they have been making noise on their first floor. So, all they needed to do was move whatever the hell they were doing that was pissing us off up to their second floor. But they did not, they even told me that the kid (who has autism) will just run down... Uhmmm, duhhh? That's because everyone is downstairs, chatting and not giving a shit about sleep? If everyone moved upstairs, turned off the lights downstairs and started enforcing this at night, I would not be posting this on Reddit lol.

I mean how hard is it to give it a rest? The noise happens almost 24 hours a day.... During night, we cannot sleep and during day, we cannot work or have a day's rest in peace. I have worked and interacted with people with Autism belonging to different ages and I understand it is not easy to raise or interact with someone with Autism BUT ALL the people I have met with autism, even children can understand and change their behaviour when learning from example and based on routine.

After the Police stopped by, the noise continued, so I went up to ask them about their difficulties but they immediately snapped at me... It's unbelievable people can be so selfish and blind even when they are in the wrong. Shameless and pathetic tbh... They can't even comprehend the simple fact that don't they think I have better things to do? Which is why we are telling them to stop because it is affecting the important things we have to do with our lives like sleep and also work from home because of the pandemic lol.

So me and a girl were in the back of seat of my car around 3am. She gave me head and she told me she was going to swallow and last minute she decided she couldn’t. I opened the back window of my car for her to spit it out and it got all over the side door of my car. I didn’t notice the stain till 3 days later because I didn’t have to go anywhere. I then later saw it and said wtf is that then I remember that night the stain is white. Fast forward to present day I took it to a car wash paid for the most expensive one. It didn’t work... so I went to a car wash where you manually have to wash your own car it didn’t work. My vehicle is black so the stain looks like a faded white. My father later noticed and said “did someone throw an egg at your car?” I said i don’t know I think a bird had really bad diarrhea and decided to take a dump on my car. Any ideas how I can remove this without damaging the paint on my car? Thanks, and it’s okay if you wanna make jokes.

I’m in Ohio USA. This might not be a big deal but I’m done and want to explore my legal options. I am on intermittent FMLA. I have not had a week off of work in over five years unless it was for surgery. FMLA legally has the right to take any already accrued PTO (paid time off, vacation days) and put it toward day’s that I take off intermittently. Well the past month has been good for me and I haven’t missed any work. I should have had a PTO Balance of 12 hours. I wanted to take a 4 day weekend. When I put my PTO request in, everyone is confused because my PTO balance isn’t right and my time off gets denied. Basically I look at my paycheck and I’ve had A NEGATIVE PTO balance the last 3 paychecks. They preemptively took future Pto to apply it to days I took off. I believe it was a system error but I’m mad as hell because I wanted to take a 4 day vacation and couldn’t this weekend because the system messed up.

148,"So umm, a year ago me and this friend with bpd, clicked, became pretty close friends and soon best friends. During the start of our friendship, it was pretty fun, we always did crazy shit when we met and never had anything negative between us, I did catch feelings for her back then but they faded within a month or 2. After summer break, we became closer than ever, after she tried ODing and later opened up to me about some deeper shits of hers, I felt attached for the first time in my life. (Note- I’ve never been attached to anyone, neither my girlfriend not any friend in the past be4 this). So she had a boyfriend and me and him became pretty good friends too. However soon she started using me A LOT to spend time with her boyfriend. Monday’s would be my only free days, she’d go all like “I miss u let’s hang out”, she’d come over to my place and then call her boyfriend on MY PHONE for 3 hours straight and TOTALLY ignore my existence. Knowing she had crazy self esteem issues and her depression was pretty bad, I always stayed quiet and never really questioned her or so, (I KNOW I WAS SUPER DUMB), it got to a point where they started having intercourse in my fucking room while I was in there 3rd wheeling them.... I know I’m dumb....

Soon all of this went on for a few months, on every hangout she’d call him and ditch us, I had no issue with that, but them making out in my car in front of my driver, that wasn’t something I liked as he was someone I didn’t trust. After a few months they broke up and she fell in crazy depression and I could see her at her rock bottom and I knew tat I would never forgive myself if she tried to commit suicide again, her episode kicked in as well and I decided to stay with her throughout and help her get over it somehow, so we then spent the next 3 months, on call every night till 5 am, and then call when we’d wake up and then again in the evening, we pretty much were in touch 24/7. I wanted to do all I could to prevent another episode from happening and barely leaving her to her thoughts. I did get pretty tired with this, there were tons of times when I had to ditch my friends cuz she was depressed and other shit similar to that, and I did get frustrated with it but there were good sides to it too so I kept going,
So during all of this, she came to my home once and felt attracted to me that day and confessed feeling tons of butterflies and shit around me, and I feel somewhere I told myself “well a relationship ain’t tat bad” and I went along with it and we were about to make out but she had to leave, I caught crazy feelings for her that moment, it hit me like a truck. That night when we video called, it was soo different and I enjoyed every moment of it, the next day everything was going fine till the evening when she told me she lost it all, and it crushed me hard, I felt heart broken aftwr like 7 years and i didn’t know what to do, she cried all night thinking she let the friendship fuck up,
Again, my care for her kicked in and the next day I told her I was over it and our friendship was fine, I know I’m dumb, it hurted a lot but that time what hurted more was knowing she cried... 

So like 4 days later she told me she didn’t really lose those butterflies but didn’t want to act on them as she didn’t want to screw up the friendship and tat pretty much fucked with me even more, and I told her I couldn’t do this, She almost cried again and I could hear her sad and shit, so I tried staying there but it got too much for me.... I couldn’t stop seeing her as the demon who broke my heart, played with my feelings... It then lead to arguments and fights between us where she started to complain my behavior of leaving repeatedly, soon after like a 3 day break, I was still heartbroken but both of our care kicked in and met and had a good time and decided to fix this, 

I then got treated like a third option and repeatedly ignored for 2 full weeks as her other friend was going through depression and she had to be there for him, I opened up to her saying tat It hurt me how she was treating me however she ended up bursting again, ahh the usual bpd toxic trait of not admitting that U’re wrong.....  and we had another fight....it soon got to a point where I felt increasingly hurt knowing that this is the same person whom I fucked everything for just so she could get over her broken heart and here she is giving no fucks about my broken heart and perhaps choosing her friend over me, although she kept denying to doing that, but her actions made it very clear....
We later got into a spell of fights that stretched to 2 months with multiple breaks and in the end we finally called it off and decided to stay away from each other’s lives..

It’s now been around 3 weeks since that happened, at first it was really hard but hypnosis and meditation is helping me let go of the attachment,

However no matter how much I try to suppress it or ignore it through medidtation, i still feel angry everytime I try to recall how I was used by this person for an entire year and how selfish she was, it still hurts me a lot thinking about shit she did months ago, no matter how much I try making my peace with all of this, I just can’t. I’ve developed anger issues from all of this.

I really don’t know how I could possibly ever move on from the past, this is something that always drags me down, please try to help me out with this :( i’d really appreciate it ❤️😞",07Sep2020,1

now i still don’t have the urge. it’s almost been 5 days and i haven’t gone and no urge, and i cant poop without it. i only have the urge to poop when i drink prune juice, and the prune juice stopped working. does anyone have any idea why i have lost the urge?",07Sep2020,1
150,"So this person I know is completely losing it. I think they have some combination of ADHD/Bipolar and possibly other mental disorder. This person was diagnosed with the those disorders similar high school? Though, they were mostly fine, not very problematic and it continued throughout college. Their behavior worsen after they move back in with their parents. Very controlling parents (not abusively, just a lot of nagging, reminding them to do things, be home by certain time, just a lot more restrictive than living with roommates. Anyway, their behavior has been spiking after they moved in with their parent. And it recently gotten bad enough that people close to them, friends, family, and coworkers are getting worried.

I don't know if this person is taking their meds properly or if it's a side effect with alcohol. Anywhere, this is some of the thing I noticed that was off about them these past few months.
Aggressive behaviors, aloof, blank stare, smiling (seems forced, fake, or unnatural), temper, dazed, destructive, unstable..etc
I won't go into details unless necessary, but this person really need help. They're not the same lately and them blaming their parents (dad?) for their behaviors just doesn't make much sense to me. Of course, they could always saved up and move out, but this person spend more than save. Psychiatrist, cops, mental health clinic, nothing seem to work. What I can do to help this person before they end up hurting themselves or others?",07Sep2020,1
151,"I've (15F) always had a pretty rocky relationship with my dad, and due to the coronavirus/being stuck together in a house for the past couple months we've been fighting way more than usual. We had a particularly nasty one today, and as a result I've been reflecting a lot on the way he's treated me. I may be a bit biased, but in no particular order, here are some things he's said/threatened to me.

\-On multiple occasions, he's threatened to set up my younger siblings for adoption as punishment for something I've done. (Maybe a joke? This happened when I was like 8-10 and actually thought he'd do it)

\-told me I'm the reason our family has been falling apart when he's mad

\-threatened to divorce my mother because of me

\-also told me I'm the reason why he will divorce my mother (again, when I was like 10 or something and didn't really get what was going on with their relationship)

\-told me I've been faking my anxiety attacks (I might be, but I don't really think I have been faking them. I know what the symptoms are but am not allowed to get a therapist or to seek a diagnosis because I'm ""faking"" it)

\-He's put time limits (through a IOS feature) on all my social media (20 minutes on safari/messages/insta/snap/facetime etc.)  and has threatened to run over my phone/ destroy it whenever we argue. (he's already smashed my 11 year old brothers phone)

\-also limited my calling time on my phone so all voice/facetime calls are turned off from 10:30 p.m. to 8:30 a.m. (I get this as I have to sleep, but it's frustrating sometimes when I really need to just talk to someone and I can't; especially since the past couple months I haven't been out once) (I'm not allowed out at all because of the virus and haven't seen any of my friends) I guess I kind of deserve this one because I abused his trust by calling people too late.

\-told me my self harm was attention seeking because I've only cut myself a couple times. (this one might be true? I only really self harm after we fight so maybe I was trying to prove something or get back at him?)

\-Doesn't believe me when I try to explain my actions to him anymore because I lied to him once about how much time I was spending on my phone. I had found a way to bypass the time restrictions once and didn't tell him. Now, whenever he finds out I'm doing something he doesn't agree with and I argue with him he pulls the ""I know you lie a lot"" card. I do think I may be a pathological liar and also want to go to a therapist to get help for that, but again, I'm not allowed to. 

Big disclaimer!! I'm a healthy 15 year old who has hobbies and friends and exercises/plays a sport. I haven't been that suicidal/depressed and all that in a year, which I'm proud of. However, I know some people who have the same issues as I have with their parents as well, and was simply wondering if this categorizes as some form of abuse or if all parent children relationships have their low points .

155,"i'm not even sure if i want to post this. i guess this is kind of a vent? i guess i'm mostly just asking if what i'm deciding to do is right.

a little backstory:

i graduated high school this year. during quarantine (for me it started in march), i met some friends (via social media and zoom) who would be attending the same college as me. one of the friends, let's call them F, introduced me to all of them via including them in zoom calls. they also introduced me to M, and everything was cool for awhile.

around may, these two friends stopped talking with each other. i don't know the exact details as to how and why, but they had each other blocked on social media and now the entire friend group was split into two. that's fine, i got accustomed to it. 

F went through a not-so-proud moment when they debated a topic in which they were not very educated in (this was in a separate group text). M (who is not white) was able to find screenshots of this because of another friend and called her out (think racism). 

when we all moved into college (i live where covid isn't too bad so we're doing a hybrid schedule thing), the two friends ended up in the same dorm building  but different floors. everything was fine, but F noticed that their white board stuck on their dorm door was being ""vandalized"" (their social media name they wrote on it would be erased). it got to the point where it was actually taken down by whoever was doing it. they don't know who is doing it.

their dorm neighbors, who they were friendly with, suddenly blocked them on social media too. F had to ask around as to why, and apparantly M had been telling others that F was racist. F isn't feeling safe in the dorm anymore and is going to file a report the day after this text post is posted. this could result in M getting kicked out from college.

i don't know what to do, honestly. i've been in the middle grounds since this drama started, but now i feel like i need to let M know that F will file a report. but i don't know who else F told of this.

both F and M know that i am friends with the other and i think they just casually trash-talk about the other to me, which i don't mind. 

for now, i think i will continue to stay in the middle. i don't want to stress myself out about this. who knows, maybe my friend won't get expelled. 

should i do nothing about it, or should i do something about it?",07Sep2020,1

Yeah sure my friends have told me I’m really funny and pretty creative but ever since I’ve started having anxiety and depression it’s felt like hell for my brain. I’m honestly scared to death I won’t be able to just be myself and be the person I want to be, I just can’t put my mind to it and it really bothers me I’m really insecure about this stuff.

Then there’s something with my speech, sometimes I can speak clearly but then most of the time I fumble my words and it just sounds weird. I swear I’ve never had a speech impediment, I don’t get it, this is one of the number one things that ruins my jokes and my confidence into trying to add something to the conversation. It just puts me in an awful mindset and discourages me and even makes me sad. I’ve never had this issue it’s like just now I guess I don’t know to be honest. 

I know depression has messed with my brain a lot, I haven’t laughed a lot until just recently it’s been 2 weeks I guess maybe a month since I started laughing again and laughing a lot usually in my Group FaceTime’s, I just don’t know what to do about it I wanna always feel happy and funny, I just wanna keep feeling the satisfaction of making people’s days with my jokes.

I have a close friend of mine who's been renting a house with a family member and caring for his kids for a very long time. He was able to make ends meet until he was suddenly hit with child support last month that takes up almost a third of his monthly net income, and then this month, he found out his roommate is moving out at the end of the month. He recently received a raise from his boss earlier this year before the pandemic so he is not eligible to request another raise at this time.

He's clearly not going to be able to make next month's rent and will have to move out anyway, but he's been trying to brainstorm ways of making additional income to supplement what he's making so that he can better provide for his kids.

What advice would you provide to a single father who is looking to make additional income besides his usual 9a-5p job?

163,"My mom has always been volatile, probably bipolar (if that's still a thing?). She always said she was an alcoholic, and I've only ever seen her drunk once so I guess I never knew the extent of it (her regular, sober freakouts were enough to put the fear of God in me). She quit her job - after endless conflicts with her employer and coworkers - when the pandemic started, and it started a chain reaction of public freakouts and binge drinking. Apparently she's had multiple disorderly conduct charges, an assault charge against a federal official, has wrecked a car, and has now taken off into a different state with some guy she's been sleeping with (who she often drinks/parties with). I found this all out two days ago when my dad called me asking for advice. Prior to that I had only been seeing her deterioration on phone calls - rambling, manic calls. She's had a history of making suicidal comments, and honestly I've spent the last seven years dreading waking up to that phone call.

Tonight I and my father separately called the police in the town she's (hopefully) sleeping it off in and requested a check-in. Apparently the officers can't do much (no drugs or bottles in her car, and she's locked her hotel door and is refusing to say anything). I'm terrified that she actually made a good decision to spend the night in a hotel and sober up, and by having the cops check in on her we've pushed her to the breaking point. I'm terrified that she's going to make a rash decision.

So, with all of that: 

1.) Is there any way to know if I did the right thing? Are there any web resources I can look into reading about how to handle situations like this?

2.) Anybody have any advice or experience about what to expect from a relative after a ""wellness check-in?"" Are there any tools or techniques I can use when talking to her (if she lets me talk to her) to help convince her to get help? (She said she's finally started going to therapy in the last month and really likes her therapist because the therapist agrees with everything my mom tells her - aaaand her therapist is moving to a different and prohibitively expensive practice and removing my mom as a client in two weeks.)

3.) I'm worried she will go home to my dad tomorrow in a rage - how do I keep my dad safe? Should I ask him to get a hotel and not be alone with her? I've seen her be physically violent before, throwing things and sometimes punching.

I apologize for the kind of strange rambling post. I'm a little shaken up.

I wish I could simply distance myself from them but I am having trouble for the following reasons.

1. I'm in a group chat where they would notice if I left
2. If I stopped hanging out, they would notice and get angry and/or insecure and either try to force me to stay friends with them or threaten self harm/emotional distress.
3. I have multiple classes with them this school year (20-21)
4. (this one is the biggest reason) Girl A is basically the (very toxic and anarchic) leader of the friend group and if i were to distance myself from her she would do anything in her power to get the rest of the group to excomminucate me. 

There are two girls (not A and B) that I want to stay friends with but if I distanced myself from Girl A, she would likely do her very best to get them to choose her over me and it would be a very uncomfortable situation. 

As for girl B, she would likely throw a fit and threaten suicide.

Then we got to the door and saw the deadbolt was locked??? We looked all around the house and noticed the light in the closet upstairs was on. We NEVER go up there.

I'm 27 years old, and i went to a high school  in the same city I'm currently in. I was bullied a kid in elementary school and i think having a crush on this guy in high school, i was in my head a lot and i turned out to be this girl who was in her head a lot. I think near the end of elementary school, I learned to not care about other people and just focused on myself and I found that people soon started to gear towards me. In my first 2 years of high school, it was one of my best years, but the moment i started to like this guy (it was reciprocal) but since I was bullied and had trust issues, I rejected him a few times even though we talked almost like we were bestfriends because he was very social and had dated a lot of people. I've also noticed the girls he has dated, after dating him, the entire school sort of villianize those girls and i didn't want to be one of those girls...yet i continued to talk to him but was trying to be on guard. at the end of high school he started dating someone else and talked to me less which made me feel sad and instantly regretted saying no to him. (I am very aware that talking about this doesnt matter now) and i think i started caring about what other people thought of me because i really seemed to have liked him, and people seem to really like him and all.  


Anyways i ended up going to the same university as him. and there he asked me out again, and i said no again because i think he felt like there was no one around in the city and like i didnt think he actually really liked me and that theres like no one else for him to like and he likes me... yes i was not nice. I just felt a bit betrayed..and like he just kept dating people in high school and once he moved away from a city by himself making new friends for him was hard.. but there again he was great at making new friends. especially with people of the same ethnicity and background. I am the same ethnicity as him..so we have a lot of mutual friends.... he started being really weird and rude and just seemed like all of sudden just wanted to get in my pants.. but like everyone else didn't always see him that way. Anyways he's married now... and he's married to a girl who's family is really well known, i can't help but think he relayed my cringy worthy stories to his friend from high school, and to our university circle and i feel like thats like my entire city...like its a very small world i find. people from my elementary school somehow know my friends university and high school...i feel like i want to be confident and meet new people, but its hard because everyone seems to have their own circle of friends and i don't.",07Sep2020,1

TLDR: I am rough on myself for my own hobbies of playing video games and working at my desk, and I don’t much like hanging out w people.

 work from home bcuz of covid, I work 8 hours a day starting at 10:30am, so I normally sleep until then. I wake up and work until 7, then almost every night i’ll either go to my gfs house or just stay home and play video games all night. I don’t know if this is necessarily bad, I know I shouldn’t play video games so much just to keep myself active. But I do go to the gym every other night for an hour, i’ve been working on gaining weight, and i feel more awake and up. 

But with this I’ve also started to dislike myself for how much and I sit at a desk every day. I mean if my gf has plans, I’ll usually work for 8 hours at my desk, workout for an hour and eat (so maybe 2 hours time), and then play video games with friends until 1 or 2 then repeat the cycle. Most of my really close friends are out of state for new jobs, and my other group of friends are all gamers so we rlly just hangout online (other than weekends we go out).

I also have the mindset of not wanting to hangout with people generally speaking. I prefer to be alone as I don’t trust a whole lot of people and It’s just generally hard to find “good people”. I’m also kinda quiet when I am with people bcuz I don’t do a lot so I don’t have much to have conversation about. 

Not sure if I just need to pick up more hobbies and stay more active so that I maybe would want to hangout w people more? idk I moist sick of hating myself no natter what i do.

178,"this is gonna be a long one. but i am so hurt, and so stuck, i need any advice i can get here...

&amp;#x200B;

my boyfriend and i have been seeing each other for 11m almost. we met in college, and fell for eachother instantly. slept in the same bed every night for months. as soon as the COVID outbreak happened, we all got sent home. we were able to see eachother for most of the spring and summer, we live 2.5 hours apart so we have to plan ahead a lot. recently we both started working full time again and he went back to school (i am doing school online) 

we were attached at the hip. obsessed with eachother, totally in love.  

we got into a fight the other day and i got really caught up in the heat of the moment and said i needed time.. he called me on the phone hyperventilating and crying begging me not to leave him.  hours later i calmed down and i regretted saying that i wanted to. 

now the table has turned, the next day he said he wanted to take a break, and i was begging him to stay with me.

fast forward a week and we have been talking on and off all day every day. but we are broken up. most of the conversation details how he isnt ready for a relationship, and how his depression just got really bad and he thinks he needs to be alone for a while. he is still telling me that he loves me, but he seems totally checked out. he told me he has ""a lowkey sex addiction"". 

i want him to see a therapist but he says he doesnt need one. he told me he isnt ready for anything, but when he is he will tell me. hes telling me not to wait for him, which shocks me because we used to be obsessed with each other to the point where we hated eachother talking to anyone of the opposite sex...

im lost, and truly hurt. with no answers. he almost died in a car crash this summer and that night i held him all night while he tried to sleep, woke up crying and panicking multiple times. he comforted me on the days i couldnt bring myself to get out of bed. and now all of the sudden he wants to be alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

do i try? to let him know that im here

do i wait until hes ready or should i move on?

are these excuses or is he valid in his thinking?

any advice would be great. feel free to ask any questions",07Sep2020,1

181,"I really liked this girl that I’ve known for a while, and I considered her a good friend and we had hung out 1 on 1 a lot. Not as dates or anything just as friends. But I couldn’t take it anymore so I asked her out for ice cream and told her how I felt. She said she had just got out of a relationship a month ago and wasn’t ready for another one yet, and she didn’t want to rush into anything. I honestly was expecting her to say no and I was glad she was being honest, because I had just been completely honest about how I felt about her. Well the next day it turned out she decided to start dating again. She had a boyfriend and I saw her with hickies on her neck. 
Just wondering what’s the best way to deal with my feelings about this. It’s kinda eating me up, I feel disrespected and kind of sick to my stomach. I’ve already unfollowed her on everything and I don’t really want to talk to her ever again. Should I just let myself feel these feelings or should I fight them head on?

185,"So I recently came out the other end of a long negative spiral. Mental health, loss of driection, drugs, you name it. I was also born with a rare social anxiety disorder called elective mutism.

It was hard for me to get help, even when I tried many times. I had almost zero tools to describe or even understand my own emotions. 

I went down a pretty hardcore path, lots of stupid shit, fucked up situations, people, drugs, reality escape, the whole thing.

Anyways, I like to think I’ve come out the other end now. I’m left with some consequences of my behaviour and will need to appear in court at some point.

Hitting rock bottom gave me some motiviation. I had spent a near decade being depressed and self-loathing. Why would I do that now. My attitude has changed. Now I think, why not be able to say to that judge, I spent all my time doing productive meaningful things to the best of my ability. I work fulltime, study online and work out all the time. I don’t wanna stand there having to say I did nothing to change my life for the better.

I have accepted the situation I am in, I’m doing the best I can with it. But I also have a concern.

Am I legit living in a much better way because I want to or am I doing it so I can avoid dealing with other realities. How can I sense if I’m avoiding something in myself?",07Sep2020,1

187,"Hi all. This is a bit of a longer story, so ill attempt to give the sparksnotes version. I dated this girl my senior year of high school, but cheated on her during the summer. At the time, I was attempting to find the answer to my problems the worst way possible. We break up at the beginning of our freshmen year of college. Last spring, right after quarantine started, I realized that the reason I had so much trouble the tear before was because of the guilt of my actions. I beg for forgiveness and she agrees to be friends again. Everythings going well, and im feeling good about everything, until my brain attempted to rekindle my feelings for her. I warned her of this, as she had a partner she was very interested in. I told her that her partner should know were talking, as I'd assume I'd pop up as a threat on their radar. She tells me she'll tell them, and i go on my merry way. We talk one day while she's upset, and next thing I know im blocked on everything. The conversation ended on good terms, so im not sure what happened. I attempted to reach out multiple ways, including mutual friends, email, and talking to her during class. She called me a weirdo and told me to ""take a hint"" I had told her before if she didn't want to be friends just tell me, but she's not willing to give me the why. She told me to not contact her, but I've been filled with this desire to know what happened, as SOMETHING had to have. I emailed her a couple more times, but got nothing. I haven't spoken to her in class. I ended up getting food around the same time, and did the exact same thing on pure coincidence, which caused her to hide in the bathroom till she thought I was gone. Every time I've attempted interraction shes treated me like the plague, despite the fact that I've been nothing but kind and there for her since apologizing. Im not looking for a relationship with her, ive only wanted to be friends. What should I do, as getting over it doesnt seem to be working, and everyone who knows her agrees its weird how she's acting.",07Sep2020,1
188,"So we both live and go to university together but today she was just extremely frustrated with me. She would just not say anything or throw things at me. I asked her what was bothering her and she said that I was annoying her but she didn't know how or why. I think my poor listening skills have something to do with it. It often takes me two or three listens to properly get the sentence to register in my head, which to anyone could be annoying. Another thing she said was ""Do you know when someone just rubs you the wrong way? You're that kind of annoying""

It's really upsetting me that I have no idea how I am annoying her. I often feel more like a younger sibling than a boyfriend to her at times.",07Sep2020,1
189,"So I matched with this girl on bumble and all was going well. All her pictures matched up and a reverse image search revealed nothing. The conversation moved to be a bit sexual and she sent me a nude photo first. I reverse image searched this too and nothing came back. I suggested we continue on snap and we did. After a couple snaps she asked to see my dick and after making sure she was ok with a pic I sent one. Right after she opened it she blocked me and removed me on bumble. My head is just spinning with a bunch of bad possible outcomes. I’m not sure why she would have blocked me unless it was for bad intent? Like she specifically asked me for a picture of my dick and it’s not like it’s small or anything so there shouldn’t have been any dissatisfaction there. Overall, I’m just pretty rattled and want to know what other people think. Could I have possibly just done something really bad and screwed myself? Could I get blackmailed or something?

192,"So a few months ago I posted for advice about a girl I like, but I left  out some darker stuff because it wasn't relevant, but now I'm worried.

At this point I don't care if she is interested in me or not, I'm just worried.

I'll start from the beginning.

This  girl and I were best friends in primary school, but we ended up going  to different high schools and lost touch. I've now found out that while  she was in high school, she didn't know anyone, her parents broke up,  and apparently she was in a bad spot. She ended up hanging around with  the wrong crowd and when she was 15 ended up sleeping with a 27 yo, now  her ex-boyfriend.

I haven't heard  from here since the end of primary school, I tried to find her but was  unsuccessful. Then two years ago, she called me up out of the blue and said she found me on Facebook and wanted to meet. I gave her my address  and she came round. She seemed off, but I haven't seen her in 13 years  and just assumed that. We ended up in bed together but didn't have any  protection so we didn't do anything. After a bit, she started to act odd  and during the night broke down into tears. She started to mention some  dark stuff she had been through and taken by surprise tried to console  her, but I could have done better. When morning came she got up and left  without saying much. I tried to text her to see if she was okay but she never replied.

Then four months  ago I text her again to see if she would reply, she did. She said that  that night someone spiked her drink with meth and she was high, and she  said that everything she said she went through that night wasn't true.  
At  this point, I was a bit relieved and she then asked if I wanted to go  up and see her (she lives quite far away.) We ended up texting for a few  weeks before I went up. This time she did seem fine, and she told me  that she recently broke up with her boyfriend (The one I mentioned, now  ex), that he got physical with her and got a restraining order against  him and even showed me. That is when she told me about what happened  after she left primary school and the under aged thing, I didn't press  the issue. We ended up sleeping together and this time it went fine. The  next morning we said our goodbyes and we have been texting ever since.  She honestly seemed interested at this point, wanting to see me again, etc.

She then started replying  less frequently, days later. She always had an excuse and I asked if I  was texting too much and she said no it was fine. But a week and a half  ago she mentioned she was going to help her ex clean out his storage  container, I didn't like the idea of this and I haven't heard from her  since.

I know she said all the dark stuff she mentioned wasn't true, but that combined with what she  told me about her ex has me worried.

Am I over thinking this?",07Sep2020,1
193,"This may sound weird. So, please don't judge. I just need an honest person's perspective. Every time I see a beautiful girl I feel lonely. I know why I am lonely. I'm 20 years old who have never had a single relationship, never had sex, or have been kissed. I also feel like I am... Just different compared to people my age. I don't like partying or drinking because of personal reasons, but I don't hate people who like to drink socially or have a beer with dinner. I love anything outdoors like hiking, fishing, etc., but I don't know anybody to go out and enjoy those things with so, in return I just isolate myself by focusing on school work. Anyways, I always smile and blush when I see a beautiful girl, but then I get feelings of loneliness. In my head, I want to walk up and talk to anybody and spark up a conversation, but I just say forget it and I don't say anything. When I'm having a conversation with someone, sometimes I think of saying something that might carry the conversation, but I don't say it. Then after I always look back on how I could have contributed even more to the conversation. So, In my head, I create multiple scenarios of dialogue between me and whom I had the conversation with. At the end of the day, when I do that it just makes me feel even more lonely. I love my life I couldn't be more satisfied where I am going, but when it comes to relationships I just don't know. Also, when I'm at college, restaurant, etc., I noticed that sometimes I get stared at by girls. Not every girl, but some. My mom sometimes will say ""they might think your good looking"". I mean if they do hypothetically, why don't they say that or try to converse with me instead of staring at me like a deer in the headlights because to me that makes me feel uncomfortable because I don't know how to interpret the message. I understand emotions and body language, but when it comes to things like full-on staring my head just goes to mush.",07Sep2020,1

195,"

So years ago my mom used to lend money to some lady who used to come around with her two daughters ( weirdo &amp; Calm ). They weren’t our family friends or anything nor were our families close. As a child i wasn’t very nice to Weirdo I don’t remember the reason why I guess I was just a mean kid 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️. Anyways they weren’t part of my childhood for long they had moved away and I only briefly saw them around as I was getting older. Growing up and getting older I had absolutely NO hatred for weirdo I actually liked her we did get along but Weirdo had become an arrogant conceited self absorbed girl which bothered me but hey you gotta love yourself right ? Anyways I come from a family that’s quite known and Weirdo loves popularity , being in the public eye and everyone knowing her name. 

Because of the way she behaves many people our age don’t seem to like her very much. But I did then I started noticing her trying to find ways to force relationship with my siblings and my older sister to be precise. This bothers me as I know she’s only doing it to benefit her , to make herself look good on social media many people have also said she’s done the same thing with their siblings too. My cousin and I have told my sister many many times that Weirdo is bad news but my sister just likes to think that we have some sort vendetta against weirdo even thou that’s far from the truth. 

Whenever vendetta calls my sister and I happen to be around Weirdo always likes to make slick comments about or treat me like I’m shit which also pisses me off whenever Weirdo makes these comments my older sister will say nothing but when I joke and say something back My sister automatically opens her mouth to give out to me. After staying calm for a long time I finally expressed my feelings and told Weirdo off( you should note that I’m generally a very calm and quiet person and If felt certain way about someone I would simply stay away from them.) 

 she went and called my sister. My sister came home and screamed the whole house down claiming that I’m just using her name because “ I don’t like weirdo” . It really hurts me that my sister thinks that I would be so malicious to just randomly do something like that is clearly out of character. What also annoyed me is that my sister then said that Weirdo was her little sister🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ What irritates me most about this is if I did Half of the things that Weirdo does and is known for my sister would be Disgusted. Now I’m irritated and part of me wants to just apologise and move on but another part of me wants to make friends with a girl my sister Despises and claim she’s my “ big sister”.",07Sep2020,1

I usually brush it off, but a few days ago, they confronted me about something (I don’t remember what it was exactly) and they brought up the fact that I made them feel stupid. They told me that I said things in a way that made them feel intellectually inferior and that sometimes I used complicated terms. I agreed, but defended myself by saying that I didn’t mean any harm and that I wasn’t responsible for their knowledge and that I shouldn’t force myself to speak a certain way (then again, there’s a limit lol). I also often like to share things that interest me (biology, biochemistry, music, psychology, books, deep discussions (At least I hope), etc) and they usually ignore me or never/rarely understand what I’m saying even though I try to explain it as clearly as possible.

199,"I have been working at a ""higher""-end grocery store for over a year and a half. I started as a cashier and have since worked in about 3 different departments at the same store. About 8 months after I started, and after moving departments a second time, I got a raise of about $1, but still don't make a living wage (under $15). Before Covid got in full force I had been planning a raise negotiation with the store director in February. This would have been at my 1 year mark and not long after yearly evaluations. Since then I let it go because I was taking a break for a month and came back around April in a new department that let me work after closing (third change). A few months went by and after I got comfortable in the new position I reached out to my boss though email to plan our negotiations again. 

It took him 5 days to respond to my email to set a date, and I responded right away with my availability. Another work week goes by and I hear nothing so I send another email asking if he's free on a couple days next week. No reply. The next day I decide to call the store to get ahold of him directly and we finally have a concrete day and time for our meeting.

When we finally start to discuss my plans for the future and what not he tells me he'd be fine giving me another dollar. This would put me just above $15/hr. I tell him that I was hoping to negotiate for something higher and the binder I wanted to start with was $18. I asked around other overnight departments and I know for a fact my friend who started about 6 months after me makes that much and we've worked in the same department. My boss then tells me the front end managers don't even make that much, and he doesn't want to overpay for my position since it was tailored to me specifically and is flexible with my schedule, and anyone can do my job. He then said he'll ask around other locations for wages of employees in similar positions and get back to me on a week.

I had the pleasure on stewing over his words through the rest of my work shift that night and came to the conclusion that he was blatantly rude and disrespectful to me and the production work that I provide. So, I have been actively looking for new employment and found something like contract work that I can start doing asap.

My dilemma is that I don't want to give this man the customary two weeks notice because of how he has treated me and how he apparently doesn't value my time. The manager that I work under however is a wonderful person that greatly appreciates my work, told me he has wanted to create the position I'm working currently for a long time, and I want to use as a reference in the future. I don't want to cause them any frustration with me leaving right away, but the director of the store told me he can have anyone work my position, and I'm inclined to force his hand.

After I officially quit I am also planning on reporting the director to HR for this unprofessional behavior and how he essentially encouraged me to quit.

I just need some advice on how to go about giving notice and resignation without having to suffer under a terrible boss any longer than I can stand.

TLDR; my boss insulted me during raise negotiations, so I'm going to quit, but my manager is really sweet and I don't want to burden them by not giving two weeks notice. How can I be good to them while also giving my boss the shaft?",07Sep2020,1
200,"A certain doctor is know to be very rude to his assistants, including myself- though it seems that he may be understanding me. 

After over a year of thinking the same things about him as everyone else in the hospital and  then witnessing small glimmers of his personality, I finally understand him and why he is the way he is. 

He's old and seems to be in a lot of emotional pain, so he bites and tries to make a strong appearance to cover the pain.

I set up things for him in the morning so the procedures can start when he walks in. But I've noticed that he actually comes in earlier than I do sometimes to get a head start in his own preparation. No other doctor does that- they come in when the patient rolls in. 

So from what I can tell, he can't sleep. 

Now it's not atypical of doctors to be perfectionists, but he takes it to another level. So I'm starting to understand that with that kind of personality one is trying to control what they can because they feel as though they're not in control.

I found a huge soft spot in him. It may not seem huge to anyone, but to someone who's closely paying attention, it was interesting. I simply found the only thing that makes him smile with a true radiance.

So I know he does care about people but does his best to hide it.

It just pains me when everyone talks trash about him in the staff room when he isn't there. It's true that he can be an asshole quite often, but he's just a man like everyone else. Iv'e been learning that those that are the meanest of all are the ones that have been hurt the most. 

How can I break him out of his concrete shell?",07Sep2020,1
201,"
This is gonna be a long story, but honestly I think writing about this will be therapeutic for me.

Me and my best friend Q (that's we'll call her) starting being best friends in high school, she had a rough upbringing, I had a stable home. But, we both experienced a similar traumatic experience and it both affected us in different ways. She used to no be a very good student, but i had to be because my parents were very strict. But, we were all each other had at the time. We grew very close near our senior year of high school. I always used to be very timid and introverted, kind of awkward. She was a pretty girl, but I never had feelings for her ever and she had a strong personality, but tended to always be in bad relationships. 

We eventually graduated high school and we went to college, she went to a community college close to my university. it was at this time we were closer than ever, but we were both immature so we had our fair share of arguments, reminder that our relationship was very platonic. In college, I had another friend that would invite us to parties and this is where I started to grow more in the sense I became less introverted. We used to have so much fun and we also became more ambitious on our goals. She used to inspire me in the fact that she would grind for what she wanted. But, then the dating came... I had no problem with her dating, but there was some red flags that came up. When she started dating this guy named R (we'll name him that), she started to pick things like vaping, or certain idealogies of his. I have no problem with having different opinions ,but I did have a problem that she was changing for him. Don't get me wrong he wasn't a bad guy, but he was one of those to keep talking up a storm and get no where. I always wanted the best for her. 

It was around this time I was super insecure with myself, I wasn't in the best shape and I had severe acne. It was because of this that I was more distant. I noticed that they were moving really fast. Eventually they moved in together. ( a lot of drama happened within our friend group that Im gonna skip, but just know that this drama is gonna be important later).  R used to think very highly of himself, which was fine but it got to the point it was pretentious. At one point, I decided to do myself better by taking baby steps, first i decided to change my major to something I would be more passionate about and that is very marketable nowadays. I also transferred to a different university that wasn't too far but also better. It was at this point that they broke up (Im gonna save all the BS) they broke twice and got back together. I was always there for her throughout this whole process. she would stay over my place and I would help her out in anyway I could. After which, she got back together with him. I was upset about this, but I eventually accepted it. We were all good and I just tolerated him for the sake of her, always polite and striked up conversations with him.

Fast forward, I took my personal growth further, I had a period of depression and a toxic relationship (which ill admit Q did help get through), after that period, I decided to go extreme into fitness and find internships to further my goals. I was so into it and I wanted Q to be better too. This is where our friendship dynamic started to change. R was just not the type of guy to actually walk the walk, he was just all talk, I literally saw no progress with him and it started to rub off on Q. I obviously am not gonna meddle in their relationship, so I made it a goal to fight for my friend and push her to be better because R wasn't going to do it. I wanted to start with fitness (she was started to let go and everybody was noticing, and it wasn't even about looks, she could not run a block with out gasping for air, I was genuinely worried). It was constant opposition from her (mind you before she was dating R she would go to the gym a lot) to the point she attacked me by saying that I've ""changed and became so vain and that it doesn't suit me"". It was at this point that she would start getting bothered by things I say even though she would do the same exact to me (but I always took it as a joke). I just found it so unfair, this extended to even when I brought up people from our past she would get angry. I started to not feel comfortable hanging out with her for long periods of time. Before this I started to branch out and make new friends because I saw our relationship was getting to co-dependent, but she never branched out she was just comfortable with me and R. 

Now present time, I started to get a surge of ambition after my depression period during quarantine. I wanted to work with her on something that would make us both money, but throughout this whole period it was always her bringing up issues. It got to the point that we just couldn't work together anymore. I stopped pushing her on a lot of stuff because we used to get into arguments, but eventually her insecurities started showing even though she said she was comfortable with herself (I would always tell her that she should love herself and that if these things matter to her work towards it then). She would lash out at me for trying to make a point if it even slightly went against her. It wasn't until it got bad and she threatened our friendship, she said that we were done and that I won't have anyone else (which is untrue I have my family and other friends). I conceded that argument saying how much I love her and that she's my family. Then she started it up again using our friendship as a weapon a week later. At this point, we haven't talked in over a week and I'm strangely relieved, but a little heartbroken. We're in an unknown state. She was my family, but at this point I don't even know anymore, I'm exhausted and I want to be at peace. I drown myself in work so I don't think about this. What bothers me the most is that I lost, I miss when she was ambitious and wouldn't stop until she reached the stars. I miss the time when she used to inspire me. But, it looks like we both changed in different directions. I just want people to be brutally honest, is it my fault? where did I go wrong? is it worth even repairing? (Right now I made the decision to stand strong and stand for myself, but maybe I could be persuaded to reach out and try to fix things) I'm just so tired....",07Sep2020,1
202,"After high school I realized how much free will and choice I have, but at the same time don’t have. My political opinions have changed, as well as my view on religion and the world. Right now both my religion and worldly beliefs have been making me feel in the middle of a war. Due to (good) personal experiences I want to not leave my religion, but I also hate being apart of it for all the discrimination and harm it can cause people. As well as my worldly beliefs, I want to stay in those too due to research. The fact that I want to be a part of both of these things makes me feel like I’m living a double life, and it hurts because I want to be open about this, but I’m scared.",07Sep2020,1

204,"So I'm chatting with someone online and we were casually talking, and they told me somewhat casually that they found out they might have bipolar and an anxiety disorder. They sounded very chill, with emojis and a casual tone. In the same message they continued to talk about something unrelated, a much lighter topic. 

Now I don't know what to say. I don't want to ignore it, because it seems like they would know I was intentionally avoiding the topic and I don't know how they would react to that. Should I try to sound chill like them or should I take a more serious tone? What should I tell them? I don't know what to do and I don't want them to be uncomfortable, we've been really vibing.

They say shit that I’m not ok with but I just ignore it. Now there saying rude shit to my face. One of them said that they wish I would just cut the depression shit and kms already. They are pretty fake to. I’m in a state of how do I make friends with other people at my college. It’s all online now and I don’t know what to do. There’s only one friend who hasn’t been rude to me and has always been there for me. Other then him there’s no one else I know. So how am I suppose to make friends? Also side question would I be going overboard to report them to there colleges because some of them go to other colleges out of state that are nice.

208,"I have very bad social anxiety. I’m good at my job and go above and beyond. I have to hit a certain level and work at a certain rate or I don’t get paid as much, and I run the risk of being replaced. I obviously can hit my production rate and get above it and beyond, but it still stresses me out sometimes. Also having to get used to new people coming in all the time since my parter switched jobs. It makes me nervous. Some weeks I may work 60 hours. Other weeks I may work 30 something or 40. But usually I have to work the longer weeks because of people constantly quitting/ getting fired/ bad management. After my job is done say after I work about 10 hours, the boss will usually ask me to load or do another job for 5+ hours and this wears me out and bores the heck out of me. My back suffers on days like that. I only work 4 days a week and the 3 day weekend is mainly what keeps me here. My net pay when taxes and everything is taken out is usually like $850 to $1100 depending on the weeks I have. I can live on $800 every 2 weeks. 

I love to drive and would love to just drive and get paid. I’d love to quit and door dash. I would only have to deal with a stranger for a few seconds on a delivery and make my money. I am introverted and have social anxiety. I really don’t like having to work with a parter all the time and working under a boss. If I could just quit and make $100 a day as a goal on Doordash 4 days a week I think I would be much happier. I wouldn’t feel like I always have to hit a production rate and have a boss drilling me or a parter slowing me down. It would just be me alone with my thoughts and I would be outside and not in a depressing building all day.

My marriage has a lot of issues, but I’m not completely miserable. And therapy will not fix our issues. So maybe I should just stay and save myself the pain of lifelong single motherhood. 

Our issues are his drinking, and we don’t have sex. He is also the least thoughtful and romantic person I’ve ever met. I don’t think he’s ever given me a gift or planned anything. He drinks every single day he is off, and he starts to become confrontational when drunk. He’s not at all affectionate or passionate. It’s not the worst marriage, but we fight at least once a week. And I can’t help wondering if something else is out there. 

I’m also interested in dating women if that matters. Not exclusively women, but I would like to try it out because I am bi and have never been with a woman and am more sexually attracted to women. How do lesbians feel about single mothers?

Over the past few years I’ve had a ton of long conversations with her about it and my view of it, and she’s been slowly coming around. Right now she thinks that it’s still wrong according to the bible, but that everyone is entitled to their own opinion/life and that it’s our job to love our neighbour regardless of their sexuality. 

During quarantine we’ve been binge watching shows and movies together. I’ve been trying to sneak in new shows that I know either have LGBTQ+ characters or talk about it at some point. We’ve watched Brooklyn 99 and we’re almost finished Stranger Things. She’s not having a bad reaction to characters coming out anymore.

What are some movies/shows that focus more on it? Especially ones that show the struggles they go through and the rejection they deal with?

Every time I try to make friends with someone it seems like there will be a spark in conversation at first but next time I try to talk to them I just can’t get anything going for some reason. I do want to keep trying, I won’t give up but I just don’t know what to do next. I feel like there’s something wrong with me or there’s just a fundamental piece of conversation I don’t understand. I’m open to taking just about anyone as a friend, even if we don’t have much in common. I also wonder why people don’t approach me first after I talk to them the time before. Why don’t people initiate with me? How can I make friends on the internet or otherwise?

He’s my brother’s friend, and he’s this smart, humorous, interesting guy who I’ve really started to like during these last few weeks. I think it’s important to add that I am his opposite in a lot of ways... You know, most movie cliches (I’m a dork and he’s cool, I’m a fan of english class and he’s a fan of math, etc). We like the same music, we preform similarly in school, and we have a nearly tantamount sense of humour, but that is just to name a few things. Lately, when he comes over (most weekends and occasionally after school) we have been making some pretty suggested eye contact. This is a new development. The age gap is admittedly a little peculiar, not to mention he is one of my brothers closest friend (either best or second best friend). Though, I honestly think it could work. There are two very frustrating problems with a relationship between us blossoming, A) I have never been in a relationship before therefore idk what I’m doing, and B) I am a complete wimp who won’t make the first move. How do I let him know that I have in infatuation for him, and get him to make the first move? Also, if he likes me how do I know? I’m a novice at anything related to romance. 

P.S. If anything notable between this boy and I develops, I will make sure to ask for my brother’s permission first. This is just a precaution, but he is pretty lax so I don’t think it will end up being an issue.",07Sep2020,1

As things progressed, he would suggest that I take off my top during video chat and if I refused, he would be uninterested in what I was saying, ignore me, and keep asking me to strip. He would punish me this way for enforcing my boundaries and it made me feel that if I wanted him to keep liking me and keep providing me with the attention I was craving, I needed to give in and take off my top. I broke up with him shortly after, but just realized a few weeks ago that I've maintained that fear with people I met on Tinder. If I don't send nudes, they won't like me.

He reached out after I posted something on a social media platform and we just kept in daily contact ever since. At times we watch shows together, spend hours on the phone, video chat, call each other at our lows, and we also tell one another about our love lives. At times in gory detail and we make fun of ourselves for it. 

But lately I've been relying on him so much for support and I get so emotional when I think he's finally going to declare his love for me, but instead it is a new girl. And I still talk to other men and hook up with them. Every time feeling empty and afraid to face my truth: that I fell in love with my friend. 

I'm so open to them and them to me that, I know about all of the girls he hooks up with. I always egg him on in an effort to hide my own, and encourage him to go for the one who will make him happiest. 

But he doesn't do the same for me. In fact he becomes spiteful and at times outright mean to me if I talk about other men. Insisting I don't date others until I am more secure with my own self image. Which is something I truly love about him, but I don't know if I should take it out of a place of love and knowing that I have a history of troubled relationships or a place of possessiveness.

234,"Sorry for any spelling mistakes, it's late and im too tired to read through.

I don't have mental health issues, which seems to be uncommon for people of my age in highschool. Most if not all my friends do, online or otherwise. They have issues or trauma. My mom's always called me a bleeding heart because i get si wrapped up in their issues i neglect my own. Really, this didn't bother me for a long time.

To keep this simple, i'm in a group chat with about 11-12 other people ages 12-16. We bonded over liking the same anime and have been actively chatting eith each other since march. I know these kids well, I've got a note open on my phone of their birthdays, allergies, and anything they've mentioned that i want to remember.

I'm seen as the ""authority"" role. I have admin powers and they unironically call me mom. This is because i give advice. I'd say I'm pretty good at advice, i've helped these girls through all kinds of things (school rejections, failed tests, homework, relationship troubles, breakups, confessions, regretted hookups, and lots more) so alot if not most of them feel comfortable coming to me and reaching out.

None of them live in the same country as me, and alot of their countries have bad stigma about mental health issues and going to therapy.

It feels nice to be depended on and im proud of them for trusting and reaching out to me but lately i...

Well I've always had a bit of trouble being the ""therapist friend"" and had to cut someone off because they only texted to talk about their issues then dipped once i gave them advice. It was exhausting so i just cut them off.

The issue really came into perspective for me when i was having a bad night... There was lightning and as a really paranoid person over simple things i was on edge and went to my groupchat for distraction. Making it as obvious as i could that i was having issues, none of them seemed to know how to help me.

I've asked for advice in the past, and they've been... Well a bit useless. That's why I've always understood that somehow I'm better at being able to help people through their problems and tell them what they need to hear at the right pace. They usually say ""i'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you"".

This night though, they kind of just went offline and left me, telling me to just go to sleep. I cried myself to sleep that night for the first time in... God i don't recall ever doing it other than that time. 

I started a journal since then, it's common advice that it can help with venting and it works for myself. Since then, the only things I've had to write about were the group chat. 

One night, one of the girls got drunk because she had period pains and was ""too tough to get painkillers"". I told her we'd talk about it soon but i am just so exhausted that I can't deal with it, I know it should be said and addressed and that she needs someone to tell her it, but I am just so... so fatigued. 

This chat makes me sad because i feel like they're a distance away from me. 

I feel obligated go be there for them as a steady precense. I know technicality I don't owe them it but i love these girls, I don't want them to deal with stuff on their own when i am here and i can talk to them.

But I'm so sick and tired of giving advice, every text message feels like a chore and even telling them that i am always there to listens feels... Wrong. 

I've dropped hints about my feelings but no one picks up on it. 

Why do I feel this way? How can i make this stop and go back to being compassionate without the burden. Distancing myself works and i feel fine most the time but only until i go back to the chat and feel bad again.

Leaving the chat isn't an option for me. It seems like the smart step to take, but i really do care about these people. I want to help them. I just don't know how to do so without feeling so... Bothered.",07Sep2020,1
235,"I (18f) broke up w boyfriend almost 2 months ago. We were together almost a year. 

While we were together he r*ped me, cheated on me with another girl IN MY BED... after we broke up I also found out that he’s racist, anti-semitic, and has also r*ped two other girls. 

How can I move forward? He knew I’d been assaulted by another guy before we’d gotten together, he pressured me into sex, and then just completely disregarded consent after the first time. 

I stayed so long because I guess it was a typical abuse situation, and he was really manipulative...I genuinely had no idea about the anti-semitism or racism...I think he knew I wouldn’t stick around if I saw that side of him. 

I’m really not sure how to move on. Just typing this I could throw up. I want to slash his tires and throw away everything I own and move to a different state because I’m so disgusted with his actions and with myself for tolerating it for so long.

I can’t participate in anything if I’m failing a class. Which is only band and a trivia team, but still...this is so so so bad. I’m such an idiot. How could I be so stupid? I had two weeks, but I waited till last minute like an idiot and only completed a bit less than half the work. My professor doesn’t accept late work. He doesn’t at all, no excuses, if there is a death it has to be immediate family and he needs a copy of the death certificate (I’m not even kidding) 

I’ve never had to do something like this before. Sure, I’ve taken intro to psych and sociology, but those are easy classes, and I had time in school set aside to do them. But now it’s COVID so I can’t even go and talk to the school counselor about my class, or anyone else for that matter. The teacher I would’ve talked to died last year. 

My time management sucks. I have procrastination issues. And what the hell, I’m lazy too. This is completely my fault. My parents are going to kill me. They are going to scream until they can’t anymore. I’ll probably only have my bed and clothes left in my room that I’m allowed to use. And because I’m an idiot they’ll probably get rid of my cat too. Because I’m irresponsible. And they don’t like him anyway. I don’t know what to do.

My principal calls kids who are failing to his office himself, at the same time each week. So everyone knows what it’s for. I’m supposed to be smart. I’m supposed to never even get a B+ in a class. It’s so bad. I know that other people have much worse problems...but for me, this is really really bad. 

I’ve been depressed since 5-6th grade, on medication since 8th, and it still isn’t going away. I still can’t get up in the mornings. Still can’t get things done when I should. That’s not an excuse though. Mental Health is never a good enough reason, obviously. I should just push through and do it anyway. My life isn’t that bad after all, so I have no reason to be anything but happy with good grades all the time. 

I have food, a room, clothes, nice stuff, pets, even “friends” I don’t even know if they count as “best friends” even if they are mine, or rather the only ones I have, I’m not theirs. Never will be. My parents will always be disappointed no matter what I do, but this is so bad. So so so bad. I can’t even blame it on no therapy for two months. Because obviously that isn’t a priority. It takes too much time to call in and set up an appointment, plus it isn’t free. So I get it. It isn’t important. But I can’t help but think this wouldn’t have happened if I’d actually been allowed to keep up with it, and maybe if I had a better therapist I’d have actually solved something in the four years I’ve been in therapy. 

But that’s just me trying to blame others, when it’s completely my fault. MY FAULT. IDIOT. 

God, it sounds ridiculous, but is it even worth it to keep trying? No matter what I do and try I always mess it up for myself. I don’t know why I bother trying at all.",07Sep2020,1
238,"Two years ago an older friend of mine (F) graduated high school and went to college at a local university. I can’t stop thinking about them and I’m finally realizing that they might be in trouble. When they left for college they started acting a bit weird. They stopped talking to all their friends and even their best friend who shared a dorm with them. They got a secret boyfriend and started to turn off their Snap-map at weird times. Now they pretty much don’t use social media at all. Their snap score increases by about 1 point every two weeks and they don’t use Snap-map at all. They also half talked to me a couple times over the past two years when I reached out, but then stopped answering at random times and then said that they loved me in a Instagram post a few weeks later. I know it sounds like they want to be left alone, but no one can really get ahold of them. They do post on their story sometimes, but nothing really of content, just black and white pictures of mostly unremarkable things. I’m just worried that they might be caught in something. What should I do?",07Sep2020,1
239,"So I know this should be a call the cops scenario. Anyway
I (16M) was awake about 45 minutes ago when strange sirens go off. They didn't sound like an emergency vehicle, and it wasn't moving. So being the dumb teen I am, I go on my bike to look. It was the local gas station itself making the noise (it's the middle of the night). I see 3 to 5 people by the gas pumps (gas station is about 2 blocks from my house). While I was going, I saw a truck go by (I assumed it was someone else checking it out, as you do in a small town) and didn't think much of it. But as I come back, I am in my driveway, and the same truck pulls up and slows down. He asked my if it what I saw and I told him just a couple of people. The alarming thing is that he didn't seem surprised that there were people who obviously tried/were still trying to break in. Also alarming, this guy now knows where a short 16 year old lives. I keep hearing every sound, and I'm thinking there's someone here. I have split feelings about this thing. I feel like I should call the police, but I feel like they were probably called since the building itself was alarming. But as far as I know, I've seen no cops. Also my dad would flip out if he knew I was out this late, plus he's be right. He says that I shouldn't go out because there are dangerous people. And in a place of 1000 people, literally no one is ever out, so I always argue him on that, and now lo and behold this happens.
Pls help me figure out what to do. And I don't know why, but I'm scared to call the cops.",07Sep2020,1

People:  xBFF,  hated girl (X), Me (OP) ((were all 16))

Before my xBFF dumped me we were really close. X had always gotten oh xBFF's nerves because she'd make fun of us for thinks we liked, but went to talk about how she liked them the next day. X also hung out with two girls that always talked behind xBFF and I's back.

About a month after online school stared i noticed that xBFF stared talking to me less and not talking about X in a bad manner. This didn't bother me at first bc I had gotten over X bc I'd be starting at a new school the next school year, but I noticed that xBFF stared talking me less and less. When summer stared we had almost completely stopped taking, but after my nintendo broke we stopped playing games and talking. I wanted to reconnect, so I suggested we hang out (safely bc miss rona)  but she made the ""I don't think my mom would let me"" excuse. This made feel angry and sad at the same time because she had posted pictures showing she had went hung out in a popular outdoor shopping center the day before. I replied saying ""You can hang out with X at \_\_\_\_ shopping center but you cant come over to my house? lol."" I know this is extremely passive and i regretted it, but my angry fingers got the best of me. xBFF got mad and keep to her argument, and she asked me ""why I was being so passive"" I just replied saying it wasn't meant to be mean I was just asking. We stopped talking after that... well actually thats a lie. She replied to my insta story asking me why I was posting instructions on how to make iron on bee light covers, and she asked ""why are you posting this at 11:00pm"" (she goes to bed early but its summer let me say up -\_-). I just texted ""no comment lol"" this ~~is~~ was our humor. She left me on seen. I haven't talked to her since. She has been hanging out with X almost every week and post pictures of herself and X having fun. Her whole personality has changed she went from someone who lived in the moment to an insta junky. She has also started designing and selling custom clothes with X. This wouldn't bother me if I didn't tell her I wanted to do the same thing before she dumped me. Honestly I'm feeling extreme jealousy because I just feel like I was dumped (...ig more like ghosted) with no explanation. Lately I've just felt like unfollowing them because it hurts me to see my xBFF just replaced me with someone she hated. It makes me think she never actually liked me. It makes me feel really sad bc I have an extreme attachment issues (my dad just up and left my mom out of the blue but thats another thing) being ghosted and replaced has made me shut down again. This also results in me acting like every things fine (ik i need therapy) nobody in my life knows how I feel. I want it this way, but I also want advice. So, Reddit what do I do about my xBFF.

Our upstairs neighbor moved in about 2-3 months ago and has started smoking lots of weed every single day to the point it even affected our AC, so we had to buy a many fans + an air purifier to prevent any more smell/smoke from it.  
My dad tried calling the police, but the only thing they got was a warning and nothing else. (We called them many times, but they still did nothing about it). We even tried to call the person who manages the apartments and still did nothing (they said they were gonna kick them out, but they never did at any point)  
It has gotten to the point where i'm getting sick and have a severe headache everyday from it, and it's unpleasant.

They usually start smoking weed mostly at 12 am - 5 am, and sometimes in the afternoon too. it's really annoying to wake up to the smell of weed sometimes. I always keep myself inside of my closet to prevent any smell (it doesn't have an AC, obv, and barely any smoke/smell comes from it)

256,"Our mutual friend (20M), John, has been a real one. He was worried about my cousin (19F) since she hasn’t responded to any of his texts or calls. John calls her and her bf(23M) answers her phone by saying that John is a racist and that she doesn’t want to speak to him. John gets a follow-up text from the bf but through my cousin’s phone. Her bf texts “please stop talking and texting my girlfriend we don’t want anything to do with you”. Afterwards, my cousin blocked John from all social media.

So John calls me and told me what happened. Now for the back story. I haven’t spoken to my cousin in over 2 weeks because she was disappointed in me. When she found out about her pregnancy, I was the first to know and she specifically said not to tell anyone. Well, I ended up telling my mom because I was disappointed in her. Long story short, through my mother, a few others found out, gave my cousin fake surprise reactions to her pregnancy news, and we stopped talking to give each other space to think. 

More back story. Her bf is half-black yet has mentioned he doesn’t like black folks. He even says the n-word with the hard r. He would also flirt with me and it made me feel so uncomfortable, which is why I stopped talking to him overall. This is where John comes into the story. Our friend John likes dark humor . I would consider him to be a closeted racist tbh but without it he’d be the ideal best friend. I love my friend John very much despite his racial insensitivity. My cousin is just like this too. Her bf too. And now out of nowhere they have decided to cut ties with John for being racist and insensitive when both my cousin and her bf have also been racist and insensitive. The way this friendship breakup is being handled is messy and hypocritical. 

So I decide to call my cousin after 2 weeks of silence. Her bf answered the call followed by her. She tells me that she won’t waste her energy on John anymore. That she’s happy with her bf. That it’s her life and her bf can say whatever he wants. And a bunch of other things that are not typical of her.

It’s crazy to think that John and her have been hanging out nonstop these past two weeks and now out of nowhere John is blocked without closure and answers. 

I’ve never liked her bf and I’m really conflicted on whether I should stop seeing my cousin for a while more, forever, or not. She’s pregnant and this is all a mess.

TL;DR: My pregnant cousin blocked our mutual friend out of nowhere for being racist and insensitive yet she and her bf have also been racist and insensitive.

He kicks him out, and last night we see a black car hanging out in front of the house. I told him I'm the wrong person to talk to, and freaked out by what he's saying. He gets extremely angry, refuses to talk about it, and yells at me before slamming the door. This used to be a friend of mine, and I'm at a loss with how to either repair the relationship or what I should do with this crazy information he shouldered me with.

My roommate, and friend of 9 years, has schizophrenia. And before her schizophrenia had become a real issue for her, we would talk all the time and share everything. And communicating had always been really easy. But since the onset of her schizophrenic symptoms, she's been struggling to communicate with me.

We got an apartment together about 2 months ago. I knew she had schizophrenia but it didn't seem to be something that would stop us from living together or cause issues. But now it's difficult to communicate. She doesn't respond to me as quickly anymore and when she does, it's in short phrases that only leave me with more questions. It's been rough living with her. I'm trying to be sympathetic to her mental health. 

And I guess that's what prompted me to open the diary she left sitting on our table. I wanted to understand her more. She said before that she wants to communicate with me better but there's been no real changes in how we do. 

She has told me about her schizophrenic symptoms, but never the specifics. Reading the entries in her diary gives me insight into what she's not telling me. 

And I completely understand that this is a breach of her privacy. But she never told me she's scared of the dark now. So now I've been leaving a light on for her when she gets home at night. I want to be a better friend. 

I'm not reading her diary just to snoop. I'm not telling anyone the specifics in her diary. I just want to see what's bothering her so maybe I can make it easier for her.",07Sep2020,1

There’s a thin white line on the back of the bag that has two seams on either side. Those seams were leaking the juice from the bag. So I’m pretty sure it was opened and I didn’t notice when I bought it.

269,"Ok I know it's insane to take in a wild rat...but hear me out here. Yesterday we spotted this little guy/lass in our driveway laying on it's side. Thought it was dead, but went to have a look. It was breathing and didn't have any obvious signs of injury. We left it for a few hours because, well..rat. But it was just laying there all helpless and wide eyed and we had to do something! We dripped a bit of water on its face and it became a lot more alert. It sat up and kinda tried to get the water off with its front paws in that cute rodent-y way. Its body stayed a little twisted though. We scooped it into a box (no, we didn't touch it with our hands), with some cat food and a dish of water, a tea towel for warmth, and some shredded kitchen roll because idk, rat stuff? It survived the night! It hasn't moved much, but it's still breathing and sat upright. We didn't expect it to live, we just wanted to give it a chance. And now we don't know wtf to do with it? I definitely don't think he's well enough to be released into the wild yet, so I need advice please. What do rats even eat? Should I put him in like a plastic box with holes instead of cardboard? Is he getting cold being in that box outside? Should I seek therapy for rescuing a wild rat? Help!

270,"I’ll try and keep this short, but there’s a lot of things I want to cover to make sure I am as accurate as possible. I’ve had this friend (F, 20s) I’ve known since my freshman year of HS (now in college), and I (also F, 20s), have always been a bit of a doormat. I’ve gotten over it for the most part, except when it comes to her. I’m so used to letting her do and say things to me or others because I’m afraid of pissing her off. Now, I mainly don’t want to cause any strife between my other friend (M, 20s) because they’re now close as well. I always tend to go through bad shit; as most people do which is why I tend not to bitch about things more than once, and I’ve tried coming to her for help but she either cuts me off, will be on her phone, or completely ignore what I’m saying. Normally I wouldn’t care, but I do everything for her. I’m pretty much her go-to when she needs a ride or an ear, which I am always happy to lend. It’s been getting on my nerves more and more lately because her issues are always very repetitive and she refuses to take advice from others so those things keep happening. Again, I’m always happy to lend an ear and a shoulder for her but, finding out that she has told a friend of mine that I don’t shut up about (a certain event, that I have only ever mentioned 3 times) when I barely even get the chance to talk. She’s done a lot of things that’s fucked me over in different ways and I’ve always forgiven them. I’m aware that this is a stupid ass thing to do, I just don’t have the energy to deal with anymore childish drama that she absolutely will start if I bring up anything with her. She’s very good at playing the victim and not taking responsibility, making excuses, blaming, etc. I am just getting so tired of getting hurt, even though I know she doesn’t do it intentionally, she just doesn’t understand how she comes off or what she says because she’s incredibly self involved. I’m not sure what to do. It’s been 6 years and it only gets worse overtime. I feel like I shouldn’t take the shit and just deal with whatever petty drama and rumors she’d start, but I feel like an awful person for even feeling that way. I’m just a bit stuck, I don’t know what to do about the situation. Any advice would be helpful. My apologies for the long rant and if this is a stupid situation to even ask about.",07Sep2020,1

I feel like this shows that she doesn't really want to message me. With quarantine i know she has pretty much nothing going on so I know she's not usually busy with anything

What do I do? I feel like I'm bothering her by messaging her but if I dont put in the effort for our relationship, it'll end.

My (24m) much younger sister has been very involved in internet culture (memes, youtube, anime) and has joined discord servers based on her interests.

It was a guy from another country in a smaller discord server with her and a couple of her (similarly aged) friends. I got super creeped out by that and am just wondering if that's normal? Should I be worried? Should I do something? If I told my parents they would likely ban her from using phone/pc for weeks and that would be pretty upsetting I'm sure.

279,"We used to live in my moms boyfriend’s house and I hated it so much he was controlling and strict. And on top of that he didn’t like my younger brother but for some odd reason my mom never really saw it or if she did she didn’t talk to him about it, maybe a few time but never change the way he treated my brother. 
Over time they started arguing a lot and there were times we stayed at a hotel because he kicked us out the house or would stay with my aunty a few days then go back. We started looking for a new house but never found one. 

Finally after 5 years living like that and looking for a new house, we found one and we recently moved into it but just us and not her bf she told us she was done with him because he was controlling and never helped her with anything (bills etc.) Recently she had been acting off and one night she left saying she was going over his house because he wanted to see his daughter before he left out of town. So she went and didn’t come back till 6 am. I know this bc my sister woke up to turn in the ac. I was so frustrated bc how can you be talking about being done with then man and then go spend the night with him. 

The next day comes around and she’s in a bad mood talking about I can’t us her car bc it’s under his insurance and everything, so me and my sister go off because she’s barely home because she’s with him. So we get into this big argument and she leaves. 

I haven’t seen her or my younger brother and sister for about 3 days. I can’t believe this is happening to me right now I can’t believe she picked him over us, knowing that I’ve already gone through this once when my bio dad left me at a young age for his gf . She told me she would never do something like that but it’s exactly what she did. 

Currently they’re at the beach I know this bc I had hw location to her old phone which he had taken away. But today the turned it off I’m assuming they found out I knew where they were at. 

I’m just really heart broken and can’t believe this is happening to me again. I just feel like I’m never worth loving. I’m never good enough and will never be good enough if my own biological parents don’t love me why would anyone else ?",07Sep2020,1
280,"I’m going to try to keep this short but it might end up a little long. For background, I am 17F and I work at a grocery store. I have been working there for almost 2 years. Since I’m a minor the only position I can do is one where I bag groceries, clean messes, push carts in, etc. 

I’ve had my typical job issues, such as them not respecting my hours and availability. I am in high school and working under a work permit. It’s obviously not really right that they would make me work more hours, and schedule me times I can’t be there. Then expect me to bend over backwards to fix it. I feel any job I could get at my age, and experience level would have issues like this. No job is perfect, there will be good days and bad days. So my only issue with my job was the hours/availability. It has caused some issues with school in the past. I’m still doing well in school but it definitely was a challenge. 

Things really changed at the start of the pandemic. I think we all know that tensions are high. Ever since April I have had three major instances of harassment that has resulted in the police being called. 

The first one being at the very beginning of the pandemic when masks first started being required, social distancing, etc. Our store started putting two people in my position outside at all times. Part of our job if we were out there was to ensure that all customers were wearing masks and not bringing in reusable bags. (as it spreads more germs) One lucky day a man tried coming in the store with his reusable bags, but he was wearing a mask. I politely told him “Unfortunately sir we’re not allowing reusable bags inside the store at this time” he walked back into the parking lot. Then he comes back up without his bags but with Lysol. He then sprayed me in the face with Lysol. His face was covered. He was never identified and got away. The problem is my work didn’t do anything about it. The managers didn’t answer our pages fast enough because they thought it was just an angry customer who didn’t get their sale price. They didn’t want to call the police as they felt it was a lost cause. They didn’t offer me any help what so ever. They didn’t ask about my eyes. I had to ask to go home early. Then my manager called later and offered me a measly $10 off gift card for the store. My mom was the one who called the police. My mother wasn’t happy. 

I’ll try to keep the other two incidents short. The second time was around Father’s Day and went into last month as a customer kept harassing me. My place of work didn’t do anything about it. Initially saying they can’t kick him out of the store and he’s welcome to shop here. Again, my mother called the police, the store didn’t really care. 

The third incident was today, and my emotions are still strong about it but I’ll try to keep it short. The carts are hard to make turns with as the wheels are fixed in place and don’t rotate. So when you’re pushing a row of them it’s hard to make a sharp turn. You have to make wide turns instead. We have a safety guidelines that we can only push a certain amount at the time. I was only pushing that amount which is very doable. As I was straightening out from a wide turn with a row of carts, a car in the front of the parking lot (I was in the back)was backing out. The car started coming my direction pretty fast. The driver was obviously looking at their phone. I try quickly moving the carts to the other side of the parking lot but they do not make those turns well. There was no way I was moving fast enough. The car was too close. I just started yelling watch out yet the driver was still looking down. Of course they hit their side mirror on my carts. All things considering it turned out better than it could have been. There was no visible damage that I saw. The person stopped their car still looking down. Got out and was on the phone they said something along the lines of “I’ll deal with you later now I have someone else to deal with.” And hung up on them. This person then started yelling and asked my name, which I told them. Then they started using my name and saying threats such as “I’m going to ruin your life so fucking bad” etc. I stated that we can go inside and talk to the manager to get this resolved. They wouldn’t have it. They said “no I’m not going to do that, I’m going to fuck up your life so much worse than that, you don’t even know” I kept stating we can go talk to the manager, yet this person kept threatening me. They made comments about physically fighting me, and saying they’ll ruin my life so bad I’d wish I was dead. Kept saying they had worse things in mind when I kept repeating “let’s go talk to the manager” they drove off as another customer asked if I needed help. I was worried, as the customer made it evident they didn’t care about insurance or money, but instead wanted personal revenge that sounded violent. I immediately talked to the managers. It turned out they DID call them immediately to say they wanted money and said I completely destroyed the entire side of their car. My work didn’t care about the persons threats to me and cared more about the accident. My mother was flaming mad that this person threatened my life. The way she see’s it too, is that if I also hadn’t noticed the car coming they could have hit me instead. My mother called the police. 

These are just the major incidents in these past months during the pandemic. My job isn’t perfect. I do love the people there, and I do generally love my job. It pays pretty well, and I’ve been there so long. I’ve had some experience in a different department there as they were desperate for help at one point. It doesn’t deal with customers as much or the front end. They made it clear they’d love to have me back there when I’m 18 in a couple months. They can easily work with my hours, and I’d even be getting a raise. I just feel like if I hold out it will be better. After today though my mother is adamant that I need to quit as they obviously don’t care about my well being. That I have better things to be doing. I could find another job but I’d be jobless for a little bit. I could pay my bills for a little bit with my savings. Still I’m just not completely sure it’s the best option. What I’m asking you, the community, what would you do if this was you, or your daughter? Would you quit? If you’ve gotten to this sentence, thanks for reading my rant. Any advice is appreciated.",07Sep2020,1

I was adopted at 14 months and I had a lot of mental health issues growing up, without even realizing it until I was in high school. I’m 21 now and looking back on how my parents raised me I want to see if any type of thing they did was a form of abuse. I’ve always blocked these memories out but sometimes they really bother the hell out of me when I think about it. 

-whenever I would have a tantrum, I never knew how to calm myself down. so I freaked out more and was always told I had “anger issues” I don’t have anger issues (anymore?) when I would get “out of control” my mom would cross my arms and make me sit on the chair and force me there until I cooled down.

-my dad would purposely lock me in my room until I stopped crying

-if I did something/say something bad, sometimes my dad would throw his pillows at my head 

-My dad would also force me to go to the kitchen sink and pull my head under the faucet and turn the water on 

-if i was throwing a fit as a kid in the car my dad would pull his hand back and pinch my leg for what it seemed like forever 

-they would spank my butt with wooden or metal serving spoons or with their hands

Even later in the day, hours after I've thrown, the pain is still there on the inner/middle part of my elbow when I twist it. I'm not sure if it is bone, tendon, or ligament that is the source.

292,"So a little bit of backstory, ever since the 2018 Winter Olympics, I have been interested in learning how to ice skate for fun. I frequently watched videos of older people learning it and I thought that I would give it a try. In 2019 (I was 15) I decided to go with my family to a local rink to try it out. I immediately connected with the sport and it felt so natural to be on the ice even if I was only making small strides. For the first hour everything was fine but then while trying a spin I fell and the instructor accidentally hit my finger with his boot. I was a coward and had to work up the strength to tell someone, but by the time I could inform my parents it was too late to make a complaint. My finger was only 1/4ish cut so it was not too bad; however, I still wanted an apology. When I went to the front desk the lady immediately began being super rude and was condescending towards us when all we wanted was an apology. None of them would own up to this and I just felt useless. Because of this, every now and then I think of this incident and just want to cry. I know I sound stupid and that I should just let this go, but that moment replays in my mind every time I think of ice skating. I want to actually learn the sport so badly but now I’m afraid that I can never fulfill this dream.

294,"So my boyfriend (25M) told me (23F) he had a surprise for me coming this month. It just kept bothering me not knowing what it was so I went through his email on his phone and found a confirmation for a purchase from an online boutique from one of my favorite influencers. I was honestly kinda impressed with this surprise until I looked at what he picked out. First was a bright yellow floral strapless jumpsuit that I already know won’t flatter my body type and is basically already out of season. Second was a yellow handbag. (Yellow is my favorite color but not to wear, especially not in the fall.) Lastly he picked out a bralette that has a pretty high chance of not fitting me. I’m really happy that he tried to pick things out for me but I’m SO picky when it comes to my wardrobe, I only even own maybe like 50 clothing pieces overall because I like to have minimal yet versatile outfits. The colors and styles he chose aren’t even my style and if I ever wear it, it will probably only be once just to make him happy. The worst part about this whole situation is that he paid FULL PRICE, coming out to about $150 for only 3 items. This was supposed to be one of his gifts to me for our anniversary so the fact that he spent quite a bit of money on something I probably won’t use much makes me feel so bad. Should I tell him the truth so he can just cancel the order for a full refund? (If the items arrive and we choose to return it later then only 2 of the items will qualify for a return since the bralette is considered an intimate item.

He messages me everyday asking me if I want to play on the server, and for the last few days I've been saying things like ""i have homework"", etc.

297,"I  am a 29F and always knew I had a ""creepy uncle"", but today, I found out  it was not just limited to the creepy behaviours I thought (nibbling on  ears, sitting too close during movies) and that he actually crossed the  line from creepy to assault on multiple occasions.

My  sister (31F) confided in me today that, one night after she finished  work, he offered to drive her home but instead drove her to a secluded  lake. Once there, he began talking about ""female hygiene"" and began  touching her vagina.

After hearing  this, many moments from my memory just ""clicked"" and I am certain he  has done this to at least another of my sisters and to several of my  cousins, both male and female.

Needless  to say, I am enraged. He never came near me during my youth, though I  distinctly remember him trying, because I was always naturally repulsed  by him even as a young child and said ""no"" to his every attempt to give  me candy, toys,  money, and to get me alone (which I now understand to  be grooming). My sisters and cousins, though, are much sweeter than I am  and not nearly as loud-mouthed.

Now.  All this would be bad enough, but he is now an elementary school  teacher and I shudder to think of the damage he could do (and probably  already has done) to other young kids. I said to my sister that I'm  sorry, but I have to call the school (and possibly the police) and let  them know of his past behaviours, though I promised I wouldn't mention  her name. She flipped out (understandably) and is begging me not to,  because she feels she will be inevitably dragged into this (which again  is making me suspect that she knows he has done this on an even bigger  scale than she's letting on). She is also worried that, because he is  married now with 4 kids to support, this will ruin his career.

AITA  for planning on calling the school to let them know they are employing a  pedophile, even though he never abused me, and my sister, whom he did  abuse, is asking me not to, for fear of having her secret exposed? And  AITA for not giving a shit that this may ruin his career?

Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated.",07Sep2020,1
298,"Hey, so I (18)f am currently living with my boyfriend (20)m and his family and have been for almost a year now. I didn’t have the best relationship with my parents and we get along so much better now that I’m not living with them although still rocky. I’ve suffered with anxiety and depression for a while now and my boyfriends parents are aware of this. We’ve had the occasional conversation in the past which usually results in his mum dismissing that mental illness is a real thing. Anyway so they had been pushing for me to get a job so I could pay rent and live there permanently. Only problem is my anxiety is still very bad. I got a job but after being there for a week, we went into lockdown. I struggled for that week but was proud of myself for doing it. Lockdown was quite difficult for my mental health and I also lost my grandad which had an effect on me and now that we are slowly returning to before my anxiety is still really bad. I’ve had a few time’s when my anxiety has caused me to have panic attacks and some really bad days making me unable to work. Instead of being supportive through these times his mum has basically been telling me that I’m giving up with life and I can’t live here if I’m not gonna work. I don’t want to bore you with the details but she makes me feel as though I am lazy and not going to work because of that when in reality she just doesn’t understand my anxiety and I really wish she would. I guess I just need some advice on how we can form a better relationship and help her understand without being so aggressive.

I really need help, please. If you read this, please. This post on Reddit is my hope I'm having a thing I don't know how to describe. It has been a thing since 4 years.

I have a voice in my head that keeps telling me how what I did could harm me and my family. It keeps telling me that the thing I'm currently doing I previously had did it in the past, and it had a few bad effects. It makes me abruptly change what I'm doing and proceed with something that is unique. It continues to talk to me everytime. When I hear crow cry, it reminds me the day before my mom committed suicide. Like affecting how I eat, affecting which words I type one after another, which youtube video not to click on at a particular time of the day. I have no one to talk about this. My friends won't understand they recommend chilling out, I tried, I just can't. My facial expressions right now feel like it's a bad sign. Everytime an activity comes up, it reminds me about anything that had happened in the past, and i feel like I shouldn't do it.

I had been like this since four years now. My marks got lower and lower since then. The first year this begin, it was 80, now it's near 50. My relationships, friendship everything got bad. The voice keeps reminding me not to do things, else it happen again. But it keeps making my life bad. My stepmom committed suicide due to quarrel (after my exams in March). Recently exam results got out and I just failed in 1 subject in board exams. This voice inside me is turning everything bad. 

While I'm typing the voice is telling me don't.

On Saturday I had breakfast with my mom and when I asked her where my sister was she told me my sister was busy with her kids, that's when I said no and told my mom what was really going on, to say the least she wasn't happy.

Later on Saturday afternoon when I was at home my mom called to yell at me because apparently me and my sister ""talked"" about me taking her kids for awhile, When I told mom that wasn't true she didn't believe me and said since I'm the oldest I should look after my younger sisters kids for awhile, I was pissed, I drove over to my sisters house with her kids and knocked loudly on the door a couple times, She was home but she ignored me so I took the kids back with me, My boyfriends mom offered to look after them but I told her it wasn't her responsibility and she understood. Saturday night my boyfriend said to give my sister 24 hours to come collect her kids or we would call CPS, So I texted my sister, she ignored me once again but complained to my mom.

Early Sunday morning my mom showed up to yell at me and make it clear I wasn't her daughter if I called CPS, I explained to her me and my boyfriend don't have the space, the kids were either sleeping on the couch or the floor and we both have busy work/life schedule, My mom didn't seem to care and told me to make time, I then asked her why she couldn't take the kids and she pretty much dismissed that idea altogether.

Since then the kids are still with us, apart of me doesn't want to call CPS because of how much I love them but there is nobody else and my sister has pretty much abandoned them.

Should I just call CPS and cut all contact with my family or do I just leave the kids with my mom and sister?",07Sep2020,1

I installed Steam and launched it. I remembered my sign-in info so that was no problem, but then it told me I had to have a special code to get onto my account. Except, the email associated with my Steam account was permanently deleted... so I click, “I’m not receiving a Steam Guard Code” and then I click, “Verify and update my email address”.  I try to enter in the old email, but it says I have to do a ReCaptcha... I then proceed to successfully do the 10 ReCaptchas and it kept saying, “are-Enter the characters to prove your humanity!”.

315,"In 10th grade, my school 'dropped' me from their roster after I missed about a month of school. I was in a wheelchair because I could hardly walk and I was in serious pain. Turns out I have a tumour (non cancerous) pressing on my femoral nerve. I'm getting it surgically removed in a few weeks.

Anyway, I only found out over a phone call and a report card where I was given 2 D's and 4 F's. When my mom tried to explain that it was medical issues keeping me away, they didn't care. They basically said that I either went to an alternative school or be held back a year. So I went to the alternative school. 

In just one year, I managed to recover all the credits I missed, and complete every class I needed for 11th grade and 12th grade. My counselor suggested that I petition to graduate early so I just kept doing classes. I finished almost every class the alternative school had to offer. I now have 21 of the 22 credits required to graduate.

Here's the problem: When I brought up graduating early, the school officials shut me down with a hard no. No explanations other than ""Students at [my school] don't graduate early."" 

So now I'm in my senior year but I only need to take a senior level math class and repeat senior english since it has to be done during senior year. I just found out that in order to stay enrolled I need to be taking 6 classes a semester. But I only need math and english so they literally want me to do the classes I need and fail the others. That would be 4-5 F's for all 3 semesters. 

What do I do? I have no idea how I'd explain that to a college without sounding crazy. And moreover, I don't want to do that. I've struggled enough with the gap in my transcript from 10th grade. Adding on all those F's would sink my GPA and tank my chances at any college.

330,"So, I'm moving out in about a month. Out of fear, I've neglected to tell my parents.

I've been toying with the idea of moving out since I was 18, coming close to it on the rare occasion. As a Latin immigrant it's pretty traditional to stay home until you're older. However, I'm 25 now I just graduated university, and I'm starting a descent new job soon. My partner and I have had plans of moving in together for the better part of three years, but it has become increasingly more and more difficult to tell my parents. The writing is on the wall but I have trouble bringing it up because any time that I do anything nice at home I'm met with remarks such as, ""you better not be doing that because you're moving out"". 

My mother in particular always seems to have a particular problem with anything I do. Or anyone I'm around. Recently, I've been having issues with her neglect to do anything productive. Rather choosing to come to me for ""help,"" which usually consists of me just doing it for her. For years now I've been trying to teach her how to do simple tasks such as paying her credit card online, but she's gone as far as telling me that she doesn't have to learn since I'm around. My father never wants to be involved with anything so he just coasts along with whatever she says. 

Any time in the past that I have brought up the idea of moving out. I'm met with a barrage of retaliation. Everything from ""people who move out aren't successful,"" to ""you'll wind up having kinds and not amounting to anything,"" to ""you hurt your brother's feelings,"" to ""we need to stay together because we're immogrants and family.""  At this point I'm sick of being guilt trip. It feels right down abusive and manipulative. Now that I'm older I'm seeing that's it might be the  hurting me, and I can't seem to find any compromise. It feels that it's their way or no way.

331,"Hi all,

A throwaway account because I know she uses Reddit and don't want her to see this just yet.

This is sort of long, because I'm not sure what's important or not. TL;DR at the end to try to summarize

A little background:
We always wanted to move in together. We've been best friends since early high school, and have stayed close all these years. Last year, I moved across the country for work. She finally felt ready to leave and join me. We got an apartment together last month, and I drove back to pick her up and help her move here. We've both had depression most of our lives, but she has found great comfort and improvement from reading buddhist texts/practicing buddhism. However, she does still suffer from anxiety/depression, and is a recovering bulimic and alcoholic.

I knew this would be a hard move on her, as she was always living with/taking care of her mother (who has a whole host of mental and other health issues), or living with her older brother, who she's always been very close to. She's never been on her own, and often complained that she wanted to grow up more, be more independent, but felt like her family enabled her poor behavior/suffocated/babied her. 

We discussed how the move would give her an opportunity for more independence while still having some support (me)/a safety net. We also were prepared for it to cause a depressive episode, and likely some significant loneliness from suddenly being away from family. We made sure to have enough in savings combined for about 6 months of bills, just in case things got bad with the pandemic and she couldn't find work, but she was prepared to work generic minimum wage jobs just to make ends meet. She's worked unpleasant, low-paying jobs before; it's nothing new to most of us.

We figured worst case scenario, we'd discover we really can't stand living together, it'll ruin our friendship, but we'll stick it out for a year and then the lease is up. We're both functioning adults, right? 

We moved in together and things were going as expected/prepared for. She had trouble finding motivation to update her resume, so it took her about a month (and a lot of help from her family and I) to get her to start applying. Recently, she got an interview, nailed it, and got a job offer in management at a grocery store making near my hourly rate. She's been up and down with depression, but making an effort to stay active, do yoga, eat right, stay in communication with her family, etc. I noticed and commented on her lack of memory being sort of concerning - she'd sometimes forget things we talked about in the car moments before, or not remember what we were doing that day despite having discussed it the night before. But depression can negatively affect your memory, so we figured that's all it was, and we got a calendar and an app we could share between our phones to stay on a schedule so she doesn't miss meals, general tidying up, etc.

In the past few days things went downhill fast. I was at my boyfriend's for a couple nights, and she admitted to having a depressive episode so warned me things would be messy when I came home. No worries, we can work through it, I understand depression. She's been talking to an online international friend frequently and said he was helping her feel better.

I came home a few days ago and noticed weird behavior. She almost seemed high? Euphoric? She couldn't stop talking and being physically affectionate, and honestly I was so surprised by the change that I don't remember the topic she was talking about even though she held me in place for almost half an hour. I kept asking if she was okay and she'd tell me she was ""amazing.""

I just chalked it up to some sort of post-depressive euphoria, with the possibility that maybe she did get high and wasn't telling me yet. I went to go to bed, but she'd moved into/trashed my room while I was gone. I was upset, so I moved her things into the hallway in front of her room and decided to talk to her about that in the morning when I was more calm and she was in a better state.

The next morning I get up and she's up much earlier than expected (I'm typically up around 7 and she's up around 10-11). More nonstop bizarre talking, feeling ""amazing,"" enthusiastic speeches on the state of society/oppression of women in the US. She's begun calling me ""baby,"" which is a term of endearment I've never heard in our ten years together. Hugs are long and frequent, and she's kissing me on the forehead, cheeks.

She's confused, and can't remember conversations we had even half an hour ago. She's not sleeping well, though general insomnia or night-owlishness is common with her. 

A friend comes over for dinner. He notices and comments on her ""stream of consciousness"" sort of talk to me later, as she dominated the entire dinner with rambling stories that were sometimes interrupted by long moments of confused silence as she forgot what she was saying/where the story was going. 

She's crying a lot, which sometimes seems to be the start of a panic attack, but she keeps saying are ""tears of happiness."" 

She asked me last week to take her shopping to get clothes for her new job (which was supposed to start today), but that shopping trip yesterday was near impossible.

I had to help her get ready. She gripped my hand and arm tightly almost the entire time. I had to remind/guide her through how to look at tags to find her size on the shelf. I had to tell her what to get (luckily she'd told me earlier what she wanted, and I made her write it down). At one point she stopped in the middle of the store, doing that half-crying from ""happiness"" thing again, kissing me and hugging me in a way that was really uncomfortable, calling me her ""dear girl."" I had to help her put on the shoes to try sizes because she wasn't capable. At some point while she was on the floor in the store with shoes, she told me she was ""a 3 year old"" and that I was ""her mom."" 

For the past couple days she's talking about being unable to work because she's ""nearing enlightenment"" and has to write a book. She's going to call them and quit before she's even started, she says. She is talking a lot about being persecuted by the government/society due to being female/poor/only ""white passing"" (her grandparents on her dad's side are Puerto Rican). She's talking about moving to Sweden with her internet friend (who is now her first boyfriend). She's mumbling and shuffling around a lot, and keeps pressuring me to talk to him/read her conversations with him so I ""won't be scared"" for her and will""understand"" that she ""can't be stopped.""

She keeps talking about her tarot card reading from 3 years ago and how it predicted that this man would come into her life, and that I need to talk to him.

She just came into my room while I was sleeping in the middle of the night and turned on all the lights insisting I wake up so she can talk to me. She then made a lot of symbols/hand gestures, only about half of which were actual sign language, as a way of explaining that she's ""having a religious experience"" and telling me how she won't work for ""them.""

I know we never have lived together before, but this behavior is still completely out of character for her. I feel like she's a different person. I thought I would wait a week or two to see if she comes back to reality before calling her brother and asking for help, even though he's on the other side of the country, but I don't know if this is needing immediate attention or not or what to do.

(As a superstitious side note, we did just move into a classic 100+ year old ""haunted house"" complete with a suicide rope hanging from the rafters in the attic, weird noises, slamming doors, extra deadbolts on certain doors for seemingly no reason, etc. It's the middle of the night and I'm freaked out so maybe that's why my mind is jumping to ""she's been possessed"")

Neither of us have health insurance or can afford much in the way of medical treatment. She thinks things are going great and doesn't understand that her behavior is concerning. I will have to get a second full time job soon to support us if she can't function. I don't want to be critical of her first relationship, and I never read their conversations, but I worry her internet friend is exacerbating her mental state. 

I'm doing what I can to keep her hydrated, make sure she's eating, offering support and a safe, stable place for her to work this out, but I don't know what to do. Should I wait it out a week or two to see if she comes back to normal? Should I call her brother tomorrow? Is it a violation of her privacy/our friendship for me to call her brother and tell him all of this? 

I dunno guys, I'm tired and stressed and scared and can't sleep because of her weird noises. I'm worried about her. I'd really appreciate some advice or any insight you have.

TL;DR: my roommate suddenly started acting insane and I can only financially/emotionally support her for only a few more months. Is she possessed? Should I call her family across the country to help me take care of her, or am I violating her privacy and our friendship by doing that? When should I do something?",07Sep2020,1

We both got a little drunk but, because we were sharing a hotel room, we weren’t worried about getting home, so were out Quite late.

When we got back to the hotel room my friend went into the bathroom to get ready for bed. I just stripped down into my boxers and took my shirt off, and got into bed.

Next morning I got up and went to the toilet and my friend made a comment “oh you’re not wearing pyjamas”, which I thought was a bit odd. I replied “I haven’t worn pyjamas since I was 4....” and we never spoke of it again.

333,"I’m currently in college very far away from home. Everyday I want to leave. College isn’t really the place for me, and the career i will get from my major isn’t important to me at all.

I don’t care much for academics but my parents sure do. Basically I want to pursue a career in music. I know, it isn’t practical. But I am so passionate about it and I honestly think I can make good music. I’d even be ok with making 30k a year as long as I’m doing something that makes me happy.

334,"So this might sound odd at first but hear me out, my girlfriend and her sister are both around my age, they both live with their parents and I visit nearly every day. My Girlfriends sister has OCD, Anxiety and some other associated mental health conditions. At first when I came over to visit my girlfriend, she (gf's sister) would stay in her room. I never even saw her until around 3 years ago, but my girlfriend never formally introduced us which I am a bit upset about. Now, 3 years after we first ""met"" without really acknowledging each other, she is a lot more comfortable when I come over, she will have dinner with us and stay in the living room, but we still never speak. 

I really would like to have a conversation with her, occasionally when I visit my girlfriend, I will say hello and she might say hello back or wave at me awkwardly, but I still feel that we are so far away from actually having a conversation. She talks to her other family members while I am over and she smiles a lot so I really don't think that she would be uncomfortable if I talked to her, but my own social awkwardness definitely puts a brick wall between the possibility of having a conversation.

It has gotten to the point where I have recurring dreams of her and I having basic conversation, I feel like once I talk to her I can stop those dreams and that it will release some awkwardness, as well as make us both a new friend. 

Some additional information, although she does seem happy and comfortable when I come over, her condition is quite severe, she never leaves the house and doesn't really talk to anyone other than her family, as they don't have friends or visitors over either (other than me).

338,"I'm 21 and I've been wanting to buy a car for a while now, but my dad doesn't want me to buy a car. I would be buying it with my own money that I have saved up and do not plan on getting any financial assistance from my parents whatsoever (unless something comes up that I absolutely cannot cover). 

Growing up, my dad worked in my grandpa's auto shop so he knows a fair amount about cars, but thinks that he knows absolutely everything. The car model that I want is not one that he's worked with before or knows a lot about, but I have researched a lot about it and know what to look for compared to my dad. I didn't spring this idea on my parents all of a sudden, I brought it up a long time ago because I'm trying to plan for the long term. If I want to be able to get a decent job, I have to be able to drive to it and he knows that. My mom supports me buying a car because she knows I'm an adult and that I've worked hard for it, but my dad doesn't seem too receptive to the idea. My mom has offered to give me some more money to buy a car, but I don't plan on taking her up on the offer because she wants me to buy a new car and it's just not in my budget right now. She's also offered to just go out with me to look at the cars I'm interested in, but that would mean taking time off of work and I don't want her to take on another burden because of everything she's already doing to keep my family financially afloat.

My dad keeps saying that owning a car and driving is a privilege, but I feel like I have more than enough earned that privilege. I have been working ever since I was in high school and all throughout college, I'm responsible and get good grades (+ graduating college early), and I volunteer in a research lab and two health clinics. He keeps talking about all of the car trips he'd take with his friends growing up and all of these different life/job experiences and wonders why I don't have any of these, but I can't because of how much he's been limiting me from these. I have enough money to get a decent used car that I plan on buying from some private seller. When I was in high school and living with only my mom, she was happy to drive me to work/extra curriculars/volunteer commitments because she wanted me to be successful and happy. When my dad moved back in with us after being laid off from his last job, he acted like it was a chore to drive me to all of these things even though he was the only one preventing me from driving (I had a license but he did not want to add me onto our car insurance just yet). I had to miss out on a lot of stuff because of this, so now I'm scrambling to make up for lost time on volunteering and work experience because of him and it's pushing my future plans back (I am pre-med). I have a new full-time job (which starts soon) that I need a car for commuting to-and-from work + responding to disaster calls with little notice. I can't be asking my dad to drive me to work every day as I'm going back to where I live for college at the end of the month and it's just not a reasonable option anymore (not that it ever has been).

I actually have less money in my budget to buy a car than I originally would have liked, but my dad has taken thousands of dollars from my bank account over the span of a couple of years and hasn't paid it back (I had a joint bank account with him since I opened it when I was younger). I opened a new bank account that is only for me and put all my money in there to start new. I left whatever money I had left in my original bank account for random expenses or for my dad because I've just accepted it's a lost cause trying to get all of it back. For some background context, my dad unofficially retired early after working hundreds/thousands of miles away from our family because of some financial difficulties we had growing up. My family is okay financially now, but him not trying to find another job for the past five years has put a bit of a strain on us because my mom is the only one working in our family besides me and the cost of living in our area is high. I try to be understanding because of what my dad put himself through to keep our family afloat growing up, but it's hard to now because of how demanding he is of my mom and the fact that he just spends his days playing games on his phone instead of looking for a job like he's been telling us. Even though he doesn't do much during the day, he still acts like it's a chore when I ask him to drive me somewhere even though I'd happily drive there myself had he let me be on our insurance and actually drive our cars. I have enough money to pay for my car insurance on my family's plan, but my dad never does anything about it.

Whenever I asked if I could drive, he said no. Now that I want to buy a car because he's told me that I couldn't drive our cars multiple times, he's asking me why I don't want to drive one of our cars. When I asked if I could drive one of our cars, he said no because he's busy working on them (he's been working on them for almost half a year now and just hasn't finished because he's putting off ordering parts for them or even just working on them). I am a decent and safe driver (he knows this because he was the one that taught me to drive and I've helped drive on long road trips when I was covered by our insurance for a short amount of time). I don't think I've gotten too rusty and I've been driving rental cars through Zipcar to run errands back where I live for college, but it's getting really pricey. He wants me to run the cars I'm interested in by him and I do this every time, but he never follows through with it and just waits so long that the car is gone or just says that he doesn't like the car/approve of it. It's getting frustrating because I've seen seemingly good cars that could be a potential buy slip by because of my dad not taking me seriously. I'd buy the car myself, but I'd need someone to take me to the seller and it'd most likely have to be him because my mom is busy working and I don't want to ask friends/extended family members to help because of social distancing. I also would probably have to get car insurance through my family as well, so I don't think my dad would be too happy if I got the car behind his back and he'd simply refuse to put me on our insurance plan.

Is there something that I'm missing from my dad's point of view? Does it seem like I'm just jumping into this and I'm not responsible enough for this yet, or is there something that I should look more into? How can I convince my dad to take me seriously and get this done so I can move on with my life?",07Sep2020,1

347,"I am 16 years old and have been looking for a job since the second I turned 14 (the legal age to work). I have applied to tons of jobs and I once got a trial shift at a shitty burger place and I found out after were looking for some free labour and never intended to hire me. During that shift I was so overwhelmed that I didn't take orders, stood in one spot for most of the night and cried 3 times that night. Needless to say I think I have anxiety. Ever since I haven't applied to any food places, only retail stores. 

Recently one of my friends got a job at a sushi place near me that I had only gone to once. The other day she mentioned that they were looking for more people and I was interested but I remembered that I can't handle working in an restaurant and I had absolutely no experience with the menu, their online menu had huge holes in it and I don't know the difference between any of the sushi, rice bowls or anything else (I don't even know what they are called) this, on top of that fact that the restaurant is different to any restaurant I have ever been in (it's hard to explain exactly why) I think that working there would only trigger my anxiety and i would be no good. 

Even though I wasn't sure if I was going to apply or not, I mentioned it to my mum and she freaked out, saying that I was wasting an opportunity and that I should apply anyway and when I tried to explain to her why I couldn't, she would listen. Later she told my sister and she came into my room telling me a similar thing and I broke down crying, she went on still and I eventually had to push her out of my room, I have now been crying consistently for the past 10 minutes (as I'm writing this) 

Now I'm not sure because I really truly think I would be terrible at working there and I would not enjoy it. However, I have no money at the moment and in a year and a half my mum will no longer have child support and this may be my only chance to get a job before I turn 18 and am no longer 'cheap labour'

I am gonna tell you about something he ate the other day, his symptoms as a result of it, and then ask if I should be worried about it. Ok:

5 days ago (he did it on Sept. 2nd) my dog ate an earring hook from a pair of my dangley earrings. I have been monitoring him to make sure he's still pooping, and he hasn't missed a poop since he ate it. Yesterday he ate slightly less than usual, so his poops were smaller, but he still pooped twice, like he does every day.

Today, he kept randomy whipping his head back really fast to sniff his butt. Other than this, he has been fine. He's wanted/eaten treats, he still wants to eat my food, still wanted to play and go on walks. His gums are a fine color and he's drinking plenty of water.

He is still eating, still pooping, but I haven't seen the earring in his poop yet. I haven't been breaking his poops open completely to search for it, but i still havent noticed it. but since he was looking back at his own butt so much, I'm scared that the earring is hooked inside his intestines and won't come out.

However, like i said, I have really bad anxiety and may just be overreacting and thinking way too hard about it.

I have looked at a great house share for a reasonable price with 3 other people, however; I have just found out that it will be very expensive for my girlfriend to return on the weekends (on the train/tube/coach) - money that she doesn't have. Therefore, I will be the one travelling most weekends with my car.

I am now in a position where I don't know if to rent the house or not. I won't be there many weekends if I'm travelling, and one of the main reasons was to use it as a base for her to return. Should I still rent it just for the experience of moving out of my parents' house, or wait until she returns next year after the foundation year of her course (to get a place together)? I kind of want to have my own place, but it would be further to get to work and much more expensive (though I have savings).",07Sep2020,1

360,"Hey all

Back in July I blew my guitar amp. It’s not expensive and probably only worth £40, but it’s got some sentimental value. 

I searched around and found a repair shop in the next town over who came recommended by local music shops. Got in contact via Facebook messenger and after a couple days they responded. From there communication was good, dropped it over and it was diagnosed in under a day with a quote of £50 for parts. 

They did state however parts were ordered internationally and would take a while to come in. I wasn’t worried so agreed to the repair and even paid the cost of the parts up front. 

That was nearly two months ago and I’ve heard nothing. So I started chasing them. Back in august messaged on the same chat on FB and it sat unread for a couple weeks. Eventually read but no reply. So I phoned them last week and got an answering machine. Left a message, asked for a call back etc. Again nothing. 

I know with everything shippings probably slow etc but I’d like at least an acknowledgement as they’re just not engaging. Any advice on how to progress this now and how to go about getting the amp back if it comes to that?",07Sep2020,1
361,So I need help I always feel like someone is judging me even when I’m alone and I don’t even feel safe or alone when I think.sometimes I get these feelings and I can’t explain but it makes my heart race super fast and I feel like crying. I never cry cause that’s just not who I am . I’ve always been a really happy person and so I feel weird crying .i don’t know what to do anymore I just see all my friends talking about how they feel but I’ve never been able to say anything but “I’m happy”. Which I am but idk. I just feel so stupid at times like all my friends have their whole life planned and a multi talented but I can’t do anything . Even when it comes to school I can’t get anything done right.i used to be able to sing like not too well but I could get runs right but now I sound like a crow . I feel really weird talking about my feelings to people I know which is why I’m here. I feel like I’ve been living through the eyes of other people and have not really noticed what’s going on around me but now in quarantine I’ve had time to focus on myself. All my friends are from really rich families and I’m not . Everyone else in my family is rich but not us. Money isn’t everything but it would make us happy .

362,"So I'm about to start a new job tomorrow and I'm worrying about how I am going to perform. In the past, I have made some incredibly dumb mistakes, and all logic just leaves my brain. I am both slow and at times, I feel unreliable. The people I work with usually enjoy working with me and I have certainly had good days where my bosses have complimented me, but they are shrouded by how much of a dumbass I am every other time. Like I have made some insanely stupid mistakes that anyone with general logic, wouldn't even think of. This isn't me trying to put myself down, I've always been like this and I really want to address it for my next work endeavor. There are times where I'll be given a task to do and I'll either forget how to do it or just have to ask so many questions because I fear doing it wrong. On-top of all this, as I mentioned before, I am slow. I've generally done my work slower than the other employees and I also tire easy. My sleep schedule in the past has been fine (although much worse since Covid) and while my diet isn't currently great, it was perfectly fine in the past and I was still lagging behind. 

I just don't want to be \*that\* employee anymore. Who seems lazy and unreliable. I want to be one of the good ones. One with motivation to get further. I've never been fired because of my performance but it's mostly because I build a good rapport with my teams and I think they tolerate that I'm just fine at my job, but I have had managers comment on my working abilities before which is never good to hear. It's a new retail job tomorrow and while I'm excited cause I love the establishment, I'm terrified that I'm just going to suck at it again.

I don't want any problems talking to a haker, and I'm afraid that even continuing with the friendship, that really after everything he has told me, I don't like him that much and it is uncomfortable to talk to him, one day he will get bored huh anyway, but I don't know what might happen if I cut the friendship, will she leave me alone and continue with her criminal life as if nothing had happened?

373,"A week or two before my 20th birthday (near the end of August), my grandmother offered to put me through college. This was random from my point of view, but apparently she *really* wants me to go. I'm aware that this is an extremely fortunate thing to be thrown my way, and that I shouldn't squander the opportunity as it won't likely last forever. But the problem comes with me not knowing what I'd even go to college for. I have few things that I find interesting enough that I'd want to pursue any sort of career in- music, art, or computer-related stuff. Thing is, I don't know how to play any instruments what-so-ever, my drawings are akin to those from a seven-year-old, and my brain isn't all that compatible with the math I'd need to know and/or learn to have anything to do with computers above playing video games. I've considered looking into law enforcement/firefighter stuff, but I have little doubt that certain medical issues will keep either from ever happening.

&amp;#x200B;

The pandemic in a way has given me a bit more time I feel to figure this stuff out... But the feeling that society expects me, a twenty-year-old man to have a place of my own along with a steady income, or in the process of learning *something* is lingering. Add on the rampant anxiety this is bringing on top of everything else... I dared asking my mother if there was an issue with me staying here, living here with an absence of a job or any other means to actively support save for being around for my special-needs brother... She assured me there wasn't, even scoffing at the idea that I suggested there might be one. But of course, she's my mother. Telling whether that's her being my mom, or being practical is something I've failed to do. Especially as I'm fairly lazy and generally unhelpful save for the moving heavy stuff. Flaws I've been working on.   


I'm at a loss. I know life is moving on, whether I progress along with it or not. Lacking much in the way of life skills, or knowledge about the world... And having dropped out of high-school at sixteen, I'm a mess of uncertainty and anxiety. Should I be going to college despite having nothing I actively know to learn? Should I be living in my own place, or is living at home something normal for a twenty year old? Or am I simply already too behind? I'm not looking for pity or anything of the sort, I truly just want and need advice if there is any to offer.

379,"**Background**

This is kinda long so thanks ahead of time for reading and helping.

My friend, let's call him Mark, has had an interesting past couple of years. 2 years ago he started having a rough time with his girlfriend while they were living together in Colorado and once they split, she basically took him for everything he was worth and was left broke. He attempted things with the police but they sided with her and he got nothing in return. After this he basically lost his apartment and his job while also going from friend to friend to find a place to stay. In Sep '19 he moved out to Wisconsin and in with an old high school friend and his soon to be wife. They basically told him that they would help out and within a year he needed to be out and on his own. 

During this time he found a few jobs that were willing to work with him in the distance he could walk and not require direct deposit. Each and every one of the jobs he had, which was about 4, he was fired from because of an issue of authority. There was a heated argument each time and they fired him on the spot. In February, they told him he needed to get out because at this point he was jobless and had no money coming in to help them out and it wasn't looking promising to him getting out at the time they had set. Then he turns to me.

I'm basically his last resort. He has no other family he can go to and no more real life friends that are willing to take him in due to his most recent history. To shed some light on our history, I met him online through a game we play in 2016 and have been pretty good friends with him throughout the years, even outside of that game. Once I heard of the situation, I don't want to say I pitied him but I was in a spot where I could help and I wanted to do so. I was stable financially and all I had to do was pay a little more in food and that was it, which I was happy to do. I figured with me being his last option basically, he would want to better himself and not do the same thing he did in Wisconsin. There's more to all this but this is the general overview of it.

We didn't plan it this way, but he moved in with me in the beginning of March and the whole Covid thing started happening. Jobs were limited but he basically searched and in early April he found a job. Granted it was part time but he was getting $14 an hour, which was ridiculously good considering the situation. I agreed to drive him to work and helped him set up an account so direct deposit isn't a problem. He was actually doing really well for a very long time and into July he had no issues. He went to his job, got paid and there were no issues at all with what was going on at his job (considering each job in Wisconsin was lasting at most a month this was a win). That's when my car started breaking down.

At this point in time I needed to get a new car and the only way I was going to do so was if I added him to the lease of my apartment. I figured that would cut down at least half of my rent and I could subsidize it with a car payment and insurance since he was doing so well. Both of us could afford it and we went and talked to the landlord, he agreed under certain parameters (I'll go over later) and we signed it. This is when things started going down hill. On August 1st he got ""fired"" from his job for the same things as in Wisconsin. I say ""fired"" because the job he worked for has a Union he is a part of and in order to get fired officially, one has to be present and that was not the case. He appealed it and it went successfully and was allowed back on the job on August 10th. He made it a whole 2 days before this time being officially fired for literally the exact same reason. Same situation, same supervisor, same everything.

**Here's where I need the advice**

For the past month now, he has had very little motivation to look for other jobs. He says he has been looking but I don't see it in the internet history and the fact I hear more of his conversations than he thinks I do and most of his time is playing games. We had to drive to his employer and have him demand his last check just so he could pay this months rent, which was only for 10 hours of work, which wasn't much. Since he has no money now, there is no way at this point he can make enough to make next months rent. Part of the parameters my landlord set, was that if I move out he has to as well and that he really wants to update the kitchen so basically if we can't make rent there isn't a chance for me to ask someone to move in with me (and of course that would mean they have to find a job and move in less than a month which is hard enough as it is).

At this point I have already started exploring options as to where I can go. I work from home right now and my boss has made it clear that as long as I log in and do my work, he doesn't care where I'm at. Right now, I'm probably going to be out of here by the end of this month. I plan on talking to my landlord about the situation and working up a deal where I could potentially move back in here once he gets done updating the kitchen and hopefully have a dedicated roommate who I can trust will do better at this. 

I knew I was taking a risk doing this whole situation in the first place but I didn't expect it to go like this. I guess my question is, how do I break this to him and what kind of assistance should I help him look for if he has no place else to go? Since Covid started when he got here he doesn't have any friends here so he's basically in the same situation as when he was forced to move here. Also sorry for the long history lesson here, just wanted to give as much detail as possible to help you fully understand the situation and I want to thank you again for reading it and taking the time to give your advice.",07Sep2020,1

383,"Hi all,
I wondered if I could get your advice on a family related issue. I will probably sound dramatic, but it’s been frustrating me for a while now.
So my husband and me bought our first home, then for personal reasons his sister moved in for a few weeks. Now we did not have much furniture, so she asked if she could bring a bed frame for herself, just a cheap one. She then told me (not asked), that she would leave the bed frame after she moved out. We politely thanked her but said it was not our style, but she could move it in while she stayed, but we did not want it.
Anyway, surprise surprise, she has moved out. We are left with a metal bed frame we don’t want. 
To top it off I went in our garage and there are several really large bags full of her clothes, and a heavy bookcase that’s beeen dismantled.
Now any normal person would tell her to come get her stuff. I am really shy, and feel guilty asking her to move her stuff, though she seems to presume we will get rid of it all for her.
My husband asked her if she needed the stuff in the garage, she said yes, but WE can take the bookcase to the dump if we want rid of it.
So basically I now see the bed frame everyday and it infuriates me, I don’t see why I should have to take it to the dump when I did say we did not want to after she moves.
I just think she doesn’t care. She assumes we will act like a storage unit for her.
So I want to send a message that is friendly, polite, but also saying ‘move your crap’, without seeming like a total bitch.
Any suggestions?- oh and she moved out 5 months ago",07Sep2020,1

He told his mom and she swayed his decision and he started pressuring me into an abortion (When I was too far along to get one also). I said no and kept the baby. He broke up with me over text, blocked me on everything. Made all my friends side with him and they all started harassing me to give up the baby but I still refused and ended up cutting out every single one of my friends. It also took me 2 months after he left me to mentally process that i has been sexuality assaulted by him during most of the relationship. I do not love him anymore. I hate him but my dreams always show me feeling differently. 


The dreams-  I am now over 6 months pregnant and my ex is in my dreams every night and I'm not even someone who has dreams often or remembers them in the morning. I am working 60 hrs a week now and I just want to enjoy the little sleep I get but its impossible when I get these dreams.",07Sep2020,1

There are a bunch of kids that I know of in my school, that I used to consider to be my friends

They were a pretty decent bunch, we use to often hang around quite a bit, but then this guy (Emie I'll call him) started to 'rise' up 

He was always apart of our group, He's a pretty nice bloke, but then, The others just slowly, slowly started to wade away from me, and seemed to have a constant focus on Emie, As a result of that I slowly waded away from them aswell

But this was quite awhile ago, I've been deciding to catch up with them and hang around them whenever we have breaks or somewhat

Holy hell how things have changed, they straight up beg for this dude

Everywhere I go, I seem them falling him around like cattle, as if he's their only sense of direction

Even worse, every time I always go up to them just to simply talk and hang around, like the good ol' days 

But every damn time, I feel like I'm being discriminated against, as if they don't even want me there 

I try to be friendly, they respond in toxic ways, **I try to avoid confrontation, they instigate confrontation**, I try to do stuff for them, they take me for granted 

The reason why I highlighted 'confrontation' was because I've tried to talk to them about literally worshipping a dude who has 0 zero reason to be worshipped, as if he's a GOD

Every single time I do this, they either insult the hell out of me, or straight up tell me 'I'm Jealous'

Jealous of what? I'm taller than the dude, I get assessed as well as the dude, what can I possibly be jealous of?

Also, even if there are FACTS and EVIDENCE he's wrong, they will deny it and believe him instead  
How dense can you be?

And I know for a fact he's aware of this 'leadership' as every time he does a thing, they follow, he tries to take advantage of it, that's why I confront him/them about it In the first place.

I don't particularly dislike Emie, He's a really nice and respectful dude, But holy crap, my guy is WORSHIPPED

I honestly don't know what to do about this, maybe I should just ignore them all together

I get a crush on Evan. Jasmine and Kelly stop inviting me to things. I have to ask to come but whatever. Jasmine starts a relationship with Thomas. I now am being talked over frequently. They start to plan events without me IN FRONT of me. They start only inviting me when it benefits them. Like when using my projector. 

They invite me to get drunk bc i have cash and can pay for part of the event. I do because i know no one else and I’m desperate for friendship. I get pissed drunk. Evan and Kelley are all over each other. My feelings get HURT. 

“I’m walking back to my dorm” I say, they say whatever and I don’t make it back bc i can barely walk. Instead I cry under a tree for a few hours until i have to piss. I walk back to the hotel and text Kelly to come get me. (door requires keycard)

She does. I go to the bathroom and knock out on the floor. The next morning I see Kelly and Evan sharing a bed. I’m hurt more but hey the hotel only had two beds and Jasmine and Thomas are of course, sharing. 

Im too hungover to walk by myself. They drive me back and exclude me from that days activities without asking me if i want to go. 

I give kelly the benefit of the doubt. She was drunk. It might’ve been a mistake. Then tonight happens. I’m always up at 4am, i’m nocturnal. She’s not. Evans not. I check snapchat. The map tells me they’re both in her dorm. They’re definitely having sex. Or had. Whatever.

401,"I would just like anyone’s thoughts on this. Not sure If I even should be posting on this sub but here it goes.

A little backstory but not too in depth, we’ve been dating for almost a year now, within the first few months of our relationship I figured out she was cheating on me with her ex. (She was) and we had a talk about that, months go by and I start noticing she’s more distant. Not as talkative to me, more on her phone, more irritable around me. So I’m not sure why, maybe the sense of not being cheated on again hit me, but I tried reaching out to another woman. Didn’t work of course and I’m glad  but she ending up finding out cause she went through my phone. What made me think she was up to something was that she wasn’t upset or mad at all cause she said “she never messaged you back” but even so, from my point I would be upset finding that out. So I found out she was talking to this dude, being all flirty and lovey dovey. She said some pretty hurtful things in those messages cause she’s showed me. Just basically saying how worthless/useless I am. How she wishes she could drop everything. Things like that...

Since then we’ve been trying to work things out. On my end I’ve deleted everything and even removed my phone passcode so she can go through it. I’m not hiding anything. But for some reason...I’m not sure if it’s cause it’s already happened? Or cause I’m still hurt from what she said...I still have doubt. Like a huge amount of it before all this of course. It’s hard talking things out with her cause I feel that I’m filling in the words for her and she’s just agreeing. but she ended up having this emotional attachment to this dude... and from what I saw in the texts she showed me, they seemed to be enjoying their conversation a lot, just by how the two of them were texting.

In some sense we are two different people were she likes to go out and id rather stay in. I get she has nights where she goes out with her friends and all...and this might be my own insecurities, but also since she’s already done it, I feel it’s a lie sometimes....It could be something small like tonight for example. She promised me she would be home but ended up texting me she was gonna sleep at her friends. Which is cool I get it. It’s way more safe than driving especially after drinking. But at the same time like I hate the feeling of doubt. Idk I shouldn’t be feeling this way but she makes me feel worthless or useless at times. Like she doesn’t enjoy hanging with me and rather be with her other friends, which I totally get but at the same time since I’m her SO, how can I be like that for her? I feel sometimes she’s better off without me. What would you do?",07Sep2020,1

for context: me and my boyfriend (both 16) have been dating for a year. but, our relationship is forbidden by our parents. his mother, who hates me, is our science teacher which makes everything complicated. me and my boyfriend are classmates. my school has a no dating rule too. i am also moving school in 3 months due to this problem . ( my parents dont want me to see him)

now, the story. everything has went downhill since our parents found out about us and we told them we broke up but our parents are still keeping an eye on our phones so we don’t text anymore. we discussed many times and we have decided to not break up because we both truly love each other a lot.

my group of friends also does not support our relationship and has been telling me to break up with him.

today, i found out from a friend of mine (not among the group) that my science teacher (bf’s mom) has assigned my class monitor and her assistant to spy on me and my boyfriend. turns out, they have a freaking note book and they write the time and date EVERYTIME me and my boyfriend are seen together. i could not believe it because they were acting soo nice towards me. so, me and my boyfriend have decided to not talk AT ALL.

this, obviously stressed me out because i feel betrayed. the class monitor was a good friend before i found out about this! i went home and wrote angry stuffs on snap story. my friend ( among the group) got pissed off because i talked shit about the class monitor and said a lot of bad things about me. and finally she told me that my group is ditching me.

406," Recently my partner and I decided to get fit. This included eating better and exercise. We have a dog so it was a win for him as well, as longer walks are something he enjoys. 

About a month ago on after a long walk,  I discovered a tick on my dog, and it was BIG. I assume definitely on him for 24 hours. Anyway, we got it off and I thought, it was over. A few weeks later, I found a tick attached to my hip. I have NEVER in my life experienced a tick bite so I automatically thought, this is it, I'm about to die from Lyme disease. I got it out and haven't developed a rash so I thought, well, maybe my dog picked up another one so he immediately got a bath. This one was definitely smaller and hadn't been on me for long. 

Fast forward to yesterday, I feel something like a needle between my toes, I quickly sat up to discover a tiny bug and took it to the bathroom and realized what it was... A tiny tick, in the nymph stage. We immediately get dressed and go to Walmart where we bought spray for ticks. I spent the entire day, spraying, wiping, threw away all my dogs linen in our room. Took my bed apart, sprayed, washed my bed linen, vacuumed, literally sprayed and cleaned every inch of my room. Having done all that I thought I was safe. I get in bed with semi peace of mind and sure enough, an hour later I woke to the same needle pinch behind my knee. Definitely another tick, about the same size. My house is always clean, I'm a very clean person and my partner and family believe I'm ocd about cleaning. I don't like dust, clutter, or things to be unorganized or BUGS. So it's not a situation of being a disgusting person. I don't allow my partner in the bed without taking a shower. Like we are super clean people... Anyway.

After much research online, well, google for hours I have come to realize it's a brown dog tick. I got up and moved to the couch, so I'm sitting here, on about 30mins of sleep trying to figure out what to do. There's only so much online. This is definitely ticks and not bedbugs. It says online that people sometimes don't feel the bites from them at that stage but I'm super sensitive to anything biting my skin. The one behind my knee I put between tape so I could get a good look at it, and again it's definitely a tick. 

If anyone has experienced this, any help would be appreciated more than you know. I live in Virginia btw. I'm on the verge of tears, the stress and anxiety from this feels like I'm going to have a heart attack. I don't know what to do. I'm just waiting for my partner to wake up so I can check his body for ticks and then spray everything again. My house already smells overwhelming like cloves from the spraying I did yesterday. I don't even know what else to google.",07Sep2020,1

408,"Hi guys,

I’m almost 20 years old and currently around 3 years and 2 months into a 4 year apprenticeship for maintenance engineering.

I hate this job so much, I think it started because of the workplace itself. A gloomy, dirty factory that’s overly loud and has machines that are 20+ years old. Floors are filthy with dust/dirt. The walls or really anything exposed to the air inside is stained yellow or has heavy tar residue from the air pollution. (The process is blown film extrusion)

Honestly I’m so tired of working this job, the management are always on your back giving you unrealistic jobs and there’s a huge blame culture alongside the fact that you really ‘shouldn’t be sick you can just come in’. There’s a huge divide between managers/office staff and the workers on the floor. Managers/office staff see themselves as above any floor workers.

My current wage is bad, it’s minimum wage still (UK). Once I qualify I can earn anywhere from £24k-£30k. However, I’m still working in a factory environment.

This job has really shit on my mental state to no relief. I can’t explain how many times I have almost left, I’ve had emotional breakdowns at home from stress and it’s just exasperated my own (already not good) mental health.

I would love to just leave my job and get another, anything. A waiter, train to be a barber, work in a shop it could be anything other than this.
I would just like some outside advice on what would be best 

TL;DR: been working a shitty factory job for 3 years, I qualify in another year but I can’t take it anymore. If I leave that’s 3 years of this down the drain but I don’t want to do this job now or for any more time. Even if I’m getting paid moreb",07Sep2020,1
409,"I'm a teacher and tried something else for a year which totally was not for me. I interviewed with several schools this year and accepted an offer from.one hoping it would be great (but not really knowing since I was never able to visit in person) seems like a fine place though there are some things that have gotten me down about it, it doesnt seem like I'm super excited about it. My husband and I bought a house in a neighborhood we love, it's an outstanding area and we could stay in this house for a long time. The person I was supposed to replace didnt end out leaving which is kind of awkward for me, and he is now working part time after asking if they had found a replacement once I was already hired. So it doesnt seem like it would be the end of the world if I weren't there. He will be leaving after this year for sure, though.

Suddenly my first choice school calls me up this weekend and they had someone take a LoA and want me to teach there. They're offering 10K more salary but with the expenses of selling a house you just bought it would take several years to make that up. It's a very prestigious school which appeals to me, though I don't know I should let that matter. It's in a more expensive area too, but 100 miles away from where we just bought this house.

412,"I understand that you have lots of other activities to do and I am truly sorry for taking your valuable time… I am a citizen of Lithuania and our people are currently living in a horrible nightmare of animal abuse, puppy mill networks and illegal breeders, who are unstoppable since 2004.

Few days ago, one woman lost a pure-bred dog and she didn’t give up until she found her little friend. Unfortunately, it was found in an abandoned house nearby, trapped in a cage among other pure-bred dogs, 30 of them to be exact. She recorded those anti-sanitary conditions - dogs were thirsty and hungry, living in small cages, their fur was dirty with their own feces, there were rats everywhere. The message spread through social media and people started looking for places like this. 
Of course, the police and public veterinarian commision were informed but they refused to do anything because of poor regulations of the government. Even when people noticed their own dogs from photos and videos, the police couldn’t take the dogs away, because it might end with a break of human and property rights… More than 80% of the dogs didn’t belong to the women, she probably was stealing dogs and trapping them in order to run a business of document-free pure-bred animals. In Lithuania, the majority of people earn quite small wages but still want beautiful dogs, so they are happy to pay less. Some of the people don't understand why documents are necessary for animals, if they are only having an animal as a pet in home and not for contests, as a result, those illegal breeders earn good money... But we are awakening!

Afterwards people started to cooperate. They found more places like this, more illegal breeders were identified. Turns out, there are quite a lot of “businessmen” in these illegal activities across the whole country… On Friday, the veterinarian commission didn’t find anything wrong with the environment in those abandoned places the pets were living, they gave up the dogs back to illegal breeders. People are predicting that some veterinarians were bribed, and the private ones don't have any power but we do not know for sure, so we cannot judge.
Yesterday, volunteering citizens and police found missing dogs burned and parts of dogs in the fields across the country. It is probably because of the microchips on animals, so they could not be identified to legal owners and the accusations would drop. It is possible that some dogs were thrown out in the forests.
Peaceful citizens are on duty 24/7 for the third day without sleep or proper meals. They are blocking roads, so the illegal breeders would not be able to change locations and destroy evidence. Government has barely made a few comments, the media and journalists are also only slightly commenting on this nightmare.

Some of the volunteers are being followed by those illegal breeders or their relatives at night, now even threats are appearing, some of those nasty criminals are breaking glasses of volunteers cars... Tonight lithuanians found recently dead corpses of dogs, they were thrown out in forests, piles of trash, everywhere across the whole country. Our nation is small yet strong enough, volunteers are cooperating physically at those abandoned storages, recording all the cruelty and trying to reach as many people as possible. Those who are not able to participate in attempts to rescue pets, are helping financially for animal shelters, because more than 200 dogs were finally rescued! Even though there is so much to do in the following future.
Today in one of the abandoned storages illegal exotic animals were found – parrots, a camel and etc. Lithuanian climate is not suitable for the needs of such animals but probably they are also bred in those terrible conditions. There are storages full of sphynx cats, rabbits. It is truly mind-blowing and the government, alongside with Lithuanian media appears to be ignorant.
I could write more and more as this is the hottest topic in my country, but I just want to ask, please share this with as many people as possible somehow. Citizens do not know what to do, you are our last hope, so please, do not be ignorant. It has to stop now.  
Are there any institutions in the European field which could make some changes for the future of animals in Lithuania? Please let us know. Thank you for your time and I apologize once again",07Sep2020,1

We are short staffed by about at my estimate one 1/3rd (everyone works about 1-2 hours of over time per day. And have been known to work 20 hours). Which means we are always stretched. Take in annual leave and sick leave. And we come into situations where we are absolutely fucked. 

4. Problems take months to resolve. And even longer to discover. And are near impossible to raise as management are dealing with backlogs of problems and will just ignore a problem that isnt urgent. Which leads me to our next problem.

5. Management are terrible at managing things. I am not talking about them being bad at their jobs, they are extremely knowledgeable but all problems are resolved with the same hammer solution: ""over time"" and ""get it done"". We wouldnt have half as many problems if permanent flexible solutions were provided.

After this how is this affecting my own workload:
workload:

-I am constantly making mistakes. Always out of ignorance. ""I didnt realise how important this was."" ""I didn't realise this was introduced.""

-I am being taken advantage of. I am an obsessive person by nature. And extremely curious. So I like to know how to do things. And I like to know how to do them properly. So any odd project that gets started always gets dropped at my desk. And I constantly get assigned a completely overwhelming workload as a result. I rarely get help. Which feeds into the above, sometimes I have to drop stuff and come back to it at a later date, and I cant hand it over either as there is no staff, and I think I am doing the right way and months later ""this is a completely wrong.""

I am just so unhappy. I just feel exhausted all the given week. And basically only really exist in social life Friday evening until Sunday. My physical health and mental health is also taking its toll too. I have some stomach problems on off the last couple of months are directly related to stress and not eating properly due to stress. I suffer from serious mental health problems already and my work just makes switch off impossible. I just jolt up about mistakes I think I may have made all the time.

I was planning to quit this year anyway. But with all that is going on in the world. I am so fucking torn. I have been unemployed and I fucking hated it. And starting in a new position where my position will be under  a 6 month review before permanency. I never want to unemployed again. Its soul destroying, it literally takes the motivation out of you to live your life. 

What's the right course of action? I cant stick this job for much longer and the prospect of going to insecure job market is terrifying.

I found out a few days ago that he cheated on me and I'm pretty broken. Our manager knew that we were together and purposely arranged our shifts together because he knew that we would share lifts there.

The break-up is still new and we haven't told anyone yet so my next few shifts are with him. He has been calling and texting but I haven't responded and tbh I would love if I never had to see him again. I called in sick the past two days to avoid him. However, with the current pandemic there is no way that I would be able to find another job if I quit this one.

422,"I've recently rented a flat in a building. The flat is owned by the landlord, the building is owned by another company.

I signed a tenancy agreement and was given a list of house rules (didn't sign the house rules as I was not asked to).

There have been a lot of issues since I've moved in but the advice I need today is relating to an email which was forwarded to me by my landlord and was sent to him by the 'chairman of the home-owners association'.

In this email, it states some damage was caused (to the front door of the flat) by me when I moved into the property - this is definitely untrue but cannot be proven either way. The email also states that some damage was caused (to an exterior wall) by a cable engineer who installed cable to the flat.

Having taken a closer look at the house rules, I noticed that it does state any work done to the outside of the building has to be done after permission is sought and granted by the building owner/s. I didn't check this before getting cable installed.

I wasn't home when the engineer visited but my friend who was overseeing the work said the engineer drilled a hole into the interior wall but the hole went through the exterior brick wall (this was intentional as he had to connect to the main cable running across the building).

Neither my friend nor I noticed any damage but a picture forwarded to me does show some damage (picture included).

The landlord is going to be billed for any repairs to the brickwork and the damage to the door. The landlord seems a bit irritated and I want to know what I can or should do. Any advice or help will be much appreciated.

425,"I truly feel like my life is over. Everyone is telling me that it gets better but I feel in my heart that I will never heal and learn to take care of myself and be an independent, normal human being. 

I grew up in a very hectic and violent home because my father was an alcoholic. It was normal for them to scream at each other almost every day, spit in each other’s faces, and have physical altercations. When they got divorced at 7 I was given a cell phone and was put in charge of communicating between them since they would always put me in the middle. As the oldest sibling I had to hear both sides of their problems, my mother telling me horrible, scary stories about my father and my father crying in my arms over how badly he wanted his life back. I became afraid of my dad and used to skip out on weekend visits with him so I could stay home and avoid the way he made me feel. 

Eventually they finalized their divorce and my father got a girlfriend. I felt that he had abandoned me and replaced me with her because suddenly I didn’t feel as important to him. I remember when I cried to him about this he told me that I was being ridiculous and at that point I decided to just stop spending any time with him. I was probably 12. 

I have strong suspicions my mother has NPD or something of the like. Expressing yourself was not something that was encouraged in our home and I always felt that I was walking on eggshells. I ended up telling myself that she acted this way because I was a bad daughter, and I began self harming in places where no one would see just to feel something. She would make fun of my interests and my shy demeanor. She would scream in my face over the smallest altercation. I was terrified of her. 

She was super involved in our church but I never wanted to go until the beginning of 2013 when she finally convinced me to go on a camping trip with the youth group. I was barely 14 and it was here that I met the 22 year old adult volunteer that would go on to sexually abuse me for 2 years. When I met him it felt that for the first time in my life somebody was here to care about me. He was completely obsessed with me and made me feel special. We had a sort of pseudo relationship where we texted all the time and his presence in my life became my only major source of happiness and validation. But at the same time, I was completely out-of-my-wits terrified of him and the consequences of being found out. Things turned ugly and he would do and ask disgusting things of me. He abused me and to this day the feeling of human touch just does something to me and makes me feel disgusting all over again. He controlled me and threatened me with suicide if I went away. A few times my mother found out about him but nothing was ever really done. He always got back to me some way or another and I thought that that was because he loved me and wanted to be with me. The church essentially protected him and no actions were ever taken. I had begun high school and met someone new and my abuser knew that I was going to leave him. He approached me at the church one Sunday and twisted my arm and called me a slut then spammed my phone with pictures of him holding a gun to his head and cutting himself. I was 15 and he was 24 when I finally got away from him. 

My first boyfriend and I lost our virginities to one another. He was so sweet, shy, and anxious and I was always there to make him feel better. I remember wanting to smoke weed with him so we did that for the first time together. This would lead him down a path of drug abuse where he used oxy, heroin, xanax, and pretty much anything else you could think of. He lied to me constantly about where he was, who he was with, and what he was doing, but I held onto him because I thought that this was love and I believe I could save him. He made me do pills with him. He cheated on me with our guy friend while I was on a family trip and told me about it, ruining my time there. Eventually, at 17, I met a 23 year old who I quickly became infatuated with. I left my first boyfriend for him and he purposefully overdosed on Xanax, declaring to me that it was my fault. When i told his parents they blamed me for wanting to get back at him for hurting me. For a long long time, I felt completely responsible for his suicide attempt. 

My new boyfriend was a breath of fresh air but I would quickly realize that I was in for yet another painful and difficult relationship. When I would talk about my pain from the past, he would laugh at me and tell me to get over it. He believed that my depression and anxiety was something I could simply stop feeling and that I was just too weak to do anything about it. He told me owned my body and that he could take me whenever he pleased. He was extremely jealous and controlling, which would of course drive me away again. 

I ended things with him after I graduated high school and it was really ugly. He was devastated and cried and screamed to get me to stay, which only pushed me further away. I made new friends my senior year who I really bonded with. Suddenly, guys my age were actually interested in me. A guy (let’s call him M) who I had a crush on throughout high school suddenly wanted me and wanted to have sex with me, so I let it happen, but it was just disappointing. Simultaneously I had a best friend (let’s call him E) who I told everything to about my feelings for M. 

Right before I was about to have sex with M for the first time, E texted me and basically confessed his feelings for me and asked if I’d ever want to be friends with benefits, which completely threw me. E was the smartest, sweetest guy I knew, but I kept chasing M because we all know that sometimes we want things we can’t have. M was the type of really cool, popular guys that every girl wanted in high school, and I was in disbelief that suddenly he wanted me. But after having 2 encounters, I realized that it wasn’t going to work and I didn’t want to be with him. 

After a party one night I kissed E and we ended up hooking up. I was completely over the moon. It was like suddenly everything made sense and I found the person I had always been looking for. We began dating and I was so happy because I finally found a guy who was treating me like I thought I deserved. After about 8 months or so though, my past started really catching up to me. 

It was like for the first time I realized that the abuse I suffered had really affected me in so many ways, like an undetected cancer. I used to play it off and laugh about it like it was nothing, but I really realized that the pain was extremely deep. My self esteem plummeted.  I felt like used goods. I felt disgusting and dirty. I lost interest in sex because E’s touch would just trigger those negative thoughts and memories. I told him this, but he would just express how he felt I was just rejecting him. 

I began abusing psychedelics, weed, and alcohol. I could only feel happy while stoned out of my mind. I went on drinking benders every weekend even though I didn’t really like it. E became distant and I felt like a complete failure and a disgusting person. He wanted sex and I couldn’t give it to him, so I kept turning him down. I didn’t realize it at the time but I was sabotaging myself because I felt that I didn’t deserve him and subconsciously felt I was gonna fuck everything up, so that’s what I did. 

I quit taking my Lexapro cold turkey, giving myself brain zaps and horrible withdrawals. I cut myself for the first time in years. I slammed my head into walls. I felt like a failure because I couldn’t please him sexually and I felt that it was my fault. 

One night after drinking and feeling particularly bad about myself, I started texting people trying to set up group sex. M had been trying to text me and I knew he had been serially cheating on his girlfriend at the time. I texted a lot of people and I honestly don’t even remember all of it because I was so fucked up. M initiated a sexual conversation with me and I ended up sending some old nude pictures of myself that I had in my phone. I felt dirty, so I was letting people treat me that way. It felt horrible and low. And so uncharacteristic of me. 

The next morning I threw up due to feeling so disgusted with myself. I went back to sleep and woke up to E sitting on the bed telling me he was breaking up with me because he had gone through my phone while I slept. He saw everything I texted those other guys besides my messages with M, which I deleted that night before I went to bed. 

And I fucking lied to him and said nothing happened. I fucking lied to his face and I don’t think I will ever live it down or forgive myself. After convincing him nothing had happened with M, he let it go and we never talked about it again. We continues the relationship. This was about a year and a half ago. 

Thus begins my suffering with living with this terrible secret of what I did. A few months ago M’s ex girlfriend messaged E and told him everything I had done as well as some blatant lies. Even though M had been cheating on her, she blamed me for everything and trying to steal him away. In the end, it could’ve been anybody I had this encounter with, but M was the scummiest and the one to reply to a drunk girl’s text like this asking for nudes. But because of my history with him, while it meant nothing to me, E never got over it. 

I read this message before he did while I had his phone, and I deleted it out of the sheer panic and terror. I am an extreme codependent and my ultimate fear was being abandoned. I told him the content of the message and how some of it was lies, but finally owned up to the fact that I had spoken to M flirtatiously while I was drunk and talked to other people during that horrible point in my life. I omitted the fact that I had sent nude pictures though. I felt that there was no reassurance and that if I came clean he would leave me immediately. I thought back to keeping things from my mother and my exes, having them scream in my face, cry, and even hit me. I was terrified of the coming completely clean. My codependency had lead me to only rely on E and I felt that he was all I had, so I still kept it to myself out of the fear he would abandon me and most of all because I didn’t want to hurt him and ruin everything. I convinced myself that since it only happened once and that I knew I would never do it again that the secret should die with me. 

But it became too much. I couldn’t sleep. I started treating myself worse. I overate and spent all of my money on weed. I couldn’t live with the guilt and started working with my therapist on how to tell him this horrible secret I just wished was a nightmare. But last week he simply called M for the first time and M told him what happened. My worst fear came true and I woke up to find that E had packed all of his things and left without any notice. I had been abandoned. It’ll be 2 weeks on Wednesday and we still haven’t even spoken. 

I know that anyone reading this probably thinks I’m a terrible human being. I’ve been beating the shit out of myself for this for a year and I feel I deserved for things to go down this way. 

This is a lot of information and I am kind of a wreck writing this, but ultimately E and I were very happy. We were best friends and this was really the one thing that fucked everything up. I can’t live with the guilt and just knowing I made someone feel this way. 

At the same time, I felt that E never let himself be emotionally available to me. I knew he loved me but whenever I would have a bad day with my anxiety or dealing with my trauma, I would never get support. He would shut down and tell me I was making him feel bad. 

I just feel like a waste of space and that nobody understand that when you are in a bad place, you do uncharacteristic shit. Everyone is downplaying what I did like it could’ve been worse, but I just feel evil inside of myself. I wanted to move past this more than anything and I always hoped that in the end he would understand me and forgive me, but he just never even brought it up or gave me an ounce of the reassurance I would need to come clean. 

Now I’m alone and it feels that a piece of me died. How do I come back from this? I really just want to end it all.",07Sep2020,1
427,"At the start of the year I was in a bad place and had no one at all in my life I could talk to but randomly because of something funny I had in my insta bio a guy messaged me, we’ll call him Alec.

He was the first person I ever had that I could open up to and he helped me to trust other people and allowed me to open up to other, if it wasn’t for him I definitely wouldn’t be here today. Over the last month we grew apart and hadn’t really talked much and today on his story he says “life is meaningless and that’s the last thing I’m ever going to say. After reading this I immediately messaged him telling him how much I value him and that he’s not going anywhere he respond with “no I’m not” followed by “this worlds fucked” I never knew him in person so I don’t know any of his friends or family so there’s nothing I can do. He’s left me on delivered for over 4 hours now and I fear he may have taken his life. It hasn’t hit me yet that he’s gone. I’m just trying not to think about it and using not the best coping methods.

429,"So, I’m having a bit of a problem with my parents right now. I’m 17( 18 in two months ) and about to be a senior in high school. Naturally, I’ve become concerned with what college I’m going to be going to. I’m physically disabled( nothing that I would absolutely die without them by my side for; it’s just that I don’t have the best vision, but it’s not like I don’t know my own problems and what I can and can’t take and stuff ), and they’re overprotective of me because of it, so, they say that what they’re looking out for is a college that had good services for that, which I really do understand because, ideally, that’s what I’m looking for, too. The only problem is they keep saying ‘ WE’RE going to do what’s best for YOU ‘ and it’s feeling a lot more like their decision than it is mine, but they just laugh and scoff and try to pull that ‘ can you believe this kid? ‘ stuff when I express that in any way. I just feel like they’ve babied me for a majority of my life and, now, they’re trying to use it against me as a reason why I can’t go to college far away when most of the stuff that they’re trying to throw in my face that I can’t do is stuff that they haven’t taught me to do. I’m still not allowed to make anything on my own or even take a bath without them in the house. My dad has a spaz attack when I so much as go up the stairs without letting them know. But, anyway, that’s besides the point. 

My mom says ‘ oh, go to college close one year, then, far away the next, ‘ but I know her well enough by now to not really trust that coming from her, at this point. I just feel like I’m never gonna be able to grow or have my own life if they want me close to them all the time; I’ve literally pictured myself as a spinster-type lady still living with her parents and dying alone without a husband or kids or anything because I’ve been living with my parents, yet I can’t tell them any of this because they’ll joke about it or get pissed as if that’s not what’s going to happen if they keep it up. The closest college that they recommended is at least 12 minutes away from them and I’m like ‘ um, how about no? ‘ It’s just that they’ve been breathing down my neck all my life and I’m kinda sick of it, but I don’t want to upset them, which is why I’ve taken a lot of their other preferences into consideration and recently stumbled across Northern Kentucky University. As far as I can see, it’s a really good college for people with physical disabilities-they have an aid type person who I’m sure doesn’t breathe down your neck as much as my parents would, but is still around to help if needed( I’m good with aids, I’ve had one before, they actually allow you to grow ), free bus rides around campus( my parents were also concerned about me getting around efficiently enough, so, I got really excited about that ), and it seems like a small and safe environment, as a whole, which feels perfect for me; I’m looking for a college that says ‘ hey, you can succeed, despite your disabilities, let me show you ‘ ‘ and I’ve mostly gotten ‘ hey, your disabilities are holding you back from doing this, let me do it for you. ‘ from my parents; my mom has looked me in the eyes and told me that she would say I was incompetent to care for myself( which isn’t true; I’ve just literally never been given the chance because every extreme do and don’t has been governed by her ) and also specifically told me that I have ‘ limitations ‘( which she didn’t mean limitations; she meant ‘ omg, you’re practically gonna die without me there; let me put you under my armpit ‘ ) that would require me to be closer to them. 

Anyway, NKU is one of the top schools I’m considering going to, at the moment. The only problem with it that would be a problem for my parents is that it’s almost three hours away from them, but I’ve looked into other colleges that I’m interested in and there are none that can provide the services all three of us are looking for without me being under their armpit my whole life. So, idk what I’m really asking for here. I guess I wanna know if you guys have anything to say from personal experience with NKU or any way of how to deal with my parents.",07Sep2020,1

A little shout me - Im 29M, full time employed remote working a design job that I enjoy, and also have freelance on the side, my income is great. I’m pretty on top of my workouts MWF, and i’m also lucky in that I have a few (although distance) solid bro’s for me in my friend circle.

That said, I just moved into my own place - which i’m very much so enjoying, however it’s because a nearly 3 year relationship just ended. It was the most healthy and peaceful split I had, and it was a mutual thing - we both grew with each other and helped each other grow but we could both feel a pull to still want to grow independently and go back to our individual journeys. 

We split a few weeks ago and I moved into the new place last week. I’m typically someone who gets consumed in work, as I enjoy it and the older i’ve gotten the better I am at making money and figuring out how to sell my design services.

I’ve intentionally aimed to kick off this transition with less work focus and more just hanging out with myself and me time, I even renewed my classic world of warcraft subscription just to have an outlet to do nothing while also doing something.

The thing is though i’m still having a difficulty just being with myself and being mentally okay with the idea of doing nothing. It’s like I want to focus on something and simultaneously I can’t because all of this me time is so new I sort of don’t know how to deal with it. I suppose time helps all things but I sort of feel lost in my own head a little bit as of late.

I just wanted to write this out for myself in an effort that someone might have a suggestion or insight.

436,"This morning I was woken up to the sound of my father knocking on the door of the house my mom owns in a different state (that I am staying at).

My father is also not on speaking terms with my brother, my sister, my half-brother and he rarely speaks to my mom (though they are still married). I spoke to my mom and my mom told me that he wanted to go to a store that opened at 9am but it’s 8am. Okay. I told my mom that was a little odd because it’s Labor Day. He wasn’t in his work clothes so it wasn’t like he just got off work and just needed a place to chill. Regardless, even if he decided to drive all the way down here at 7am (40 minute drive) and the place was closed I still don’t feel comfortable being alone with him. Not because I necessarily feel he’s going to hurt me but because he just oozes negativity and tries to take advantage of people’s weaknesses. Moreover, it quite frankly it really pisses me off how terrible my mom and sister are at reading people. I think things are off about people’s behavior while they think I’m being delusional/overreacting. Which is crazy to me because I only act this way with people who have hurt me in the past.

We broke up 2 months ago because I felt like it would be best if we were just friends because in the relationship I wasn’t going to be able to give her the attention she asked me for. What I was doing wasn’t enough and in a lot of ways we were not compatible so I realized it would be better to stop the romantic relationship and focus on building a better friendship/partnership due to the fact that I cared about her so deeply. I also broke up with her because she pushed my boundaries and that made me develop trust issues in the relationship. She doesn’t have any family and any real friends to lean on except me. So I told her I would be there for her regardless of us not being a couple. So we sat down and had a heart to hear about how we were going to co exist and live together until April and the agreement we came to was 

I would still help her get her ged, get her car, teach her to drive, get a new job, and save up money for her savings 

In addition she would also not have to pay any bills until these commitments are completed and I would still cook for her and take her to work

The last part of the stipulation was that we would not see other people until the lease and we would not have sex with other people to make living together less complicated and stressful 


The goal of this agreement was for me to give her the ability to work on herself since she came from an abusive family and has never had any real support in life.


So fast forward to last weekend 

She lied to me and said she was going out with her friends but instead she went on a date with a guy and end up sleeping over at his house. But the whole time she wasn’t even going to tell me or have a discussion about it. She even blocked me on Snapchat do I wouldn’t know what she was up to.

I end up finding out what she is doing because she didn’t block me on Instagram. She had picture of her with her now new boyfriend and videos of them kissing and cuddling in bed rubbing crotches.

I warned her if she broke our agreement she would have to move out because she is not on the lease. I have sacrificed so much for her and I was willing to do so much for her to help but I feel so heartbroken and betrayed.

I need to point out that we broke up so she did not cheat but she did go against what she agreed upon.

So I gave her a week to leave, I packed her bags and I told her I never want to see her again 

* Did I do the right thing or am I going to far?

If you have any questions about the details of the relationship PLEASE ask because she is now about to move in with the guy she has only known for 2cweeks through text message 

She can’t drive 

She will not be able to pay rent 

Her car has broken down again 

She will have no one else to lean on but her new bf (🤷🏾‍♂️)

I feel so sad but I don’t want to be used and I feel like she didn’t respect my boundaries",07Sep2020,1
438,"Background: After moving to a different state, I recently found an office job in my field of expertise; it is temporary (about 6 months) with the possibility of extension pending funding.  They asked for a verbal commitment to stay for the full 6 months because otherwise it will tank the work (no other resources available to step in or time to rehire).

The problem: in my first week on the job, there has been zero onboarding. I still am not fully set up with programs or file permissions I need to do my job. I was not supposed to have direct reports, but I already have 2 with the potential for up to 8 more (for now). The experience levels for these staff do not align with their responsibilities. Other staff in the department expect that I am going to take over leadership of 3-4 programs not in my job description (they have stated this). I’ve worked 70+ hours this week to help us meet an important deadline, but I suspect this is actually be the norm.

My direct supervisor, who I like so far, is putting in similar hours and told me this has been the work schedule since March and that there isn’t a good solution. My supervisor suggested I flex my hours to offset the overtime, but I don’t see how I could do that without falling woefully behind. I already feel stressed and unhappy.

TLDR verbally committed to temp job for 6 months. In first week it’s way different than expected (zero onboarding, have direct reports, potentially broadening my role).  Worked 70 hours, not 40-50. Husband can support household on just his income, but minimal addition to savings. 

How do you recommend I proceed? I like the work itself, but even if they increased my pay these hours are not sustainable and I’m already exhausted.",07Sep2020,1

444,"I have been friends with my friend since the 1st grade. We were in the same resource room so we bonded instantly. It was always hard for her to make friends and people kind of made fun of her. I was always there to be her friend. 

Years went by and I’ve noticed she became super clingy or codependent towards me. And still is sort of today. We are both 24 now. I’ve always felt bad for her because it’s always been a little difficult for her to make friends. She tries to get super super super close to people and clings to them. She also asks a lot of questions to find out more about them. A lot of people notice her behavior and start to pull away. 

Despite her difficulty with making friends and me feeling bad about her, I’m at the point where I have outgrown the friendship. What’s holding me back from ending it, is I’ve known her family for years and also feel bad because she does not have many friends. She can be toxic to me sometimes I feel like. She’s always had a bad opinion about my friends, she never seems like she wants the best intentions for me, and she can be a little controlling. I find she does not really have boundaries. 

For example: I was at a bar with her a few years ago, and we bumped into these two guys. I was talking to one of them who she found cute, and he told me he would hook me up with an internship opportunity! He gave me his number. My friend asked to see my phone, and when I got home, his number was completely gone. It is clear that she deleted his number. 

Recently, this cop in town who I would see at my job (I worked at a diner) would stop by for food. He followed me on Instagram, probably saw me through a mutual friend. I told my friend about him and she asked to see his Instagram. I told her that I thought he was super cute but I noticed a ring on his finger, so I did not message him. She finally admitted to me that for months she has been talking to him. She found his Instagram through mine. And was talking to him, knowing that he was married. I found it odd that she would hide this from me knowing that I was kind of interested. 

She also once was super judgmental of me a few years ago when I would go on tinder dates and how I met my ex boyfriend through there. She said it was trashy for people to meet others on apps and now she has already been on two tinder dates this year...

A few months ago she got really close to me, knowing that I was nervous about covid. I asked her to stay six feet and she pretended to cough on me. I told her I didn’t like that and she goes “I was kidding! I barely even coughed on you”. She never takes the blame for anything. 

Last example: I told her recently that I’m thinking about going back to school to get my masters in Education. She basically scared me saying education is hard and that last year I was not trying hard enough with finding jobs (knowing that my father passed away last year - my job search obviously had to be on hold). 

I feel like she does not want what is best for me. I’ve felt bad for her for many many years and I feel like she does not support me after all the support I’ve given her. I’m at the point where I want to cut out her, but I find it hard and I don’t know how. I’m at the point where I just want to cut her completely.",07Sep2020,1

449,"First, some background: My mother was heavily involved with drugs throughout the 90s and 00s and so didn’t raise my siblings or me. My and their fathers' identity was never known, though we are all very different in terms of looks, so it's clear we all have different fathers. My siblings and I never cared about our biological fathers and were raised by my grandmother and grandfather.

Even while not caring to find our fathers, there is still wonder about our races. My sister is clearly majority black, my brother white, while I am much more ambiguous. All through my childhood, it was a topic of discussion about what I was. My grandparents thought I looked Spanish and filled our forms, stating that when I would go to the doctors, while other people have told me I look Native American, and others have said I look Hawaiian or Samoan. The fact is, no one knew, and my mother changed her story a lot.

I recently took an ancestry DNA and learned from this test that I am Cambodian, Indian, and Thai, along with the things I know I am from my mother's side. After years of always changing the story and pointing to different men she believed it was, she told me it was likely that my father was a friend of my grandfather’s. She said this man was married at the time, and still is, and so she never told anyone about being involved with him. This man is also Indian, so she now says it is likely him, given the ancestry test. My mother said she was in a relationship with his son for a while around the same time, so either of them could be my father.

I don’t want to delve deeply into my feelings regarding my mother because this is not what I am concerned about.

Anyway, to the current situation: I am a 26F, married with a child and so I already have a life of my own. I want nothing from these men other than an answer. I want to know where I came from. After that, if he wants, he can never speak to me again, or we can try and get to know each other if the test comes back that he is my father, totally up to him. I am just unsure about what I should say when I break the news to him.

I have located his phone number through family who still speak to him, but I don’t know what to say. After all, he was and still is married and so I doubt he will be welcoming to me coming in and possibly ruining his marriage. I currently have no plans to try and contact the son just because I think speaking to him would be harder than the father, but I’ll consider that if speaking with the father goes terrible. Realistically, I only need one of them to do the test because if I am related to them, the father is either my father or my grandfather, and the test should show that.

I’m just unsure what I should say, or if anything I say could make a difference in how the news is taken. Sorry if this post is filled with errors. I am running on no sleep because the stress of this situation is keeping me up.",07Sep2020,1

452,"So this all happened about six years ago.

I was 21, dumb and horny. I had a fake Facebook account and came across this random girl I didn't know IRL in another state who I started talking to. The conversations were never sexual or explicit, but I eventually got her to send me some underwear pics. They weren't nudes (you couldn't see any privates) and she wasn't doing anything sexy (sexual acts, posing) in the pics. 

Afterwards, I learned she was just short of her 18th birthday. I IMMEDIATELY cut off all contact, blocked her, and deleted the pics. 

Ever since, I've been feeling so incredibly guilty - especially lately. I never did that before or since, but I just feel so disgusting, considering myself not unlike those internet predators you hear about. 

Nothing has happened in those six years since, but I'm also always worried about the FBI booting my door in (since FB keeps things forever and she could report me at any time). It's getting to the point where I'm considering turning myself into the police or feds or whoever just to face the punishment for what I did. 

Anybody have any advice on how to go about turning myself in?",07Sep2020,1

 I was talking to this girl who lie's to me a lot and doesn't have the same hobbies and interests to I decided to end it because it made me feel bad and get a bad vibe when talking to her. 

I just need feedback on how she may have felt, Is she hiding something from me, Did I execute it maturely and what are the things I should avoid or do next time? Does she have some stage of depression and should I talk to her parents about it? 

The chat is copy pasted below!

""Her""=the girl in talking to
"".....""= Me


Her: Hi
 ....: Hello
....: I don't think we should talk anymore. I think our mindsets and goals are different. You aren't a bad or toxic person but I think when we talk together we create a toxic friendship and environment.
 Her: But why ?
 ....: You don't feel the same?
Her: No
....: Well I'm very busy and I can't handle talking every day for an hour and also when I talk to people I don't usually play games we talk about our interests and hobbies
 ....: We don't have anything in common and our age difference makes it worse
 Her: Ik
....: Well what do you think?
....: I want to have your opinion, do you feel the same? You think that I have some bad personality traits that made that happen?
 ....: You don't know what to say?
Her: I don't think you have bad personalities
....: Did you feel like we are incompatible in the past?  Do you feel that now after I told you?
....: If you want to tell me anything tell me right now.
 ....: I'm in a good mood today
Her: No
Her: I have to tell you something
....: Ok
Her: After tomorrow we are going to make a covid test
 ....: That's what you needed to tell me?
Her: And our ages are 2 years different
 ....: I'm not using the age difference as an argument.
....: It doesn't change how I feel
[ ....: What I said is a final decision, it's not gonna change.
....: Maybe we shouldn't talk for a few weeks, maybe we could keep talking if we have common interests and mindset
Her: Ok
 ....: Don't be sad about it, I'm sure you have a lot of friends that are able to talk to you comfortably.
Her: Ok but we can still be friends but not talking for a few weeks like you said?
 ....: Anything you need to tell me?
....: Friendly not friends I would say.
....: I am happy you had the courage to tell me this
..: I really need to go. You have anything you want to tell me?
Her: And once I had a friend on Instagram and we kept talking but then that person  told me the a very bad word and I felt sad abt it and in my previous school all the girls was insulting me and I was led by a boy
....: That happened to my friends a few years ago. I know how it feels. You can ask these people why they did this. Or talk about it with people like you are right now and improve what needs to improve
Her: That boy he also told me a bad word the one who I was led by he told me like eh ya... You know the bad word 
....: That's bad
 ....: Do you need me to help you or just listen?
Her: You know that also my sister she got bullied by a group of girls she was kicked and they were pulling her hair
....: Will only you can handle this. It's more about how to handle the situation not avoiding it
Her: And there teachers my father said that they don't do anything. Can you imagine?
....: That's bad
 ....: Well you should talk to your parents about it. I can't help you.
....: They are older than me and they have more experience than me
....: I will leave now
....: Bye
Her: Ik know but now I know but I also know how to defend myself
 Her: Ok
 Her: Bye

456,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here. A loved one of mine has recently been diagnosed with BPD after several manic episodes. For reference, we’re both sophomores in college, although we’re both currently living at home and taking online classes because of the pandemic. 

Obviously this is a pretty stressful time for them, and I wanted to know if you either have BPD or have people in your life with BPD, is there anything you wish people knew to help support someone who’s just been diagnosed? 

I’m really sorry for my ignorance and lack of knowledge around the matter, I’ve been scouring the internet to learn more about their diagnosis and how I might be able to help support them. I understand I can’t be my friend’s therapist or complete support system, but I want to be there for them as much as I can, as I’m one of the few people they’ve told about their diagnosis, and they don’t have the best relationship with their family.

457,"Hi, I'm 16 and I'm starting a new school tomorrow. I've been on break for 6 months because virus so I havn't talked much to anyone apart from my mum and sister and people on the internet in that time.

I'd like some close friends but I have no social skills- I don't think I'm a huge jerk or anything, I think people generally liked me at my last school but I'm really shy and awkward and probably kind of boring so I had people who were fine inviting me to hang out with them sometimes but nobody I was really close to.

Basically that's it. I've got some stuff that's vaguely interesting about me- I can play the harp and do caligraphy, but I think the issue is I've got a really boring personality so if I tell anyone that it sort of becomes my entire personality, I don't really want to spend the next 2 years being known as 'Quiet harp person with nice handwriting'. 

Other thing is I'm a bit scared about bringing people back to my house; I was on a bursary at a private school so most people I knew were pretty rich with really nice houses and stuff (I'm a bit broke.) Probably less of an issue now that I'm going to a 'normal' school but I still feel a weird about it even though I know that most people probably don't care what your house looks like.

And this probably sounds super weird but I genuinely hate my voice- I think I sound really whiney and annoying. Again I know people probably don't care as much as I think they do but it's still really hard to stop thinking about that and talk to people, and even if I'm not worried about talking I still don't know what to say.

Yeah that's it. Any advice appreciated :)",07Sep2020,1
458,"Okay this is a long story I’ll provide some context but I really need help in knowing how to cope with the loss of someone I loved deeply, we went through a lot but we never actually got to meet..

2 years ago I met this guy on tinder, his name was Justin, he was very attractive but ultimately I loved his personality it was just perfect he was really great, but to cut a long story short, he was lying about what he looked like but what he said about himself was apparently true, so I broke it off with him and ignored him for 8 months, but he kept coming back so I gave him a chance and we became friends because he explained his confidence issues and the years of bullying he went through. I wanted to help him gain some confidence even if it was just with me, especially so he could show what he really looked like. After a while we occasionally had *moments* but he’d not talk for months and suddenly come back but ever since the pandemic started we’ve been even closer and talking more. I started to fall for him again and he already confessed his love so there was something there. He still wouldn’t show me what he looked like and I understood that, trying to make him comfortable with me so he would gain confidence. It wasn’t that bad, I was willing to spend time on this. 

so that’s the context of who he was to me. 
Here’s the seriously heartbreaking part (for me anyways)

Basically a month ago he started feeling very unwell and we were both worried it was COVID-19. I said let’s not talk until you’re better because he needed time and space to recover and i didn’t want to be in the way of that. Then a week after we stopped talking his sister messaged me on his account saying he’s very unwell and in hospital, they tested him for COVID but it was negative. So I was just waiting to hear back and hope he was getting better. But this morning, his sister messaged me again and I was praying she was gonna say he’s back to normal, but unfortunately she explained he got worse, his condition turned out to be a lung infection and that he passed away yesterday. 

I can’t begin to explain my feelings towards the news I received. I feel like I shouldn’t be so heartbroken since I never got the chance to meet him or see the real him, but I went through so much with this guy, his name was Justin, and I honestly loved him. As a friend and as something more. He meant a lot to me and we both new we liked each other deeply, there was something there. I wanted to have a future with him, I wanted to finally meet him, but this illness beat me to it and took his life. I’m devastated. I’m crying but I’m also so fucking angry. Something good could’ve changed my life he would’ve loved me and I would’ve loved him no matter what, and I can’t have that now. I’m seriously done with my life right now, I’m broken and I don’t think I can ever be fixed, things have just continued to go wrong and I can’t fight anymore. 

I need help, I don’t know what to do, I can’t tell my parents they won’t understand, no one will think this is worth getting upset over because he was only online. I’m so depressed..

Rest in peace Justin, I loved you, I truly did, after all we had been through. ❤️",07Sep2020,1
459,"So my dad has zero table manners. He slouches at the dinner table, and he always eats while shirtless. He wears a pair of disgusting boxer shorts when he eats, and he eats with his hands. When my mom makes soup, he slurps really loud, and he lifts the bowl and pours it straight into his mouth. He's really fat, and when he sits down, his potbelly bulges out really big. He constantly burps and farts at the dinner table. His burps last for about 10 seconds, and they smell horrible. He releases the most silent but deadly farts. We'd just be eating dinner and talking about something, and then suddenly everyone smells a nasty odor. It always comes from my dad, and he's the only one who doesn't seem to be disgusted by it. 

He is also a really loud eater. He smacks his mouth when he eats, and he chews with his mouth open. He slurps way too loud, and he burps after every few bites. It's so terrible that he does this. When we eat, he picks his nose non-stop, and he smears the booger on the underside of the kitchen table.

And then my dad is also really coarse. He constantly hogs all the food for himself. For example, there would be a casserole or something, and my dad would eat all of it. When my mom makes spaghetti, my dad takes literally all the meat sauce for himself, and leaves zero for everyone else, despite the fact that there's 5 other people. He drinks wine at every meal, and my always asks him to stop, but he doesn't listen. That explains why he is overweight by 50 pounds. Each time he reaches for something, he stretches out his thick arm, and he always puts his hands in the food. Sometimes, he just throws stuff like asparagus or beets in the trash can, and this really infuriates my mom. 

When we eat, we try to discuss engaging topics, such as something interesting that happened at school or work, or the news or something. However, my dad doesn't seem to understand this, and he just brings up embarrassing stories about other people, including me and my siblings, non-stop. He always tries to embarrass others and highlights other people's weaknesses, and it's so annoying when he does that. And he also talks about how we're always out of toilet paper in the bathroom and how the toilet doesn't flush properly. The truth is that he uses too much toilet paper and clogs the toilet every time he goes in there. He needs to exile himself elsewhere to eat and crack vulgar jokes.",07Sep2020,1
460,"My family started a business during the pandemic. I was invited to assist them last week. I made a ton of stupid mistakes, angered the person who gave me this opportunity, and had panic attacks (so I looked crazy to them). I couldn't focus and stopped completely functioning mentally.

This is where things get so confusing. Ever since the day I started, I could hear them talking about me or whispering insults under their breath. It threw me off and I performed poorly, to say the least. They called me stupid, crazy, and bread face. They would emphasize ""key phrases"" like ""fake"", ""plastic"", ""money hungry"", and ""untrustworthy"". They would say something, watch me react, then judge my reactions. 

They seem like they're trying to dig for information from me but I'm completely clueless. I haven't talked to any of them properly in months. When I started interacting with them again, everything felt so volatile and heavy. 

They're so nice and understanding when they talk to me but when they're all together, they would talk badly about me. I don't ever want to hear them but the walls are so thin and they talk so loud sometimes. 

I know I made mistakes but they always assume the very despicable, worst attributes in me. I want to give back all the money from my commissions and everything. I never did it for the money but they'll never believe anything I say. I'm turning into a person I hate trying to survive what is happening right now. I feel like throwing up everytime we interact. I'm scared. Everything is so under the table. I have nobody to trust in my house. 

A few minutes ago, my Aunt was in my room pretending to talk to her friend but she was actually just repeating the ""key phrases"". She was also checking if I was writing on reddit because she knows I ask for advice here. She said ""this is how we fight now"" as a joke to her friend but it's obvious where she's getting at. She is taking pictures of me, sending it to her friend, and giving me compliments to get me to engage. 

You don't know how turbulent this is for me. They're so hard on me and the mind games is making my mental health deteriorate even more. I'm losing my hair and I'm gaining so much weight in one week. 

I don't know if I should just address it head on or if I should pretend not to notice. Right now, I'm playing dumb because I have no idea what to do. Something inside me is telling me to stay and trust the process but the other part of me already dreads the next day.

This wouldn't be such a concern if she didn't get offended easily, and doesn't see how some of their actions are made out of care for her. (Not all of them, her parents are not the greatest, though that's just my opinion)

She insults her ""friends"" behind their backs. This has been going on for as long as I can remember. She'd talk crap about them and then talk to them as if they were the greatest friends. If she has a falling out with someone, she calls them b*tches and acts as if they were never friends.

She's never worked a full shift in a job (not because of low work ethic, but because those were the hours the job has) and doesn't seem to understand money all that well, but is insisting I get a job and asks about how much I have. Our apartment has a policy were your roommate doesnt have any liability for what you pay and vice versa. She could be concerned but is being a little pushy.

Any mistakes she makes are attributed to something else. She's a pretty shifty driver, regularly speeding, not looking at the road, and cutting people off. Has massive road rage, I'm constantly scared for my life, but we were recently talking about why she drives like that and she attributes it to her mom and dad, both who are also bad drivers, but she explains it by saying her dad drives like that and has been in multiple car accidents, etc so he knows what he's doing so she copies him?? That's the gist of what I got from that convo.

If I get corona I get corona. That's her stance on it. She's a huge extrovert and we had a conversation tonight about how she was planning on not letting a global pandemic stand in the way of her life. The precautions she says she's taking are not going to any crazy parties and not sharing food or making out with people (though I have my doubts about the latter). I have some classes that take place in person where they put a huge emphasis on protecting against corona, so i was a little alarmed that she wouldn't think to tell me that was her plan. I knew she was trying to make friends and hang out with people, but I'm uncomfortable about her stance on protection. She doesn't seem to believe she'll get it or that it'll have any lasting effects on her.

There's been a bunch of other small things that have me wondering if she's being selfish, but basically I'm starting to question whether it was the best decision to move in with her, and I'm questioning whether she's a toxic friend or if it's all in my head",07Sep2020,1

464,"Alright, introductions first. I'm a 27M. My situation is something that is very, very weird. I have quite a big dong (asshole me, but this will come useful for later) It'a about 8 and half inches. We all know that in the heat of *ahem* horniness, we do terrible stuff, right? I did something like that. While pleasuring myself, I grabbed it and tried to put it in my mouth. I had studied that it was impossible unless you really tried or something like that. I never bothered to try it anytime before, but this time, I did it. I put it in my mouth and was able to give a nice lick of it. Only when everything got over, did I realise what I had done. Instead of guilt, I felt excitement. I'm now obsessed with doing it and already done it twice. Can I do something here? Is there a way to make myself inflexible? Is there a way to stop myself by just controlling myself.

I'm not a gymnast or anything. I'm not even that flexible, and I've managed to do that. Please give me advice on this.",07Sep2020,1
466,"Hi, I just created reddit and I'm new to this. Let's just get into the topic. 

From the title, yeah I have depression. I was thinking about going to a therapist this year but it looks like the stupid virus ruined that plan for me.

I've been asking my close friends from the internet from some advice, but almost all of them just left me confused so I just pretend I understood to make them feel better.

I really need advice on how to cope with this shit. I don't even know if it's extreme but it probably is. My parents don't even understand, no one has except for the people that are fucking far away from me.

I'm keeping this short, I don't want to rant all day. So please, give me some advice. I'll try and hope to understand. Thanks.",07Sep2020,1
467,"To preface, I (M) am a recent college grad who is currently unemployed and lives at home on the east coast. I was recently offered a job in Los Angeles in the career field that I want to work in. The job also has pretty good opportunity for growth in my opinion. The only problem is that I don't know a single person out there. All of my friends live and work in New York and that's where I've wanted to eventually move as well. The job in LA doesn't pay very well (less than $40k/year), so I'd more than likely need to find a roommate (again, something I'd have trouble with considering I don't know anyone that lives there). I understand that jobs are tough to come by right now because of the pandemic, so I feel like I need to take this. I also want to get out of my house as soon as possible after spending 5+ months here during quarantine (nothing toxic at home, just ready to not have to live with my parents anymore). I just don't think I'd be happy moving across the country to a city where I'd feel so alone. Basically, it comes down to choosing between a good career move for me and my happiness. If anyone else has faced a similar situation (or even if you have any thoughts) I would love to hear your input. Thanks!",07Sep2020,1
469,"It’s my birthday tomorrow and Im crying. I miss her so much. She was all I was thinking about this whole day. Even through the hustle and bustle of my work day, she’s all I was thinking about. I dont want to sound crazy but I just have this feeling that eventually we will find our way back to each other. That is the only thing that is keeping me sane. Not everything has been bad though. Because of this break up, I got closer with my family and have a renewed relationship with the Lord. Whenever I feel anxious, I just pray and usually it goes away. Never been the religious person so Im also very surprised that I turned to this.

She is still the first and last though I have everyday. I dont plan it nor do I force it. When I wake up, I automatically think about her. I miss her so much and I just want to be with her again. This isnt my first relationship and Ive met quite a few people throughout my life but this girl is really my soulmate. We are literally the same in every way and I think thats why my mind does not want to move on and forget about her. I just want to tell her that I miss her so much. I miss her laugh, her jokes, her comforting me, her sharing her every detail of her day. 

Summary of our relationship. We were together for 1 year. Lockdown and quarantine came and we didnt get to see each other but still maintained communication through calls and texts. 2 months into lockdown, she felt the need to be by herself and thus break up with me. Out of no where. Just a few days ago she was totally fine and even sweet. It has been 5 and a half month since and Im still at shock. We didnt fight when we broke up because there was really no reason. She was also confused why she felt this way. I think the anxiety got into her head and she needed to release some thoughts from her head. And maybe keeping a relationship was too much for her to handle at this moment. I respect this and hope she does feel better. But i also miss her and want her in my life. Im really lost and dont know what to do. We havent been talking since and I think she is avoiding me now. I dont think she is mad at me though. I think she is doing this to help her forget about me. I dont want to sound crazy but i just have this feeling that we will be back together. Call it the law of attraction or whatever but I just feel it in me. Anyways, any success stories of couples going through this same experience and ending up back together would be helpful. Or any sound advice. Thats all. Thanks for reading my story. God bless.",07Sep2020,1

473,"Ok sorry for the clickbait ass title but now that I have yalls attention I could really use some serious advice. 


So I am a 18 year old male right. From the time I was probably around 9 I have been seriously overweight. Well queue me being 17 and just graduated back last December I decided to make a change. I started extreme calorie cutting and busting my balls exercising. Ok I weighed nearly 280 pounds (I'm 5'10 btw) (20 stone for my europeans as well) and queue 8ish months later I am now 165 pounds (11.5ish stone) (still 5'10 obviously) and not to toot my own horn but I have turned out I would honestly say extremely good looking and I have not seen anyone that I use to know because of this whole COVID thing and having not talked to anyone outside my immediate family and 2 of my extremely tight homies. And i honestly don't know what to do. I mean how do I go about dating? I mean I have never ever bothered with dating because I knew I'd never find someone up to my standards and be with them cause I was a fat ass. But now I have meet a couple of girls out in public (yes I usually wear a mask but there has been maybe like a dozen cases were I didn't. Usually at socially distanced outside events.) And literally practically all these chics have flirted with me openly and I do not know what the fuck to do. Note all these chics were average looking to one of them being what I would consider a model and I almost pissed my pants when she walked up to ME to talk. I mean I know how to flirt back etc I am fairly charismatic and so forth. But I mean when it comes to like taking the next step. I don't have a fucking clue. I mean I am a virgin right. Like I said. Never gave a shit about girls really prior. But now I could *probably* get laid in a ghost town if I wanted to. but here is where the problem arises.... I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK TO DO.  I mean is it ok for me to be kinda cocky and hot headed? I have turned out similar to how my dad looked and he was in a semi famous band back in the late 80s early 90s who toured and he said in around the 8ish years they toured he slept with nearly 800 women give or take. And he actually has proof in Polaroid cause you know who looked up to gene simmons, yep him. And he told me to be bold like people in movies cause that's what worked for him. But then again even though me and him are good looking he was also a borderline famous rockstar so he could probably do that. I'm good looking but not famous. 


So I guess my question is how should I handle my new found powers if you will lmfao. 

Also lemme rephrase what I said earlier. I have met a couple people from school outside of my immediate friends (whom I kept updated on my weight loss) and absolutely none of them recognized me. 

I now have a strong jaw line, I actually have a nice nose not to big, not to small, and a decent bridge to it, my chin is nice and pronounced. I am also getting close to having a good six pack. How ever my arms are extremely toned which is what I'm most proud of. And to answer the age old question yes, women don't really compliment muscles. Perhaps once you get on a intimate level but I have not been there yet. It's mostly been homies and other men who compliment my physique.",07Sep2020,1
474,"My cat Luna, was found as a stray and my brother took her in. Things have been well so far, but she has this recurring problem of peeing on our blankets at night while we sleep.

Occasionally, if I don't check, absolutely my fault, the litter runs low and I won't know until the morning after. 

She's an outdoor cat mainly, but we keep her inside at night. She's not spayed, I know about the importance of spaying cats as to not make the stray cat population grow further.

Like today I showed her something with this notebook that we use, had to show her a particular number on it. And instead of just grabbing the phone and looking / squinting, she grabs my whole arm and just pulls it towArds her face. Another time I was showing her what I needed to on the computer and she kinda put her hand over my mouse. And just held it there for a little more even when I appeared uncomfortable. And ANOTHER example is I was getting the password wrong for a computer and she kinda just grabbed me and thrusted me aside?

He has admitted he’s attracted to me before, but is not sure if it’s a crush or not.

Secondly, My friend is clearly ignoring me without an explanation.

So my friend C is doing a group project With me for online school he’s done nothing at all! I messaged him multiple times and he didn’t even look at the messages, so I'm talking about it with a friend and he responds instantly! I’m worried he’s ignoring or muted me for a reason I don’t know.

One day I(17f) texted him(16m) that the door might be locked but we would be home in 30 minutes from college. He started to cuss at me through text and raised his voice at me when I got home. Then he raised his voice and I yelled back. I told him he had no right to curse at me (and I had never cursed at him). We kept yelling and I told him if he wanted to fight we could. He said it was abusive to even insinuate we could fight it out. I told him to leave me alone afterwards. While staying with me he did no chores and couldn't do a single task on time  that Id ask of him (like dishes or clean a litter box.) I thought he saw me as a parental guardian or respected me because I was paying for any and all of his stuff.

Now, we ( now 18f and 17m)live in a big house that my partner and I rent. We got a bigger dog awhile ago. She is big enough to possibly hurt someone if she runs and jumps onto someone. 80% of the time I use positive reinforcement for training her. The other 20% I will smack her butt (if she's biting too hard, jumps onto someone roughly, refusing to move outside a door.) Brother heard me smack her butt twice, she didn't cry or yelp or anything like that, while moving her to the kennel. Usually she sprints to it on command for a treat. This week was weird because of visiting relatives plus their dog. Brother sprints into the room and starts yelling and saying I'm abusive to the dog. I have cried over spanking her, I use treats and positive reinforcement a majority of the time, and she's not afraid of me or people. I felt so fucking hurt he was saying again, that I'm abusive. I don't want to hurt my pet and I will try to rehome her to a better home.

I don't know what to do. I haven't stopped crying and I can't sleep. Brother tells me I never listen to his mental health issues (I've offered to get him a therapist or listen about them.) He knows I've been there. He throws it out in these arguments that I'm not a good sister to him. I have never mentioned my mental health issues when arguing with him.

My close friend’s (22M) father passed away unexpectedly this morning. I’ve known this friend for 7 years and spent a lot of time staying at his house when I was going through rough times in my own life in 2014/15 so I also grew to know his parents fairly well at that time.

My friend’s parents were on holiday in another country at the time of his father’s passing while my friend has been at home looking after the pets.

I do intend to donate to funeral costs but I don’t have a lot of money so anything I can contribute financially won’t make much difference overall. I’m also concerned about not overstepping boundaries and seeming like I’m trying to be too involved because it has been a couple of years since I last saw his parents and I’m worried about coming across as inappropriate.

494,"Title above. I suck at everything and the things I am good at are meaningless or don't really help me that much in the grand scheme of things. Growing up, I've always played video games so I never took an interest in anything. I was able to type incredibly fast since I would text people on a game all the time. I'm dumb in all school subjects and I only make A's and B's but never retain any material since my ADHD just throws it out the window. It especially makes it hard to try and learn new stuff as my mind wants to quit anything that's too daunting and I absolutely hate it. Only other things I am good at are video games and rapping/ decent at singing yet I'm terrible when it comes  to music production or songwriting even when I actually tried learning so I'm only good at performing. I've been told my voice is good so that's why I say decent sing I don't have that much control over my voice and it depends on the day and my mind state. I've also been told by my drama teacher that she thinks I should be an actor after I recited a long passage from Jurassic Park where Malcolm talks about the dangers of the park. I was the only one she complimented but the thing is, I'm of Asian/Korean descent and we don't do that well in the acting industry.

If I had to go any route in life it would be to get into music and try to get some notoriety. Then I wanted to make my own clothing brand since I see so many other artists or celebrities in general with terrible merchandise. I'm more into Street wear and aesthetic clothing so it's even more egregious to see terrible clothing like the celebrity just slapping their name or logo on a product and calling it a day. Then after or during those, I wanted to get into acting/voice-acting as it seemed very interesting and something I would want to get into.

But to think like this is incredibly dumb and it's not realistic at all. I've been in College and I've switched majors a lot and it's made me disappointed in myself. When I pick a major, it's not even something I enjoy and it's something that I pick in general to have something and that's it. I've taken a multitude of tests to try and see what's right for me and nothing has fit me in the slightest.

I've always felt like a disappointment to my family and I just don't know what to do. Not to mention, there are other problems like I hate the way I look mainly because of some acne scars from my days as a middle schooler and scratching my face. I've been told by many people though that I look like a K-pop star but some people  are just nice. My insecurities arose when I get some comments once in a while like a jealous BF (who had their GF like me) call out my scars. I definitely want to get them fixed through a dermatologist one day but it's definitely holding me back as the reason why I am not trying acting is because of headshots. I don't even like looking in the mirror at myself let alone pictures or videos. It makes me think of how the actors who avoid looking at themselves in videos or pictures got a head start in acting in general. This is especially why I am thinking of voice acting and I've been trying to work on mimicking a lot of other cartoon/anime voices to increase my voice range.

Like I said though, none of this stuff is actually viable in the real world and like my username suggests, I'm basically talentless with no direction in life.

I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I feel as if I'm just coasting through life and time is just passing by. While I see people on the Facebook Feed, graduate and live fulfilling lives, I'm here with nothing to show for. I want to make my parents happy and I want to help them financially and it just sucks.

I just don't know what to do... I wanted to ask for opinions or advice on this because I'm lost. I know I'm depressed and I can be suicidal at times but I know I'll never kill myself because I'm a huge wuss that's scared of everything (including needles, the dark, being alone in an empty big house, doctors, dentists, heights, bugs, I have social anxiety when it comes to dealing with customers or giving a class presentation yet performing songs in front of people is fine and makes me quite happy, etc). I feel like dying would be fine though since I wouldn't have to live up to anyone's expectations (as well as my own) but the thought of leaving my GF or family also terrifies me and makes me sound a bit selfish if I didn't think about what would happen to them if I ever did die.

If you read this, sorry for the rant. My mind is racing and I don't know what to do. Thank you so much.",07Sep2020,1

Im 25 and my memory has become awful, i forget the names of everyday things or memories from 1 month ago, its so bad that my friends joke that i have Alzheimer's

Im constantly weak/tired, my sleeping pattern is awful and i can never fix it (sleep at 4am, awake at 2pm)

496,"Discmaimer: not saying everyone is slow besides me. Obviously I don't get stuck behind people who are faster than me lol. So sorry, I know I generalize some phrases, but when I say ""everyone"" I mean ""the large group of the population who seems to inconvenience me on a daily basis"".

So to start, I am long, lean, and fast paced. New York born and raised. Also have ADHD (and don't take my meds bc I don't like how they make me feel) so I'm always moving, cleaning.... just always doing something. 

As such, I get so fucking frustrated that others can be so unbelievably slow, and also always seem to be in the way!

Like I get that some people are faster than others, people have different strengths/ areas of expertise. 

For instance, I suck at math so I would imagine others might get frustrated with me as I would take an extra few seconds longer than the average Joe to come up with a math answer. I try to remind myself of these things, but depending on how frustrating yhe current situation is, it doesn't always help.

Mostly because, in my mind, (using the same example) if I suck at math and someone else is a savant, I would gtfo of the way so I don't hold them up and ill solve the problem over here and not be in their way as I will just hold them up longer than necessary. We both have our own pace, this person who is faster shouldn't suffer through my speed at something they excel at.

However, it seems hardly anyone else on this fucking planet also feels this way/ thinks of anyone else besides themself in that regard.

So I have reached the conclusion that I really must work on my patience.

If 90% of the population seems to feel that the rest of the world should have to wait for them -- it doesn't matter what anyone else is doing with their day -- because *they* want to spend a half hour at the register not knowing what they want to order, while the 8 people in line are forced to wait, while they say ""hmmm"" and ""uhhhh"" 9,000 times

..... or drive in the only lane on the road, going 30 under the speed limit, **refusing to pull over for the line of 20 cars stuck behind them**

.....speaking of driving, when people in rush hour drive three lanes across, refusung to lass each other, all cars going the same speed -- under the speed limit -- so nobody can pass, even though *as they're all going the same speed* they could **easily just drive behind one another and keep the same speed they're at** ffs without making the rest of the fucking county barely make it to work on time.

..... or standing in the dead center of the grocery store aisle with their full ass cart, and nobody can get around them bc they want to stare at canned soups for 20 minutes, and they can't seem to comprehend that if they moved just a foot to the right, then the rest of the people in the aisle besides them could get by and also shop at this place of business.

Like people are so fucking stupid. I really need to learn how to manage this frustration, as the average IQ isn't going up, and neither is the average walking speed.

I don't think I should have to alter my brain chemistry with medication, just to slow myself down due to stress caused by other peoples ability either.

I just need some tips from people who are more patient than I am, what are you secrets? Any advice?",07Sep2020,1
497,"Today I was talking to my friend, and I told him I wished life was guaranteed to end at 40. Or maybe 35. That would mean I need to survive hardly more than a decade. And he asked me how I felt about having lived more than half my life. And I said it gave me relief. Relief that I do not have to think beyond 35. And long term future is non existent. 

I have never wanted a partner or children. I am unable to understand the reason why people get into relationships or get married. All of that seems like a lot of work. Despite knowing the kind of negative investment they are going to make, why do people decide to get children. I never understood. And then I thought about one moment in my life that could be described as absolute happiness. I realize I lack that moment. I have never had the happiest moment in my life. 

I think this nature to be negative and moody is a weird gene that has no solution. I was born moody. It looks like I cannot change it either. But the irony is that my story has no twists. I have never been neglected, always was financially provided all the things I needed. Maybe had some childhood dilemma that comes from having  authoritarian parents but how long can you keep blaming your parents. 

I tried looking for happiness in my work, tried doing other work. But I ended up finding fault in everything. Something was too good for me, something was not good enough.

501,"Basically, I can’t sleep. My ex (of which we ended a 3 year relationship on good terms, I moved countries) called me out of the blue screaming into the phone. After calming everything down, she said that I raped her 1 time in our relationship. The incident happened at the start of our relationship (She was 14 I was 16). This is exactly what she told me btw, I have very little recollection, but this isn’t my account of events, hers. I went round hers as usual, we were watching a movie and I asked can we do it. She replied with no not now and I said ok, and we continued watching the movie cuddling. A couple of hours later I asked again, and she said yes, I went home, everything was great between us. It was never discussed until a year later, when she said that she only said yes because she wanted to make me happy, to which I replied never do that, only say yes when you actually want to. Then 2 years after we ended the relationship (last weekend) she called me screaming rapist into the phone and saying she’s going to contact my friends about me being a rapist. I don’t know what to do. I can’t sleep because I don’t know if I did or did not. I loved her, and she even agreed that she knows I would never rape someone, but continued to call me a rapist... I just don’t know what to do. Am I rapist? I can’t sleep. I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night with panic attacks and have been constantly on edge during the day.

I’m worried that if I manage to date him for longer (Or just anyone I were to date in general) and he says I love you I wouldn’t know if I could say it back.

508,"So recently my girlfriend started crocheting as a hobby and I’ve been openly supportive and she is always asking me questions about what to do next and what colors to use and she seems really excited about it. I’ve taken her to buy materials and it’s a blast. 

But I’ve noticed for the most part she only talks to me about it, she has made pieces for her family but she just kinda does it then doesn’t talk about it. She usually just likes to make things for me and her. I thought it was weird that she almost never involved her family.

Well she made a hat for the first thing she made and I have fought to get it (she did say it was for me) and is it perfect no, but I love it like crazy because she made it and made it for me. It’s something special to me and I plan to hold it like a trophy. 

While she was giving it to me her family just started being super critical about it and making a bunch of comments on how bad it was and I kept trying to counter them with compliments but I think it still gets to her. I’m guessing that’s why she doesn’t involve her family as much and now she is set on making another hat and taking back the first one.

511,"Hi! Despite the title seeming over dramatic, I am genuinely struggling with figuring out whether I may be about to blackmail someone (which I really don't wont to do!) Any advice would be appreciated.

Long story short: I pre-paid for driving lessons (20 to be exact) and have come to be unhappy with the instructor. He makes and takes calls while I drive, rearranges lessons last minute and used one of my lessons to run a personal errand (which was my final straw)

I have 7 prepaid lessons left and absolutely don't want to continue with him. I want to request a refund, but have seen lots of stories online of people who had a similar dilemma and 0 success on the refund front.

The blackmail bit:

I have legitimate grounds to make a formal complaint about the instructor's conduct (according to gov.uk).

In my written request for a refund, I am tempted to include that I have grounds to make an official complaint, in the hopes that this will encourage him to refund me.

Is this blackmail? I don't know if I'm overthinking things, but I want to be really careful not to do anything potentially unethical or illegal.

514,"Hello everyone! I have a few hundred bucks right now and I live with my parents, but I am really afraid of lowing low on funds (and while it wouldn't really be a problem now, I still need to make and save money somehow for when I do need it.)

I live in a house with several other adults, in a semi-rural area in the US away from the main town. I can't really rely on anyone else to take me anywhere though because everyone is busy all the time, and I don't have my own transportation. (Even biking would be quite a while.)  


Some things about me. I turn 22 years old in a few weeks. I'm currently enrolled at a well-known University but since classes are all online right now for this semester, it's cheaper for me to stay with my parents. I'm majoring in ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) so I'd say I'm good with computers, however I don't have much coding experience. I know how to do a little bit of photo/video editing here and there, at least when it comes to making memes. But not something I'd say I can do in a professional setting. My university gave me an iPad Air and I've been using it to practice drawing, but I don't think I have much experience, if any at all. (Though I do hope maybe getting good enough one day to do cheap commissions.)  


I'm somewhat limited to my room area so I can't really go out and apply for jobs in the nearby town. And most places probably wouldn't get back to me in the time before next semester starts anyway, so applying for a short-term job when I'm not sure if I'd even be able to get to it would seem rather moot. 

This is all I can really think of off the top of my head. I don't really need a consistent 9-5 job or anything, but just something to make a bit of money so I'm not just sitting here pushing myself into the negatives buying food for myself and all that.

To put it lightly, my mother has no energy and she's in pain all the time. My mother also doesn't have her driver's license as my grandfather never taught her and when my dad tried to teach her a few years back he yelled at her with us in the car (I was 10 at the time and my brother 12). Understandably this rattled my mother and after failing her driving test she didn't want to go again. So only my father and brother knows how to drive and I'm still learning.

Here is where the problem comes in. My dad isn't an emotional or sympathetic man at any means. He doesn't know how to handle emotions and thus through my mother being sick he hasn't given her much support, to the point of watching her cry in a hospital bed and doing nothing about it. He belittles not just her but me and my brother as well and he spends more time with his bike group than at home with my mother.

This is my part time job so I’m only there one or two days a week, and haven’t seen anyone working with out a mask there before. I grabbed the box of disposable masks my boss had up front and offered it to the two people working. They told me they had their own masks. I asked why they weren’t wearing them and they said that our boss has seen them working with out a mask on and doesn’t care. I told them it’s the law and the health department would care. They said our boss doesn’t care about the health department. I immediately called her and she said she never gave anyone an ok to work with out a mask on and asked to speak to the girl. When they hung up the phone both of them were laughing. My boss texted me and asked if they put masks on. They didn’t and I told her no, and she told me to tell them to put them on again and to tell them she can see them on camera. (Her cameras are broken.. but she doesn’t want people to know) I told her that I already told them once and they’re laughing at me and giving me the cold shoulder, she can tell them, they’re her employees. She calls again and speaks to both of them separately. They put a mask on but only cover their chin leaving their mouth and nose exposed, while preparing food. 
This week was the first week for indoor dining in my state and there’s a window on the kitchen door looking in and you can see them. I actually had two customers come in look at the pastries but after a minute of looking whispered to each other and left quickly without getting anything so I wonder if they did see them. When the other girl who works the front came in to close I asked her what’s up with these people not wearing masks? She said “I know they never do”. I also texted another person who works up front and asked her about it she said the same “they never do and it makes me really uncomfortable”. I don’t think anyone actually LIKES wearing a mask, but it’s the law so I wear it when I’m in public and especially when I’m at work dealing with customers or preparing drinks. My boss is just kind of neglectful of the business and barely comes in. We don’t have a manager or designated “person in charge” which is a health code violation. Also daily temperature checks are required for restaurant workers in this state and my boss has never done them, we don’t even have a thermometer. On top of other things, I’m practically certain the health department would shut it down if they went in there, which is why I feel like I would be the asshole. At the same time I feel like my boss is the asshole and deserves to get shut down when the best she can do to take care of her business is a phone call and never check in on how things are actually operating. She never even gave us any guidelines on working during a pandemic.",07Sep2020,1
532,"Hi, if you're taking the time to read this I really appreciate it. 

Some background info: I'm 19, Autistic and have a puppy. I just graduated high school after a pretty stressfull last term considering Corona and everything. I always had plans to take at least a year off before doing anything regarding further education, and my parents supported me in this as well.
 
So, what do I need advice about?

Once I graduated my parents nudged me towards at least applying to college as a second option if I didn't get a job, since if I were to stay at home they wanted rent, not much, but as a symbol that I'm now an adult and should pay for myself.

So I did apply for college, but kept looking for work. I didn't find anything and ended up getting into my first choice. My parents were really happy about it, and i'm not gonna lie, so was I.

After that I was up and out of the house with my puppy in less than two weeks, and i've lived a month on my own with him, and mind you, he requires a lot of work.

Every waking minute i'm either taking care of him, studying, cleaning or doing something proactive and to cope with all this stress I started drinking more and more coffee/caffeine products. And today I just fell apart.

The college study method isnt sticking to me, I feel like i'm falling behind in every subject even though I study daily. I feel like my pupper isn't getting all the love he needs and I keep forgetting to shower, eat or take care of laundry/personal hygiene. 

I need advice on what the hell i'm supposed to do in life, I can't take three years of this, but I also can't move back home since I study in another city + The only income I have is my student loans. I do want this degree, but I feel like i'm sacrificing my wellbeing, just to stay afloat.",07Sep2020,1

534,"So this all happened about six years ago.

I was 21, dumb and horny. I had a fake Facebook account and came across this random girl I didn't know IRL in another state who I started talking to. The conversations were never sexual or explicit, but I eventually got her to send me some underwear pics. They weren't nudes (you couldn't see any privates) and she wasn't doing anything sexy (sexual acts, posing) in the pics. 

Afterwards, I learned she was just short of her 18th birthday. I IMMEDIATELY cut off all contact, blocked her, and deleted the pics. 

Ever since, I've been feeling so incredibly guilty - especially lately. I never did that before or since, but I just feel so disgusting, considering myself not unlike those internet predators you hear about. 

Nothing has happened in those six years since, but I'm also always worried about the FBI booting my door in (since FB keeps things forever and she could report me at any time). It's getting to the point where I'm considering turning myself into the police or feds or whoever just to face the punishment for what I did. 

Anybody have any advice on how to go about turning myself in?",07Sep2020,1

541,"I am a small IT firm owner. The size of our firm was about 50+ during March, when the Covid lock-down started in India. Covid was not affecting in any of our revenue and financially everything was going good.  
During the lock-down (March last week), all of my employees are working from home. And within 1-2 months, I saw that there is a spike in productivity of the employees. Also I noticed that there is a huge pool of talent both freshers and experienced alike in the market who are desperate for jobs.   
So I devised a plan by end of June, to hire as many people as possible and started the process. So I hired about 20+ employees and the funds  to sustain these employees were found by adding one more project to our senior employees. Originally I was planning this expansion by 2023   
But after a month and a half, many of my senior employees complained about the work load and lack of personal time where as 3 of them resigned (quoting various other reasons, but in retrospective, I think it was the additional projects).   
Now I am having serious second thoughts.   
On one side, this is a great time to recruit as there are a lot of great talents out of job willing to work for a small company like us.   
But on the other hand, do I make the current employees (the ones which I had when the lock-down started) happy and make them feel safe and stable?  
Am I being a little too aggressive here?.",07Sep2020,1
542,"I’m a science student and just recently started my higher course at college after working my way up from the introduction course and then the National 5 course. And if I’m being honest with myself, I’m really not enjoying it. I’ve always hated the practicals and I’m terrible at maths and problem solving in general. I’m just scared of switching now because 1) i wouldn’t know what to switch to. And 2) I might not like what I switch to either. 

I’ve always liked the idea of law but I’m quite shy and not very confident so it probably wouldn’t actually be suited to me. I got caught up for a while in the idea of dermatology but that would obviously involve science. I also like art and although I’m good at it, I couldn’t see myself doing it as a career, more just a hobby. Career wise, money is important to me but I’d also ideally like something that I do relatively enjoy. 

So how does someone decide what the hell they want to do with their life and what they should study? I don’t want to end up wasting years of my life studying something I don’t like but I also don’t want to end up with a useless degree.

546,"So I found out yesterday that he had been talking to multiple girls (like pics and sexual texts). Had created multiple dating sites, but managed to keep it secret since the start of our relationship. I was hurt, couldn’t believe it. I trusted him. I really didn’t think he’d cheat, he would talk shit about my ex who cheated and all my friend bfs when I told him about how they recently got cheated. Anyway, found out when I was trying to login to our webcam, so yeah, guess it was God trying to open up my eyes. Like he would do things that were like iffy, but he always had a good excuse or accuse me of making things up. We would fight, he’d apologize and reassure me he loved me. Just in case someone asks if I saw it coming. I really didn’t, he was just so good at making believe he would never do anything wrong. So anyways this was last morning. He left work early, and texted me. We ended up talking on the phone for a few hours during the day. I was hurt, but I still wanted to see him, kiss him, deep down just forget and go back to being a couple. I ended up texting him last night asking if I could come over (I know I’m stupid) just wanted an explanation why, and maybe too hope to see that he’s hurt from the breakup :/ Just hurts being the only one being hurt by everything. Anyways, we talked, I let out my anger, he listened, he cried. Then he cuddled with me, then started kissing my cheeks, and led to us being intimate. I know I’m stupid but he reassured me he never met up with any of them and that he loved me (I know, why would you cheat on someone you love? he doesn’t love me, I know. But he made it seem like he does, so I fell for his lies in the moment ☹️)  Then this morning I woke up from a dream. It was a replay of my whole day yesterday, every message I saw. I took his phone and locked myself in the bedroom. Not sure why but I felt like there was more. So then I check the last place I’d think to check, his work chat. Right away I noticed one chick was silenced. I open and read, and notice he’s been fucking her. He would refer to me as a friend. Like I took care of his dog all week, and he told her that his dog was at a friends. So I felt bad for her, and messaged her and told her he had been dating me over a year.

Anyway, there’s a lot of fucked up shit he did. He lied a lot, throughout our relationship. He would tell me he would get off work late or that he couldn’t or didn’t have time to text on his breaks, and would always talk about someone from work. So now all the pieces are coming together. So yes, I’m mad, I’m mad he put all the girls before me. I’m mad that he didn’t give a shit about me. I struggled with taking care of 6 dogs that week, and there he was, fucking someone else. He had no remorse all these months. Yet, I don’t hate him. Why??? Like what’s the psychological reason??  I’m pissed at his actions, but I still feel bad for him (he might get fired and lose his apartment:/). I even helped him out this morning after I found out he’d been sleeping around. I just don’t get it. I’d like to know why I’m not mad at HIM, just mad at what he did. I just want to know what’s wrong with me??? I want to hate him soo bad. I still want him :( and I don’t want to anymore....

I think I need to be more secure but this happens almost involuntary, when I realized I am already all nervous and like a scare puppy that feels like I am going to get scolded just for talking, I am not a out-front person, so this is worst when I have to tell a bad news or when I want to suggest an idea and I feel like I am gonna be mock or belittle or scolded so I tent to avoid being the one speaking but my work demands that I be direct and tell my opinion or make suggestions and seal deals, and even stand my ground when I am right or I feel I am right, but I cannot even give an idea without feeling I'm losing it,

549,"There are other things like this, too, but nail clippers are the first that come to mind. My partner likes to take them from the place I designate for them (because this happens so much) into other rooms to clip their nails (rather than doing it in the bathroom or something, which I usually do, because I got tired of having to buy new clippers every two weeks.)

I keep telling them, ""dude, stop taking them out of the bathroom if you want to stop losing them,"" but they just. Keep. Doing. It.

Then they ask me, ""Where did you leave the clippers?""

*I left them where they're supposed to be, because I'm tired of buying new ones.*

I've bought my own designated ""this is my one, single clippers, please don't use it because you will lose it like you lost the last 10"" but. Lo and behold, they get taken and lost anyway.

Yesterday, I was kind of annoyed that this has already happened so much and told them, ""can you stop taking them out of the bathroom because you keep losing them"" and he got all defensive like, ""I don't lose them, *you* lose them!"" — we eventually found three pairs in his side room. 

I need advice, ya'll. I'm at the point where I'm going to have to get a goddamn bicycle lock for my nail clippers or other little necessities like that which keep getting lost.

Last time we cleaned the SO's side room (it's technically a guest room, but we never have guests, so I just told him, ""hey do you want a man cave? go nuts with it, idc"") we found like. Five clippers and handfuls of other things we'd kept losing (his room's a mess, really.)

551,"I'm starting my sophomore year tomorrow, and am supposed to be taking precalculus. This means I'm ahead of most people my age, even though I honestly have no idea how. Algebra 1 was tough for me, and I almost failed geometry (I was lucky to be in middle school and I had a teacher that let me retake a lot of my tests). Algebra 2 was cut off midway because of coronavirus so I have no idea if I remember anything in it, but grades wise I did okay in it I guess. 

The thing is though, that I really don't enjoy math. It's just been a subject I've been required to do even though I hate it. And now I'm at a point where I can not do it for a year and still be fine, and that's what I want to do. 

There are more things I dislike about math that don't necessarily have to do with the content itself. For example in the school district that I've been in since freshmen year I am one of the only people at my age on the track I'm on. This leads to me feeling kind of lonely because theres like less then 10 other kids in my grade at my level of math. Not only that, but those kids are actually smart, and a little bit of the annoying type of smart (cocky and smart). I myself am a pretty average student.

I am still taking tough classes this year as well, like APUSH, chemistry, and honors English. Not many people at all take APUSH in my grade but history is always something I've been able to tolerate, and my friends from my old school district have already taken it and are giving me their notes so I'm alright with APUSH.

If I don't take precalculus this year then I will probably take some physics class so that I have all of my science credits out of the way (I'm not too fond of science). Or psychology which is something I'm interested in. Then next year I will take precalculus.

556,"Okay, so here’s the thing with a little context... TL;DR at end of post. 

My mother is 43, and after a few dietary changes in the past couple of years, is pretty healthy. She has a modest life insurance policy, and while growing up, my brother and I have been her beneficiaries. 

My brother is 22, lives with our mother, pays no rent, and when she talks to him about their living situation, tells her that he has BIG plans to move out VERY SOON... nope. He eats her food, leaves the apartment a mess, and doesn’t follow her few rules. One example is not smoking weed in the apartment. We, as a family, have no problem with anyone doing it, but my mother works in the medical field and doesn’t want to risk her job by being exposed as home. He makes nearly $30,000 annually, and blows all of his money on concerts, trips, and other nonsense, but can’t help our mother who works two part-time jobs (16 hours a night) six days a week with rent or any bills. My father is diagnosed bipolar and my brother, being the ripe age of 21, shows all of the signs and behaviors that point towards it too. My mother, working with similar patients has expressed her concerns to my brother many times and he refuses to see a specialist. He is unpredictable, and at least once a month, vows to leave and never come back to our family because he hates us. 

My relationship with my mom was strained for a really long time due to the stress she had taking care of my sick grandma who had stage four lung cancer throughout my childhood, working a lot of hours to pay hospital bills, and dealing with two kids on her own. Now that I’m an adult and moved out, it has been much better and she’s proud of me for not being like my brother who is three years older than me. I work hard, and I’ve struggled with bills, but I’ve taken on a second overnight job just to stay where I am instead of giving up. Overall, I’m the responsible child. 

My mother texted me this morning asking for my SSN and email, and I didn’t think anything of it. Then she sent me a message that said, “Don't tell your brother. I put u as my soul beneficiary for my life insurance.”

...

I dislike my brother sometimes; I’ll be honest about that. I want to respect my mother’s confidentiality, but I feel awful keeping this from him. I know her decision is the right one because my brother LIVES for money and blowing it, and all I want to with the money is throw her ashes off of a cliff in Ireland like my mother has always wanted. I know my brother would use the money poorly with no regrets, and that would break my heart because my mom is working hard every day to add to her policy for our well-being...

I want my brother in my life when she passes, but with his aggression and selfishness, he will never forgive when he finds out that he isn’t a beneficiary. I don’t want to tear my family apart and I don’t want to rat my mom out. What do I do?

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Thank you for your time!

TL;DR: mother named me sole beneficiary over my irresponsible brother and told me to keep it a secret. Is that okay?",07Sep2020,1

Hello guys I'm 20 years old and for the last year of my life I haven't enjoyed drawing for even a minute. I keep on drawing, learning about it, watching my favorite artists but I find myself happier when I do other things like working out or learning a new language. When it's time to draw I just don't find any meaning. I keep asking myself ""should I try this? Should I try that? Maybe that's for me, maybe it's the other one etc."" Thanks to that overthinking I feel very exhausted and never actually get to any conclusion of what I want to do. Drawing feels like a painful ""must-do"" work. If I don't enjoy it, it makes me depressed and due to this depression I can't focus on the actual subject that I'm studying at University (economics) then what's the purpose of doing it? Due to my stress I've had 0 interest in everything else in life, even hanging out with good company, talk, laugh and connect with people.

What I wanted to create eventually was concept characters from my imagination but I found out that it is extremely hard. Seriously, mastering perspective and human anatomy counts like actual WORKING, not to mention that you have to memorize stuff like weapons, shoes, clothes and eventually learn how to paint, so if I don't do this for a living and the process makes me feel like crap then what's the point of doing it? I tried it, I've seen improvement, but it still makes me feel empty. I can guarantee you that it's not due to laziness, I can sit for 5 hours trying to understand/memorize chinese characters instead because I love doing it and it feels awarding to me.

But anyway, actually making the decision to quit drawing feels like I'm killing a part of myself, maybe a part that needs to be killed. I'm thinking about trying some other form of art, because I don't want to remove art of my life completely. I think that learning how to play music will be a better choice for me, because it's still an art form and after you memorize a song you can play it easily again and again, enter the flow state, but also enjoy yourself. I really want an opinion about my situation. Should I try playing music for a couple of months and see how it goes? Did you have ever any similar experiences? Any advice will help.",07Sep2020,1

My fear is that my partner might not want me anymore, or that they will use it against me as blackmail, because it's very, very sensitive and could lead to some kind of social suicide. If this information ever reaches the ears of my family, I'd not hesitate to kill myself over it. It's THIS dark.

It is a double edged sword sometimes in that I have a small group of great people I can call friends, but at the same time it is hard to make friends with new people that I may not be able to trust. 

This year in college I made an aquaintence which I certainly would not call my friend. The relationship has been somewhat one sided in that I feel like she asks a lot of me and sometimes asks questions that I feel she only wants to use for gossip material to others (I hate gossip). Ex.. send me this material, send me that... , how much money are you making, who was your ex boyfriend etc. She is now in the same class as me just because she heard I was in it and I have a strong feeling she'll try and ask me to send her my homework. 

I recently asked her if she could do a very small favor for me and she refused.

I really have no doubt she is using me and would really like to cut her off but also not burn a bridge as we will be working at the same tech company post grad.

570,"Hello. Apologies in advance for any layout mistakes, I'm on mobile.

So about a month ago, my(20f)boyfriend (20m) got a new apartment. He doesn't have a job, I have a part time job, just enough to pay my part of rent + food + whatever. It's fine, we have enough saved to be able to live here for several months while he looks.

This isn't the problem. My boyfriends friend recently broke up with her boyfriend and got kicked out of his house. Her family is abusive, and she is apparently pretty mentally ill, meaning she cannot hold down a job. It's a shittyass situation to be in, so we offered her our couch, since my bf also has been in a situation where he had nowhere to go.

Now he just informed me it's probably gonna take several weeks before she can leave. Which kinda worries me. First of all, we can't have a third person living here according to our lease, secondly, I'm the only one out of three who can pay rent, food, etc, and thirdly, we have a guest 24/7 which just honestly puts me on edge all the time. Something about not being able to ever relax completely. I know she obviously has it worse, but idk.

I just need to know if I'm an asshole if I figure that it's too much for me to have her here the entire time her case is being processed. If not, how do I approach this? I won't just kick her out, but there aren't any homeless shelters, and I feel that that's really shitty to tell her to go there.

580,"Hi.

Today was my first day of high school, and tbh, I am a bit worried.
First, I think that I didn't do well considering making some connections/ friends.
Of course, I didn't expect to be friends with everyone the first day, but I think that I took the wrong path.
I didn't do anything stupid, nor have I made any enemies but I just don't like how I ""reacted"". I didn't find courage to talk to my classmates. I am interested in making them, but don't really know how. For now, the only firends that I have got in the school are my middle school friends that I'm good with, but we don't go to the same class.



Secondly, I am a bit worried about my free time, grades (potentially) and stuff like that. In my first 8 years of education, I usually finished with mostly A's or worst case scenario B's without any stress and need of studying whatsoever. But, the problem with my HS is next: it extremely hard and time demanding. I know this, and in a way, it was some kind of a reason why I enrolled.
But, today my teacher has given our class this week's subject schedule and it has really scared me. 
I knew that it was gonna be hard, but I didn't know that it would drain the life out of me.



But yeah, here are my questions:

1. 

Connected with the 1st paragraph:
How to start to make connections/ friendships?


2.

2nd paragraph:

How to make myself study, even when I'm not feeling like it?
How to organise time better?

She says to give it 24 hours and we can pick them up today. Now i will say that since Saturday she has been pretty unresponsive and zero communication. We had basically no information only that they were ill.

I went grocery shopping and went to the liquor store next store to pick up a six pack, where I noticed a homeless man wandering in and out of the door begging college kids for money. I was at the register when the clerk told him to “fuck off and die somewhere already.” 

I left and kept my head down, both hands full of groceries and then I noticed in the corner of my eye he was trailing me pretty closely-looking for an opening to snatch something. I told him to “give me some space” to which he just started saying “what!?” louder and louder and eventually he was grabbing at my arm and bags, trying to provoke me into fighting him presumably so I’d drop the groceries. I told him to fuck off one more time and dropped the six pack after he punched me in the face once. 

I was so disoriented I just walked away and told him to take the beer, and he just started yelling and smashing the bottles in the street- he’s clearly not well. 

So one thing I learned was to do my shopping with a backpack to keep my hands free, but I’m having trouble with what to do if he confronts me again.

My Aunt was only 59. She was driving from Ca to Az in the middle of the day when she somehow got on the wrong side of the road and had a head on collision. I don’t know if she died immediately but she didn’t make it to a hospital. We got a call from the coroners office late that night when we we’re calling highway patrol hours after she should have arrived. I am just in shock. I still cannot believe it. My mom(her sister) is absolutely crushed. She just lost her mom (my grandma) only a year ago and now her sister. I cannot bear to imagine what she is feeling but this is a life changing experience and I don’t know what to do. My mom can not handle another loss. She lost it last night when we told her. We can’t visit the coroner office until Tuesday because of Labor Day. This has absolutely crushed us. I still can’t believe it. I don’t want to. I spent the entire night trying to find a news article about the crash but nothing has shown up. I just can’t bear the fact that she died alone in the middle of no where and not a chance to say goodbye or anything. The idea that she is laying alone right now in a coroners offices instead of passing peacefully surrounded by family sickens me. No one deserves to go like that. My cousins (their mom) found out about the crash themselves. Their dad is with them. They’re from Canada. She was supposed to take a flight from Az to go see them. She was so close.

We kissed a lot, danced all night between 1am and 9am. He would follow me everywhere, e.g. when I wanted to join back my friends and hang out/dance with them. He would follow with (not in a creepy way). He introduced me to his friends which were super nice. I remember him asking me during the rave if i wanted to follow back to his place. It was a bit far tho he told me so i said nah and that i wanted to dance more which he was gladly okay with and we stayed till 9am. He asked for my number while dancing also. He was cute and rly nice, just not very manly but i guess thats fine.

Anyways he texted me after the rave (yesterday) hoping i got home safe and sound and asked me if id like to meet again which i agreed to :). The only thing is when we met we were under drugs and I hope he knows its just not gonna be the same at all when we meet again. And it might be a bit awkward. How is he thinking? Also he kept on texting me during the day yesterday, just chatting. He wished me goodnight and also texted me today at 8am to wish me good morning and a good day at work. What does he want? Could he be doing all this effort but only wanna hook up? Or you guys think he wants smthg more? Does he know its not gonna be the same at all when we meet again?

Ps. I told him i dont remember anything from the rave (cuz i honestly dont. But i do remember snippets of kissing him. My friends were watching over me tho so i was safe. But yeah he told me ""we exchanged some hugs and a tad more"").",07Sep2020,1
600,"So me and my best friend are both guys both 18, so I am the giving type I love to give and make people happy. His birthday last year I got him some 250$ shoes and he was thankful, later that same month because our birthdays are in the same month he Never got me anything I wasn’t mad. This year I got him some 300$ slides and let him have a brand new pair of 200$ shoes I already owned just never wore and let him have them, same thing happens I get nothing not even a card for my birthday. I know you shouldn’t give to receive but this is my best friend I’m talking about 2 years in a row he never got me anything, and you can’t say maybe he’s broke because he’s not he has money. Please don’t come in the comments and try to call me selfish or anything like that because I’m pretty sure if you spent that much money on your best friend and they never even got you anything back you would feel some type of way as well.

601,"Over the past few months, a neighbor (M 51) had been stalking and harassing me (F 31) to the point where I had to let work know and I didn't feel safe in my own home.
It is quite complicated. For simplicity, I'll just say that he is a convicted felon and drug addict with lives across the street from me. He rents a triplex and I own my own home. This is a transitional neighborhood and it seems that his dislike of my family is purely socioeconomic and sexually-motivated (he is attracted to me). He is friends with the neighbors next to me and on either side on him. Ive had my own issues with their bad behavior (letting their kids destroy my yard, blocking my driveway repeatedly, hitting my car, and lying to the cops about it when I had it on camera). My husband had to confront him over his leering and shaking his genitals at me. This confrontation happened in the middle of our street and his neighbor friends all sat on their porches and egged him on to hit my husband. I did not trust these people to accurately describe what they witnessed to the cops which was him approaching my husband aggressively. One even suggested he run when the cops came. 

Anyway, he's dead. The last time I saw him was August 22nd and he harassed my family every day so this was very odd. My husband and I jokingly talked about our hopes that he was dead or something. 

On the morning of September 3rd, my husband got me out of bed to look at the cop vehicles blocking our driveway and the investigation van. Some time later, we saw his body being dragged out in a body bag. A woman showed up who is his girlfriend. She was looking for the SS card he was withholding from her since she had a PFA against him. The property manager spoke with her about how he's much happier now and they both seemed very happy he was dead. 

Let me tell you that I am pregnant and the smell of the rotting body made me vomit. It was a smell I won't soon forget. It's obvious that he wasn't found for at least a week since it isn't hot and I could smell him across the street. 

The property manager put all of his possessions on the porch to go out with the trash. Turns out that his neighbor friends were all at work when this happened. Their comments about the stuff on the porch leas me believe they have no idea what happened to him. There's no obituary and no social media recognition of his death. I can see that his close friend who just came back from vacation is confused. 

So the advice I want is if I should tell these awful people what happened or if I shouldn't say anything. I honestly hate all of these people for bullying me in this neighborhood for no good reason. 

Do you think it is worse to be forgotten and your death be unknown or do you think letting these friends know would be better?",07Sep2020,1
602,"Hi there -

My dads Pomeranian seemed to have dislocated her hip the other day. the emergency vet put it back in place, however today it seemed to hopped up a stair (not sure how that happened with my dad watching her........) and either redislocated the hip again or hurt the other one and she's back on her way to the vet.

I do not think they need to put the dog down because of this. probably just let it rest for a few weeks and keep her from using her hips and needs to be watched like a hawk so she's not hopping stairs again. has this happened to others, and is there a sling or something that will help keep off of her back legs for a few weeks?? or harness? just thinking of when she needs to go outside, maybe a harness my dad could use to prop up her bottom half so she can atleast go potty.",07Sep2020,1

605,"I've never really cared for confrontation much. Not because I'm afraid of it, or am weak (mentally or physically) or anything like that. I just prefer going with the flow, letting people do them, and I just swallow things. Or, if someone *knows* something is bothering me, I'll downplay it, and only give them a part of the issue, to the point that nothing has to change, they are just aware of my issues.

It hasn't been an issue for awhile, but for the last month or so, I find myself being constantly stressed, and my patience is paper thin. I feel like I have no control, or (almost worse) I feel like the little bit of control I do have isn't *actually* mine, if that makes sense.

I know the short answer is ""just stop bottling things inside, and you won't have these issues"". But after 28 years of acting one way, it's kind of hard to just pivot immediately. So yeah, any advice to stop just letting things go, and take more control?",07Sep2020,1

608,"For context, I’m a 15yo. My mom’s entire side of the family and herself are from Brasil, and since we’re citizens (which extends to my stepfather) we’re legally allowed to travel there. My parents want to go there for three weeks during Christmas break to see family.

From what I can tell, it seems pretty obvious that the situation there isn’t being handled well and is only going to get worse. We already went to Florida for vacation this summer (stupid idea, I know. I wish I had more say in it), and we were very lucky not to get Corona. 

I’m scared we’re not going to be as lucky this time. A lot of my family is poor, so I’m sure many cannot afford to stay at home or social distance, which increases the likelihood that they might get Corona and pass it on to us. That’s not even accounting for non-family that we might be around in public.

My dad is 65 with lots of health problems. If he gets sick and dies, we don’t have a house here to live in because the one we’re living in is going to his son (my step-brother), who doesn’t give a single shit about my mom, my little brother, and I. My mom also doesn’t have a source of income right now.

I want to convince my parents to stay home because there’s no reason we should be travelling to another damn country right now, for family or not, but I feel like I don’t have a say in this. I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do.

If I were to try to convince them, how would I even go about it? My dad’s the kind of person who throws around ‘well the FLU kills more people each year, so Corona isn’t BAD’ and my mom stays clean and takes it a bit more seriously, but thinks things will go back to normal soon.

If I’m forced to go, what am I supposed to do about that? We have our own house there, but we’re going to have to be around family. Plus, It’s going to cut into my school time once break is done during classes I have to attend virtually from 7:25 - 12:30, along with getting 2 hours of work each day. I don’t want to get distracted.

613,"(TW rape, self harm, suicidal thoughts)
Throw away account because I know my rapist uses reddit and so do my friends and current boyfriend. Im sorry I know this is all going to be a jumble of a story because I haven't told many people.
Last year I started dating this guy and he got me incredibly drunk on my birthday and continued to have sex with me after I said 'no' and even tried to physically tried to push him off of me. It was until i started sobbing uncontrollably where he stopped. After that he made me comfort HIM saying hes a terrible person and all that and I fell for it. He admitted later he assaulted me again that night after I blacked out.
This cycle continued for 6 months while we dated because he manipulated me into seeing him as two different people and he couldn't control his sexual urges. There were even a few times where he told me when I didn't want to be on top during sex it was my fault he raped me. He also wanted to have sex with me while I ignored him and scrolled on my phone. Looking back I do think it was a kink. He'd also get mad at me when I would say no to sex a few times in a row saying ""ive been good so you should just give me this one.""
We finally broke up 6 months after. I told him i dont see myself marrying my rapist someday. He told me he wasnt going to tell his family and friends we broke up because he didnt want them to know the truth about what he did. I ended up blocking him on everything except instagram to see if he ever gets a new girlfriend because i feel some responsibility to make sure this all never happens again.
Long story short he did get a girlfriend. 
Not only that but on top of everything else my therapist office was completely shut down because of covid. With my birthday/day of the first time he raped me coming up, I am having a harder and harder time. Ive self harmed and have been crying almost every time. I lay down to sleep because thats when I relive the things he did to me. I feel like I need some kind of closure that doesnt involve going to court and reliving those moments like that.
His mother and step dad absolutely loved me and even once said if we ever broke up they'd probably take my side 😬 I still have his moms phone number and want to text her telling her what happened not only for closure but to also protect any other person he gets into a relationship with. Should I? I will also take advice on how to take back my birthday for myself instead of having it as a terrible reminder of what happened to me. My boyfriend suggested I move my 'birthday' a day forward.

614,"When we first started living together. We all were assigned bills to take care of. I was given gas and electricity.

 This would be fine except for the fact I’m honestly appalling with asking people for money, I’m quite an anxious person so the idea of demanding money off people really stresses me out. 3/4 of my flatmates have paid about a third of the bills but the rest have been piling up for sometime due to my inability to ask them for money. 

This in total has put me in about £900 debt. 

3/4 of my flatmates now owe me about £200 whilst the other owes £300 (she didn’t pay me even when I asked her to). I decided today enough was enough before the situation became worse but inevitably the outcome of this was still pretty bad.

615,"Ok sorry for the clickbait ass title but now that I have yalls attention I could really use some serious advice. 


So I am a 18 year old male right. From the time I was probably around 9 I have been seriously overweight. Well queue me being 17 and just graduated back last December I decided to make a change. I started extreme calorie cutting and busting my balls exercising. Ok I weighed nearly 280 pounds (I'm 5'10 btw) (20 stone for my europeans as well) and queue 8ish months later I am now 165 pounds (11.5ish stone) (still 5'10 obviously) and not to toot my own horn but I have turned out I would honestly say extremely good looking and I have not seen anyone that I use to know because of this whole COVID thing and having not talked to anyone outside my immediate family and 2 of my extremely tight homies. 

And i honestly don't know what to do. I mean how do I go about dating? I mean I have never ever bothered with dating because I knew I'd never find someone up to my standards and be with them cause I was a fat ass. But now I have meet a couple of girls out in public (yes I usually wear a mask but there has been maybe like a dozen cases were I didn't. Usually at socially distanced outside events.) And literally practically all these chics have flirted with me openly and I do not know what the fuck to do. Note all these chics were average looking to one of them being what I would consider a model and I almost pissed my pants when she walked up to ME to talk. I mean I know how to flirt back etc I am fairly charismatic and so forth. But I mean when it comes to like taking the next step. I don't have a fucking clue. I mean I am a virgin right. Like I said. Never gave a shit about girls really prior. But now I could *probably* get laid in a ghost town if I wanted to. but here is where the problem arises.... I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK TO DO.  

I mean is it ok for me to be kinda cocky and hot headed? I have turned out similar to how my dad looked and he was in a semi famous band back in the late 80s early 90s who toured and he said in around the 8ish years they toured he slept with nearly 800 women give or take. And he actually has proof in Polaroid cause you know who looked up to gene simmons, yep him. And he told me to be bold like people in movies cause that's what worked for him. But then again even though me and him are good looking he was also a borderline famous rockstar so he could probably do that. I'm good looking but not famous. 


So I guess my question is how should I handle my new found powers if you will lmfao. 

Also lemme rephrase what I said earlier. I have met a couple people from school outside of my immediate friends (whom I kept updated on my weight loss) and absolutely none of them recognized me. 

I now have a strong jaw line, I actually have a nice nose not to big, not to small, and a decent bridge to it, my chin is nice and pronounced. I am also getting close to having a good six pack. How ever my arms are extremely toned which is what I'm most proud of. And to answer the age old question yes, women don't really compliment muscles. Perhaps once you get on a intimate level but I have not been there yet. It's mostly been homies and other men who compliment my physique.",07Sep2020,1

617,"PLEASE, any advice is very welcome.

I've been spending some months at my sister's apartment, because I was too naive to think it was a good idea. I was living at my parents' house. At my parent's, there's my mother, who is a narcissistic bipolar and borderline person who refuses to get treatment. It's an extremely toxic environment. I then decided to go to my sister's house, in another city, to spend some time here, and maybe work online, but here's the thing: she lives with an extreme abusive and alcoholic husband. She's a victim of constant  domestic violence, but every time I bring it up she's protective of her husband. She doesn't seem that wants to leave this relationship. I even talked to psychologists and lawyers about her case do have some back up to talk to her, but they said that if the victim doesn't want to leave, there's nothing to be done. She also has two sons, and one is autistic. Because of the toxic environment they are living, they all are developing behavioural and psychological symptoms from an alcoholic and emotionally absent father. The autistic one is constantly having meltdowns (autistic meltdowns, that are not tantrums) and yells constantly. I'm autistic myself and every time he yells and throws things, I get extremely anxious because I'm sensible to sound, specially the screams of a kid but since I'm an adult (38 y/o), I'm ""supposed"" to behave like one. I took some books and watercolour and other things with me in hopes I could finish some books I'm developing, and to do some online work (translation, and other things), crafts to sell online, but it's been almost two months I'm here and there wasn't a single day I could have a piece of mind to sit down and concentrate to actually do something without being interrupted. I have earbuds, earplugs, but they are not enough for the sounds and physical interuption. I've been trying to meditate, but i'ts also impossible because the younger one doesn't understand what I'm doing so he keeps climbing on me and pushing me to fix a toy or something like that.

And what is killing me most is seeing my sister's husband drinking everyday (he's been working from home, but he locks his room so he won't be interrupted) treating her like shit, ignoring his own sons' existence, not helping her with house chores at all. 

My nephew, my brother in law here, and my mother and father, they are all from the risk group, so I can't work outside, because everywhere people are not wearing masks. In Brazil people are literally acting as if there was nothing happening.

So, I have no idea what to do. I can't work outside, I can't work inside. I have skills for both, but I can't do anything. don't have an income, and I don't have anywhere else to go. I'm sinking in anxiety and depression every day. I have the equivalent of 37 dollars in my account.

I was working at a restaurant and left because of the pandemic. At the time, I was looking for houses to rent with another person, than the pandemic exploded and I got unemployed, so renting a house is not an option anymore.

It was built so all the backyards slowly drain into several outlets placed throughout, that then go to one of the retention ponds.  I don't actually understand it completely, but for the most part it is considered standard subdivision stuff.  When it rained really hard our backyard would develop a rather large puddle until it dried up a bit and did what the drainage was supposed to do.  No biggie.  A few years ago the ""puddle"" would become much larger and not drain for days.  We thought it was a particularity heavy rain season, so we just dealt with it.  Then it happened the next year.  Not a particularity heavy year, but whatever, then again the next year.  Most of the summer the area back there is wet and our dog can't go back there without getting muddy and it just never gets dry, we joke it's a lake when it's been raining hard.  Our neighbors have been here for 30 and both have been retired for as long as we have been here but they aren't old.  She is a master gardener and he an avid builder, so they putter in their back yard all the time.  They have a lovely dog that is very well behaved and we used to occasionally chat amicably.   Everything seemed fine with them but we just found out - They are the reason why our backyard won't drain.  He built a fountain in their backyard, near our adjoining fence and they put in a barrier along the fence that won't allow our rainwater to get to the drain.  Effectively creating our ""pond"".

621,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been dabbling on and off (mostly not using) with nicotine products since my mid-late teens. I always enjoy the initial feeling, but then typically feel like shit afterwords.

Recently, I learned about nicotine being used as a nootropic (boosting mind function) and found nicotine gum as a “healthier” way of getting to that point. While I do agree that it does help my brain think more, I also have noticed myself going from 1-2 pieces to at least 3-4 in the past couple weeks. These are 4mg pieces of gum, which is fairly high I believe. 

Nicotine, as we all know, is addicting AF. I think it might be harming my sleep (depending on when I chew it). I have also noticed myself feeling like shit in periods that I am not using this gum. 

So overall, today, I haven’t chewed a piece yet and it is early afternoon. I drank a bit last night but got decent sleep. I do feel a bit drowsy and cloudy. Is this normal?

So the main honest question is - should I just quit this stuff now? Should I do it cold turkey? Will it suck? Like I said, I like the initial buzz, but it seems like it starting to turn negative.",07Sep2020,1

So about 8 years ago,my father died and I was only 12. I don’t think I ever accepted what happened( obviously) but I also never really learned how to deal with it. I never talk about him. And everytime a conversation about family pops up in a friend group I immediately get stiff and try to change the subject. I panic so hard that someone might ask me what my father does or idk how old is he because then I have to tell them that he died. I am terrified of this, it happened so many times and everytime I feel the same way. I don’t really mention him to my friends. I don’t acknowledge the fact that he died. And everytime someone asks about my family I always tell them I live with my mom and thats it. I never mention that I don’t have a dad or that he died or anything. 
My friend told me couple of weeks ago that she noticed how other people who lost a loved one actually talk about them or say that their mom died that year, or their father used to do that and that and how I never do it.  Also when I actually mention my dad it’s always something small, mostly when or how he died and I only answer questions, I never say this on my own. When I talk about him I’m either 100% emotionally detached or about to cry. There is no inbetween. I can’t really talk normally about it. I don’t even know if all my friends know how he died. And I especially can’t talk about this with my mother. She just starts crying everytime and I feel so uncomfortable because I don’t want her to cry and because I don’t know what to say.  I said two times that I miss him outloud.

I know one time I was out with my friends and one friend was saying how her aunt died couple of weeks ago and how much she misses her and how she can’t believe that it happened. She was very emotional and I was just sitting there not being able to say anything, like someone sealed my lips. I wanted to comfort her but I literally didn’t say anything bc I didn’t know what. 
I feel like I’m literally trying to forget that my father existed and I pretend like I never had one. I have his journal and I still didn’t read it. Not because I don’t want to, I just can’t. 

And then suddenly it just hits me. Suddenly I realize he is not in my life anymore because he died. And then I just start crying. This happens randomly, I can’t really control it. When i’m doing my make up, when im in school, when im waiting for a train, everywhere.

I talked to my mom about how worried I feel and how long I have been doing so but she just tells me that it’s just “teenage things” and “I can just destroy the fear I’m feeling by thinking so” it’s honestly really stupid and I have read things like that countless times online that I feel sick of it and the fact that she is telling me that too just makes me upset.. it has gotten out of my hands and I don’t think I can control it",07Sep2020,1
627,"I'm 22m living at home still, I want to move out, get a car and go to uni. Financially I just feel thin and that's before i've even went to a uni where i'm going to have to pay tuition. I work a minimum wage job that's essentially... A dead end job, there's no room for movement as they are firing managers because of covid. Some months my wage is £950, other months, like this month where £750.

My mum that I live with, i'd say shes just on the breadline, shes making enough to pay the bills but has little after that. I also have 3 siblings, that are have all moved out already and i'm the last stuck at home.

Because my mum is not well off, she tells me to pay rent (£200month) then she also expects housekeeping as well which is money for petrol, food and electricity. some months this ends up being £600 a month I pay.

Its just that I see everyone else that went to my school, go to uni or live on their own, getting married, getting their 3rd car. and i'm left with about £200-£300 to spend on drivers lessons and public transport as well as lunches and various things. 

Am I going to be stuck in a rut like this forever? I live in an area where the only jobs going are IT jobs that pay 30k+ but you need to go to uni for that, or jobs in the hospitals where I would dread to work, especially at the minute. No where else is really hiring at this very uncertain moment.

I feel like giving up mentally and physically. I spent my years of dreaming of FINALLY moving out and going to college. I’m 25 and had just left the family house. Just as I started making friends stupid COVID has us online and I’m back home again. My parent is terminally ill and refuses to seek medical treatment for the cancer. I’m in a relationship with a guy that can be emotionally abuse, possibly cheating, controlling, and could care less if we broke up. But doesn’t want me to date anyone outside of him and has made it clear he wants no future past dating. I’ve pushed away my male friends for him and he’s the only one I see and then sometimes he doesn’t want me around. A couple months ago he turned a little physical. He’s not a bad guy at all but I think he’s a little broken too.
My father’s side of the family rejects me. And the only parent I have, has her life hanging by a thread. I feel like nothing in my life is stable. All my friends have either moved away for school or relationships that turned into marriage. I’ve reached out to my school for counseling but I am so ashamed that I stopped taking the counselors calls.

634,"So I recently found out that my ex used me during our relationship. Finding out really blew a hole in my self esteem and the anger I experienced after finding out was frightening to say the least. I've never gotten that angry, it was to the point where I felt my heart physically ache and burn. I've never had to actually lay on the floor and listen to music at 1AM in order to try and calm down while shaking. Maybe that sounds dramatic, but I've never had that happen to me. Right now I am conflicted with the choices to

1. Confront him myself and ask him to spill everything (this could result in ruining of my close friend and my ex's friendship (since he doesn't know that I know) --they've known each other for a long time, and my friend wants to try and help him still because they're just a great friend like that, they want him to take responsibility and apologize to me)
2. Ask my friend who showed me their messages between them to tell him to apologize to me

or 3. Not even ask for anything at all.

However, I do want to know what he has to say for himself. I guess its curiosity that's really leading me to want to know what he has to say for himself. I guess it also gives me the opportunity to express my own feelings as to how hes contributed to my perspectives on love and myself. But then again, why even expose those sensitive details about myself to him?  It really sucks. So, what I am asking for is: what do I do? And How should I proceed? Should I really get my curiosity get the best of me? I mean, it could serve me in the future. I just really want to know everything.",07Sep2020,1

638,"hi everyone, i'm just gonna start out by saying that i know deep down what i've done is terribly wrong and i realize that i have to live with it :/ bash me all you want but i'm really here for constructive advice

so basically let me start from the very beginning. i got my heart broken by my ex around the end of february of this year, and when i found out he had already found someone else after two weeks i was a mess. the day after i found out about his new girlfriend, however, i met a guy that would later become my current boyfriend. let's call him Daniel. he asked for my social media at my work and we spent two months in the talking stage before becoming official. everything was perfect until i got a text from an old acquaintance (if you would call it that, we had lunch together once back in high school. he was the new kid and he ended up moving back to chicago soon after) asking to hang out. Let's call him Joseph. as it turns out, he lived only two doors down from me and we went for a quick coffee run. i thought that was the end of it, but we continued to text (as friends) and go out to dunkin about once a week. while i was shy at first and made it clear that i had a boyfriend, the more we hung out the closer we became and he quickly earned the Best Friend status. Daniel knew of him briefly, and even got to meet him when Daniel and I ran into him while on a date. Joseph left for Chicago for the weekend, and I told Daniel he was leaving for good, so I didn't tell him when he came back a few days later. Daniel didnt worry about him too much, and neither did I, because in my mind we were still good friends. 

That all changed in July, when Joseph and I were playing guitar on his porch. We kissed, and suddenly i realized how blind i had been the whole time. I had unknowingly developed feelings for Joseph, and I was so confused. On one hand, Daniel and I have been going out for a few months now and he makes me so happy. On the other, Joseph has spent more time with me, i've met his parents (who were actually good friends with mine already), and he genuinely knows me inside and out. The thing is, Joseph already has a long-time girlfriend in chicago. according to him, they've dated since high school but the relationship has gone downhill. i've listened in to a conversation between them, and let me tell you, they are not going to last much longer. Anyways, back to the story. I realized that while I loved Daniel, I was head over heels in love with Joseph. We continued to see each other and it quickly became an affair. I know, i'm garbage, but Daniel thought (and still thinks) that we are fine, so I didn't want to ruin it and break it off all of a sudden. After all, we have spent so much money on each other and are planning to move in together after my second year of college. While Joseph and i did what we were already doing (going out to eat, running errands, etc), we did it with a new attitude, holding hands, kissing, etc. I was so happy, and I KNEW i was genuinely in love. I truly could see myself marrying Joseph and having kids and growing old with him; he feels like my soulmate. 

It went to another level a few days ago, when Joseph and I went out for breakfast. We came home, got up onto his rooftop to make out, and we went inside for a drink. The next thing I knew, we were in his bed, and he ate me out. I came home and pretended like nothing happened. Later that night, I wrote about it in great detail, describing exactly what had happened and how I felt; I fell asleep writing it and left the pages on my bed. The next day I went to work in the morning; everything was normal until my manager told me to clock out, three hours before my shift ended. Apparently my father was here to take me home due to an ""emergency."" On the way back he wouldn't say a word to me and he sped, something he only does when he is angry. I got home and my parents held up the paper I wrote from the day before, screaming at me for not only cheating but mostly because I had oral sex. My dad beat me with his belt, took my phone, and prohibited me from ever seeing Joseph again. This might seem a little ridiculous considering that I'm 18, in college, bought my phone and pay its bill, have a job, etc, but I'm also Hispanic and my parents are crazy strict. They also said I have to call Daniel and tell him that he deserves better (which is true) and to break it off with him.

I told Joseph via Skype what happened and told him I couldn't see him for a while, if ever, which in all honesty hurt more than getting beaten. He said if he can't see me he might as well should go back to Chicago, because I was the only thing tying him down to this small town in Ohio. As for Daniel, I've been able to talk to him more and strengthen our relationship, despite what my parents told me. 

And here we are. I really dont know what to do, if I had met Joseph earlier (he had moved back to Ohio in mid-march, about a month before Daniel and I became official) everything would have been perfect. On the other hand, I met Daniel right after my breakup, and he's helped me through more than you can imagine. I love them both, but I am in love with one. What do I do?

TL;DR I cheated on my boyfriend with my best friend. I love them both but I am truly in love with my best friend, but best friend also has a girlfriend back in his hometown. My parents found out I cheated and won't let me see best friend anymore + want me to break it off with boyfriend. Thoughts?",07Sep2020,1
639,"There was a highschool reunion this year (went to boarding school so we all were like a family), and after seeing all of my close friends doing well, I realized how much college had beaten me down. Mostly the things that happened outside of coursework, but juggling huge life changes and full-time classes was difficult. I ended up jaded and unaware of how grey my days had become (I'm fine, I'm tough and I can deal with whatever is thrown at me, but I had become complicit in getting by). I realized that I had turned into someone buying time, not someone doing something with it. That was never me. 

So I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna finish my degree. I have one course left to finish my Astrophysics degree with a Russian language minor, and then I'm out and about in the workforce. The problem is that where I live (near family) in the South, there are no good options for these degrees. I would like to stay close to home, but I'm worth more than I make doing construction, even if I love the work. I've saved up enough to pay for the course doing that and learned a lot, but I can do more and I should.

My question is for anyone who has been through similar, what do you recommend? I've got my first step down (finish my degree), but then what? Where do I go from there? Career paths worth looking into? I'm not the best at physics, but I have a real knack for languages and I'd love to find a job that lets me learn as many as possible. My goal is to have me, a secluded house, and a dog. My own lawn to cut, my own porch to sit on, read and write books, and drink my tea. And one day, have children to play in it.

TL;DR: Finishing my degree, but nowhere nearby to use it. I'd like to stay close (preferably within an hour's drive) because family is important to me. Where do I go from here? Where should I start looking? Any advice?

If any clarifying information is needed, please don't hesitate to ask.",07Sep2020,1
640,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Excuse me for the title but I couldn't find a better way to explain it. The next school year (higher education) is going to start in 2 weeks and we got to give up names of who we want to sit in class with. I have a good friend B and a friend C who I consider myself neutral with. 

However through the summer my friendgroup (except me) got into a fight with friend C and got to the point of ignoring/avoiding him even making a new groupchat. I myself am not in a fight with him but I don't really like him as a person either. He has a high image of himself, is annoying sometimes etc.. I even heard him talk shit to me behind my back. I decided not to say anything because I don't care and he was a bit drunk but still.

So when we gave up names my friend B told me that we should give eachothers names and ask to not be grouped with friend C (there are 3 classes and this was allowed).

I just feel bad for friend C. If I were in his place I'd be devastated because he doesn't have anyone left but on the other hand I'm not like the things mentioned above and he did it to himself.

I just wanted to hear your opinion/advice on this.

642,"I met my best friend at school when we were about 14. Even though she later went to a different school, and then boarding school in a different country, we kept in touch, met up frequently, and remained best friends. We didn't plan to, but we actually ended up going to the same university and living together for one year. Then, we went on years abroad - me to the US, her to France - and we had a falling out. Basically, she did something that she promised me she wouldn't do, and at the time it felt quite hurtful. I stopped talking to her. When we got back from our years abroad, it was never the same and we lost touch.

In the years after, I was busy with my own life and problems (getting over my terrible anxiety, moving cities, going to graduate school, and meeting my partner who I have been with for 3 years now). Sometimes little things would happen that would cause me to think of our lost friendship, and I gradually understood that I massively overreacted to what she did, and that it was petty, stupid, and definitely not worth losing our friendship over it. At the time, I wasn't mature enough to understand that cutting her off was wrong. Since then, I have grown a lot as a person, and I feel guilty, and I miss her. When I think about this person, I feel very strong emotions; I had many other 'best friends' in school that I gradually lost touch with, but none of them stir up the powerful feelings that the friendship I used to have with this person does. She always understood me on a completely different level. I am still friends with her on Facebook, and I'm considering sending her a message to see how she is, to apologise for my ridiculous behaviour five years ago, and to ask if she'd be up for trying to rekindle our friendship.

645,"Hi,

I'm going to write out my thoughts on the title and explain where I am coming from, this will be a personal story but I am confident this would be taken with all seriousness.

I'm a 30 year old male born and raised in the Netherlands. I've lived around the same small town for the majority of my life and currently saving up to settle down and buy a home. However, since as of late there has been a serious itch on my thoughts and the feeling of being ""at home"".

I never really felt at home here in this country. The culture, the people, the social mentality. It is in all the little things. I can't stand listening to the radio, watching tv in my own language, the music is horrible and the way we go about our social lives bothers me deeply. The other thing is, all my life I have been influenced by American culture. I've grown up with their films, music, comedy, tv shows, friends online whom came from all parts from the USA. 

My best friend in real life has shared this ""USA passion"" for as long as I known him and in 2014 we did bite the bullet together and went for a 3 week vacation (which was the best time I had in any country that was not mine). I am also aware it does not give a realistic view of a country and living in one, since you are a tourist and receive a different treatment. 

It is a contradicting feeling, the feeling of leaving my country, which I will explain from here on out.

&amp;#x200B;

My life in the Netherlands; Stable, living with my dad at the moment since I have not saved money properly (reasoning behind it), which I am doing right now. I have a decent job with good pay which is 5 minutes from my house, hence I am focussing on staying around town. Healthcare is constructed in an amazing way, if I'd compare it to the USA. I still have my family here, my friends (which I have neglected over time). Life is really good in the Netherlands, aside from not feeling comfortable with the social life and day-to-day talk around here. My colleagues (beside 2) bore me to death and I could not imagine living the life they are living, however it is stable. Stability is something that I hold high and is my realistic take on life.

&amp;#x200B;

Life in the USA (as I would assume); A lot of stuff, a lot. Healthcare scares me, since I do visit dentist/doctor regularly. I don't have a lot of savings, which makes it even more scarier to bite a bullet and leave my life in the Netherlands behind me. Also, since I have not travelled excessively (aside from a couple of countries as vacation), it also scares me. I'm afraid to bite the bullet, because I have had a negative way of thinking for a majority of my life (which also comes from something, will explain). But somewhere it also seems liberating, starting over, starting fresh from scratch. Finding a job in the USA (I work in sales, I can yap-yap easily so I don't feel I have any issues finding jobs, however I never really properly knew what I wanted to do. Sales are superficial in my opinion, from my experience and I don't feel the sense of fulfilment. I do enjoy succeeding, in which ever task I have in front of me.

I also have some issues with some of the things, like the over-the-top lifestyles. Racism being a big thing. (I'm white but I love everybody, I don't like the current situation which is going on aswell.) Politics are insane in the USA, it's like a comedy show to foreigners. Not a fan of the overly kissing of the military. Police brutality and the way police forces work in the USA (I feel if I make a wrong gesture I could get shot.) Pro-gun laws, not a fan of guns or why they should even be in hands of civilians, and I could go on for a while.

It's hard to pinpoint everything, since I'm writing out of emotion and a feeling of not feeling where I need to be.

On the other hand, I love Americans, I love their humor, their sense of bonding. The way you go around sports and how it's a thing for everybody. I love the unity you have, the sense of patriotism (which can also be the opposite extreme, looking at the obvious people). I love the way you communicate even if some may find it ""fake"". (which I do not agree with) (Dutch people find this a lot)

In the 3 weeks I had been there, I was welcomed and felt at a place I could become myself more than I ever had been (Florida, I was 24 and I know it's not the state I would go to again). I listen to American radio stations, I have tried to watch the NBA (doesn't work if you wake up at 7am and the games are live at 3am) which I love aswell. I know it may sound shallow but it's everything I don't like about the Netherlands.

Now to me, my negative ways of thinking and pessimism. I always think of the worst, why? Addictive behaviour. For the past 10 years I have been addicted to smoking weed/hash, in a excessive amount. Which is also a reason why I have not saved up my money as good as I could have and makes me think of worst-case-scenarios. Even thinking about moving, I can only come up with;

""I'm not going to have any money and I'll be homeless within a heartbeat.""

""The plane might crash.""

""I won't be accepted.""

""I will live in a community where I won't feel welcome again.""

etcetera.

I am somewhat proud to say that I have finally kicked off my addiction, (stopped smoking cold turkey 3 weeks ago, which doesn't say much but my conviction is great and I don't see myself ever using drugs again. I don't drink, I started to work out 3 days a week and swim at least 2 times. Starting to watch my sugar intake, eat proper food and fixed my entire teeth which I've neglected for years. (I smoke cigarettes which I want to quit, just because I don't think I can go from 0-100 without going into a relapse).

The helpful situation behind that is my current income. It has been more than I have ever had and it will allow me to be able to purchase a home in the Netherlands within an estimate of 3-5 years. (Which is kind of the goal I have in front of me right now.)

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel clueless. It's been a thought for a long time but since I am clean and my mind has been clearer and more targeted, it has become a serious thought.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to engage in conversation about this with people that feel like they could give me proper advice, or even if you live in the USA that might want to be casual friends or have casual conversations.

The thirst for sharing my thoughts is unquenchable.

&amp;#x200B;

If you were able to stick around through this anecdote, thank you for taking the time.

Let me know what your opinion is.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I think I wanna emigrate but I dont feel confident about it and it scares the shit out of me.

&amp;#x200B;

Final note; I have written this without reviewing it myself and straight from my emotions, apologies for any mistakes or unclarities. Feel free to ask me anything, I'm an open book and have nothing to hide.",07Sep2020,1

651,"Hello, I’m F14, turning 15 soon!! I don’t have the greatest relationship with my mom. We don’t fight that much. Usually 4x a month more or less. Usually over me forgetting to do my chores, or something stupid.

 I’m always calm (when I was little I used to yell back, but I’ve grown out of that) she’s the one who’s usually yelling/talking to me with a rude tone. My dad usually calmed her down/made me feel better but he died from cancer about 2 years ago. I’ve grown used to it lol, so it does really hurt me anymore.

Anyway, here’s where I think she might be a little abusive. I have little to no privacy. I have little freedom. I can’t ride my bike outside of a circle around our neighborhood. 

She squeezed my chest and butt before, my butt multiple times even though I’ve always asked her not to because it upsets me. She told me it would only be weird if my dad did it.

 She has looked through my texts and pictures before for no reason. Soon, I’m not going to be allowed to close my door to my room anymore.

She’s hit me really hard with her hands. Last time was a while ago, probably 5 months ago, because I would drop my food on my plate out of habit instead of placing it gently. She didn’t like when I did it, and I tried not to, but when your absentmindedly doing something its hard to break the habit.

So, yeah. I don’t know if I’m being sensitive or if this would count as abuse. I do love my mom, we still hang out on the couch and watch tv together. We went to the beach together not too long ago.

Here is an example of probably the worst we've heard since we've been here: [https://streamable.com/wsfsm4](https://streamable.com/wsfsm4)

The windows in the complex we live in open fairly wide and so us being the next window over means we can hear a lot.

So should I report this and if so, to who? I feel sad for these children because they are getting yelled at everytime they do something 'wrong'. How they raise their kids is none of my business but feel like I should at least",07Sep2020,1
654,"Hello all, me and my girlfriend are going through some things. I hope I can gather some advice from some people. It starts with us having a financially difficult time, me being between jobs and her never finding the right one, im an electrician turned plumber, and hitting the reset during journeyman and getting switched to apprentice pay is not ideal. She is constantly having to deal with people being racist towards her, and her being a girl she does feel boxed into customer service rather than a proffession(I know thats not true).
Shes been a military baby, she's moved around alot, her mother and father in law are both retired vets.
We were very happy to find eachother, so happy we planned a trip when things were going okay financially(Before the rona hit) , to vegas, coming up next month. 
But things have been so hard for us, she wants to join the navy, as it will relieve stress for multiple reasons. I think its a good idea, but, only way we can realistically be together is If I marry her and then they will support both of us. But i don't know if that's what I want.. i am constantly trying to help my parents(who we live with) with repairing the house and day to day things. I want to be with her, but I just feel like this moment will change both of our lives forever depending on what I do. This morning she took a pregnancy test as well, and its positive. Her mother wants her to move back and live with her so she can be in a safe environment, because she thinks my house is too dusty. And she wants her to keep the child. We talked about this already and agreed we wanted an abortion if this happened. But i think she's leaning on keeping it now. I know this is multi layered and there's no right way to deal with this. But i have no one to ask about this, so thank you if you've gotten this far.",07Sep2020,1
655,"So recently I’ve been in a bit of a rough patch. Quarantine is making me depressed, my self esteem is very low due to not having a job and gaining weight, and my boyfriend and I are not doing so hot. Long story short, my mind has been racing for the last few months. Recently, my boyfriend has started to make side comments about it all. He wishes I were happier, but won’t let me vent to him. He’s trying to get me to do new things, but gets upset when I don’t enjoy them as much as he does. He recently started commenting on pictures of other girls saying that their tattoos are hot, girls in flannels turn him on, and comments about their bodies. All of which I don’t have or do. When I ask him to lay off or tell him it’s bothering me, he just gets mad and storms off saying I need to gain control of my depression and anxiety. Am I overthinking and overreacting? I just feel like I’m stuck in a catch 22 and can’t do anything right.",07Sep2020,1

657,"Hi,

I'm going to write out my thoughts on the title and explain where I am coming from, this will be a personal story but I am confident this would be taken with all seriousness.

I'm a 30 year old male born and raised in the Netherlands. I've lived around the same small town for the majority of my life and currently saving up to settle down and buy a home. However, since as of late there has been a serious itch on my thoughts and the feeling of being ""at home"".

I never really felt at home here in this country. The culture, the people, the social mentality. It is in all the little things. I can't stand listening to the radio, watching tv in my own language, the music is horrible and the way we go about our social lives bothers me deeply. The other thing is, all my life I have been influenced by American culture. I've grown up with their films, music, comedy, tv shows, friends online whom came from all parts from the USA.

My best friend in real life has shared this ""USA passion"" for as long as I known him and in 2014 we did bite the bullet together and went for a 3 week vacation (which was the best time I had in any country that was not mine). I am also aware it does not give a realistic view of a country and living in one, since you are a tourist and receive a different treatment.

It is a contradicting feeling, the feeling of leaving my country, which I will explain from here on out.

My life in the Netherlands; Stable, living with my dad at the moment since I have not saved money properly (reasoning behind it), which I am doing right now. I have a decent job with good pay which is 5 minutes from my house, hence I am focussing on staying around town. Healthcare is constructed in an amazing way, if I'd compare it to the USA. I still have my family here, my friends (which I have neglected over time). Life is really good in the Netherlands, aside from not feeling comfortable with the social life and day-to-day talk around here. My colleagues (beside 2) bore me to death and I could not imagine living the life they are living, however it is stable. Stability is something that I hold high and is my realistic take on life.

Life in the USA (as I would assume); A lot of stuff, a lot. Healthcare scares me, since I do visit dentist/doctor regularly. I don't have a lot of savings, which makes it even more scarier to bite a bullet and leave my life in the Netherlands behind me. Also, since I have not travelled excessively (aside from a couple of countries as vacation), it also scares me. I'm afraid to bite the bullet, because I have had a negative way of thinking for a majority of my life (which also comes from something, will explain). But somewhere it also seems liberating, starting over, starting fresh from scratch. Finding a job in the USA (I work in sales, I can yap-yap easily so I don't feel I have any issues finding jobs, however I never really properly knew what I wanted to do. Sales are superficial in my opinion, from my experience and I don't feel the sense of fulfilment. I do enjoy succeeding, in which ever task I have in front of me.

I also have some issues with some of the things, like the over-the-top lifestyles. Racism being a big thing. (I'm white but I love everybody, I don't like the current situation which is going on aswell.) Politics are insane in the USA, it's like a comedy show to foreigners. Not a fan of the overly kissing of the military. Police brutality and the way police forces work in the USA (I feel if I make a wrong gesture I could get shot.) Pro-gun laws, not a fan of guns or why they should even be in hands of civilians, and I could go on for a while.

It's hard to pinpoint everything, since I'm writing out of emotion and a feeling of not feeling where I need to be.

On the other hand, I love Americans, I love their humor, their sense of bonding. The way you go around sports and how it's a thing for everybody. I love the unity you have, the sense of patriotism (which can also be the opposite extreme, looking at the obvious people). I love the way you communicate even if some may find it ""fake"". (which I do not agree with) (Dutch people find this a lot)

In the 3 weeks I had been there, I was welcomed and felt at a place I could become myself more than I ever had been (Florida, I was 24 and I know it's not the state I would go to again). I listen to American radio stations, I have tried to watch the NBA (doesn't work if you wake up at 7am and the games are live at 3am) which I love aswell. I know it may sound shallow but it's everything I don't like about the Netherlands.

Now to me, my negative ways of thinking and pessimism. I always think of the worst, why? Addictive behaviour. For the past 10 years I have been addicted to smoking weed/hash, in a excessive amount. Which is also a reason why I have not saved up my money as good as I could have and makes me think of worst-case-scenarios. Even thinking about moving, I can only come up with;

""I'm not going to have any money and I'll be homeless within a heartbeat.""

""The plane might crash.""

""I won't be accepted.""

""I will live in a community where I won't feel welcome again.""

etcetera.

I am somewhat proud to say that I have finally kicked off my addiction, (stopped smoking cold turkey 3 weeks ago, which doesn't say much but my conviction is great and I don't see myself ever using drugs again. I don't drink, I started to work out 3 days a week and swim at least 2 times. Starting to watch my sugar intake, eat proper food and fixed my entire teeth which I've neglected for years. (I smoke cigarettes which I want to quit, just because I don't think I can go from 0-100 without going into a relapse).

The helpful situation behind that is my current income. It has been more than I have ever had and it will allow me to be able to purchase a home in the Netherlands within an estimate of 3-5 years. (Which is kind of the goal I have in front of me right now.)

I just feel clueless. It's been a thought for a long time but since I am clean and my mind has been clearer and more targeted, it has become a serious thought.

I want to engage in conversation about this with people that feel like they could give me proper advice, or even if you live in the USA that might want to be casual friends or have casual conversations.

The thirst for sharing my thoughts is unquenchable.

If you were able to stick around through this anecdote, thank you for taking the time.

Let me know what your opinion is.

TLDR; I think I wanna emigrate but I dont feel confident about it and it scares the shit out of me. That's why I am asking for advice.

Final note; I have written this straight from my emotions, apologies for any mistakes or unclarities. Feel free to ask me anything, I'm an open book and have nothing to hide.",07Sep2020,1
658,"Sorry if this sounds a bit rambly, but I just need some advice. Also apologize for any weird formatting or grammar mistakes, I’m on mobile.

For the record, I’m a 20 year old college student who works at a movie theatre and the coworker is question is a 17 year old sophomore in high school . 

Ever since he started working at my theatre, this kid has been mean spirited. He’ll act all nice to your face and then talk smack behind your back with the other coworkers. He also smugly proclaims to be a social chameleon, saying how “it’s so easy to get into groups by lying” and shit like that. So being around him isn’t all that pleasant most of the time. He can be a good conversationalist, but for the most part, he’s a arrogant know-it-all; which I except from a teenager, but not to this degree.

This, on top of his more recent behaviors, is making me deeply uncomfortable. Last week, me and him were scheduled to clean the theatres together. As you can imagine I wasn’t too thrilled, but I bit my tongue and went along with it anyways. 

In every theatre we’d clean he would stand just a bit to close to me, and when I’d take a step away from him, he’d take a step forward. Even if I’d purposely move away from him, like let’s say six feet, he’s always get right back up in my personal space and give unwavering eye contact.

When we’re wiping the seats, he’d rush his job and then zoom back over to me, not to help, but to “talk”. Every time I bend over to clean a seat, I can feel him lingering a little bit to closely to me, so close to the point that I’ve bumped into him many times. I feel gross just typing this, but I think he was looking at my ass. 

One of my other coworkers, another teenager whose actually a really chill dude, told me about how some of the guys talk about me when I’m not in the theatre. They say how “she’s gotten thicc” and other gross things like that. This wouldn’t disturb me as much if I didn’t know that my arrogant coworker was definitely a part of that group. I’d don’t blame my chill coworker for not saying anything to them about their behavior, he’s really young and super sweet, but a little bit skittish.

So, I guess what I’m trying to ask here is how do I deal with my coworker? I’m an adult and he’s a teenager, I don’t want to be leered at by a minor. Even if he wasn’t a kid, its still wrong and is making me super uncomfortable. Should I tell a manager, should so tell him to buzz off, should I quit? I’m still half convinced that I’m over thinking things, so any advice would be greatly appreciated since above never dealt with this sort of situation before. Thank you.",07Sep2020,1
659,"Hello there!

So, I ended elementary school in the ""COVID"" fashion, i.e. been home for 6 months, not really doing anything. Started high school last week and I just feel like... I am not ready for it. I don't mean that I think I will have problems in learning, for now, I am a fairly good student. 

The problem is my social life. I am quite an introverted and shy person, and I don't know what to think after my first week.

I have serious issues with breaking out of my shell, constantly worried about what my new classmates will think about me. I don't know anyone there. I prefered a good  school over my friends, and I am still not sure about that decision. 

That being said, I talked to some people, and I have been talking to this one guy quite often, but I just don't feel like I will be able to establish the same kind of relationship with him as with my old friends from my elementary school. Groups are already starting to form and it seems awkward for me to just bash into someones group/conversation.

Another big problem I have is starting, but mainly keeping the conversation going, I just run out of stuff to say after a while and then it seems way too awkward. That being said, I am a totally different person around my two best-friends, cheerful and funny, but I can't bring myself to be like that around other people, so I come out as the boring/sad one.

Thanks for all of your advice in advance! :)",07Sep2020,1
660,"I'm 16 and I seriously think that I have ADHD so I'm wondering if I should go get it checked. I can never pay attention for more than five minutes in class and I normally just doodle and in online school, I do anything else but listen. There are these moments where something comes over me, and it's like a rush of adrenaline(?) so I suddenly blurt out things or do things that are really irrational, and things I feel like I can't control. Also, I always have so many thoughts going through my head all the time so it's really hard to think clearly about anything. Even when I'm just trying to run, my thoughts will be racing and I can't even focus on moving my feet. Whenever I'm trying to complete an assignment or read, my mind drifts to something else and I have trouble completing tasks. I am also very forgetful, if I'm walking somewhere in my house I forget why I went there in the first place. I also always lose things three seconds after seeing them. For example, I've lost my phone and airpods 8 times each. In school, I always understand the concepts and a lot of my teachers even pull me aside to compliment my understanding of the material, however, I am never able to meet deadlines and make silly mistakes that I skipped over while reading in the test. There are also times where I feel like I'm in a trance, and can't pull away from something I'm doing so I won't drink water or do anything else, even if I'm sweating, for four or five hours. These are the main problems that I have, that make me think I might have this issue. As a toddler and in middle school I was always really active and hyper. But I would also exercise a lot and probably participated in at least three sports (1-3 practices a week) at any given time. So I think I was able to channel a lot of it into sports, but for a few years now I'm not doing any type of exercise, which is about when I started to notice these issues. I went to see a psychiatrist a few months ago but my mom was there with me (I'm not close to her and feel uncomfortable and anxious around her) so I didn't really answer her questions honestly. That being said she did pull me aside separately to ask me questions about depression, which she eventually diagnosed me with. lol. Anyways, I'm thinking about asking my mom for another chance to get a professional opinion, and this time getting interviewed privately so I can feel more comfortable. I would really appreciate it if ppl could give me some input!",07Sep2020,1
661," I don't mean just one friend, I mean several people over the past couple of years. I'm not well off by any means. I actually have a lot of debt which I occasionally sprinkle into conversation if it comes up. I have a steady job but my rent eats 50% of my monthly income and debt I am paying off, so I don't live a lavish life. I consider myself a good friend and good listener, overall a low maintenance friend to have. I'm just wondering why this keeps happening because it's making me wonder if I'm giving off some sort of ""doormat vibes"". I only lent money to one friend recently ($100) who was cut off by her family away at grad school, later learned she was on coke and used it for coke and a tattoo, so I cut her out immediately. When I make new friends, I'm very straightforward about how easily I walk away from situations that do not serve me. Now another friend is asking me for a huge sum of money, which I just am not going to give/unable to give at this time. These aren't even extremely close friends. Is it a sign of the times?",07Sep2020,1
662,"What I (14/m)am about to say is probably extremely stupid but it has been bothering me for a while so I'll just spit it out. My siblings (a brother who is 2 years younger and a sisters who is 6 years younger) are not caring about their healths. My brother is very fat and my sister isn't but I feel like she will be at this rate. They eat all types of shit food and rarely eat any healthy food. They also spend too much time on screens which means they never do any hobbies or try new things, just video games. My parents don't seem to be bothered by it and they just provide them with all the junk they ask for (don't get me wrong, my parents are great people and I could never repay them for all their favors towards me, it's just that I feel they aren't strict enough). I know that I am not responsible for they do but I just can't stand to watch them grow into fat idiots. I had tried advising them many times before but it never works. Of course I can't tell my parents how I feel bcuz they would say it isn't my business (and they are probably right) but I just can't stop it.

663,so this all kinda relates around my parents for context im 14 almost 15 likes video games and technology in general and i have from a young age my parents are christian (as am i) and im completely happy with my faith no problems there... but im very different from my parents in my humor etc now this isnt a bad thing on its own but it becomes bad when my parents think i dont know about various things (im not gonna go into detail but about porn rule 343 in the most extreme cases) and my humor and knowledge of the things in this world are things that they arent aware i know and they have tried to keep me away from those things but failed miserably its a combination of fear of me not wanting to get into trouble and disappointing them and ive struggled with it heavily i have like 0 other problems now besides this one and i know it's irrational because everyones done this but it scares me to death,07Sep2020,1

I haven’t spoken to them but I decided to follow them more, I would regularly check on their account and what they would do etc. Somehow he becomes a moderator of a small community as that then forced me to join it, I craved for their attention but they weren’t appreciating it. I confessed my feelings to them but they ridiculed me with his fellow moderators. That made me understandably angry and I doxxed them. It wasn’t harmful but it seems like it upset them, through that the other moderators harassed me and made fun of me.

I continued doxxing him because that was the only way I could have their attention. At first it worked but they started insulting me and that pained me. They never listened to my pleas and it upset me even more. They deleted their account but they still were apart of the community. It was a mess as it was a struggle of me craving for their acknowledgment and the moderator team harassing me and telling me to leave them alone, even though I never harmed them.

671,"Backstory is gonna be kinda long, but I feel as though it's relevant. I (19m) was raised in a Christian home, in which we were homeschooled by my mother. Mom also went to school for and became an NP, so lots of time studying and then working at different hospitals. Anyway, our family was super close growing up. My only sibling (22m) was almost always with me, and as we got older, we became super close and are still best friends due (I believe) to being homeschooled together. Everything was great and then my mom divorced my dad. Still unclear as to why exactly, but she said mostly because she was unhappy. This was a shock considering that she raised us to believe marriage was for life. My brother got married 5 months after the divorce at the age of 21, leaving me hopping between parents (I was 18), and also living on my own with financial support for part of the time. I will have moved 7+ times in the past 1.5ish years come this Oct. I was in the process of starting my own barber shop business when Mom left, so that's also been stressful. On top of everything, I started dating my dream girl (17f now, but was 16) just a few months before it all went down, and that made it really rough, as she couldn't really come over to my family's house. This caused me to be with her family when I see her, which, they've been absolutely great, but it's hard to get to know a girl when she's always around her family. We're going strong after almost 2 years, as she really is the girl I want to spend my life with. She's just everything I want, and moreso what I need. The things that have annoyed me about her over our time together usually end up being something for the better. I've learned a lot about myself, and how to treat a lady. I only get to see her a twice a week, and I have to travel an hour and a half round trip every time. Other than that, my brother is busy with work and his new wife, so I don't get to see him very often. My best friend is super introverted and has school stressing him out, so he secluded himself a few weeks ago. I've tried to get closer to other friends and stuff, but I still have so much down time.
   I bought a house a couple weeks back. It's a fixer upper, but it's livable. I'll be moving into it in a few weeks to be out of the middle of my parents and to start my own life. I do this to try and show my girlfriend she can trust me, and that I will take care of her. She IS younger than me, but she seems to be scared of marrying me. Which, I understand, but it hurts me because I'm impatient and I've been lonely for so long. I just want someone to come home to after work, to wake up to in the mornings, to confide in me, and me in them. She doesn't like texting or calling (I'm not fond of either, but I would do them to talk to her) so I don't really get to hear from her much unless I see her. Also would like to add my love language is physical touch and quality time.
   Work has been getting to me, my relationships have been strained, my Bible and prayer time have dwindled to almost nothing (which makes me feel like crap), I'm tired of driving, I want to get married and move on, and I'm tired of just waiting for things to happen. Advice?",07Sep2020,1

He recently bought a laptop for $600. He hit my mom up as he didn't have the funds. She gave him a loan. For those curious, I cannot stop my mom from enabling him. His money mostly goes to medical marijuana and various "" toys"". He's also very giving to his ex-GF and her children. He has a good heart. He is mentally ill (depression, bipolar).

My mom is not well. I often worry if she goes before us, my brother will continue to be broke (even if she leaves him something) and he will expect me to provide for him. We are extremely close. However I won't foot his bills if he ends up in a situation he created. It's not how my brain works. On the other hand if he had a healthy relationship with money and hit rock bottom I would shell out my last dollar to him. 

If I broach the subject, he panics and quickly gets off the phone. How can I help him see that if he has nothing to show after working full time for a year when every expense is covered, he will always be like that. I am afraid of spooking him or making him feel like he's ""the family problem"". He is generally open to my advice but I'd be hard up to get him to read a book.

What would be the best response;

1- ask my instructor to contact the client and let them know I’m interested.

2- ask for his advice on how to contact/approach the client by myself?

3- something else?",07Sep2020,1
678,"Hi Reddit, in need of some advice regarding a recent relationship.

So... I met him 2 years ago and we fell in love and started dating. Throughout the relationship he was manipulative and controlling.. I don't think he meaned to be, he was just very attached.

When lockdown started, we wanted another way to feel ""close"" to eachother, so we started doing s*xual things in messages and calls. But eventually it got to the point he wanted to have s*x (I'm 15F, he's 17M. Age of content here is 16)

And of course, we couldn't because of lockdown. So he decided to take things slightly further on calls and even begged me some times to ""show"" things. I wasn't comfortable at this point but didn't know how to say ""no"".

At one point, idk why, but we started to drift apart. What was once 8 hour calls a day became more like 3, and he said he felt like I was ""drifting away"" from him. He wanted to do absolutely everything with me and got jealous when I did things without him, but when he did things without me, I had to put up with it, and he'd say ""let me do things on my own"".

These were everyday things. Like playing games and spending time with our friends. He wouldn't let me do that.. or, well, he ""would"", but he guilt tripped me and well, i always came back for him because I felt bad.

Anyway, I gave him a warning a few days before breaking up with him, and he didn't listen to it, so yeah I ended it. From then on, he sent countless emails to me, begging for me back, contacted me on every social media platform he could find me on and I had to block him absolutely everywhere. It was hell.

After trying to contact me on basically everything and showing no sign of stopping, I had to call the police to ask for him to stop. I knew that if I directly messaged him about it I'd just be giving him the attention he wanted, and well, the opportunity for him to win me back.

I think the police told him off 1-2 months ago now? He's been quiet since. But one of my friends told me he hates me and thinks I'm overexaggerating the whole thing, making him out to be a super bad guy, and yeah he just upright hates my guts.

This is where the trauma bonding comes in. Throughout this time I'd developed such a close bond to him that we were basically inseparable. Now I had managed to separate myself from him, the fight wasn't over. I get flashbacks and dreams about him every day, making him seem all innocent and harmless, and voices in my head telling me ""he's harmless, go back to him"", and ""don't you want things to be how they used to be?"" It's awful.

Today I saw him on the way to school, the first time I've seen him in 4 months, and my heart sank. I don't know why, but I became so divided inside. Half of me wanted to go back so bad, and apologise for anything I could've done, and go back to how it used to be. The other half knows it would be wrong and dangerous, and wants to completely avoid him. So I'm in a dilemma. I tried to make a compromise to myself, about how I wouldn't ""go back"" to him, but rather, just message him, a little conversation, where we both apologise for our mistakes and move on, not hating eachother at all. I'm just thinking this could help fix some problems about how I currently have to avoid and fear him, but on the other hand it risks me going back to him. He's said to other people he hates me and he doesn't want me back, but it's still possible yknow? He might well be in the same position as me. I don't like him until I see him in person again and remember all the happy times we went through. Part of me wants that back. But part of me really doesn't.

For a balanced story, his POV is that I didn't show signs I was uncomfortable, so he just continued. He did always say if I felt uncomfortable to just say, but I felt too uncomfortable to say anything. I mean, we were close. I can say for sure it would be completely out-of-character for him to purposefully pressure me into something like that, with the knowledge I didn't like it.

So, my question is, do I go back to him, do I give him a brief message saying I don't want us to forever hate eachother, or do I completely avoid him?

It's such a sticky situation *because* we were so close, and *because* the relationship ended as suddenly as it did. I still can't get over that, even though it was *me* who broke up with *him*.

It's a big decision, and I really don't know what to do. I'd appreciate some advice. Thank you Reddit.",07Sep2020,1
679,"Hey guys. Lately I've(19F) been having trouble with a roommate, let's call her P(19F). P apparently doesn't know what the word ""no"" means. It always little things, but it's just been getting on my nerves more and more. Here's an example of a conversation we had the other day:

P:  You should watch this show!

Me:  No I don't want to

P:  But it's really good!

Me:  I've watched a few episodes before and I didn't like the show, so I stopped watching

P:  Give it another chance!

Me:  No, and I have other things I want to watch anyway

P:  I'll just force you to watch it at some point

Me:  No? I told you I didn't like it

P:  You'll change your mind!

Me:  No I won't, now can you drop it already and just respect that I like different things?

P:  Wow you're so rude! :'(

This is how every single conversation with her goes. She wanted me to get tiktok, I said no, she responded by telling me that she'd just snag my phone, download the app, and make an account for me when I'm not looking. Who the fuck does that? I told her off and she sulked in her room for the rest of the night.

I've tried talking to her before and explaining how no means no, regardless of the context, and that I would appreciate if she'd stop pushing me when I don't want to do something. She always gets really defensive but agrees to stop, which lasts all of 10 minutes.

I just don't know what to do anymore. She only understands the concept of ""no"" when I get mean about it. I feel bad about being mean and I don't want to cause problems in the house by making her my enemy. We're staying here for a few months (it's 3 of us abroad) and I don't want to spend the rest of our time here with her hating me. But I just can't deal with her bullshit anymore.

How do I get her to understand that when I say ""no"" it doesn't mean ""convince me""?",07Sep2020,1

683,"(Background).   So my ex boyfriend broke up with me and I still live with him. In the spare room. I don’t really have any where else to go never had a family per say I have one but they are extremely toxic for my mental health and I have one friend. I’m kind of a loner, I’m one of those I know a lot of people and am friendly with them but we never make it past small talk. I’ve been with this guy for 3 years and the break up devastated me to the point where I considered taking my self out. It seems a bit over dramatic for my particular situation and I am by no means trying to be insensitive towards the subject, but he made all the promises and told me he would never leave me and all this bullshit and he knew I didn’t really have anyone but him in my life. Now he’s making me feel crazy and that the breakup was all my fault when he really just wanted to fuck other people. I am a student in college I graduate next semester, I just lost my job because of my background, I made some mistakes at 18 years old and got a felony so it makes it fucking impossible to get a decent job that isn’t in a restaurant. My mental health is dwindling fast and I feel like I just keep getting fucked over no matter how hard I try to just be a good fucking person. I just don’t know really what to do anymore. So I sat myself down and made myself type this out and express what I want from life and ask for advice on what to do and how to get there. 

(Life plan) I obviously want to try and find a nice job, but I really want to start up my own brewery and dog rescue facility. (The two things that make me happy in life craft beer and dogs) I want to find a cute home and get 6 golden retrievers (they are my favorite) I want to get super hot and stay single forever because I really just don’t trust people anymore. I want to figure out how to drive a car and get my license (I’m 25 and have severe anxiety when it comes to being in a car). Finally the most important aspect is I want to learn how to love myself and feel important and that I matter.

684,"So as a normal teenager, i have a crush. He has been showing a little bit of interest lately, and recently asked me who i had a crush on. He seemed very interested when he was asking, and he was trying to get it out of me for two days. The problem is, he has a girlfriend. After i told him that i like him, he said that he felt baf for me, and he asked me to promise him that i wouldnt give up. He also called me cute, and we talked for a while. Yesterday, he told me that he trusted me, because i told him that he could talk to me about anything, and later he asked me to come to his soccer game. All of this happened over text, but when we see each other at school, we have eye contact a lot and i see him looking at me often.

I dont know what to do. Is he just teasing me? Or is he actually interested? What am i supposed to do, since he has a girlfriend (they have been together for 2years, and he told me like 2 days ago that he would never be able to cheat on her), but he is still leading me on.

686,"So this guy I \[25F\] was interested in asked me out for the first time. I was a little surprised that he did, as I had never really spoken to him before, despite the fact that we have mutual friends.

We had what I thought was a really decent date. We went out for brunch. Conversation flowed well, and it didn't feel awkward. After the date, he did call me to follow up and he told me he had a good time, and that we should totally hang out again soon. So I was pretty optimistic overall.

A couple of days later, I go on whatsapp. I noticed he had changed his profile picture to one of himself with another girl. She was in a bikini and he was in swimming shorts and they appeared to be on a beach. They looked somewhat cozy.

I'm a little confused now about whether this is an indirect message to say he is no longer interested? I don't know whether to just continue to text him as per normal or not, because I don't know who this girl is and if I should just take it as a sign and back off.

If he is seeing multiple people, it's almost like he has no tact or regard for me, if he would just plainly post another woman he is seeing.

I don't get why he followed up and hyped up the date if actually he isn't interested. Thoughts?",07Sep2020,1

688,"Hello there. My situation is a bit odd so please bear with me. Let me explain.

So I'm currently 18 years old. I start school tomorrow for the first time in years. I was kicked out of my last school for having bed bugs. Due to ridiculous circumstances over the last few years I had never actually started highschool but a private school that went by your educational knowledge. The work I got im guessing was around 6th-7th grade knowledge level and I was 15 or 16 at the time. Well 2-3 years later im finally able to go back and get my schooling done but this time I'm going for a public school. That school didn't go by a credit program so im basically starting fresh. I had a meeting with the teacher and principal both and they told me that if I want to finish within a years time I'd have to complete all 4 years in a year if not a little more. Main reason its 1 year is because my grandfather is on the verge of passing anytime. He has at most a year or so left and im in a big hurry to try and fix what's left of my life. I just dont want to put so much time and effort into getting school finished and suddenly something happens. Is it possible to get all 4 years done in such a short time ? I forgot to mention I also take care of him and do everything for him around here rather thats by doing errands, cleaning, making sure the bills are paid, food shopping and keeping upkeep around the apartment etc..

College was sort of easy for me. I struggled like everyone else but I was able to stay on top of everything and graduate on time with a pretty good GPA. (Way higher than my high school GPA).  
  
I also graduated with barely any debt. I took out two small loans my senior year and already paid one off, I’m holding off on the other due to everything going on. (So I don’t think the money will hold me back too much)  

  
I obviously struggled to find a job for like 6 months before there was any pandemic induced issues. I was discouraged then, now I’m just over it.   
  
I’m currently a mover, I also work part time at a grocery store. I’ve been thinking more and more about just going full time there and giving up on my job search. I’ve also been thinking about going back to school, I just don’t want to end up in the same situation in another 2-4 years.   

  
I know I can work while going to school, as I’ve already done it.   
  
I’ve been thinking maybe I’ll get my CDL or maybe go into a butchers apprenticeship program. I don’t like that with trades you’re kind stuck in your choice, but at least your choice leads to gainful employment.

691,"We will refer to the roommate as Carl and the gf as Sally. Also sally is a hair stylist to keep in mind.

Since my roommate has moved in there's been sus stuff thats been going on, along with just actual annoyance.

I have had a couple of things that have been misplaced or appear to have been used. Even from time to time having an occasional ""um...I dont remember missing THAT much."" The particular things in question are bathroom supplies. I've had some other weird instances too involving dab/the devils lettuce but im going to focus on the bath supplies for now since i feel i have somewhat of evidence to support that. (Body washes, body scrubs, lotions. face washes, deep conditioners, shampoo.) All that good stuff. I really pamper myself because when I was younger I wasn't allowed to pick out stuff like that. I was in an abusive home with my mom and would even get ""in trouble."" If it was that time of the month and stuff. So over the couple of years after not living with my mom anymore I have kinda collected a large amount of bath supplies. I love shopping for this stuff and I've had some of these products for years and I've never forgotten something I've bought or misplaced it. And I was in foster care with this stuff. So I managed to keep track of all of it even after moving 5-6 times.

There would be times when I showered where I'd notice some of my products seem to be missing a little bit more than usual, but no real hard evidence. 

I will be referring to 2 specific instances for this post. Since these seem to be the most sus.

One particular thing that I noticed that went missing was one of my body creams from BABW. This was my absolute favorite body cream and I bought it just about a year ago. I used quite a bit of it but there was some left and I was trying to save it for as long as possible or use it for my hands instead. For a long while I didn't use it and it had been left in the bathroom in the cabinets (also mind you all my bathroom stuff was in the cabinets in the bathroom, my roommate doesn't use them because he just uses a 3-1 wash.) So she would have had access to that stuff anytime she would use the bathroom, and on occasion she showers here and did it so often at one point like each time she came over to the point where it was like does she not shower at her own house? I have seen her bring a bag of her stuff before. But that was a while ago. And I dont necessarily snoop through their stuff if I happen to notice the bag of her stuff on their bed in the living room (cause that's where they sleep and stay we share a 1 bedroom) then i just happen to notice it. But I haven't really had an opportunity to make sure she's using/bringing her own stuff nor do I care to be a huge detective about it.

Now keeping that in mind im not sure if this Sally is thinking ""wow who needs all this stuff. Im sure she won't notice. How could she?"" Etc.

The body cream had been in the bathroom forever and just a few weeks ago I had brought it into my bedroom because funny enough I couldn't decide if I wanted to use it or save it. So I kinda just admired it and kept smelling it lmao or using it for my hands to save it like I said. It was on my desk for a couple of weeks and never left my room and I never put it back in the bathroom. 

Then there was one day that I came into my room and I noticed it was gone. I searched everywhere. My room is a mess cause I suffer from depression and sometimes me and my bf throw away large amounts of garbage so I thought maybe I accidentally threw it away? Or my bf. I know I 100% didn't because I would actively keep in mind my lotion is right there and we were strictly picking up garbage. My bf also knew of this lotion and I would talk to him about it and it being my favorite a lot. He knew what the bottle looked like and he never would touch my bath stuff anyways, he never cared to. And I showed him the picture of the lotion and he says 150% he didn't throw it away. That he remembers it and if he was going to he would have asked me first if I was done with it before tossing it.

I searched my entire room when I noticed it missing which was about a week and a half ago. I searched the closet twice and the rest of my bedroom 3 times. U mean THOROUGHLY. Like picking up one object at a time thorough.

To this day I still never found it. But my other lotions (which aren't so luxurious) that weren't so much in plain site and were on the floor or covered in stuff are still in my bedroom.

I'm devastated even though its a lotion, its still really fricking annoying.

The 2nd instance I found yesterday. I was going through my bathroom cabinets 1 more time to see if maybe I had put it back in the cabinets. And when I was looking my eyes immediately darted to one particular product.

This shampoo i had originally bought two. Sometimes I buy two of one shampoo so if I like it and something happens where I can't buy another later I at least have somewhat of a ""stock"". I thought I would love this shampoo and it would be great for my hair. But I actually really disliked it for my hair and stopped using it. Now this is some really expensive shampoo its basically organic shampoo meant for curly hair. Which idk why she'd be using that of all things since she legit has hair above her shoulders and constantly straightens it and dyes it every week.

So I had two bottles of this stuff. I used one bottle as my test subject and used about half of that, and these bottles are very ""crunchy"" and round if that makes sense. So the bottle I first used is super crunched and the other bottle was completely brand new. Didn't have any dents or anything on it.

When I went through the cabinet yesterday. My eyes directly went to the new bottle of shampoo, because I noticed it had a crunch in it.

Now reasons why I suspect she used it.

The cabinet for one wasnt completely closed. (My fault.)

It was kinda in this position where if closed it wouldn't have made any noise because I had a hair dryer in there that was just the tiniest bit too big to fit. So that cabinet was always slightly open and it prevented it from being slammed or making noise when being closed. This shampoo bottle was at the very front in plain site and was near the opening of the cabinet. So it would've been in easy reach for her. 

My eyes directly darted to it because of the crunch on the bottle. Now this wasn't just any crunch it was super weird. There was a perfect finger placement as if someone only used theyre thumb and index finger. While the bottle i used was completely crunched up because obviously im not trying to hide that i used it. It was almost like someone tried to be as gentle with it as possible without messing it up too much to get the shampoo out.

Then when I held it up to the light there was a significant amount missing. It wasnt a brand new bottle anymore. It was missing from the lid to the logo about a 1/3 amount. That's not a super big amount but it was definitely a WTF moment.

I tried to make sense of it. I thought maybe before it was there (because I go through the cabinets a lot) maybe it had stuff on top of it that caused the crunch, so then I tested it and it absolutely did not work, everything just slid off the bottle and nothing could create that type of crunch. When i say this I mean it its like someone didn't even used their whole hand on that bottle, its like someone used two fingers only to try to get it out. There's perfect indentation surprisingly.

So all of this was hella suspicious to me, and after I found that I decided to get a big ole box and take all of my stuff from the bathroom and put it in my bedroom. So the bathroom is empty for right now except for the stuff in the tub which I left to make it less sus. The cabinet it completely empty and closed and I left a nice little note in there (GOT YA B*TCH) in case she decides to open it. I'm not too worried if Carl comes across it because he shouldnt be going through that cabinet anyways. Only my stuff is in there. And hes known that
And also we don't keep toilet paper or anything in there. Our toilet paper is in the kitchen so it's not like she'd be looking for it in there. She knows the TP is in the kitchen, and I've heard her call carl numerous times for it when she needed some.

So this is what I have and im not sure how to proceed further with it.",07Sep2020,1

700,"Hey guys, I'm at a bit of a crossroads. Ever since I was in my early teens I only ever wanted to be a soldier or a police officer when I grew up, preferably both. The plan has always been to join the army, serve for a decade or so and then join the police and serve until retirement. 

It's more complicated than that though, my parents really want me to forget the army and just focus on the police. They say if the police is where I want to end up then it makes more sense to join up now, rather than wait. Especially since there's a recruitment boom here in the UK. And although they haven't explicitly said it, it's obvious that they're afraid of something happening to me in the army, as it can obviously be a very dangerous job.

The police would definitely be the more financially sensible route too. Training lasts 3 years and because I live near the training centre I'd be able to stay at home for its duration. My parents are lenient with rent so I'd be able to save up most of my pay. I did some calculations and worked out I'll have enough money to buy my own car in about six months, based off the money I'm getting at my current retail job (plus what I've already saved). After the three years of training I'll have enough money for a sizable deposit on a pretty decent flat, plus I'll have the flexibility to be posted wherever the police want me to as I'm not tied down and I'll have the money to move to whichever local police area they need me at. From that point on I'd start my career and basically my adult life, already owning a car and living on my own in a nice flat without having to worry too much about debt. It sounds like a pretty sweet deal and seeing it in writing is kinda making me see that even more. But it's not that simple.

When I was 15 I used to do fitness training with my teacher after school, he was an ex royal marine and always based the sessions off of the things he actually used to do when he served. It was the highlight of my week, every week, without fail. After that I attended multiple work experience trips to military bases and loved it every time. I loved the discipline, the feeling of being part of a team on an important mission, the demanding physical challenges, the high octane aggressive nature of the work. I feel like army life (moreso than police life) would fulfil this craving for adventure and danger that I can't help having as a young man. That's why I'd want to do it first and then join the police. Is it worth it though? The pay is worse and I wouldn't be living at home saving for my future, plus there's a big recruitment push for police officers in the UK at the moment, the kind that likely won't be around in a decade. 

I've been debating this in my mind for literal years now but I really need to make a decision. I recently applied to both the army and the police and have interviews coming up for both. I need to pick one but I'm losing my mind trying to decide. 

What would you do if you were in my shoes?

703,"To preface, I (M) am a recent college grad who is currently unemployed and lives at home on the east coast. I was recently offered a job in Los Angeles in the career field that I want to work in. The job also has pretty good opportunity for growth in my opinion. The only problem is that I don't know a single person out there. All of my friends live and work in New York and that's where I've wanted to eventually move as well. The job in LA doesn't pay very well (less than $40k/year), so I'd more than likely need to find a roommate (again, something I'd have trouble with considering I don't know anyone that lives there). I understand that jobs are tough to come by right now because of the pandemic, so I feel like I need to take this. I also want to get out of my house as soon as possible after spending 5+ months here during quarantine (nothing toxic at home, just ready to not have to live with my parents anymore). I just don't think I'd be happy moving across the country to a city where I'd feel so alone. Basically, it comes down to choosing between a good career move for me and my happiness. If anyone else has faced a similar situation (or even if you have any thoughts) I would love to hear your input. Thanks!",07Sep2020,1
704,"My best friend of four years stopped talking to me after I told her I hooked up with one of my friends who happens to be 3 years younger than me (He's 17, I'm 20F). Sure it's a little weird but it's not like I'm manipulating him or anything like we've just been friends for years and then decided to hook up. Also the age of consent is 17 in my state.

Is my friend being irrational? Like I understand that hooking up with minors is not okay in most circumstances, but me and this guy have known each other for a while and there's no abuse of power or any of that going on so idk I don't think I did anything wrong

705,"My mom is in her 60s has been diagnosed severe Bipolar disorder with psychotic features for many years since my preteens. Because of this my parents have obviously had issues with their relationship and have been married but haven’t lived together full time or had a romantic relationship in a very long time. 

About two years ago my moms condition deteriorated greatly to the point where it was clear she couldn’t live alone and she ended up moving in with my dad with him pretty much in a caretaker role. 

Now they unexpectedly (to me) sold the house that I grew up in and are officially getting a divorce. 

My mom has nowhere to go. I flew to be with her and we have been staying in a hotel. I planned on helping her find an apartment but I’ve been here just over a week and it’s obvious she still shouldn’t be living on her own (she doesn’t eat without being convinced to, barely leaves the bed all day) 

I’ve never had a great relationship with my mom but I’m worried if I don’t figure something out she will end up homeless. She has money in the bank from the house sale but not enough for a retirement home situation which I think would be best for her. 

I’m just at a loss for what to do. I live a minimal/nomadic lifestyle and live in a truck normally so she can’t live with me.

Any advice much appreciated and I’m happy to answer questions. Thank you.",07Sep2020,1

The housekeepers take about 15 mins to come meanwhile i already put the candles in the cake. I'm waiting and waiting and I never felt more embarrased having to call them to come sing me happy birthday.Then when they come they're all quiet and look annoyed to be there. So I light up the candle and just wait awkwardly and then they start singing happy bday very quiet and quickly.

708," 

While I’m thankful that my mom and I have become closer these past few years, particularly these past few years, her loneliness and relationship issues with my dad are negatively impacting my life. There are days when I don’t start doing what I need to do until later in the day (related to my own time management issues) and that seems to be the time that my mom wants to video chat. As a result, there are things that I don’t get done when I wanted. It’s difficult to push someone away that you love, especially someone who is lonely (but won’t admit it). My mom is very much a “brave front” kind of person.

In the past few years, my parents have been having relationship issues. I have encouraged my mom to see a therapist. She went twice, pre-COVID, but then stopped. She refuses to go back, afraid that people will discover what she told the therapist. Even though I repeatedly tell her that that would violate HIPPA laws and patient confidentiality, she doesn’t seem to care. I asked her if my dad would consider going to therapy together but she said no; he thinks therapy and psychology is a load of bullshit.

Pre-COVID, I have encouraged my mom to go out to lunch/coffee with those people. Now, I shifted that encouragement to video chatting or calling some of those people. She always refuses by making excuses. I’m pretty sure that she doesn’t want to have a virtual lunch/coffee because of my dad.

In the past few years, my dad has become more child-like, having tantrums and fits over the most insignificant stuff. There have been times when my mom and I will be video chatting and, all of a sudden, he bursts in and then demands an answer then and there.

I have encouraged my mom to stand up for herself, telling him that she will help him when she’s done. None of the things he’s had fits about are emergencies.

710,"This is going to be long, so I am sorry. But I don’t know what to do. 
I am from Europe and I try to explain our laws a little. My (33F) husband (32) has a daughter (7), lets call her C, who is living with her mother (27) 100miles away. If child lives with one of the parents, the other one has to pay certain amount of money per month (it is official amount that changes every year). But also you don’t have to pay for the days the child is spending time with you (my husband is still paying and i am totally fine with it). This also means that everything has to be equal- half of the times mother takes the child to fathers place and half of the times father goes and brings the child to our place. Few years back the mother got a new bf, something happened and she went to the court hoping to get more money from my husband. She failed. Now my husband has to pay that amount monthly what court said and he doesn’t have to pay more (the amount gets bigger every year like I said but she still gets the same amount that court said years back). My husband buys clothes, school stuff etc for C, I bought phone for her cause she went to school etc. We never say bad things about her mother when C is around, we try to show her the happy life. Now, 4 months ago we moved 100miles away to another city because of the work.
Right after that the mother started to text my husband that how can he leave them, doesn’t he care about them and that he is not acting like father who isn’t seeing his child that often. C is telling the same things. The mother doesn’t like me and she is telling that to C, she is telling bad things about me (fe i am the reason why daddy moved and i am not allowing them to spend time together). The mother is yelling at my husband on the phone when C is around. So this has begun to be an everyday environment for C. She doesn’t understand yet that her mom is just jealous and frustrated. She doesn’t understand what is right and what is wrong. 
Now. She refuses to take the child to our place telling us that it is not her problem how we get the child but she has a right to get her time off. I feel so bad for my husband, he wants to see C as much as possible, they call every day, make videocalls couple of time a day etc. But he doesn’t want to allow the mother to dictate how we live our life. My husband doesn’t have driving license and he has to take trains (3) to get C to our place. It is really expensive. I don’t know what to do, how to support my husband. Doesn’t matter what kind of solution we give to the mother she always says no. 
I absolutely adore C. She is smart and sweet girl but her mothers attitude is ruining her childhood and messing her up psychologically. 
We can’t take C to live with us cause we are often away from home for days because of our jobs. 
What do you suggest? Just spend our money and time to see the child and let the mother get what she wants or what? Go to the court? We have all the screenshots where she tells us she won’t spend money on stupid things like taling C to our place.",07Sep2020,1

My friend group consists of 5 tight friends but it seems like it'll soon be reduced to 4.
You see, I'm not a very social person and the relationship with my parents is rocky. Sometimes I just don't want to go out or im too afraid to ask for permission.
The thing is, my friends meet each other very often, 5 times a week I would say. I just can't come that often and it's become an inside joke that I'm never there.
It really offends them, which I can understand, but I hate to be considered ""a bad friend"" because I can't attend every meet up. One of them told me once that I should be thankful that they still keep up with my shit and should start to change my ways because they think I don't appreciate them or don't even like them. 

I totally understand their perspective but I really try to come as often as I can. However when I'm there I don't even enjoy myself. I just sit around because I don't feel like a part of the group. Maybe it's an initiative thing but I genuenly grew tired of trying to satisfy them. Any advice on what to do?

714,"I know this isn’t a new problem, but it comes up for me more lately that I’ve been getting more involved in social media.

Lately, I’ve been kind of using reddit as a vent and advice tool, which maybe is a stupid idea but it seems to help.

But sometimes I’ll post something, being annoyed when some bullshit in my building or at work, and someone will comment something rude. Essentially minimizing my problems or insulting me as if whatever I’m struggling with is my fault or I deserve it. 

Generally, I try to write about whatever is bothering me in a way that’s differentiated and not really bitter or insulting, so I genuinely don’t know why my post would compel people to insult me for asking advice or venting about a problem.

717,"So I'm hosting a LAN party this Friday till Sunday, and invitations were sent out 3 weeks ago. I invited my 2 best gaming bros and longtime friends (Bob and Tim) whom I have known for 8 years.
Last month I moved in with my girlfriend in a house we are renting (important for later) plus she is gone the whole week being on a holiday trip with her mother, giving me the opportunity to host a 3 day LAN without having to care about noice and making a mess.

Through the years we have played many different games and had multiple LAN parties, where we would bring additional friends, which is super fun cause we all like to socialise irl. 2 of these LAN parties Bob and Tim had brought their mutual friend John. John has ADHD and social anxiety, plus he legit smokes bong between every single game he plays (no exaggeration) 20-40min long games.
I have nothing against his ADHD since I have it myself, nor about his anxiety cause I've dealt with that as well in my younger days, even his weed addiction is cool by me since I too like to enjoy a good blunt now and then, same with Bob and Tim who also likes to light up a blunt every now and then.

My problem is that the last 2 LAN parties with John, we all got super stoned, like it took 30 to 60 minutes just to join a single game cause everyone was high as kites messing around, John brought a shit ton of weed and we baked hash brownies. 
But that was 3 years ago and having talked with Bob and Tim we all agreed still to hit up a blunt or two to loose up and chill, but NOT to overdo it like the last times. 
I really don't care about John tagging along and getting high as a kite, but I care about staying in the house (no drugs polici) and obviously he can't smoke in my garden due to neighbours smelling his weed and possibly reporting it. There is a spot to smoke 5 min away but no way his lazy ass is gonna make that trip between every game or two. 
I also don't want any drama with denying him or him trying to influence Bob and Tim to smoke more than they planed to, just to keep him company on his many weed trips. 

My second problem is that normally I could easily just say I don't know him well enough to invite him or just avoid the topic, but over the last 2 months I've started playing this FPS game called Tarkov, which Bob, Tim, John and their mutual friend Lars all thought me how to play and all spent countless hours helping through the long starting process. 
We have a discord we all join every time we are online and there I became good friends with Lars whom I've never met. His a chill guy and just like Tim and Bob he also likes a blunt now and then. 

Basically I'm inviting 3 out of 4 people from our small gaming community, and I feel like a dick, and have no clue how to deal with the fact that when we load up on Friday and John joins discord he will definitely know about the LAN and since I'm hosting I'll look like a huge asshole. I could go by the fact I haven't talked to John in weeks due to him being distant, since his mom got cancer and he isolated himself with his weed addiction. 
The whole cancer thing makes me seem like an even bigger and careless asshole but John isn't even my friend, we just play sometimes when everyone is online and I've never hanged out with him just me and him, actually it's been years since I saw him last. 

I honestly just want to have a chill and fun LAN party with Bob, Tim and Lars with minimal weed smoking, and with no drama regarding John needing to smoke every 20-40 minutes. Lars even asked me about John the day I invited him but I just told him I hadn't heard from him in a while and him being isolated due to his mom's illness. 

Any advice is greatly appreciate, but try to minimise the judgments, I would like to exercise my rights to not having to deal with an acquaintance many problems. If he was me long time friend things would be different by a lot.",07Sep2020,1
718,"23(M). Okay so I suck at talking to girls online, tinder, Facebook ... any of them. I suck. 

First of all I find it weird how guys message girls on Facebook etc randomly or even semi random after meeting a girl just once. Or am I weird for not keeping up with the trend?

Tinders a little easier as your both there to meet someone. But even then I just don’t know what to say most of the time, especially if they don’t have a good bio to comment on. I actually feel quite awkward messaging. 

Now here’s the weird part, I’m a confident guy in person. I have absolutely no problem walking up to a girl or even a group of girls at a bar (I don’t need to be drunk) and making good conversation. I enjoy meeting new people, even if nothing comes of it. 

With everything going on things have shifted even more online and I just suck at it. I think because there’s no context to what you say you have to choose your words carefully.  Whereas in person I can just say what ever pops into my head. Even if it’s a bit cheeky. 

So any advice on how to improve my online dating?",07Sep2020,1

728,"Looking for advice on my college situation. General idea here is, I have met a couple people, I have 2 friends (one being my roommate), and I’m a little opposed to even attempting to make more because of COVID. Cases are starting to pop up on campus, and ~200 students are being quarantined right now. My introvertedness aside, I don’t want to increase my odds of getting sick. My boyfriend and his mom are autoimmune compromised and I’m not going to increase my odds of bringing the virus back home.

Even all that aside, this college is 2 1/2 hours away from my hometown. The school has done a very poor job of handling the COVID situation thus far, and I don’t plan on continuing my education here after this year. Which makes it seem even more pointless to try making friends. Not to mention the likelihood the school will eventually send us home anyways.

I feel it’s also worth mentioning I have issues with my social anxiety that I’ve been meaning to discuss with my doctor as it impairs my social life drastically, even with my lifelong friends. Lots of anxiety just going to hang out with people I’ve known for 10+ years. So maybe once a doctor helps me find a solution for this, making friends would seem more ideal, but for now, it’s not a priority for me.

The advice I’m looking for: is it even worth making friends on campus, specifically during this pandemic, especially if I’ll be changing schools? Other than some company, what would I gain from these friendships? I’m here to get an education, but I’m paying a lot of money for this education, so it feels like I should make some memories while I’m at it. Which is hard to do during these times.

I'm gonna make you think you're the worst person in the world. And you're worrying about this while you're on holiday? You should just be grateful.' I've been able to avoid this considering we haven't gone.

Now, I find it easier to talk to people online. So I found this online artist on insta, who did a lot of artwork on this fandom we both like - this made it easier as I knew we had soemthing to talk about. I started following and liking his stuff and eventually we started talking in DMS. For the sake of this story, we'll call him Charlie. Charlie (18M) and I have been talking for a while. We're like exactly the same people, and we always offer each other good advice, etc. 

Some things to note about Charlie and I: We are not romantically interested each other. At all. We're great friends, and that's all, and eveyone assumes because we're a girl and a boy we must be 'secretly in love' or whatever. It's absolutely not true and SUPER annoying. Also, he lives in Washington and I live in Ireland. 

It was my idea that we meet up in Disneyland. The pure CHAOS we could cause would be awesome. Charlie is ok to do it money wise. As he lives so far away it would have to be for a bit to make it worth while you know? Also you cant book disney tickets for a day.

My parents are aware that Charlie exists, and I mentioned it to them and they laid out so, to me at least, pointless rules. We're only allowed to meet in the parks, not outside them  (What does that even mean?) And my dads acting like it'll only be for a day or 2. It's a long trip for both us AND Charlie so only staying for a few days would be stupid. And he thinks that we're secretly dating which is complete rubbish. Charlie's mum does the same thing.

The thing is, everything I suggest my dad doesnt want to do. I suggested a video call between me, my parents and charlie so everyone could meet and see how we interact, etc.,and see it's not romantic but my dad refuses to. Says he trusts me but then at the same time judges me and makes me feel stupid for suggesting it  although that could just be my anxiety.

I know that the age gap can be concerning, particularly in romantic couples. In my opinion, if an 18 year old is dating a 15 year old they're just looking for someone they can control. But this is different as it's a really sweet friendship. Charlie is much more of an chaotic older brother to me. I hardly notice the age gap, especially considering that aparently mental illness ages you. 

We also have to talk more, to work out how long Charlie would stay in Florida, what parks we'd go to when, a lot of details stuff that I have to admit I've never planned. And I dont know how willing my parents would be to cooperate.

Whenever I go to speak to my dad, I dont know what to say. Well, I know what I want to say but I dont know the words to use, or how to explain that 'I want to spend more time with him' and maybe meet up outside of disney, even to like a late night adventure to Target (which is the real most magical place on earth if you ask me) 

I guess what I'm asking is this: How do I tell him I want to spend more time with Charlie? Hes said out right that 'We're not spending the whole time with Charlie"" which is fair, but I want more than a few days. It's not like I'm going to abandon my parents entirely - we're going to be there for 3 weeks. I'm grateful for the trip and the fact that we (might be) going next year if everything works out, and I'd live to finally meet Charlie in person and to have fun with someone my own age. Any tips, points to bring up, even a mini script or example sentences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

TL;DR: My parents think that my american friend is only going to be staying at the same holiday location as us for 1 or 2 days, when I want him to stay for longer as we haven't met before and I want to hang out with someone my own age. I dont know how to tell them this. Got any suggestions?",07Sep2020,1
734,"My boyfriend (25m) and I (22f) have been together for nearly 2 years. We moved in together after 6 months, so most of that time has been spent living together. We're very happy together, we work at the same place together, everything is pretty great. Except, he has an issue with my dog. He grew up with dogs, so its not a dog issue. I think its a *my* dog issue. She's a 35 lb rescue, cute as a button, can be troublesome. When she does something bad, he snaps. For example, we got on a new work schedule which messed up my dogs feeding and walking schedule. Because of this, she's had a couple accidents while we're at work. When this happens I simply say ""box"" and she goes to her box until its cleaned up. Then she gets taken outside in case she has anything else she needs to do. Her punishment doesn't involve being hit, spanked, or having her nose rubbed in anything and this bothers him. He thinks I'm too nice to my dog and thats why she does this. I think its because she's eating before we leave for work and has to go potty before we get back. 


Basically, yes I'm working on getting her feeding/potty time back on track and I'm not asking for help on that. I have that under control I just need to get back into a pattern too since I'm working full time and school full time, so we're both adjusting and I'm not angry with her for not knowing when to eat. But what I need advice on, is if his angry behavior is something I need to take more seriously? He took her out to potty this last time, and he yanked on her leash hard even though she was already cowering and he yelled at her. I told him to stop and just bring her inside. He's now isolating himself in the bedroom and my dog is decompressing in her box. I'm just so angry too, but I dont want to lose my temper if there's just some miscommunication I'm overlooking? I feel like I've been clear since day 1 that my dog is my child and she is treated as such. I work hard to encourage good behavior and I refuse to hit her. He knows this. I just. I don't know. I don't want to be 10 years down the road, married with kids, and he treat our kids this way. Am I over reacting?",07Sep2020,1
735,"Ok I'm going to try not make this post too long. In 2018 I left south Africa for Ireland with my mom. I was 15 at the time. My relationshop with my dad prior to moving overseas was not very traditional. I only saw him once a week on the weekend. Since moving here contact with him has tapered off slowly. Monthly calls turned into calls every 3 months until around January. I didn't answer his call. Why? He was trying to lower maintenance payments and coincidentally this just so happens to be the first time he calls me in two months. Felt like he was trying to butter me up. Cut to now in September and we haven't talked in 8 months. He hasn't tried to contact me once since then. Obviously this has made me feel quite a few things. Primarily guilt and shame. I just want to know, is it my fault that he doesn't call? Should I have called him back and tried to get a relationship going. Or should he as a parent tried to contact me again? I  dont feel I have enough life experience to know. I haven't been a father.",07Sep2020,1

I feel like this always happens to me. Someone will just decide that we are friends even if I don’t want a relationship with said person, and so I keep playing along because I don’t want to hurt their feelings even when it makes me miserable.

I’m tired of doing this because I know it only makes everything so much worse, and so I wanted some advice on how I could tell them I don’t reciprocate their feelings in a way that doesn’t make it sound too personal or harsh. 

In this particular case it’s an online friend so I’m just considering ghosting them at this point but that’s my last resort if I don’t work up the courage to tell them. 

If anyone has had anything similar happen to them and resolved it please let me know how you did it.

any help is greatly appreciated! :D",07Sep2020,1
738,"Yeah so I got a job that pays 2.5 times what my previous job pays, and it's just been a lot of work. It's also really boring, and socially isolating. It's in software development.

I've realized I can work less hours... only I am in control of whether I work until 6pm or 9pm Monday through Friday. I still just think I will be depressed and stressed when I come back from the vacation I am on. Kind of case in point, I am using all my vacation time for this year to move into a new apartment, and I am still not done moving in. I just have no free time to socialize or go outside or anything, at least that's what it feels like. I also have few friends, and COVID doesn't help that.

I know typical advice will be to make friends, and exercise. I moved to a new apartment which is near a forest so I can go for walks there which will probably help a bit. I just think I also hate my job. It's constant pressure to do things NOW and I want out. It's hard, though, because I would need to switch to a new company, and it could be just as bad or worse in a new company. Or I could switch to a new line of work entirely but that could also prove troubling.

I guess if I were to give myself advice it would be to just find a less stressful job which pays less. I am just not sure exactly what that job would be. It seems that most of the software development jobs involve a high degree of pressure. I am okay at software engineering, but not very fast, and it seems managers always want speed more than anything (who can blame them, they are under deadlines themselves). My team is honestly not too terrible in terms of work / life balance, we are sort of middle of the road. I think part of it also is just being lonely.

It's gotten to the point where I end up crying some days in exasperation. It just doesn't seem to get better despite my efforts. I just signed a new lease, which will help if I stay at this job, but it also ties me into this job location. I would gladly take a job where I make half as much but also work half as much, but I don't know of any software engineer jobs that are like that.",07Sep2020,1

741,"*tl;dr - Friend is a huge asshole to people and I think he's a bad influence to myself. Keeps promising that he'll  change but doesn't. Also pressures me into driving everywhere because there isn't much to do in town. Don't know if I should just ghost him or tell him over the phone.*

I've been really thinking about cutting ties with a close friend of mine but I think it'll be better if I got advice from a third party before making a final decision. 

I've known my friend since I was three and we had a perfect friendship up until around high-school. He really became negative and acted like an asshole to everybody. I remember during lunch in our freshman year he would squirt ketchup packets into unsuspecting kid's backpacks and he threw food at kids around us. I became embarrassed and didn't want to be associated with him anymore so I stopped sitting by him during lunch and started hanging out with a new group of friends. 

Fast forward until Junior year of high-school. A close friend of mine committed suicide and my old group of friends just broke apart after that. I became very pessimistic about things and I was just lonely. Didn't really have anyone to talk to so I rekindled my friendship with my childhood friend. I became acquainted with his group of with friends and we would hangout. It felt nice that I finally found people that felt the same way about things. We were all basically the quiet kids at school minus the tendency to kill everyone at school. 

Our hangouts consisted of going to punk rock concerts and vandalism fueled by teenage angst. I'm not going to go to detail into what we did but it was bad. It wasn't until we were almost caught that I snapped out of whatever I was in and told my group of friends that we should stop. This wasn't right. My childhood friend agreed and told everyone that we shouldn't do this anymore. And we all just kind of stopped. However it resumed once we all graduated high-school. I eventually stopped hanging out with my group of friends and only talked to my childhood friend. 

He kept telling me that he has changed and doesn't associate himself with that group of friends anymore but I don't believe it. When I drive, sometimes he'll roll down the window and shout out profanities at people walking. He constantly makes fun of people including myself. I don't like being around his presence but I feel forced because I can't find new friends during the pandemic. He's such a bad influence. We kind of stopped hanging out because he admitted that I was a boring person. I didn't want to play airsoft with him, I didn't want go fishing with him, that sort of stuff. 

So help me reddit, should I tell my friend that he's not my friend anymore or should I just stop talking to him?",07Sep2020,1

743,"I’ve been hooking up with a guy recently. We both still live with our parents so we usually just fuck in our cars. I think he’s getting bored of that though and he asked me if I could sneak him into my place one night. 

My biggest concern was making sure my dad doesn’t find out. So I waited until last night when he was working night shift. I planned to sneak the guy in once my dad left for work and then sneak him out after my dad came home and went to sleep. 

The guy asked me to come blaze with him outside first so I tried to sneak out. But my sister caught me and asked why I was up and dressed at 3am. I didn’t respond and she just rolled her eyes and went back to bed. 

I went outside and we smoked for a bit, then he kept asking me what kind of stuff I was into. He asked if I would drink his piss and I thought that was really hot. It always kinda turned me on when I watch it in porn.

I snuck him into my room upstairs. However, my bedroom is right next to my parent’s room and my mom was asleep in there. As well, my younger brother and grandparents were asleep down the hall. 

I felt like it was extremely hard to relax while we were fucking. I was so nervous about waking my family or if they could hear. He kept asking me if I was okay. I really wanted to stop because I couldn’t enjoy myself with all this stress. But I felt like I would disappoint him if I asked to stop. (Yeah, I know I should have asked to stop) 

He eventually asked to pee in my mouth and I agreed. But I quickly realized how awful pee tastes. After that he asked me to jerk him off while he took my phone and looked at nudes I had saved. I said I didn’t want to do anything else that night and he was pretty understanding. We just cuddled for a bit and I asked him to leave before my dad got home. 

I slept three hours. I felt super guilty about last night. My mom was acting weird and super quiet with me this morning. I’m like 90% sure she heard us. And my sister is angry at me for keeping secrets from her. Idk how to get over this guilt.

Also I’m not sure what to message that guy I saw. I think under the right circumstances he is a lot of fun to hang out with. But this was way too intense for me and I didn’t have a good time. I want to apologize to him for acting so panicked and kicking him out early.

744,"Hello reddit. Last Sunday I had a very hard fight with my family. To sum up a bit I was the one in my family (me (23M), brother (25M) and parents (49 both) ) to deal with my mother's drugs problem (cocaine and pills) since 2014, when the problem started to be more frequent.
My mom has borderline disorder and always had a grudge with my father's family (like some kind of loop).
My dad is an emotional inept when it comes to this matter and I recently discovered some financial secrets about him that surprised me. 
My brother is a fucking idiot too sensitive to deal with this. 
The thing is that I always saw how to resolve this problem: mom need to go to rehabilitation and after that try to start a new life and my brother needs to 'man up' (in a sense where he can deal with these issues like a damn adult). 
Last Sunday and with 4 days of nearly no sleep and cocaine, my mother had argue with my father about not been appreciated, not be dependent on coke and babble/non coherent speech when we tried to talk with her. Then, after 5 years trying to be as calm as possible I exploded. I broke the glass of the table with a slap and started shouting that I was tired of that bullshit. 
Everything was fucked up. My mother had an anxiety attack, my brother tryed to calm her (and call the doctors) and when things were a bit more calmed I told them that I would visit a friend for the next days in another city. 
I ended in a hostel (because the friend went to Italy on vacation and my timing is wonderful) and now things seem to be calm, but I know that this is only a patch that won't truly solve anything. 
I'm tired of pulling the car (that's the literal translation of spanish, sorry if you don't understand) and I don't know what to do. 
Should I try to become independent or try to help them once more?

746,"I met a guy at a party in my friend group and he showed interest in me, inviting me to a yearly cottage they have. We had casual sex while drunk; I haven't hooked up with someone in over a year so it was kind of a big deal (being an emotional but also kind of distant female) even though I didn't necessarily have any interest in him and even when we tried getting closer and talking I felt like there was no spark or connection. However after we had sex he became kind of distant towards me and could only really talk to me when he was drunk or obviously trying to hook up again. 

I started to get a little attached towards him (or the idea of him) -- I also tried talking to and dancing (casually) with other guys just to not solely focus on him but every time I tried he would interject and be like ""woah woah woah"" or something, in a way claiming me (or, once again, the idea of me). On the third night of the cottage we had sex again and after sex he said he was going for a cigarette so I said to come find me after for round 2 (He finished quickly) as I had to get something from my bag in my room. I ended up falling asleep and found out that he had sex with another girl a couple of hours after me and him.

I feel really hurt and empty and even though we both wanted it and both knew we didn't really like each other I can't get over the fact that he hooked up with another chick right after me without even caring to have me orgasm or make me feel good. My friend said he could see that I started to like him and wasn't being the fun lively careless person that I usually am so he got weird about that and is just a ""guy being a guy"".

My problem is that I become cold, distant and subconsciously play the whole hard to get because I dont know how to act and get anxiety about the whole situation of not knowing whether or not someone is playing you. After a bad past with relationships and jerks it's really hard for me now to open up and just be casual and go with the flow

I also don't understand why the hell I am feeling like this because as I said I did not really like him at all and only became attached to his presence after we hooked up. Had he not hooked up with the other girl I wouldn't want him (I think) or try to get closer with him. I guess I just feel used and don't understand how a guy could just do that. I unfollowed him on Instagram after finding out he hooked up with that girl and now feel stupid because I feel like he ""won""... like, in the beginning, I was the one playing hard to get and I had sex with him and feel like I just got toyed with. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS CASUAL FROM THE BEGINNING. I HATE THIS. 

Writing this all out now I feel pretty stupid and immature that I care so much and like... what should I have expected from a guy who has no bound to me and vice versa? I'm not really a party girl and don't do hookups so I guess I just wanna know is this a normal situation? Am I being completely illogical and too emotional? How do I get over this?

**TLDR;** I hooked up with a guy after a long time of being single and not hooking up with anyone and he hooked up with another girl that same night.

Don't have a job, hearing impaired, barely any money, my mom doesn't have any money, and long story short.

I had to stay with my mom to support each other and my parents are hoarders and I just finished moving a few weeks ago after 2.5 years of moving. There's still a lot of stuff to purge but that's all my mom stuff. I myself so badly want to move into an apartment, gain independence, and be successful with money and fulfillment with my career and relationships. It's always been my dream as a young teen of making video games as a game designer and artist. I also always wanted to own my own business and have multiple incomes. I also enjoy fitness, self-improvement, minimalism/organizing, and technology. I always had that entrepreneurial spirit in me. My dad had his own business up until his death (not very successful but it was something - we always struggled with money). 

I'm mad at myself and my mother for not being able to do anything for a  job or career. She has this incredible control over me and wants me to work for her for free and take care of her. I can't do that. I have been pushed to go into real estate as a realtor agent. I think I can do a good job but I also do not know much about sales and worry about never having time to grow my personal business as a game designer and publish indie games. Create a YouTube channel, etc. Write books related to fitness or game design rulesets.  The thing is, I need money to start a business. I need a new computer and a website.

and why is that you might wonder? Because of these fuckign arabs that complained like btches and put their own religion onto are FCKING CHRISTIAN COUNTRY....

Also if you are not Muslim you are not allowed to visit inside of Mosques unless you want to serve a severe prison sentence, you cannot set foot in a Mosque to visit...

751," 

Okay I don’t know how to write this, but ye one of my online friends told me to go here and post about my current situation, to hopefully get some good advice. 

So let me explain my situation and what my problem is.

So first of all I'm a 16M, my problem is my dad, he is not the nicest person in the world, I would say the opposite. Me and my oldest sister, who has moved out thinks he has a real bad narcissism (and you can really see it in his behavior), I mean in the way that he always has been pushing us (me and my sisters) down without any reason, if we do something wrong he is just telling us how worthless we are. For example, if I would drop a glass he would yell our lives out of us and push us down to the ground with insults, but if he would drop anything he is just like “opps'' hiding it and throwing it away. So he loves pushing us down, trying to show that we are worthless and that he is great and better than everyone else and that we “need” him. Another thing that I noticed last year was when one of my older sisters started to get home later then she was allowed because she had a boyfriend, and yeah of some reason she wasn’t allowed even tho she was 18 years old, so yeah and because she got home late and my dad found out that she had been with her boyfriend (which he didn’t know was her boyfriend) and a few other boys and a few girls hs started calling her (his own daughter, without proof) a B\*\*\*h and sl\*t, which yeah I damn hated it and cried multiple times for her sake. When she revealed she had a boyfriend my parents weren’t happy and even started calling him bad stuff, and trying to get her to break up, she luckily didn’t. My parents (especially my dad) were not happy when my oldest sister, who already had moved out and got a boyfriend and they were just mean and talking shit about him, even in front of my sister(even though he is an amazing and nice guy). I guess my dad doesn't like that there is someone else in their lives that can prove that they are better than him. 

What made me want to write this today was because, I've been sick this weekend and today, and my dad basically punishes me for saying I'm sick, this saturday I had to follow my mom to my 3 year older sister who just moved out this week and help her fix her home which got me to feel even worse on sunday, which he punished me by saying I'm not allowed to play games and talk to my online friends (and I would have to say I have a online friend which is basically my emotional support and that I have to thank so damn much for having, thank you if you are reading this) and forcing me to go to sleep a lot earlier than usual, today, which is Monday when I still felt bad he forced em to school even tho this pandemic is still happening and I'm not supposed to go even if I feel the slightest bad, today I talked with my friends and I was done with all my homework and he stomps into my room at only 19:30 saying, “you have played to much today” and threatening to just drag out the cables from the computer and take it if I didn’t stop (which would kinda destroy the computer). 1 hour later he opens my door and screams at me for not being in bed saying “if you now are sick you better sleep early”  when my bedtime is 22:00 on school days, and then at the same time giving me something saying “read this” and threatening me to take away my computer if I'm not going to bed. My mom is a bit better but he really doesn't seem to listen to her, and he is only this way with the family, if someone else would be at home he is a whole different person, or if we would be outside with someone. I can’t handle this anymore and he is really getting on my nerves but at the same time I'm kinda scared of him. I know what he is doing is wrong and not normal. this is why I'm now asking if anyone has any advice on how I should handle it or what I should or could do? I don’t want to live with this anymore and don’t want my younger sister to have it either.",07Sep2020,1
752,"It's hard not to feel like something's wrong with me when I see literally everybody else dating someone or in a relationship, meanwhile I'm alone and have always been alone.

It feels like everybody else is out there getting experience in dating and romantic relationships and doing all this stuff in middle school and high school, meanwhile I'm a sophomore in college and still have yet to have a relationship or even anyone who had a crush on me.

757,"I moved out two months ago due to lease being up. However, my two roommates renewed their lease, and they found someone else to replace me in the lease. Unfortunately, that means I won't get my portion of the security deposit back, since the lease was renewed. I asked my landlord what I could do in this situation, and he said that he usually lets the tenants figure it out, and gave me contact information for the new tenant. I emailed the new tenant, but it's been a week and no reply. Honestly, I'm getting frustrated by the lack of communication... I know that I could probably go to a small claims court, but I don't even think I have a good case. I think my only other option is to ask my landlord for the contact info of the new tenant's co-signer ( my landlord required all of us to have a cosigner, as we are college students ), but I'm not even sure if that's a thing I can do, or if I should even do....

761,"(Really sorry this is gonna be a long post)
Umm, okay, this probably needs some bg, so yeah, About 4 years ago in 2016, i started my life in college and I was 16yo. There was this girl who I am gonna call 'P' (also 16) whom I met while on a trek with a college group. I instantly got a massive crush on her and for the next 4 months I slowly y'know, made my way up her peoples list, becoming friends, best friends , me confessing my crush to her, she rejecting me first, but then eventually, she said yes to me. I was so over the moon when that happened. It felt like the best thing ever had happened to me then.  It was all going so wonderfully, I was madly in love with her and with confidence I'mma say she was madly in love with me too. She was literally the definition of the word best. About a year into the relationship, just like other normal couples, we used to get in a minor arguments, which would usually be sorted out by talking or going on a date and spending time with each other. But this one time we were having a fight over me not celebrating our 1 year anniversary the way she wanted because I had other business to deal with(Looking back I would throw that business out of the way to reconcile with her)
 During this period of lack of communication between us, I kind of got a minor attraction towards another girl in the college, and subsequently, being the naive dumbfuck college student that I was, i ended up thinking that I had lost my love for P. (Which, i'll tell you btw, is still not the case). So i ended up breaking up with her and we seemed to be on good terms for a while as well. I really used to cry my heart out everyday about not being with her but My immaturity took the better of me and made me think thats just the way it goes. I heard from a few conmon friends of Ours that 'P' was expecting me to reconcile for over 6 months and that she was super sad about it. I did not end up talking about it with her and we stayed broken up. 
In 2018, i forced myself to convince myself that I had moved on from P by dating another girl 'D' . Me and 'D' started dating but it became clear to me that I hadnt fallen out of love with P and hence mine and 'Ds' relationship lasted only 6 months because it was essentially a rebound for me. Now since i have broken up with D, i took a lot of time to think about what I felt about P and my best friend helped me realize that ever since I broke up with P, i never had looked genuinely happy. So I feel like i gave away my happiness when I broke up with P. Hence, during lockdown here, I tried to communicate with P(we are still on talking terms) to try and get back together but she said that shes moved on and that ''we arent happening again"". I wanna know if there would be any way to win her back, or atleast , move on from her, because I genuinely believe i wont ever be happy as much as I was with her again.",07Sep2020,1
762,"need some advice, I have a very polar thinking (black or white- like thinking, where the answer is either yes or no -&gt; no betweens) when it comes to issues and I have this belief that I need to believe in certain things if I want to be a 'good person'.  Let's say this, there's the LGBTQ+ Community and I believe that I should support it, but I don't represent any part of that community, and I find that if I don't openly support it, it means I don't support it bc that's the only other side (and if I don't support it, then it means I'm not a good person). Then, should I bliss ignorance to the community, to which I think is also wrong. It's a lot to take in. Sorry for using the community as an example. The weird part is that I don't use any major social media (no twitter, rarely reddit, just some contacts on my phone, and I mainly talk to people in person but I've taken a texting approach now due to covid) so most of these thoughts seem to be influenced by what others say. Just a lot on my mind. I've had this thinking for around 2 years now.

I would love to hear your advice on how to deal with my polar-like thinking and my need to believe in certain things (or else I'm not a good person). It's very peculiar how I've developed to have these types of feelings.

It's that time of the year where I (15M) start getting sick.. I have been requiring medical help in this period of the year for the past 4 yrs. But this year looks like it's gonna affect my future health alot.. 

My parents have been pressuring me to learn more and more for the upcoming annual exams (in 10th)becuz they  want me to get good marks in school and tuitions and that's it. They don't care about me from any point from there. They just think I'm supposed to learn and only learn when I'm free and get above 97% since my elder sister got 96%. It's like they forgot about my freedom and health..

I had bad eyesight from the age of 7. It kept getting worse and worse from that time on. Coming to the present time, it's probably more than +5 in both eyes and I didn't get a eye check over an year due to covid. My eyesight have gotten that bad that I can't see items further than 50 cms clearly. I have been complaining about this to my parents but they are just saying ""wait till covid ends"" or ""people are losing their jobs alot"" which  they have been saying for more than 3 years now whenever I want to get something expensive since, alot of ppl have been losing their jobs in my country becuz of a crisis in the country which I'm living in.

On the other hand my vitamin levels in my body are low af. We shifted to a ground floor apartment over 8 yrs ago and we had plenty of sunlight coming in until a year ago. A new building has just been concentrated in front of the only window which gives sunlight in my room. And to make it more worse, the outside common spot where people usually sit is being occupied day and night by these fucking illiterate kids who came straight from a village during the winter. I once tried sitting there with my phone without interfering in what they were doing to get some sunlight and these kids came around me and were looking in my phone. I was fine with it in the start but then when I changed to something else they started demanding me to put it back. And when I said no they fucking started hitting me. That's why I no longer go out to that area when they are outside for the 3 months in which I can get ample amount of sunlight easily. 

To make it all worse I have been getting random allergies and headaches. Like I am not even eating anything new and I get scratches all over my body. And for the headaches, it's random. Like I wake up after a nap or in the morning and I have this migraine for the whole day. One more thing is I think I'm getting insomnia from a chronic disease. I have been able to sleep and the days I sleep at 4 in the morning, I wake up literally 7 hrs after even tho I'm tired af.

And also about my Metal health, I have been suffering from anxiety, stress and too much of self awarenes and to make it worse, I cant get counseling since I don't get pocket money when my younger sister literally gets 30$ every month. 

To end it all i being fed food filled to the brim with oil saying its ""healthy"". I have been eating that only for the whole quarantine and have gained more than 10 kgs. I have asked my parents to buy a treadmill since everyone is obese and then they are like ""you can go out and run"". Bitch it's literally 40-50° C for 9 months along with sunlight which literally stings..

I have been saying about these to my parents and it's either the thing I said before is what they say, or they will be like eat some painkillers or vitamin D and C pills and that's it. They havent taken me to the doctor from last year and when my younger sibling just had A FUCKING FEVER they rushed her to the hospital even thru FUCKING COVID.

775,"I'm a 28yo male. I live with my wife (29f) and have being together for 6 years and this is the only relationship I ever had. We moved from our country a couple of years ago and even though it has been hard we are doing a lot better now. 

I have suffered from depression and anxiety since my young childhood and was neglected about it. I didn't deal with that problem until I was almost 20yo when I got therapy and medication for some years. My dad always told me I was exaggerating things about how I felt so I just accepted it (I think this is called gaslighting and will keep refering to it that way) and thought that it was normal to live like that. Gaslighting and repressing myself was the way I ""dealt"" with my suicidal thoughts when I was 8yo and even though I no longer want to die I think it has shaped my grown up self.

I no longer know if I'm living my own life the way I want to, if I'm living the way I'm expected to have or if I'm just sabotaging my own life. I have been thinking about this for months. Wife and I had the babies talk and I just don't know if I want to have kids yet (or never, I really don't know). There are moments I feel like having a child is gonna be an awesome experience but there are other times I feel like I really don't want to do it, sometimes I'm even wondering if wanting kids is something I really want or if it's something I'm into because I'm expected to. I don't know who I am anymore and what I want. 

I have also started having fantasies of going out, traveling, getting to know new people (I'm an introvert why do I even fantasize with this) and even getting one night stands and try bisexuality (this is also something new). A part of me desires to explore the world and youth I never thought could be within my reach and feels like my marriage is a cage but I don't always feel like this. There are also moments when I feel like I'm happy with my life. I have a wonderful wife who is also my best friend. We have gone through so much shit together and come from a similar background of abuse and neglect that makes me feel deeply bonded to this woman. I think she is gonna be an awesome mother and I admire her so much. I feel like this is the woman of my life and can't stand the idea of not being part of her life. I'm also gladly supporting her in her journey of learning to code so she can get a nice job cause local job market sucks unless you have some coding skills. I want to see her grow into her best self and I totally know she can be great. We get along really well and she is incredibly caring and attentive with me.

Who am I? Whom do I want to be? What do I want to do? I don't have answers, just questions. I know that those answer MUST come from me but I really can't tell which is the real me. Leave my current life and pursue the fantasy of being young and free (which feels like the hedonistic and selfish choice) or stay with my wife and try to purge the fantasy from my head (which feels like the gaslighted and conformist me choice). Both seems wrong and both seems like the right thing to do.",07Sep2020,1
776,"Back in early June my saint of a 16yo cat died. So being in the middle of quarentine, I looked to adopt two cats to fill the void, seeing as I live alone and would go crazy if totally alone. 

Found two 8-week-old kittens at a shelter and they called saying I was chosen to adopt them. awesome! drive 45 minutes there and then they suddenly tell me they're feral.. a little less awesome. I take them anyway and it was a struggle for months but we finally got to a very good point. They had worms and ringworm and now that is all cleared up and they are fixed and have all their shots. 

At about 5 months old now I let them out into the main floor of the house (previously in a small room) and they have been good and coming to me for pets and love and food. But they still run from me from time to time and run from anyone I bring over. 

So. this weekend I leave for 2 days. I left Friday night and got back early Monday morning. They shit on my bed and on a chair in my bedroom. I understand that this is probably because I was gone and they were stressed but wow. i can't leave for 2 days? and I guarantee they pooped yesterday bc some of it looked older. so i can't leave for one.  

I went to grab them and tell them no and scold them and boy turned on me and bit me on my nose and so now I have a gash.. and I understand that it was because they were scared but idk. i just feel like I didn't mean to sign up for this and now I am conflicted bc i feel like an asshole who took cats from a shelter and now wants to give them back and trade them for different cats :/

My mom is not taking care of herself. The doctor told her shes too over weight and continues to eat so unhealthy.

781,"This isn't for me, it's for my girlfriend, we'll call her Alexa, in her living situation. I'm going to write out the recent events before I get into asking for advice. 

Just tonight the roommate, we'll call her Eliza, came home from work. Apparently someone parked in *her* spot in the parking lot. There are 2 buildings and 20 spaces total in the lot. Keep in mind, they do *not* have assigned spaces. She came upstairs to the unit and ignored us as she walked in, Alexa had said hey to her, then Eliza hung up her keys, turned to me and asked,'are you leaving tonight? I said,'I don't know, probably not.' Then she said,'because there's nowhere for me to park.' She essentially asked me to leave so she could park in the lot, OR just to inform me how unhappy she is that I'm there. I didn't respond so she kind of huffed and walked to her room then closed the door. Alexa and I walked onto the deck to check the lot. There was a spot open *next to my car*. She didn't even check in the lot, just saw that the side where she parked was full and parked in the driveway that leads up to the lot. (There are 3 spots in this driveway, apparently she doesn't recognize them as spots, even though they are valid) Where she ended up parking was no more than 20 feet away from the open space.

 Alexa has said that she should not have to, and will not, keep me from coming over just because it upsets her roommate. It is just as much her own space as the roommate's.  Which is rather funny, because the entire apartment essentially belongs to Eliza. Alexa doesn't have *anything* hanging on the walls, or any furniture there.  Eliza had said that she would be bringing the furniture originally. Alexa has *three* plants in the living room, that is all that she owns in there. Eliza has close to 10.  I absolutely love plants, I do not have a problem with plants themselves, I have over 20. But when it would take 1 armload for Alexa to remove her things from the living room, and 2 truck loads to remove Eliza's, it's a problem. Again, I am not exaggerating.

Eliza has a Facebook marketplace addiction. And is weekly bringing things home to decorate with or fix as a project. Well, her 'projects' generally cover the entire living room floor. We've both very narrowly avoided stepping on needles and nails multiple times. She has at least 4-5 projects in the shared spaces, but WILL NOT keep them in her room. Why? She doesn't have space, its full of stuff already. 

Now with the kitchen. Alexa has cleaned the counters, did the dishes, cleaned the sink, and swept the floor in afternoon. (Eliza doesn't sweep up the constant leaf droppings from her fern hanging by the window, theres a literal pile of leaves on the floor at all times because it is neglected for water and light.)
*I am not exaggerating in any way* when I say it took less than 24 hours for the kitchen to be trashed again. Alexa came to my place that afternoon after cleaning and stayed the night, we came back together approximately 24 hours later to a sticky counter, dishes *piled* into and next to the sink. No comment on the mess from her, no apology. And in general, Eliza would not clean dishes herself without waiting 3-4 days, or waiting for Alexa to do it. Eliza does not clean. I have pictures of their kitchen as evidence, it's awful.

To the dishes, Eliza uses easily 2-3x as many dishes as Alexa. Eliza likes to put water in them to 'soak' after cooking and then leave it for multiple days to stink in the sink, and they *do* stink. It also frequently doesn't matter if the sink is full or not. She will put the dirty dishes and cups on the counter next to the sink and leabes them for days. Eliza will frequently leave the full/clean dishwasher open, that Alexa originally unloaded and loaded, in a passive aggressive method of telling Alexa to unload it. EVEN THOUGH Alexa washed Elizas filthy moldy dishes already, Eliza implies she needs to do it again. I had shut it myself at one point and we came back later to find it opened again and untouched. Even when the sink is empty, Eliza will sometimes set her dirty dishes on the counter *next* to the sink and leaves it for days. 

In the bathroom. Eliza has 2/3 of the space taken up in the mirror cabinet, the rack above the toilet is 70% full of her things. In the shower, she has positioned her shampoo bottles in a way that I knock them down when I step into the shower. She has a device on the shower head to hold bottles, soaps, etc, which she already has shampoo and conditioner bottles in. I moved them over 2 feet to the right so no one knocks them over and she moved them back. Which, it isn't my bathroom, so I get it, but it's still frustrating that they were placed in a spot that causes what should be obvious inconvenience.

I have a hook that Alexa decided was for my towel. I have 1 bathroom hook, I'm not asking for much in a space that isn't mine. Just a hook for a towel. Eliza will frequently double up her robes after showering, as in placing 2 robes to a hook. Our hooks are next to each other. One day while neither Alexa or I were there, she decided to take my towel off the hook, drop it onto the floor, and place her robe on it instead. Even though she frequently doubles them up together. I have a hard time seeing this as anything other than a blatant act of disrespect.

Eliza also puts her *dirty* wash clothes on the towel rack, ON TOP of Alexa's towel. She didnt push Alexa's towel slightly out of the way to access the bar, just set it on top. Or even using the bar in the shower, Which has been holding the same washcloth for the last 3 or 4 weeks, even though Eliza isn't using it. That's disgusting. You clean your butthole with a washcloth and Eliza put that on her towel. 

A few days ago I had an issue with the washers that I have in the area office of my apartment, and needed to wash a load of laundry at my girlfriend's apartment. No big deal, right? I had to do one load, I was on my last clean outfit. She made a snide comment about it. I forgot my small mason jar full of detergent there on the drier. Eliza put it on the floor while we were gone. There were open spaces elsewhere. 

Frequently Eliza will make snide comments, which she claims are attempts at jokes, directed towards me or Alexa. Such as about how much Alexa eats, which is *not* too much. She has a regular appetite. Or about smoking a joint. God forbid someone have a smoke session after a stressful day of work and classes.

To her animals. She has 3 reptile tanks, and a cat who she claims is for emotional support. First, it's unfair that they split the electricty bill 50/50 when Eliza has 3 heat lamps running for 12 hours a day. My last roommate and I had our first electricity bill at around $100. He had a habit of leaving his PC running 24/7, which contributed to it as did the 100w grow light I used that month for cilantro. We took $40 off our bill while still playing just as much by doing some energy saving things. 

More often than not (from what I have seen while I am there)Alexa or I will end up feeding her cat at night. Eliza gets off work and does whatever she does when she gets here, then makes her own food and goes into her room or watches TV with us on the couch. She even will leave for an evening out without feeding him. The cat is vocal when he's hungry. She can't not know it when he needs food. Animals are precious family members. I cannot understand how you can either hear your crying pet and ignore them, or not hear it through some haze caused by a mental disorder. It does and cannot ever make sense to me. 

I recognize that mental illness can be serious and excruciatingly challenging/ painful, but there is a limit to how far one can justify someone's actions even when considering the disorder. 

And I'm *trying* to see this from her viewpoint. She frequently blames all of her actions on the mental illness.. I have ADHD and don't blame my inability to focus on it. Alexa *also* has a mental illness but she does *not* blame her shortcomings on it. She tries hard.   

 Eliza gets upset that Alexa does not spend time with her very much in the evenings, but would you want to?  Would you want to spend time with someone who is always making snide comments about everything you do?

Eliza and Alexa were friends before they moved in together, I've since warned her not to room with friends again, but it's too late at this point.

What can I do? What can Alexa do? I've been trying to get Alexa to just talk to her, but Alexa has confrontation issues, which I get. I do to an extent too, but I won't let someone walk on me. We're both worried that addressing the issues will lead to Eliza blowing up on us. We have access to the resources our university has to offer us, if they'll offer anything. Eliza is frequently meaner to men rather than women. We've been told that she has Borderline Personality Disorder, but again, there's only so far you can go to justify someone's actions. You cannot use your mental illness as an excuse for your horrible actions.

 I just don't understand how somebody who the both of us have gone out of our way to be good friends to, and to help when she needs help can be so mean to us!?  After her break up, a mutual friend of Eliza and I, and myself, sat with her for 10-15 minutes literally being a shoulder to cry on. Both him and I were late to class, but it was worth, so I thought. If I knew she'd be like this in the future I wouldn't have done anything nice. 

I just don't understand her.",07Sep2020,1

785,"I started of taking them for a genuine reason after I was stabbed, I managed to quit no problem. Recently though I was stabbed again, so I bought a bag of Oxy again. This time it was more painful and I was eating these pills like candy. Then I got lowkey kidnapped and had acid dashed in my face (don’t ask, it’s a long story but I deserved it). This gave me some psychological stress and has resulted in me going over board with the pills. I love the relaxing feeling which comes with them and have been using them excessively.

I genuinely don’t think I can stop now and I’ve just stared to college and don’t want the hassle of a pill addiction. It’s not an issue financially but its definitely a problem. How difficult is it to just stop taking more ? I’ve tried twice and couldn’t manage it.

It’s unfortunate this has happened as I’ve just started college and want to do well and don’t want this distraction to hold me back but I guess I can still function.

So what’s the best way I can try and stop taking Oxy ?",07Sep2020,1
786,"Just a disclaimer that I’m not trying to start anything politically-charged, I do genuinely want advice because I don’t know how to handle this situation:

I have a couple of friends (also coworkers) who want me to play in an adult kickball league. It’d be for the next 3 weeks, 1 day per week.

I said “yes,” and signed up for it, but now I’m having second thoughts due to possibly being exposed to Covid if someone is sick. Or, of course, I could be asymptomatic and give it to another person who’s playing. 

I talked to one of my friends and asked her if the players need to wear a mask during the game. She said no one wears a mask and I got the impression that they don’t really care. This is sending off alarm bells in my head.

I’m not immunocompromised nor do I live with anyone else, and I would DEFINITELY be wearing a mask at all times and keeping my distance when I reasonably can, but I don’t know how safe kickball really is in terms of limiting exposure.. on the one hand, it’s probably safer than basketball or soccer, but less safe than say tennis or golf. 

My girlfriend doesn’t want me to do it. My mom is leery as well. If I could go back in time, I’d just decline my friend’s offer. But now I feel that if I back out, I’ll look flaky, inconsiderate, and just be a giant asshole. Like, couldn’t I have figured this out before committing to something? Plus, we all work together, so I’m going to have to see at least a few of these people on an almost daily basis and explain in even more detail why I don’t want to and then they’ll probably resent me for it. It sucks. 

What should I do?",07Sep2020,1
787,"So this my secondary ""dirty"" account as I didn't want to use my main and I didn't feel like making a new one. So here's how the story goes: when I was around 9 (I'm 21 now and also am a guy btw) there was this kid who lived next door and he was 14-15. He was a black kid from kind of a poor area so he didn't have the best grammar, and he also had some sort of mental disability where you could tell he was kind of slower than the rest (if you asked him how to spell his name he would reply I Don't Know, but you could still talk to him and he wasn't a total idiot). Him and I got along and we always played basketball, though we would always get into trouble even if I never got any consequences from it. He had shown me me his dick before and this had always grabbed my curiosity. Ever since I was a kid I knew I was bisexual but I always denied it into my late teens. So one day we were at the public pool and after we got out, we went to the locker rooms which had these big individual stalls for showers, I guess for families and privacy. He and I got separate ones next to each other. He called me over to his, and when I went in he was naked and I saw his dick, and it was really big, I'm talking porn star size dick. And he kind of gestured it to me, and i asked him, he didn't ask me I specifically asked him willingly if I could give him a blowjob, and he let me so I did for about two minutes. I enjoyed it. When I went back into my stall he followed and we touched cocks and held each other, he told me to turn around but I told him I didn't want it from behind, so he didn't push me into doing it. When we got back to my house he sucked my dick in return after I sucked his again. 

I like to think that this really didn't affect me in life, and I definitely don't hate him for what he did. It actually kind of helped me realize my sexuality. But to say it didn't affect me would be lying, as to this day I have a thing for black guys with big dicks and blowjobs, and these are the things I look up when I watch porn. I haven't had any luck with women my entire life besides a couple girlfriends in high school I never got to sleep with, but I've experimented with a couple guys. 

So anyway, thw guy from the story texted me last night saying he was in town next door (he comes back down like once every two years since he moved that year and we chill, although we don't talk about what happened, though he is a really perverted type person), and when he texted me the possibility of being able to suck him off again started to make me shake uncontrollably as if I were in a blizzard with no clothes, and I was turned on. I knew if I asked him if I could pleasure him he would agree but he fell asleep and never texting me beyond saying what's up. My question is: why am I shaking like this? Why am I getting so nervous and fidgety over something I essentially shelved away in my memories? Looking back, I know what he did is pretty much textbook sexual abuse of a minor, but I don't hate him for it, even though I am adamantly against sexual abuse of children. I asked him if I could suck and he said yes, so it's my fault even if it's obvious he was subtly coercing me into doing it. Why does this whole thing make me feel this way, like I'm nervous as hell? I'm even shaking while typing this for some reason. Sorry for this story being so long but I could really appreciate someone else's thoughts",07Sep2020,1
788,"I'm going to be traveling out of the country after Christmas to visit my boyfriend.

793,"Hey dudes,

So as you can probably guess from my username, I like to draw and animate in my free time. However, for what think has been a year, I have had little to no ambition or joy in this hobby. I have spent approximately 6 years dedicating my time to drawing and getting better, but at this point, I feel nothing from doing it. The best way to describe how I feel is ""v o i d"". 

I have realized that I am feeling ambition and excitement towards another hobby though: Music Production. I know that I should see this as a good thing, but in all honesty, I am scared at the idea of starting something new again and being a beginner. It also makes me sad that I spent 6 years of my life getting better and better at drawing, only to feel I need to drop it feel happy and fulfilled. 

Sidenote: I also have always seen the people who are like ""Yeah, I make music"" and it's poorly produced hoopla on SoundCloud as dorks? Could that also be preventing me from wanting to really dedicate myself to the hobby?

795,"Hey everyone! I'm a full time dad to a beautiful 2 year old daughter. I went through a nasty separation with her mother a year ago now in which we were both abused and I had to leave the state to remove us from the situation. Our custody and her criminal cases are ongoing and I was granted emergency custody until they are resolved. 
   Before the separation, I had a respectable job with benefits and good income, but I went into massive debt to pay my lawyer bills and get us established in another state. With family support, I took a part time job waiting tables because I couldn't go back to my field due to the hours and lack of sitters. This didn't touch my debt and barely paid the bills, but it was something. I was just getting us established and we moved into our own home (inherited from family) when covid struck and everyone was laid off. Luckily because of my previous job, I was able to draw unemployment, which barely kept us afloat.
   About a month ago, the unemployment checks stopped coming with no explanation and I have left multiple messages with no response. Ive been taking odd jobs since then, but between them being sparse and paying sitters, it just isn't paying the bills. All of my bills are behind, my electricity is close to being cut off, and my mental state is frail to say the least.
   Im afraid to show any weakness because the courts have already done everything they can to make me the bad guy, even with overwhelming evidence that I and my daughter were both victims of abuse. I feel like I have to try extra hard to look like a perfect dad, but I don't know what to do. My family loaned me a lot of the money for the lawyer, so I don't want to ask for any more help, and I can't seem to rake in enough jobs to get us caught up.
   I tried to seek out a counselor, but the only ones who will video chat with me, i would have to pay for and can't afford. I also cant talk to people around me because om worried about looking like i cant handle it. Im afraid that my mental state is creating a cycle that's making things worse. I just want to be a good parent, but I really don't know what to do here. Thank you for reading.

803,"So one of my best friends Nate (18M, currently) dated this girl Aria (24F, currently) till they broke up in January. The girl has graduated university while he’s in his last year of high school.

Several months ago, when Aria got to know that Nate had cheated on her, she came to me and told me that Nate had once sexually harassed her during their relationship I.e. groped her without her consent. I was immediately in shock and cut off Nate because I don’t want to be friends with someone who sexually harassed someone.

A few days ago, Nate found out I know and outright confessed to me that the groping did happen but it was when he was 15 and she was 21-22, and he says he immediately felt horrible and apologised to her many times, even a year later. She always told him it’s alright and they continued dating, they agreed to bury it behind them. Yet she brings it up now to me. He’s in shock that she told other people about what happened after so many years, without telling us the full story of how he apologised to her and stuff. Nate has also suffered sexual abuse in his childhood.

Then why on Earth did she come and tell me that he had sexually harassed her and that she hates herself now? Is it in retaliation for him cheating on her? Well, wasn’t she also in a relationship with a teenager and isn’t that wrong too (albeit no sex)? They dated for 2 years and yet all of this feels so messed up. Yes, what Nate did is wrong and groping someone is wrong, along with cheating on them. I feel for Aria. But dating someone so young when you’re in university and him in high school is also so wrong? And then bringing up something you said you forgave.. what am I supposed to deduce from this?!

I guess what I’m saying is that Nate really is trying to be a better person after their breakup and I am feeling for him now. Can what you did at the age of 15 be let go? Especially as I have never heard of him harassing anyone else like that? Can I be friends with Nate again like I was before all of this mess? Should I support him right now when he’s in shock over the label of ‘sexual harasser’ over him? I’m just in a moral dilemma right now..

TLDR: one of my best friends sexually harassed his girlfriend when he was 15, and apparently she forgave him but several months ago she told me about this.

I have a week off before uni, and I don't have friends here close enough to go out, meet and stuff, because my mates already have their friends from childhood and I moved here 6 years ago and found hard to fit it in and stuff.

I honestly have 2 close friends and they're on Spain where I used to live, now I live in England.

I talk to them, play games, few messages here and there, and that's it, fair enough because I'm not there anymore and they have their life there which is cool, Im happy with them.

My problem is, I feel lonely, I feel like Henry from Firewatch, lonely with only Delilah talking to him daily, but without Delilah.

I've focused on improving myself this summer, and it has worked out well but not as much as fixing this problem I have.

New to cycling, been cycling for a month now, I play new story based games to entertain myself, I've done all the finances and stuff I was putting off and I've put myself together.

But the feeling of loneliness doesn't go away, it doesn't leave,  I know I'm someone that needs companionship wether is romantic or not but man, I try being happy alone but it doesn't work out.

I check my phone constantly for a message, I sleep to pass time, I get bored of doing things I love because I want to spend time with friends or even meet someone.

I swipe on Tinder with no hope, I scroll through Instagram to find something that motivates me, I watch youtube videos to learn and to pass time.

810,"A little while ago, I was using my 15 year old's phone for work when mine was acting up. I found porn on it and told my wife, who told me not to punish him. I have no problem with masturbation, but I don't like the thought of him looking at naked women at his age. I eventually gave in, until I found out that W (wife) bought S (son) personal lubricant. When I confronted her about it, she said that she was only trying to keep S from hurting himself or accidentally using a harmful lotion. I explained to W that buying lubricant wasn't a good idea because it was encouraging other sexual activities, but she said I was just being too much of a prude. I once again gave in. But that wasn't the end of it. A few days ago, S went to his girlfriend's house to spend the night while her parents were away. I was reluctant to let him go, but I knew I could trust him to not do anything out of line. As he was getting ready, I saw W try to sneak a condom in S's wallet. I started to yell at S for asking his mother for something like that, but W explained that he didn't ask for it and she just wanted to give him one in case he felt ready to lose his virginity. He didn't even know what she was doing at the time. W also said that I shouldn't expect S to refrain from sexual acts when the both of us lost our virginities at 14 and didn't use protection. She said that she only wanted S to stay safe, should he feel ready. We had a big fight after he left (I still let him go because I got rid of the condom) and we haven't really spoken since. It's been almost a week, but W won't hear me out and keeps saying that I need to adjust to how things are now. I don't know what to do. My son told me that he heard what went down about the condom and make a promise that he'd wait until he was old enough, so I'm glad W isn't being a huge influence on him, but I just want to explain my reasoning to her.",07Sep2020,1

815,"I (14 almost 15F) have been dabbling with the idea of opening a bank account to collect interest. I will not be touching it until I am 18 aside from emergencies, ect, ect. A bit of background is that I come from a difficult family. Sisters are bullies, mother doesn’t do anything, father cannot be in the house since we live w/ grandma, and grandma is mentally, emotionally, and psychologically cruel. 

I’m not sure how to convince them to allow me to open a bank account, or how to trust them with not touching it. My friend (N) is all for it it, but the thing is my mom (M) won’t even allow me to make any financial choices. I’m not asking for legal advice or anything of the sort. And am unsure if this would be asking for extremely specific advice, but I wanted to take the swing anyways. What I am trying to get to is that I’d like to know if it’s a smart thing to do, the money, the trusting, the no touching, ect.

Another thing I want to ask is how would I handle the bank account? I’ve been told there are fees and the like, and I don’t want to get scammed out of any cash or get poor interest. I want at least enough to be able support myself if an emergency arises. A conversation that went down with M a few weeks ago makes me feel reserved in telling her.

Me (E): Hey, M, I was wondering if I could have some form of credit card to build up credit and the like. Since I don’t want you to have the burden of building it up by putting my name on your card. (Really it’s because she’s horrible at financing and my sisters are big ole’ bullies and force her to buy whatever they want)

M: No, you’re young and I do not want you buying things without my permission.

E: That makes sense, but I don’t want to buy anything too expensive, and I just want a limit of thirty dollars so I can use ten of it, then pay it back. Aunt (A) suggested I do it so adulthood is easier.

M: *deep sigh* E, what do you not understand about ‘no’ I am not willing to give you financial freedom at your age, you’re too young and don’t have any experience.

E: I get that, but do you understand why I’m asking?

M: No, you’re almost 14, you don’t need to worry about adult things. Quit trying to be the adult in this relationship. I do not appreciate it.

I told N about it and he said that a bank account would have a much graver reply. How am I supposed to convince them to allow me to have a bank account? I don’t trust piggy banks any more, as I’m down ten dollars one sister stole from me. I have around 20-30&amp; all in coin, and then am owed 70$ by my mother, since I gave her the hundred I spent saving up last year to help her with her car payment. 

My grandmother was over the moon about this, but I worry it’s because she thinks she’ll be the one ‘running’ the account I guess. She made it difficult for my aunts and uncles to move out until they were almost 30, and I refuse to be shackled for any longer than i need to be.",07Sep2020,1

My demi tendency is that I generally only develop attraction to people I know for a while and develop a bond with. Which is frustrating, because that's extremely infrequent, it's never worked out for me, and I'm tired of being ""alone"" at this point.

On top of that, I've developed a very strong infatuation with my best friend, and while I want so badly for something to be there, I really can't imagine she'd consider me. I hate that the circumstances we know each other in weren't different in such a way where we could've gotten together.

So, I'm not sure where I go from here. Dating feels nigh impossible because of my demi tendencies. I'm very infatuated with someone that I can't ever act on without probably losing her from my life, which I don't want.

Almost all of my friends would be the ""bad"" friends, because they don't really spend time with me, unless I specifically push them to hang out with me, they aren't really interested in what I do and only show genuine interest when my presence can benefit them.

I'm writing this post today to just let out my thoughts on having parents that immigrated to America from Afghanistan. I know many people can relate or feel how I feel but sometimes, I just feel so alone. I've found Reddit to be a place I can talk about my feelings or what's going on so, here goes nothing.

Currently, I am 19 years old. I live in California with friends and family all around me but, I feel so stuck. My parents don't let me go out and live my life, I'm in constant cycle with them. I want to travel the world and see what there is out there but, they won't let me. I've found that there is only one solid reason they say no; because they will lose their control over me. If you have foreign parents you know that all they want to do is control you. They want to know what you do, who you hang out with, what's on your phone, what's in your room, they want to know EVERYTHING. The idea of me not being in the palm of their hand terrifies them. Mostly my dad, he's a traditional old dog Afghan. So, you can see how this can be especially hard for a female. I find such angst and hatred within me because of them, my emotions are bottled up. Sure, some of you can say I'm legally an adult but it is not as simple as that. I have a brother, how can I leave him? We live in a very toxic household where there is ALWAYS tension in the house. How can I leave when he is still stuck there? How can I make myself happy but not let my brother suffer at the same time? 

I'm just so very confused and tired of life. I'm stuck doing things I don't want to do and being someone I don't want to be. If you have any advice or opinions, please let me know.

827,"My husband and I were looking for a place to buy or rent at the beginning of the year. We were looking at condos and houses. We found a house that we both loved and scheduled a day to go look at it. When we arrived we met with the realtor and he walked us through the house. He was friendly and everything seemed normal. At the end of the tour my husband and I had a quick discussion and decided we wanted to rent the house. My husband went and spoke to the realtor and he told my husband about all the info he would need from him to start the process. I really loved this house so I told my husband to get the info over to the realtor ASAP so my husband got it in a few hours after we toured the house. We had more places to see but we really wanted this house, so my husband asked the realtor when we would hear back and the realtor told him he would contact us the next morning.

The next morning my husband and I were out running around town to multiple appointments for other house tours. My husband sent the realtor a text in the afternoon asking him if he had any updates for us. He didn’t respond. At the end of the day around 7pm my husband texted the realtor and asked him again. We were trying to not be too pushy, but a lot of the places we toured wanted us to put in an application and we were apprehensive because we wanted the house we saw. Also the realtor told us he would let us know the following morning but he never did.

Finally the realtor texted us back around 8pm. He told us “We have decided to go with another renter. They are offering more and for a longer period of time.” We thought that sounded weird. Do people offer more when it’s just a rental? Also, why didn’t the realtor let us know this and give us a chance to offer more than this other renter? My husband texted him back and told him we would offer even more and for a longer period of time than this other renter. The realtor responded, saying he would let the owner of the house know and then get back with us. He never got back with us. 

I went online and saw that the house was still available to rent about a week after he told us someone else was going to rent it. I figured they were either being lazy by not taking it down right away or that these things take time. Three weeks after we last talked to the realtor I saw that the house is for rent again! The first time it was listed when I found it, it was listed for $3,000 for a one year lease. Now it is listed for $5,000 for a 6 month lease. Can someone explain this?",07Sep2020,1

830,"Hi there, 

I (F24) have been working as an English Teacher for almost five years. I didn't get a degree, I knew English when I finished high school and after that got some certificates (TOEFL and TKT). I'm currently studying to get the TEFL/TESOL certificate so I can teach people from other countries online and have a better income.

So, I have this job that I really love. I love my students and get along with them really well, my co workers are nice and I have a kind of good boss. 

The thing is my boss needed me to move to another city and train other teachers here. We talked about it and agreed that he'd hire my husband so both of us could move. He didn't raise my salary but I'd have 8 hours everyday (I'm paid per hour). We are renting an apartment, which we pay as well as services (electricity, internet, etc).

Anyway, we have been able to pay our debts (still on it) because we have a better income. Buuut, my boss is terrible at administrating, he has always been like that. I've had no issues here but last payday (August 15th) I didn't get my full payment, they gave me the last part of it on August 29th. 

Now, on August 31st was the next payday, well, I'm still waiting for half of it.

I live in Mexico, so I don't earn as much as I'd like (This period -Aug16th/Aug31st - I got 8k, that's like 370 dollars). It's a good income comparing to other people here but I've been working more than 10hours a day. I think he hasn't paid me because my husband received money from some suscriptions he got, and he may think that I don't need the money, but I do. 

How can I talk to the boss so he pays me punctually? I want to keep everything friendly as I still need to pay some things, so I'm planning on staying here at least 5 more months...",07Sep2020,1

838,"I’m sorry if this is Kong’s it’s been a long process for me on my end lol. 

This story starts all the way back on July 5th or 7th. I made some clothing purchases on a popular online retailer that’s named after a jungle. I received my items about a week later, but during the whole time I was never charged for them. I didn’t worry at first. I just thought it was taking some time to process. A few days after I had received the items though I got really confused on why I still wasn’t seeing a charge. I hopped onto my account and looked at the purchases, and I realized I had accidentally used my dads credit card instead of my own. His card had been connected to my account prior to this incident, and I had forgotten about it. My mistake. 

Because it was just my dad’s card, I waited till the next morning when he was awake and told him what happened, and that I’d just go get the money out of my account and pay him back. Simple fix, right? Nope. Literally a day before I realized what happened, he saw the charge and filed it as fraud. Once we both realized what happened, he called his card company to make sure I wouldn’t get any legal repercussions on that end, and I called this online retailer and told them what happened. I told them I made a purchase using the wrong card, those payments were canceled, and I needed to figure out how to charge my card instead. They told me all I had to do was add my card to my account and it’d be straightened out automatically. 

A week after I did what they told me to do, I got chargeback emails and was informed I couldn’t use my account to make further purchases until I payed. I called them again and explained that I did what they told me last time, nothing happened, and I was now sent chargeback emails and my account couldn’t be used now. The woman (MUCH more helpful than the previous guy. Love her) looked into it all and pushed my requests through to their department that deals with payments. I was told I’d be sent an email and called back within a couple days to finalize the purchases. I got the email, but it was asking me for my card information (like first two digits, expiration date, and card type). I didn’t feel comfortable sending that info through an email, so I removed my card and put a gift card balance on my account instead bc the email also said I could pay with a gift card balance on my account. Never got a call, never saw the balance get used. 

A couple weeks later (I had gotten busy with work and the issue was put on the back burner) I called again and told them about the previous two calls and that my account still hadn’t been charged, and that I never received the call I was told I’d get. The guy went into my account and told me that there isn’t payment issues on my account? It’s with the credit card first used (my dad’s) and that they’re going through his bank instead to get the purchases? The hell kinda logic is this? 

It is now September (the guy told me it could take a while for anything to happen) and STILL no money has been removed anywhere. I refuse to spend the balance on my account in case they decide to actually take it like they’re supposed to, and my dad’s account has not been charged. I’m really at a loss of what I can do to get these damn purchases processed. At this point I’m literally begging them to take my money and they just won’t. Is there anything I can do to fix this and finally get this issues done with?

We continued talking that way for another while until we FaceTimed and switched to messages. 

Our conversations have mostly been getting to know each other, our interests and experience coming out and nothing has been very relevant to dating in the context of each other. We spoke about past relationships but that’s as far as it has gone. She also mentioned possibly deleting her account on that dating app soon as well. 

We’re also in separate states and haven’t met in person yet, originally we had been about an hour away from each other but we met only a few weeks before university started and she attends in another state. 

I know that I want to pursue a relationship with her, but if she doesn’t see it that way anymore or want anything more than friendship, I don’t want to spend more time than necessary unsure about where this is going, especially being long distance for now. 

I want to know what she’s thinking but I don’t know how to ask this while making sure that I’m clear about what I would like to come out of this. I’ve never dated seriously and with this being mostly virtual I’m even more unsure about how to do this. I don’t want to keep waiting around if nothing is going to happen and I need to keep looking.

Recently, and even as far back as a child, I would have these dreams where it felt like I was in a Limbo type state. I would begin to lose vision, and everything would get distorted. I wouldn't be able to comprehend almost anything, and everything (my movements, my sight, myself) would all of a sudden lose touch with ""reality."" What really sucks is that when it happens, I never can overtake it, and something bad starts to unfold in my dream.

For example: My last dream was me and my gf in a weird, sorta fancy home. Some people came over (I knew them from high school) but they were like little kids (ages around 12 or so). Once they entered my house, things got so bad with my vision and my thoughts that I couldn't move, talk, speak, or think well. Everything was distorted and blurry. My dream ended with me falling to the ground with everything blacking out and me being unable to move or communicate at all. I was just ""there"".

843,"As it stands, I'm a junior in college(20M), pursuing a cybersecurity degree, and I'm set up with a contract with the Army that will make me a 2nd Lieutenant upon my graduation(through the ROTC program). Both of those things sound like a promising life in retrospect, but I've come across a host of issues since my sophomore year started; the bulk of them being mental. 

As the semesters went by, my college classes became increasingly difficult. It got to the point where I failed my first class(ever), and a second failure came not too long afterward. This semester, I have without question the biggest workload I've ever taken up (4 ludicrously difficult classes all made online in response to the COVID pandemic, on top of the early-riser/late-to-bed ROTC schedule that I'm required to follow) without the option of switching to easier classes given how my future semesters are lined up. Despite how much I pay attention to the lectures in my class, I can't make sense of what my professors try to teach, so I have to reteach the topics to myself in order to keep up with my grades, and with classes like cal-based physics, C++ programming, etc., it gets tedious. All of this wouldn't be such a hard thing to deal with if I didn't feel like I was so isolated on campus. Most, if not all of the friends I've made in the last two years are gone from either dropping or moving colleges, any close family is hundreds of miles away, and trying to meet in person with any of my classmates is practically futile due to the fact that most social spaces are heavily restricted in terms of social gatherings. 

On top of all of this, school is the only thing that I've ever known for the majority of my life, and in these last 2 years I have at college, that process is leaving me sapped of motivation, almost like running around the same track for multiple miles at a time. I know that the end is only 2 years away before I truly start my life, but in my head it still feels like I'll be stuck in this seemingly endless loop of schoolwork for many, MANY more years. This semester in specific feels like a MASSIVE hurdle with all of my support taken. If I fail one more class, all of the scholarships that I've busted my ass for will likely be voided, but for some reason that fact alone still isn't enough to convince me to work hard. If there's any piece of advice that anyone can give me, I'd be very grateful for it. I'm truly at a loss",07Sep2020,1
844,"Okay so. I’ve tried a lot of paths in my life and i’ve never been fulfilled. I went to University straight out of high school and only lasted a month before I came back home. 

Worked 3 different jobs after that cause I couldn’t make up my mind. Then last minute, I decided to go to college. I finished my course and got a job in my field and Ive been working here for a while and it just hit me on one of my shifts that this. Is. Not. Me. This job, this place, nothing about it. 

I used to be so happy and outgoing, funny, silly, the friend everyone always wanted around. Now I have a career where I have to be 100% serious 100% of the time. I’ve literally lost myself. I’m not happy or funny or outgoing anymore. I pretty much lost my friends because I’m not even me- they can feel it and I can feel it too. I was very smart, and athletic when I was younger and now I’m doing a job that feels like it requires minimal brains, and I’m so tired all the time that I don’t do much at all other than work and sleep. I feel like I made the decision on a whim to do this kind of work because I didn’t know what I wanted only to realize that this is exactly what I don’t want. 

I’m still young but have accumulated about $30,000 of debt just from going to school. I just signed a lease for an apartment close to my work and I’m moving in next week. Prices are so high here I ended up getting something in the middle range since I have a good paying job, only to realize I won’t have any room for savings. (Some, but not much)

The point of the story is I feel like I’m living someone else’s life. I’m not who I’m supposed to be, I’m not doing what I’m supposed to do or what I want to do. I feel like the definition of going through the motions because I don’t connect with my life or feel fulfilled whatsoever. 

What do I do? 

Should I just work around my career and work on my personal life and try to be myself as much as I can outside of work? Just kinda put on my work mask?

Should I push through it for now and wait 2 or 3 years and save up what I can and go back to school for the third time?

Any other suggestions? 

I just feel like I used up all my chances. How many jobs can I go through and invest myself in before I just need to bite the bullet and accept the life I chose for myself?

848,"Hi all, let me know if there is a better place to post this.

Since quarantine, I have started getting into exercising and losing weight I've been gaining the past few years. I have an Android that comes with Samsung Health and also have a Galaxy Watch that automatically syncs my data. 

I have been loving Samsung Health, mainly for the Weight Management feature which is a very quick and easy visual on how many calories you still have left to lose for the day (taking into account calories from foods you've entered so far as well as calories burned from rest/activity that's tracked vs your daily calorie goal) and shows it all in realtime. There was even a widget with the same information on my watch. 

They've just removed this feature and I'm devastated because it was the key for me to be able to track my calories for the day and lose weight, so my question is does anyone know of an app that has something similar? I'm not looking for a calorie tracker that just shows how much you've taken in vs your daily calorie target, but a realtime tracker that takes into account all calories burned + calories consumed against your goal and shows a visual in one spot. 

Sorry if any of the above is confusing, let me know if clarification is needed. Thank you to anyone who reads and/or responds.",07Sep2020,1

851,"Hey, so for the past year and a half I have been taking 50-150 mgs of codeine on an almost daily basis, mainly in the evenings... I have, for the past couple months, reduced my usage to about 56 mg a day and I use it in the evenings to relax and feel happier...

I have gone a month without it, that was a few months ago and then one day I was feeling shitty and resorted to getting it and I'm back to daily use again...

I am prescribed Vyvanse (amphetamine) for ADHD and Lorazapam (Benzodiazapine) for OCD and I take the Vyvanse in the morning and the Lorazapam in the mid-late afternoon...

My problem (apart from relying on drugs to function every day tbh) is that in the evenings both of these medications wear off... I want to feel happy all the time tbh and although that's unreasonable, it's the truth.

I take codeine in the evenings and it provides a pleasent euphoric buzz, however I know I cannot continue this as it is taxing on the liver (the acetaminophen along with the codeine in the pills I am taking)...

I am worried that I will continue pushing off quitting until it's too late and my organs are fucked. I love life and I don't want to die thing young at all...

I have tried Kratom a few times and aside from its horrible taste it was a pleasant experience and boosted my mood better than codeine, however Kratom is a lot more expensive than Tylenol with Codeine in it, though I may go back to Kratom in the future if I see no other way to get off this shit. 

Also, I have heard Kratom is hard on the liver as well, which is another thing that worries me...

Can you offer whatever advice you may have for me in the hope of me quitting this addiction? I know I won't go through physical withdrawal as I can go several days without it and not feel physically ill, however the mental effect of not taking codeine is what drives me back to using it again... I feel depressed and bored out of my mind if I go without taking it...

Any advice would be a blessing, thanks in advance to whoever reads this",07Sep2020,1
852,"Hi reddit,

so I've been struggling with a career / life decision which I'd like some advice on:

I (24m) was always good in school and would have had no issues (intellectual, formal, or financial) to study basically any subject I would have liked. I ended up doing a B.A. in Politics and Public Administration in a rather abstract desire to understand the world better and to stick with a more or less interdisciplinary subject area. After finishing my BA in 2018 I struggled to commit to any next steps, let most Master's application deadlines pass, and just ended up doing an internship to get a better grasp of what I want to do. I got an internship with a major e-commerce company and just signed my second follow-up contract as a project manager for special projects. Considering my age and work experience,  I enjoy surprising seniority in this job, managing a 10+ person team and projects with million-dollar budgets. While I am on a one-year contract right now, getting a permanent one is just a matter of time. All in all: This is the type of job and company, based on which you can start a family etc.

I've been with this company for two years now in total, time is rushing by, and I am getting more and more sure that I would like to learn about and do something different - probably in the area of computer science or biotechnology. I am really interested in this area privately, and if I had to choose a course of study again for my 18yo self, I would have been something along these lines. The two pain points are: I am 100% sure that this is where the future of humanity will be and I would like to be part of that. Might be a little native but what can you do.  Second, my current career seems bland and lacks an intellectual challenge. Most problems are organizational or social and thus solved through harder work, social skills, and planning instead of creating anything meaningful or sustainable. 

This is why I thought about making a switch in this direction. It's not yet 'too late' at 24 + I have the personal funds required, and it would likely not be a practical issue to be admitted into a Bachelor's Degree leading me down e.g. the Bio-Informatics path. 

On the other hand, I've been super lucky with my career. In my current company, I work with the German leadership team, have a high-responsibility supervisor role at my age etc. It would not only feel like throwing away something good but a once-in-a-least-a-couple-thousand opportunity.

I've been thinking about this back and forth and am not sure how to come to a decision, or whether there is a good middle way.

At the same time, as time passes, not making a decision is a decision as well.  

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you think folks? Hit me with your hot takes, tell me that I am a privileged wimp to even worry about this (lol), or give some advice if you feel like it. Cheers.

855,"Okay so my friend has always been a really open minded, understanding, very intelligent person and he’s an extremely good guy. Recently he has been telling me about time loops he’s been entering where he will do the same action over and over again (like he will switch off a light, turn around and the light will still be on and he will look back at the switch and it won’t be switched off anymore. And he’ll keep doing that.) He also has said to of created matter, like he was washing the dishes and took the last pot, washed it, turned around and the same pot he was holding was still in the same place he picked it up, so now there was two pots. And he just called me saying that he just made a wall make a bang sound without touching it and without his mouth, and in the moment he knew he could make the wall bang but after he can’t do it anymore, it was like a moment of clarity of his ability. 

He’s always been a very spiritually in tune person and shit and he thinks it’s because he’s really sensitive to electrical currents. He believes he can control electrical currents sometimes too. He’s a very alert guy as well, always attentive, noticing every little thing, in order to not let something bad happen. He even makes up scenarios in his head just to see what he’d do.

The other option is a LiTT bag (£34.50), a bigger bag that comes with a grinder and small jar. Cost wise it's far better, and although it's a bigger bag it's still portable.

867,"Hi reddit - I'm a 20M computer science student. I have a really high sex drive, despite being on antidepressants (which supposedly kill sex drive). This high sex drive makes it very difficult for me to focus on schoolwork and do what I need to do in order to have a successful career. 

I have never had a girlfriend and I am a virgin. My lack of sex makes me feel miserable, lonely and at times suicidal due to feeling worthless and unloved. Please don't judge me for this - my parents were abusers and they made me feel like I didn't deserve to live. I have asperger's syndrome and my parents relentlessly called me names because of it. I crave romantic relationships and intimacy because I want to feel love and feel wanted. Despite this I have failed to form any relationships at university, further destroying my self esteem.  I worry that I'll never have a romantic partner. I also have body image issues. 

When I wake up I usually think about how I'm still a virgin and how worthless that makes me. I worry that I'll never have a romantic partner and this leads to feelings of despair and sadness. In an attempt to cope with my lack of sex I masturbate twice a day but this doesn't change any of my feelings. It's hard to start or work on any schoolwork because I feel so sad. 

I have tried a lot of hobbies and techniques to cope with life better but nothing seems to help me with this issue. 

Here's what I've done to improve my life:  
1. Made a new friend online who I feel connected to and can rely on for emotional support. (I have a crush on her but she seems like she just wants to be friends, and I'm afraid if I tell her she'll abandon me. She lives across the state too so I don't think this will work out.)  
2. I've started learning to play the guitar.  
3. I adopted a rescue animal for emotional support.  
4. I attended therapy for a year and various support groups.  
5. Read a lot of books and attended practice groups to help with autism.

869,"I'm on my last year of college and it took a lot of time, learning from failures, and work to be here. My educational life was not easy since I am a procrastinator when I was at community college and my first semester at my college. I felt regret after failing and started a new with a new major and part-time job and years later am now at the finish line. What held me back but at the same time that made this journey hard was my part time job. This job requires me to help this persons son(not going into details out of respect and privacy) to be independent and assist him. The job was easy at first since its on the weekends and I got to make money but also help make a difference in someones life. As time went by staff members start to shorten and I had to cover a ton of shifts over the years and Iv'e only needed someone to cover me for once. Some days they would need my help at the last minute and I would arrive to help on spontaneous days. In a way its good to experience what its like to keep busy and balance with school and work since I'm doing this to travel when I get out of college.

What made me want to post this is the fact that the other day I got dropped with a ton of news. Two staff members are quitting, I would have to work out a new shift, and the parent is offering me to rent a place to take care of the son since hes of older age now. The person says it takes a while to find new people at this time but I am willing to help until the spring. It took more than the usual four years to get to graduating and I haven't told them yet that I might quit after finishing college. I feel guilty if I leave this persons son to chase my own goals. If I stay at this place to help I would also feel guilty that my parents wasting so much money and time to help with my dreams after college. 

Is it selfish to leave this job in a struggling state in order to pursue a goal?

870,"about a month ago, i had gotten reprimanded by my boss for “constantly being on your phone on the floor; other partners have come to me about this and are very uncomfortable working with you under these conditions.” I was confused as to why this was, because all of us are far too busy to look down at our phones for more than a brief second. 45 minutes into my first day of work last week, i was called to the back by my manager, accompanied by two other managers as her witness to inform me that i’ve allegedly made threats of domestic terrorism to our store to coworkers- i have no criminal history, i do not own firearms, and i don’t have homicidal tendencies. i told my boss i had said no such thing to which she had said that it was multiple partners who had come forth and told her. I had suspicions it could’ve been a co-worker who i had previously had disagreements with but soon after heading home for the day (paid leave effective immediately) a co-worker who was “up to bat” for me had noticed suspicious behavior from 2 co workers who had just began dating. later it was confirmed to be them, and a friend of theirs who hasn’t worked any of the same shifts as i do. I was so shocked- because of all of the people i worked with, i had been pretty certain i was “cool” with them. At work, i have tried to meet each episode of conflict with an understanding demeanor and resolve the issue civilly- this month is the first time in what was almost an entire year of employment that management had ever come to me for any negative reason. 2 days after being on paid leave, corporate / HR had called to inform me that they concluded their investigation and had made the decision to terminate me.

Like a typical person my age, I am interesting in people of the opposite gender, but my introverted personality combined with my self-hatred makes it nearly impossible to approach any females that I might be interested in. Not only do I do this, but my lack of self confidence has caused me to turn down one confession already, as I believe I cannot provide enough for a good relationship. Often I lie in bed at night wondering why I am the way I am, sometimes crying myself to sleep at night. Even writing this post, I wonder if I am just wasting people’s time. Even when trying to rub one out, I end up in tears instead as I am faced with the reality of my loneliness. I don’t know what to do at this rate, and I don’t want to involve my parents in this. I am already taking medication for my depression, which I feel is a burden on my parents. I’d like advice on what to do in my life, or maybe just go on and enjoy your day. Sorry if I troubled you.

873,"Me (f 16) USA and my bf (m 18) Egypt have been dating for 7 months now. We do love and care about eachother so much, but recently things have been factoring between us.

Me and my bf were fighting for a while last month for atleast 3 weeks. We ended up breaking up then getting back together. We decided to just sit down, and hear eachother out without any dispute. The talk consisted of his habits. which were him not taking care of himself properly. (This is why were fighting)

He mostly doesn't because its really hard for him. He battles with OCD/Depression/Anxiety so that does take a toll on him. Plus hes had trauma in the past which does also take affect on him now. My boyfriend does see a therapist and is on medication, but we both dont think hes really helping him? Hes been going to him for a year but hes still the same, which we both believe. 

Ive been trying to support him for these past few months now, like trying to motivate him or push him to shower or clean but were moving at a very slow pace. Sometimes he'll shower like once or twice a week but then he'll start pushing it off again. He always says hes ""tired"" and he doesnt have the mental or physical energy to do anything. He also mentioned how much of a hassle it is to do a simple action because of his OCD, which is understandable. This whole thing is just frustrating.

Im not trying to be his mom/therapist or anything. Im just trying to support or help him because I hate seeing him like this.",07Sep2020,1

878,"So I have been wanting to go to college my whole life and it’s been my plan forever. I got into the school that I loved with my best friend as my roommate and we moved in a few weeks ago. Everything was going great and we were both really excited but then as we got more used to being here we realized it’s not exactly what we planned for. Obviously everything is different this year. We spend most of our time in our room either doing work on our laptops, sleeping, or eating. We’ve tried to be social but it’s hard when there’s  really no opportunities. We’ve also just had some bad experiences from a guy yelling inappropriate things at us outside our dorm to my roommate getting her clothes thrown in the trash in the laundry room. 

She’s been extremely miserable the entire time and is working with her advisor to hopefully move all of her classes online so she can finish the semester at home. I’m trying to figure out if I should do the same. I think that I could finish the semester on campus but I wouldn’t be happy and honestly I’m not sure if I could do it alone.

Hey all, hoping this is the right sub for the question I'm asking. I moved into my first apartment in July with two other friends of mine. I'm admittedly a terrible adult and didn't really have a clue how the utility bills worked in practice. I had just assumed that after the first month, we'd get the bill in the mail or online that we could pay. After a month and a half, we asked our landlord and he was surprised that we hadn't gotten in set up yet, but checked and said that the previous tenant never took it out of their name. He actually said you might as well put it in your name starting in August and go from there. It's now September (pushing it I know) and I tried setting the bill up in my name but was unable to without having the account number. I'm not sure what to do at this point either without being able to set it up. Do I continue and just have the account under this person's name? I figure they may have auto pay on and not know it. Any advice would be appreciated regarding this, thank you!",07Sep2020,1
885,"It's a bit confusing, but I hope you understand.  I(F17) have a friend (F18). 

A little back story.  We lived in the same village and as a child we went to the same kindergarten together and when we were little we did not communicate.  We have good mutal friends. We only started communicating about a year and a half ago.  We have had a similar past, violent parents, alcohol, and so on.

Anyways, we moved to a bigger city and now we go to a different school in the same city.  I have my own apartment and she lives in a unit.  Anyways, I like being with her so much.  I like to just talk to her, cook with here, do everything with her. I feel as good as I am with her.  I laugh from the bottom of my heart with her.  Usually when I've been with people all day, I want to be alone in the evening.  But this is not the case with her.  I can be with her247, from morning to night. And I'm not tired of her.  She stayed with me for several days in a row, and every time she leaves I feel so empty.

Little story: We did nap and she had to get on the bus and I woke up and saw that she wasn't in my bed next to me and I immediately had tears in my eyes, and it felt so empty that she went and didn't wake me up. I thought I'd go after her in the yard and send her on the bus, but then she came out of the bathroom and I immediately felt a great relief that she hadn't left yet.

And no, i don't have a crush on her.  I know that. I don't like her that way.  I'm happy if she's doing well and if she can get a guy.  Why I feel that way?  Why am I so obsessed with her?  I understand this is good that I have such a friend but it's bad bc I want to be with her all the time but due to lack of time it is not possible.  The distance between our schools is about 20km.

Idk what to do, what can I do to get rid of this obsession?",07Sep2020,1

887,"I’ll preface this by saying that everyone in this story is in their mid-20’s.

So this weekend, I (M) went to my friend’s (M) bachelor party. We’ll call him Fiance 1. He and I and a few other of his friends and family got really, really drunk on the first night and I blacked out. (Someone made me a couple of mixed drinks that were probably waaay too strong.) Anyways, I don’t remember going to bed, but I know that we discussed sleeping arrangements before we were drunk and I was supposed to be sharing a bed with one of my other friends who was there (not with Fiance 1). Anyways I woke up up at maybe 2:00AM in the bed to Fiance 1 giving me oral sex, kissing me, and trying to put my hand on his penis. I just pretended to be asleep the whole time and eventually he stopped for a while, but then after like 15 minutes passed he started again, at which point I pretended to wake up (I had already been awake the whole time) and Fiance 1 stopped. I went out to the living room and waited for like and hour until I thought he was asleep, and then I snuck back into the room and grabbed my things and left in the middle of the night.

This same weekend, my wife (F) was at Fiance 2’s (M) bachelor party (same couple), so I drove a few hours to get to them and I told them what happened. Everyone was upset obviously, Fiance 2 apologized for what happened to me and he speculated that maybe Fiance 1 didn’t realize it was me because Fiance 1 was really drunk and the two of them often wake up to having sex in the middle of the night with each other and not knowing who started it. (Don’t blame Fiance 2, he was just trying to make sense of it as much as I was. I had already emphasized to him that I was fine personally and he had emphasized to me that it still wasn’t acceptable.) Fiance 2 called Fiance 1 to confront him, and Fiance 1 was in tears and felt so bad and said that he didn’t remember any of what happened. Fiance 1 told Fiance 2 that he wanted to talk to me if I wanted to, but I said that I wanted to wait a while first (Because I was/am conflicted: On a personal level I don’t feel super violated and I am circumstantially willing to forgive him, but at the same time I know that what he did was wrong, and maybe I shouldn’t forgive him because maybe he has done/would do the same thing again to someone else.) Anyways, I spent the rest of the weekend with Bachelor Party 2 and we enjoyed the weekend together for the most part. We only stressed a little bit about the situation.

Here’s some other info: 
- Fiance 1 and 2 JUST bought a house together. Like, a month ago.
- Their wedding is in a few weeks, and I am a groomsman. 
- Fiance 2 is obviously very conflicted, but given the house and wedding situation, I can guess that he’s probably going to continue with the wedding as normal. 
- I already know I’m not responsible for what happened :) I really am fine personally, I just don’t know how to respond. Am I allowed to forgive him or do I have a responsibility to report him?
- My wife and two of our other close friends have already told me that they don’t want to go to the wedding. Maybe they would still go if I was really, really insistent, but it looks like everyone else is already starting to make a decision regardless of me.

Is there *any* circumstance in which Fiance 1 can be forgiven? Should I cut off this friendship? Should I encourage Fiance 2 to leave Fiance 1? Should I report Fiance 1?",07Sep2020,1

I wash the dishes and mop and clean me and my sisters room and this attached room sort of thing? Now this is fine but whenever my mom is out and I complain about something happening with them she gets pissed and says I dont dictate her time.

At some point of my life I was suicidal (I'm a better now I think) and when I told her so she said never to mention it again and that it was selfish and such I just wanted someone to lean on.

891,"I grew up with dyslexia all my life. I am a 25 year old male in Canada. Dyslexia is, in crude terms, a learning disability that effects my reading and writing. For example, if you learn a second language, you can speak it normally, but if you have to read it or write it, you read slower than your first language. Same with me for any language. I try my best to hide it and lead a normal life. But anything that requires reading or writing is hard. Like reading a fancy menu with cursive or something like that. Even though I have this issue, I got my degree in mechanical engineering and design cars. I want to show that even with dyslexia, I can lead a normal life. 

My main issue is that I still get a lot of sympathy for my disability. For example, last year, a few of the guys from my boxing gym and I went to a theater for a movie. I took some time to read everything, and some guy got pissed and called me retarded. I didn't want to cause a scene  and let it go. My friends took my decision for weakness, and even when I was telling them to calm down, they got into a fight. Trying to stop the fight, I broke my pinky and tore a ligament. Just the other day, a friend of mine took my silence for a homeless guy calling me retarded as weakness (her words) and yelled at him until I pulled her aside. I am sick and tired of people assuming I need help when I just want to put it aside. I told her I didn't feel comfortable with her doing that, and she said that she couldn't sit there and watch me get attacked. I told her that I box and I can kick the shit out of people if I need to, but I can only control a few things in life, and how I react to a situation is one of them. If you take that away from me, it makes me feel more powerless than some bum with some issues yelling at me. My main point is that I can't do things like read from a menu or write a cheque like a normal person, and  have only a few things i can control in my day to day life. I dont want to have people take my ability of being able to react to a situation as well. How do i explain this to people?",07Sep2020,1

I'm supposed to be back to school tomorrow but I'm terrified out of my mind. I had to leave school for about a year and a half due to depression and anxiety. I have autism and my year head didn't offer me the resources that I needed. she used to just leave me in the corridor for sometimes up to an hour entirely alone and then tell me to go back to class without any counselling or even trying to help.

the school councillor was worse. when I told her I was hurting myself, she told me it was pointless and to just stop and she told me not to tell people I was suicide because I needed to consider others emotions. she was awful.

thanks to them, my first 3 years of secondary school (13-15) were traumatic. I couldn't go back near the school. my parents had to use a code word when talking about school as to not trigger me. the thought of school made me sick.

now I feel I am ready to go back but now the night before I go back, I'm terrified. and I mean the same fear I felt anytime school was brought up before. I dont really have friends. I have one close friend but he isn't in the same class and he's not going to school tomorrow. I have one friend in my class, lets call him Frank. Frank and I have hung out once during the summer and have texted pretty constantly too. but i feel really close to him and its really scary. i have huge problems trusting people and I'm really scared that Frank wont want to talk to me in school because I'm the weird depressed kid who disappeared for almost two years. Frank also is clinically depressed and just recently got out of hospital and I feel like I am just adding to his load.

My dad's main goal is to convince her to get a professional caretaker (my aunt is burned out from working and watching her for months). I've thought about taking care of her for some time myself, but I don't know how viable that is, particularly as she loses more and more basic physical abilities.

So for starters I (21M) have been in what I can only describe as a will they/won't they relationship with this beautiful young woman for over 5 years now (We actually met through a mutual friend of ours in our freshman year of high school but we got to know each other much better in our junior year), we have been through hell on Earth together and I can confidently say she is the person I love and cherish most in this world, even promising each other we'd be there for each other no matter what. I even took to calling her cute names like Khaleesi and my Queen

The problem is that every time I try to take a step forward and hopefully move it to something more she always changes the subject. Well this year she did tell me she was talking to another guy and things were going well for them, and today I found out they are now dating. I did congratulate her for her new relationship and she did apologize for not telling me sooner. I told her it's okay and that I'll still stand by her side no matter what which she seemed incredibly grateful for.

900,"I (17F) have always been relatively close with my cousin (19F). She’s had a history of being very toxic and manipulative in her past relationships, but she’s been with her current boyfriend for about a year and I really thought she had matured and that their relationship was going well. Then I visited them for about a week and I was very shocked and disturbed at how she was treating him. It seemed like everything he did was wrong and she was always mad at him for something. She constantly belittled, degraded, and threatened him by saying she would break up with him. There were also several instances where she would say things like “You don’t love me” or “If you loved me you wouldn’t do that.” 

While I was visiting she took some photos of me and my little brother mentioned he wanted to edit them. When my cousin’s boyfriend said that was a good idea, my cousin proceeded to yell at him about how he shouldn’t edit them because he didn’t actually take the photos and doesn’t deserve to take credit for them. He then said something about how my brother is 12 and he just wanted to edit some pictures of his sister. At this point my cousin was fuming and said things about how he “always takes other peoples sides” and how she wants to break up with him for it. This was just one of several instances that really upset me because it seems like her boyfriend is a good guy who is trying his best and can’t seem to do anything right with her. I don’t think he did anything the whole time I was there that made him deserve the treatment he received. 

Another thing that is important to mention is that my cousin thinks of me as a best friend. I wish I could say I feel the same about her, but it’s hard when she treats other people so poorly. I honestly think she needs mental help and so do many of my other family members. However, when she’s been confronted about it she always acts very hurt and offended. I’ve also confronted her about the way she treated her ex and she freaked out on me so I wouldn’t expect it to go any differently with this relationship.

Would it be bad if I reached out to him to let him know that I think he’s in an unhealthy relationship? Would I be betraying my cousin by doing that? I also feel like this shouldn’t concern me especially because it’s not my relationship, but I almost feel like a bystander just sitting back and not doing anything.",07Sep2020,1
901,"So my best friend of like 3 or 4 years was dating this guy for a couple months, C. She set me up with his best friend, L. Now me and L’s relationship has outlasted theirs, and L &amp; C continue to be best friends. L and I live together and he hangs out with C at least once a day so we’ve become really good friends as well. They had only been dating for about two months before she set me up with L, and I got all the details about their relationship beforehand. They continued to date, on and off for about 5 months after me and L got together, and since we were all best friends, I got to see their relationship first hand. (Even though we are all adults my friend and C both live with their parents and couldn’t really see each other unless they were at my house). Note how I said on and off, because within that 5 month period they broke up about 4 times. And she was the one who kept breaking it off. Now, C isn’t perfect, but when I compare him to her 2 exes (both awful people), he’s been very very good to her. Her reasonings for breaking up with him never made very much sense to me (Example: One time they broke up she said that because she had a traumatic upbringing and he didn’t, which made her feel like he didn’t understand or relate to her pain and depression. However in my opinion I just don’t see how that is his fault? I also don’t know why she would want to be with someone who has depression when she has it herself. Wouldn’t you want to be with someone who lifts you up?) but I am her best friend and I’ve just wanted to support her. But every tome she broke up with him, that hurt him too. It was apparent to me that this constant back and forth was painful for him. Because before all of this, C was pretty much obsessed with her. Well fast-foreword to last month, when they were half dating half not dating, and C finally breaks it off with her. He tells her that their relationship is toxic and that he wants to just be friends. So he texts her every once in a while, but not as often as before because every time they break up, if they hang out and text every day they might as well be dating again. Now, my friend is heartbroken. She gets upset that we all hang out without her, despite the fact that L &amp; C are best friends and I am not going to tell my boyfriend he can’t have his friend over anymore for no reason. She is texting C often about how suicidal she feels. She is telling me that she can’t see herself with anyone else but him, that he’s the one for her, that she doesn’t want to live this life without him. She says she doesn’t understand what went wrong or why they are even broken up. She won’t accept the fact that he doesn’t want to text her daily anymore because he needs space to get over her. She keeps calling C selfish and mean for not “caring about how upset she is”. She is convinced he hates her when he literally doesn’t at all. Now the advice I need is, how do I comfort a friend when I think their completely wrong? How do I tell my friend, who is telling me she literally wants to die because she can’t be with this boy, that it’s her fault? I don’t want to lie to her, and I love her so much. But I am also friends with C, and I don’t want to sit around and bash his name and turn this into his fault when I don’t think he did anything wrong. I’m trying so hard to tell her that her happiness doesn’t depend on a boy but she just ignores that. She will absolutely start a fight with me or make me out to be a bad friend if I try to tell her that she shouldn’t have broken up with him so many times, which is just because she’s very headstrong and I respect that. She is hurting and I know that, and I don’t want to make her pain worse by not being there for her in the way she needs me to be. I know that she needs me to respond because I have tried to just not say anything in the past and she thought I didn’t care. I really love this girl and I wish her nothing but happiness but when I get something daily about how heartbroken and depressed she is knowing the full story, it almost makes me mad that she isn’t being self-aware. I just don’t know what to do. How do I be a good friend and an honest friend to both of them?",07Sep2020,1

I have done this for so long though that now when I’m trying to have regular social interactions I don’t ever talk, I always listen. In listening I realize how very little I am offering the world in as far as talent, success, etc. Having conversations with regular people makes me hyper- aware of how my very small life and lack of being able to be open has made me not feel connected to the aspect of being human. I just want to hide my head in the sand after being around people and it’s really beginning to effect all parts of my life. 

I get anxiety when I’m working knowing I’m constantly competing against proper humans. I get anxiety about hearing strangers life details knowing that I’ll go home and be mad at myself for not being more human.

910,"I came here to ask if theres anything I can do (maybe even legally?) to adress this.

I work in a cafe/pattisiere in Europe somewhere,  it has a small cafe and a big bakery in the back. We have several bakers, cashiers behind the counter and the wait staff. Tipping isn't a tradition here but we do get them, people saying ""hold back the change"" or leaving money on the tables after they finish eating. 

This money gets collected in a jar and at the end of each month it gets divided by the amount of workers, and given to everyone accordingly. Or so I thought. I was talking to a colleague I was working with and I said ""Man we got a lot of tips! Ill be able to buy x now!"" She looked at me puzzeled. ""A lot? That was almost nothing..."" It was strange that she said that and we found out we got VERY different amounts of money, I got about 12 times more than what she got.

Whilst closing I spoke to my manager about this, I said something along the lines of 'Hey [manager], I found out that [coworker] and I got two very different tips. Did something maybe go wrong?' She laughed and said 'No thats how its supposed to be.' I said 'I thought all the money that went in the jar got divided equally? [Coworker] and I worked almost identical hours.' 'I know, but some ""people"" deserve it less.' She replied. Whilst she said ""people"" sarcastically she signalled with her hand over her own face.

My coworker is black.

She wasn't only dividing the money unfairly, she was doing it because she's a racist. I havent told my coworker yet, cause I don't want her to feel hurt and not know the options of what to do. I will give her my tips, cause obviously this has been happening for a while, and we have one black baker as well.
What can I do? Can I go to the police?

911,"I need advice on how to help my boyfriend deal with his boss. My boyfriend is 20 and he's just recently signed to be an apprentice painter. His boss seemed nice at the start but now he's just a prick. Here's a few instances. 

1) A guy who works with him sometimes was giving him shit and swore at my boyfriend so my boyfriend swore back. The guy immediately goes to the boss and complains so Boss comes over and asks what the deal is. My boyfriend tells him what happened and has asked not to work with that guy. Turns out not only do the other workers have problems with this guy but this guy is Boss's nephew. Boss now puts my boyfriend with his nephew a lot.

2) My boyfriend doesn't own a car so my sister drops him off in the morning. He's never late and the workers all use the work van to move to their job sites. Boss gave him shit for not having a car and then started texting links to crappy cars for my boyfriend to buy. My boyfriend is already saving and looking for cars every night. 

3) My boyfriend didn't have sick leave yet but had to take a few days off due to having a really sore throat. He had to get swabbed in case it was covid. When he went back to work his Boss was cold towards him and gave him shitty jobs. His coworkers confirmed that's what he does to his employees when they take time off. Sick or not.

4) My boyfriend has been told to talk more but yet as he is at work today his boss is giving him silent treatment. Boss is literally talking to everyone but my boyfriend and then leaving the room.

All this crap has made my boyfriend come home questioning if he likes his job or wants to be a painter and will just be miserable.

912,"Ok I’m 29m and my girlfriend is 27f, both from the US. We’ve been in a committed relationship for 3 years now but have known each other for maybe 12 years? Really good friends before we started dating. 

Anyway for the last year or so I haven’t really been feeling it anymore. I feel we were suited better as friends and don’t have enough in common to suit a healthy relationship. The problem is every time I go to break up with her something bad happens and I feel forced to push what’s best for me aside in order to be there for her through it all which is starting to really weigh me down. She’s currently staying with her Grandma as she’s got cancer so my girl is taking care of her but she’s ‘officially’ living with me at my parents due to COVID and losing her job and not having enough money for rent anymore. I moved back in with my parents not long before COVID started and she’s stayed with us through the whole pandemic as we felt it was better to be with people then to be alone in her apartment on her own but since then she’s lost her job so it’s became an official thing. It’s been hard for us both living in my old bedroom as we both had our own spaces before but it’s made me realise even more that I don’t want to be with this person yet I feel ending the relationship just fucks everything up and I know I’ll be hated by her for it. She comes from a broken home so has no real family and the only person who half cared about her (her grandma) is now dying of cancer and I feel me breaking up with her would be too much shit to throw on her plate. At the same time though we have nothing in common, she doesn’t have social skills and we can never talk in an adult way about problems we’re having as she just blows up due to being brought up in a broken home and not being shown how to talk through problems. I’m not making out I’m a Saint for a second either I’m a human being but I know where my faults are and I’ll always admit to them. 

Anyway I’m rambling but what I came here to say is I wanted to break up with her just over a year ago now but she became pregnant with our kid out the blue so I took it as a sign from God if you will that I should give her a chance. During the pregnancy she was nothing but nasty, I was out working longer shifts to try get some money together while she did nothing but sit around and complain about everything I done. After about 6 or 7 weeks we lost the baby which honestly gave me mixed emotions as obviously I was sad we had lost a baby but I felt like it was another sign from God that ok well maybe we shouldn’t be together. I couldn’t break up with her just after as we’d lost a baby but then just when I thought there’d been enough time to heal and I was ready to break up with her, her Father attempts suicide and is in intensive care for 2 weeks getting his stomach pumped and his wrists stitched up, so again how could I break up with her then? 
We stay together for a bit, I give her the love and support she needs and when I finally feel like - ok, now is the time to break up, her fucking Mom gets cancer. How can I break up with my girl after she finds out her Mom gets cancer? Basically the same thing happens again, her Mom gets good news and just as I think ok well now’s the time fucking COVID comes and before speaking to me about it my Mom invites her to live with us through it all so she has people by her side. Which I was happy for in a way because I don’t hate her and I do really care for her but how can I break up with someone when we’re living in the same bedroom and she has no family, friends or loved ones to stay with during these difficult times? Then about 2 months ago she gets a call out the blue from her Grandma saying she has terminal cancer. 

I obviously can’t break up with her in this moment as she’s now lost her apartment, jobless and living with me and my parents whilst staying with her Grandma to care for her while she dies of cancer. 

I’m not even making this about me so I’m sorry if it comes off that way as I know she’s had such a hard life and so many bad things have happened to her in the space of just over a year but I really can’t see us being together for any longer than need be. I don’t have a lot of relationship experience so I don’t know what to do or how to handle this situation. I’m just sooo confused. 

I try and make it the best I can and at times I forget I even want to break up but then it just eventually goes back to the same old story. If we do manage to have a conversation like adults, fake promises are made by her that are forgotten about within a week or so. I feel I’m trapped. I feel if I stay with her I’ll never be fully happy and if I leave her I feel I’ll always regret adding more shit to her already shit situation...

919,"So I’ve been trying to just forget this whole situation for a long time but it’s not working, so I need some advice. Last year, me and one of my friends had a bit of a rough patch I guess. I’m not sure what happened but I was feeling like she was really absent, instead of being mature and telling her how I felt I just got my feelings hurt and became absent too which turned into a vicious cycle, turns out she was going through something traumatic at the time and that’s why she was acting off. Part of why I was so hurt was because I’d been feeling left out (I struggle with insecurity so it’s not hard for me to feel like that), basically she’d been blowing off plans and ignoring me and not inviting me places even if all our friends were there. So we were not as close as normal for a few months, then towards the end of the year she ended up cancelling plans we’d had for an entire year because of work and other reasons, which I eventually found out she was lying about and just made up the excuse so she wouldn’t have to go. Then a couple months later she went on this vacation with my other best friend, and normally I would never think it’s okay to be jealous of your friends having other friends and spending time without you, but what hurt me was that the three of us had planned this vacation out for all three of us, they knew how excited I was for it and told me we’d do it a few years in the future. Apparently the two of them were already saving to go together without me at the time we were talking about those plans. Plus, the week they were gone the one girl in particular was constantly sending me photos of them doing the things she knew I’d been wanting to do, and bragging about how much fun it was. Meanwhile I’m home with a severe flu watching my friends have fun without me XD. Anyway. I never confronted her about any of this stuff, because I really felt like I was a jerk for being upset. We talked a couple months ago, all that we really said was that we were both sorry for being absent for the past few months but nothing specific was brought up and no apologies were made for the things that hurt me, because I never told her they hurt me. I knew that I had no right to expect an apology if I was too cowardly to confront her, so I decided to forgive and forget. I thought I’d been successful and our friendship has been back to normal, extremely strong for 6 months now. However, I just realized I’m still holding on to a grudge. She’s been acting off for a little bit now and kind of avoiding making plans with me again. She very well could just be going through something, but the issue is that now I’m paranoid and all I can think about is what happened before. I realized that I’m still really hurt and kind of mad about it and I don’t want to be, because at this point I have made her believe that I forgave and forgot everything, I’ve chosen NOT to confront her about things and because of that choice, the only person I can blame for my feelings is myself. But even so, I can’t seem to get rid of them. So what should I do? Finally bringing it up to her would feel really good, but I feel like that would be cruel to bring up something from so long ago and that she doesn’t even know it was an issue. It would make her feel guilty and at this point it’s just holding onto a grudge especially considering that she has been an amazing friend to me for the last few months and has actually supported me through some really hard stuff. So I just don’t know what to do. Please help!

TL;DR: My friend regularly excluded me for a few months, lied to me to get out of a particular event we planned, and secretly planned a vacation with my other friend, while allowing me to be under the impression that all three of us would go together at a later time. It’s now been half a year since this happened, she’s been an amazing friend to me for that time, but we never talked about what happened and I still feel hurt.",07Sep2020,1

I’m wanting to move out because I’m ready for my independence. My parents are pretty old fashioned so dating right now is a huge challenge. I also just am ready to have my own space, not my home office and bedroom in one spot. I’m tired of having to hide food I buy for myself or get upset that it gets eaten. My family can sometimes be inconsiderate of my work schedule (not often of an occurrence at all, I’m just naming the reasons I have for wanting to do this). I have to clean up our shared bathroom after myself and my siblings, which gets old. I also just am ready to not always have to explain where I’m going/what I’m doing.

I know they’re going to say I should save my money to buy a house, which is a great idea in itself but I know that’s going to be years away. They’re also probably going to make the argument that extra expenses will pop up and I’ll be broke and they won’t be able to help me. For the record, I don’t have to pay rent to stay at my parents house. I just pay my own personal bills (car, insurance, phone, other misc bills).

928," 

TL;DR Cousin/good friend didn't reach out to me when my mother died, its petty but I am now butthurt. How should I let her know that I would like to stay in good terms but not be her friend. Last paragraph includes a draft of a letter I want to send.

Recently my mother passed away due to covid complications. I had a few acquaintances reach out and offer condolences, but none from people I actually considered friends. I know it sounds so petty and trivial compared to my situation, but I am very upset about specifically one person not reaching out. She is my cousin, lexy, which I considered a close friend.

I kept waiting for her to reach out and considered messaging her multiple times, but never did it. eventually I just stopped waiting, but continued caring. Recently my older sister(ellie) spoke to me saying that lexy thought we were mad at her and her family, because we hadn't allowed them to come into our house a few weeks ago. I explained to ellie that we didn't allow them into the house because our mom had just gotten home from mexico and was still in quarantine, additionally lexy is currently pregnant and her mom is very high risk. At the time we were not sure if our mom had covid, so instead of allowing them in our home we went to their car and stood outside their window to talk a bit. As it turns out it was good we didn't allow them because she was indeed sick. Lexy and her mom thought we didn't want them there and therefore she didn't talk to me anymore. I think this bullshit.

I completely understand the miscommunication and why they were upset, but to not even offer condolences when my mother died is such an ass hat move. This person claimed we were best friends yet couldn't get over her anger enough to be there for me? I was there for her at one of the scariest moments in her life, risked a lot to be there too. I really wish she had reciprocated.

Now to the advice i'm here for. I do feel bad about the miscommunication and want to explain why we didn't invite them into our house. In this message though I want to let her know that she really hurt me for not reaching out and how upset I am. I wrote something down:

"" hey lexy, ellie told me that the last time we saw each other we gave off the impression we didnt want you at our house. I want to clarify that we loved that you guys went over,but we were hesitant in having you in the house because our mom was supposed to be in quarantine after coming home from Mexico. I am so sorry it came off that way, we really did not mean it that way at all, if anything it was to protect you guys specially because you are pregnant, we wouldnt want anything to happen to you or your baby. im sorry it came off as rude but im glad we did it because my mom was sick and who knows what would've happened. Now i do want to let you know that the fact that this miscommunication kept you back from talking to me in the worst time of my life was really upsetting. I considered you a good friend and really hoped to hear from you in the worst time of my life. For the sake of family id like to remain in good terms and acquainted, but i dont think i can ever trust the sanctity of friendship with you. I hope you can understand, best wishes to you and your little family""

Is this okay? too much or too little? Help!",07Sep2020,1
929,"tw: misgendering, sexual assault, abuse

\---

I have a friend who I've known for 4-5 years who I feel like has just treated me a little manipulatively: she threw me a surprise birthday party and then proceeded to talk about herself and play on her phone the whole time, and she gave me a mug for my 22nd birthday this year that said ""happy 21st birthday"" and had my birth year wrong. The final straw was a couple months ago, when she misgendered/deadnamed me pretty much 3 minutes after I told her my new pronouns and name and then when I called her out on it, she called me racist and sexist for only calling her out on it (I'm AFAB nonbinary) - but we were best friends so I trusted her enough to respect everything. All of this to say, I feel uncomfortable being the friends we once were.

In January, I was told by her former roommate that she had narcissistic personality disorder. This lined up with my experiences and her personality. 

Today, she called me (after we had taken a prolonged break from talking) and told me that this roommate had groomed her and verbally abused her; additionally, another roommate of hers had assaulted her (I'll spare you the details because it was pretty grisly). She's been sexually assaulted several times before this. Because I always believe survivors, and knowing these people's personalities, I believed her outright and told her so. I told her that I'd be there to support her, and unfollowed the roommate on instagram because we're not really friends anyways, and told her that she was valued. 

My opinion is that everyone here just has a lot of trauma, which doesn't give them excuses to act the way they've been acting. But I don't really want to be friends with anyone in this situation, which I can manage because I'm applying to grad school in a different state and we're in quarantine. But my friend seems to think that we're now really good friends again, which I guess was the impression I gave, and I also gave the impression that I was ""taking space away"" from the roommate because I unfollowed him. I just don't really want to get involved in a situation that I wasn't involved in before today.

My question, though: How do I create the boundaries I once had so I don't have to get involved in this situation, but still show my support for my friend?

Also, am I just making entitled excuses? Is this just all minutae and unimportant compared to what she's going through?

TLDR: I had a falling out with a friend over a couple things, then she told me later that other friends had abused her. How do I keep her at arm's length but still support her?",07Sep2020,1
930,"I've been trying to adopt a cat for some time now, the agencies around my area are super busy and their pets are constantly being adopted. Originally I was planning to travel far to adopt, but something happened, so I gave up on that. I ended up turning to Craig's list to adopt a cat. I inquired for 2 cats and I got a response for 1. The lady had a nice, well taken care of cat named Choco, she had a very short description for the cat like ""this cat needs a nice, loving home. I can't take care of her anymore due to medical reasons, she's loving when she knows you enough"". 

I asked questions like her temperment, her likes and dislikes, her health background, and all that. We had a back and fourth and I told her I was serious about adopting Choco, and she had my word I would give her a good home.  I also told her some personal information like how I cared for my fiance's pets when I moved in with him for a year. 

I could tell the lady really cared about Choco, and she wanted to make sure she found the right person. She eventually told me why she had to rehome her pets (I didn't ask), she said she was too pregnant to take care of all her pets and to cater to them properly. 

I commended her and thanked her for disclosing that information, and I emphasized with how hard it must have been to make that decision. 

As she got more comfortable with me, I showed her pics of my fiance's cats, she said we would love Choco cause they were the same breed. I told her more personal information like how my fiance was stuck in America due to the pandemic, she sent me a message of sympathy  saying ""I'm sorry to hear you were separated for so long"". Thanked her for her sympathy, then we went back to business and she went into more detail about Choco's grooming regime. I assured her Choco will maintain her grooming routine. 

Things were going good, and I asked if I could meet Choco in person. She agreed and said "" Of course. When would be good for you to meet her? I appreciate your interest and understanding in maintaining the habits already in place"".  Then this is where things got a little weird and sus. She sent me this message 2 minutes later ""If its ok I can come to you as i have other pets that somewhat go crazy when company is around. I am trying to rehome a couple more of them as well. I rescued a couple including choco after my cousins murder. 

I thought it was so weird how she included that info, I was thinking maybe it's because she felt comfortable with me because of how we got personal during this back and fourth. Maybe she wanted some sympathy for this tragedy she went through, because I showed her sympathy earlier during her plight. It just felt so out of the blue and odd, and it made me feel kinda uncomfortable. My fiance immediately told me not to meet her, he was already sketched out by one of the pics that showed she had hand tattoos (not so pleasing cheap parlor shop tatooes of random tribal symbols). My sister also told me not to meet her too, and said it sounds like red flags. Other than the tattoo and the unnecessary info, nothing seems amiss. The photos featured in the listing had a clean and orderly room, and the cat looked healthy and well groomed. 

I'm young and inexperienced, and my friends describe me to be naive. I'm kind of worried I'm meeting up with a potential killer. I hope I'm reading into things too much, and she really is a normal person trying to find a good home for her beloved pet. I'm thinking of meeting her at the mall with my mom and one of my girlfriends'.

937,"Hey Everyone,

I’m hoping for some help. I am not normally the type to spill my life on a public post, but this situation affects my best friend as well and I’m hoping that the community here may be able to say something that can help her through this, and honestly, maybe myself as well. This will be a very very long post. But it is a very big deal to us, and one we are still in the middle of. I know I won't come off as completely unbiased, because I honestly cannot be. But I accept the blame which belongs to me and tried my best to give the situation as clearly as I see it. Our friendship is very true and dear to us, and its future is uncertain right now. I hope a few of you can make it through and feel you have something to say that could help. Sorry for the burner, but I wanted to keep anonymous so I don't make things more difficult on her. She's not a reddit user, but still. 

Again, this is a reaaaaally long one, so I will give a quick (but still kind of long) TL;DR.

A female co-worker (both mid-30’s, both married with 2 young children roughly the same age, both fairly anti-social) form a very close and dear friendship over the last 3 years. Twin-flame, platonic soul-mate, tell your deepest darkest thoughts type friends. So much so that I easily and proudly say she is my best friend. Yeah happened a bit fast, but truth is truth. 

However, her husband won’t accept a mix gender friendship for his wife and creates a very toxic home atmosphere for her, including accusations of being oblivious and naive to a guy’s 'only possible intentions' , snide comments at any mention of the friendship, and staging a severe moment of humiliation for her in front of her sister-in-law and her new partner calling her out in front of them. This caused our friendship to be driven into the shadow, where we continued to grow closer outside his notice through phone calls and text messages. This was a snowball effect that just started with sometimes not messaging me while he was in the room so she didn’t have to hear the snide comments yet again, to a progressively more and more (but never completely till now) secret.

Feeling guilty for her omissions and wanting to make things right, we had decided to try and remedy the situation by having me reach out to her husband to try and build up some familiarity, including some family visits, which we hoped would calm the situation and remove her guilt by bringing our friendship back into the light. Before this could come to pass (between Covid, and a death in her family) he checked her cell phone records and found that we had been speaking over the phone. Emotional chaos ensued within their house as he flipped out about this, and despite several days of apology’s and explanations for the omissions from both Li and myself, he ultimately asked me to keep my distance from his wife and ordered his wife never to contact me again. He claimed that the lies were as bad as cheating. He resented our getting close and that I had helped her through the death in her family (because if she needed my help then what does that make him, in his words) . Worse, after my last message to him, he sent me a txt from her phone under her name claiming that I should stop messaging so he could forgive her, and that he was not and never would be ok with her having a male friend. I immediately knew this to be from him, which Li later confirmed.

*Note that there has never been a physical or romantic aspect to our relationship, only a deep friendship. It is something we discussed more than a few times as our friendship grew, making sure we were both on the same page and sure of our own and each other’s intent. It was very important to both of us, since we both have families.* Despite everything, we both value our friendship greatly and have messaged a few times since then. She feels trapped by her own heart in the matter, wanting to respect her husband but not being able to deny how much a part of both of us our friendship has become. 

Now not only are she and I are unsure of the future of our friendship, which neither of us want to give up on, but she is also at a real emotional low point, saying it was selfish for her to try and have a friend (any friend) when she has a husband at home. Questioning whether having a trusting friendship with me was a betrayal in of itself, even before the omissions started. Questioning if she should just try and be content and keep herself restricted to the work and the home. That the entire guilt of the situation lay with her and she doesn’t deserve forgiveness.  It breaks my heart to hear her say these things. Not only questioning things that I truly believe is every person’s right, but also assuming all the guilt of the whole situation. 

Also worth a note, my wife has always been aware of the extent of our friendship and has been happy and supportive of it. She was even beginning to form her own friendship with my friend before this went down.

/TL;DR {Yes, that was the short version}

So if you’re still with me, I thank you very much for making this far. Like I said, I’m looking for some help. I’m hoping to draw on the words of the community here that have had experiences which could help my friend and me.

I have told her that everyone deserves to have a friend and indeed, to have as many wholesome people to care about in this world as they can find. I have told her that she always has a friend in me, and that she could do whatever she needed to do. I would never hold her hostage in our relationship and that even if we have to step back and wait 20 years for things to change, that I would still be there when they did, happy to see her. I told her that her lying or omitting may have not been the right thing to do, but it wasn’t the first wrong either, and that some of the blame for what happened belongs to the toxicity that was put on her for making a male friend, and also some on me for failing to reach out to her husband in good faith sooner. I did try once; we had a family visit to their house early on. We did not click at all at the time, so I didn’t worry about trying to continue. In hindsight, if I knew it may have made a difference I would have tried harder despite the discomfort. (though I suspect his reaction would have been the same eventually anyway).  Most of all I tell her that I don’t blame her. That the friendship has been worth it to me every step of the way (she has questioned whether she is worth the trouble a few times).  And that she is not selfish or doing wrong by wanting something for herself. It helped a bit while I said it. But I know that she takes what her husband says very hard, it has caused her to be caught between thinking my outlook is right, but also unique and that the world just can’t work that way.

To me, her husband seems manipulative and controlling. For example, she rarely even goes to a store by herself, because “families stick together.  We will all go or you can just stay home”. She has admitted to me before that he makes almost all the decisions. He asks her input, but usually results in a big fight  or just outright ignoring her if she disagrees with him. Li is a strong, smart, and very earnest person, but she married to her husband when she was very young and unsure, and has always had a blind spot for how he drives the relationship due to that by her own words. I gave him a lot of benefit of the doubt through everything until the explosion for Li’s sake, but it seems so 1950’s to me, and I have difficulty not being upset by this attitude. I have always really believed in equality and that you don’t have to sacrifice yourself completely when you become married. That and to me this is basically the equivalent of getting life on parole for a lie of omission and nothing else. We never cheated, and couldn’t even emotional cheat as some might say, because we had defined ourselves so completely as friends. And I believe that everyone deserves someone to talk to outside their marital bed. These are my opinions based on what she has told me and what I’ve seen.

But as close to the situation as I am, I can’t possibly sound objective. And truthfully, I’m not. I think what happened is because she wasn’t treated with trust and respect in the first place, and I can’t help but think of her first.

 

We have messaged a few times since. She initiated, and I let her set the pace. Sometimes we talked about nothing, like old times. Sometimes we talk about what happened, how much we miss each other, and what comes next. We know that our options are stop talking and hope things change, to keep our relationship going in secret, either frequently or infrequently, and still hope for things to change, or stand up to him for what she deserves (something she told me she has the strength to do, but is impossible right now, her words and all she would say on it.).She doesn’t want to lie to her husband, but nothing feels right to her and she is feeling lost. The hardest is last night,  after I tried again to tell her she wasn’t being a bad person by wanting a friend and that she had just made some mistakes along the way. That we would figure it out no matter what the answer was. She said thanks, sent me a hug emoji. Then she took a moment, sent me a crying emoji and asked if I could just somehow make everything ok. Very unusual, because like I said she has always been ernest and direct with me, never passive like that. Then she apologized and said that wasn’t fair to ask. I still told her I would do my best.

And this post is part of that.

This is a strange kind of help request I suppose, my apologies for that. 
I’m not looking for feedback from the community on whether it was right or wrong to hide the frequency of our conversations. No one is harder on Li than herself for having carried on beneath his notice. I’m not looking for someone to say that I should have gone around Li and spoke to her husband myself. We discussed having a frank and open conversation and she was adamant it would not go well, and I would not disrespect her and go behind her back to do it. I’m not really looking for someone to just tell us what to do either. I’m still not sure what we will do, but I know it will have to be our decision. I’m definitely not looking for someone to say “the husband makes the rules” or that you can’t just have friendships with whomever you choose after you get married. As long as it’s a positive and supportive relationship like ours is, I simply can’t believe that and I would never lie to her. And I don’t think just saying “life is hard and unfair, just break it off” is helpful either, because if it was that easy we would have already done it. Our friendship just means too much to us. I guess I’m not totally sure what I’m looking for. 

I guess, I’m looking for someone other than me to tell my friend what she deserves. That she deserves to have a friend without being made to feel untrusted or stupid about it. Deserves forgiveness without being put in a cage for it. That the only thing she did wrong was a coerced lie, and that wanting something for herself was not wrong. I’m hoping people who have had successful friendships like ours, whether they were easy or hard to give us their story. For another pair of mixed gender friends who have a large amount of emotional real-estate with each other who are making it work, whether it’s hard or easy. For someone else to tell her that she deserves to receive trust and respect too, not just give it. Maybe even from someone who’s friendship like ours didn’t work out, but they wished it had.

 I’ve said most of these things and I believe these things. I know not everyone may think the same as I do, or may even think her husband is completely in the right. But I know that someone out there. Must think and feel as we do. I think it would mean the world to her to know that we are not alone out there, and knowing might make our decision easier on her, whatever it ends up being.  I guess I just want to give her a little hope and/or validation.

So if anyone can help me try and make things ok for her, I would love to hear what you have to say and I appreciate the time you spent listening to my post. And If anyone wants the extreme long version of events for context, see below:

 

My best friend, who we will call Li. Li is mid-thirties, as I am. We are both married and each of us have 2 young  children of similar age. Both of us have no other real close friends, and have difficulty making friends in general.

Over the course of 2 years, we developed a light and fun working friendship. Over time this moved past the usual niceties and we began to enjoy sharing some personal interests with each other. Some shared and some we enjoyed showing each other. Well, over the 2 years it became fairly obvious to us that we were much more compatible than any of our other co-workers. We began to idly bring up the idea of getting together outside of work, but with no real urgency. After all, we saw each other for a couple of hours every day, spending our breaks hanging out at work. Well, things progressed slowly and really pleasantly like this over the two years. This changed once my friend applied to a new job at a different facility within the same company. After much discussing the opportunity and encouraging her to go for it, she ended up getting the job.

After the emotional high of that win passed, we realized what this meant for our friendship. Suddenly, after 2 years, we would no longer see and talk every day. On one of her last days in our facility, she dropped by and invited me for a walk and talk. We had a real talk about our friendship, and what it had come to meant to us.  Neither of us formed friendships easily or often, and in fact she was the first real friend I had made since I was in school, and she had similar experiences. Well, we decided during our talk that our budding friendship wasn’t something that we wanted to loose, so from that day on, our friendship moved from the workplace into our home life. We would text every day. We would often talk on the phone during our drives back and forth from work. And when our schedules allowed, we would sometimes meet up to steal a quick breakfast before our shift started. Our txt conversations would often run late into the night into the hours of early morning. We would often laugh at the strange topics and difficult questions that would come up during these times, calling them our 3am thoughts. We would sometimes spend these late nights talking while painting, or watching shows we both enjoyed. During these times and over the course of the next year, our budding friendship turned into one that was very dear to both of us. We spoke at length about anything you could imagine, and we helped each other through some really dark times, just by listening, reaffirming, reassuring, and being there for each other. We comfortably called each other best friend and more.

Now there are a couple of amazing, and perhaps fairly unique, aspects of our friendship. One is how forthright we are with each other. We never leave anything unsaid, and difficulty or potentially inappropriate or upsetting questions are said without fear. We can completely confide in each other with no fear of judgement, and total benefit of the doubt. And another aspect is that we have complete trust in one another. Not just to keep the things we spoke about to ourselves, but also with our relationship as a whole. See, as I said we both have families, spouses and children. So as we felt ourselves growing closer and closer with each other, and our friendship deepen into something really singular and, for lack of a better term, intimate, we also had many conversations about how appropriate it was and if we were sure what we were feeling could be defined as friendship and not something else. We always decided that our relationship was pure and exactly what we both wanted it to be. This was our truth and we valued each other even more because we understood it.

Over the last year, it became clearer and clearer that Li’s husband does not see things the same way. Any time she was texting me, or talking about me in any way, he would become very toxic. Saying mean spirited jokes like “why don’t you ask your boyfriend”, or just outright saying that he doesn’t trust my intention in befriending ‘his wife’ and that no man would ever spend this much time and energy on a woman unless he was trying to ‘get something’ out of her. This attitude got so pervasive, that eventually Li grew tired of trying to convince him otherwise, and began taking the path of least resistance. She began contacting me during times when she was alone or out of the house. It was a slow gradual process, but effectively it resulted in her husband becoming unaware of how close we had become. I was semi aware of this as it started happening, but it became more and more apparent over time.

As uncomfortable as it was to address, we did speak at length about the problem several times, as like I said, we did not leave anything unsaid between us. Knowing that her omissions were slowly becoming a deception over time was weighing very heavily on her, as Li really prized honesty and earnestness even when it’s difficult to do so. The idea of having a plain and frank conversation with her husband about the pure nature of our friendship, as well as how his attitude toward it made her feel was discussed, but quickly shot down. As she feared his reaction, she was caught between trying to save his pride, and trying to keep our friendship possible for her. Honestly it snagged my thread to hear that she feared he could just tell her not to be friends with someone and that she would feel obligated to listen, as I have always believed committed relationships should co-exist with personal freedom.

Hearing her fear over his reaction, we spoke about solutions and decided the best would be to have more of an open presence in each other’s lives, hoping that he would acclimatize to our friendship as my presence became more familiar to him.  We hoped to do this mainly by having semi-frequent family visits, and we intended to have a get together at my home as soon as possible. We had already done this once earlier in our friendship. Things were civil and pleasant, but I did not click with her husband on a friend level at all and didn’t make much effort to continue with him till much later. Looking back, I wish that I had, though I’m not sure it would have changed anything. Well, unfortunately, due to the Covid Crisis as well as a couple of the dark times I referenced earlier, we were unable to arrange anything for a good while. Of course, this just made the situation draw out longer. Finally we were able to arrange a visit. I got his number from Li and reached out, sending my invitation to him. Though he initially told Li that” he didn’t want to go, he didn’t want to help someone try and F**K his wife”, he eventually accepted and his response to me sounded happy to receive the invite. Things seemed like they were going to go our way.

But then, disaster struck. 2 days before the visit, he checked her personal cell phone records and saw that she had made calls to my phone number. This resulted in an emotional explosion in their house. I was sent a text by him demanding to know the situation, and I responded with a long text about what had happened from my perspective. I included that I was sorry for him to have found out about our close friendship like that, and that we were trying to remedy it without hurting his feelings or pride. I really tried to put it all out there. He responded saying that to him, keeping him in the dark was as bad as cheating and to keep my distance from his wife. I responded, once again explaining that it had been a snowball scenario and wasn’t intended, but I completely understood how this was upsetting, and that I would respect his wishes, but I hoped that he and I could talk again when heads cool as Li and I really valued our friendship and hoped we can make things right. Then, I receive a text from Li, but was written by her husband (I knew right away, and later confirmed). It states that her husband is not ok with her having a male friend, and will never be ok with it in the future. And that if I valued her friendship, I would never message her again, as reminding him made it hard for him to forgive her.

This is the exact scenario that Li had feared. I sent what I thought may be a final message to her, in a separate method which I knew would be for her eyes only. I told her I didn’t blame her, and that we may have lied, but that this was not her fault. I told her I would always be there for her and that she could contact if she ever needed me. And I told her how to keep track of me from a distance if she wanted to (social media). And that she would always have a friend in me. She sent one back apologizing again, placing the entire load of the blame on herself. Wished me well, and that was that. At least I thought so at the time. We were both devastated.

But we started messaging each other again, slowly. Starting just with profile pic changes that were clearly meant for each other and likes on posts of new paintings and such. We have messaged a few times since. She initiated, and I let her set the pace. Sometimes we talked about nothing, like old times. Sometimes we talk about what happened, how much we miss each other, and what comes next. We know that our options are stop talking and hope things change, to keep our relationship going in secret, either frequently or infrequently, and still hope for things to change, or stand up to him for what she deserves (something she told me she has the strength to do, but is impossible right now, her words and all she would say on it.). Nothing feels right to her and she is feeling lost. We are taking a few days to think about what to do. And that is the really long, yet somehow still much to short, version of events so far.

TW: abuse? Molested? grooming?

So... I’m 17 year old female and I have always had issues with my dad. I was adopted as a baby and have no knowledge or memories of my biological parents. Looking back at pictures and videos both of them were all smiles and loving, but behind that, my dad was an alcoholic. He always slept on the sofa and reeked of sweat, alcohol and cigarettes. He was always angry and if I did something he didn’t like he would grab at me really hard or yell. There are some instances I can for some reason recall down to the last detail. What he said, how he grabbed me and how I played with toys to distract me since I wasn’t allowed to cry. There was also that time after my parents divorced he drove in the car drunk with me on passenger side. Yada yada, police came yada yada I got back home to mom yada yada stuff happened.

As a sober person though he was different. He was still easy to anger but at the same time he spoiled me. Bought me toy upon toy, took me out on walks. When there was other ppl around he was clear as day.
But what concerns me the most, and the reason I made this whole throwaway account and this post at all is this... for as long as I can remember he always patted and squeezed my thighs, sometimes even did it to my butt. When I was little he always wanted me to kiss him on the lips. If I did it on the cheek he would ask me in this sweet tone “What? Call that a kiss?” Then make kissy lips at me. Since I didn’t want to anger him I of course never felt like I could say no. What freaked me out the most though was that one night he had tucked me in and kissed me on the forehead, said good night and then just looked at me. Then he licked and bit his lip. 

I’m sorry I’m making such a long post, I just don’t know what to do, bear with me :,)

Also, wether sober or drunk he would always be lost in his head. Muttering to himself.

Now, he has kind of stopped? Skimming through a bunch of things over the years... he cheated on mom( reason for their divorce (denies it)), became a new (better?) man, married again, got a son, was persuaded into alcohol rehab, and divorced again. Yeah, bunch of stuff, and I was dragged through it all since didn’t have much choice. 

At some point he stopped making kissy faces, he stopped patting and squeezing my butt, still sometimes does it to my thighs tho. But now, he comments on how pretty I look and that I shouldn’t eat too much and keep my hair long. 

Now I’m 17 and dealing with a bunch of things.. anxiety, depression, foggy thinking, feeling shame and guilt, trust issues, sleep disorder, panic attacks, low self esteem, disassociation, never showing pain (physical) when others are around but bawling my eyes out if I hit my knee when alone, resentment and anger, stressed by people and any type relationship, feeling like I’m always playing victim, feeling like I can’t say no and if I do I get shedded by guilt, feeling like I’m never clean. 

Did he do something to me? I’m aware of the yelling and grabbing but did he do something else to me? I know it may just be loving father gestures with the patting since I’ve read other ppl experience the same, but by putting it with the other things he has done and that freakish look he gave me saying when goodnight, I’m starting to think he did something else. Am i overreacting? I have no other memories of it. Could my brain have blocked it out? 

I’m still taking to him and seeing him. I’m still playing nice so I won’t hurt or anger him.  I hate him and would never trust him but thinking something bad may happen to him makes me sad. I want him out of my life but I can’t say no.

I’m scared for my half little brother. My dad is not as rough with him as me was with me, but I sometimes still see him yank a bit to hard on him. I feel like I’m going to be in trouble if I say something. I feel helpless like I did before as a child. 

Before u say or ask where is my mom in all of this or that I should talk to a therapist, then yes don’t worry. I agree my mom should have stepped in before but this post is not about her. 
I am starting to talk to someone, we have not come this far into conversation since it’s still in starting phase and I find it far much easy to talk anonymously here.
