0,"We have received a fairly important letter today, that had the postage printed by the sender 6 days previously. The normal timeframe from the sender to receiver is 3 days. There have been no out of the ordinary interruptions in their operations to speak of. 
     The reason for asking is because the letter was time sensitive in regards to an appeal to a policy. The sender whom is acting as HR, has a history of being a snake in regards to employee rights, nepotism, and romancing or otherwise controlling board members in order to “stack the deck” in their favor.

1,"I’m in my early 20s and I had planned to have sex for the first time last year. I met up with the guy I was going to do it with and we went back to my place. When he entered me I was in too much pain and since it was his first time too he had some problems finding the right entry point. 

We were at it for 20 minutes, just awkwardly moving through different activities back and forth. 

The next morning I had what I thought was my period, even though it was way off my schedule, and it lasted two days with heavy bleeding. Not sure if this was my hymen breaking and if it is meant to last that long when it bleeds or something else. My periods do not normally last such short amounts of time. 

Any insight?",07Jun2020,1
2,"In the country I live in you are allowed to leave home without your parents consent at 16, I am 17 now but I have no money and no support to leave.

They're emotionally abusive, just last week my own mom said she doesn't love me anymore and wants me and my dad to move away so she doesn't have to deal with us and so she can move on from us . Both my parents tried to commit suicide this year.

I don't think I can stay here any longer I need to get away but I don't have any support and was wondering if maybe the government would help? I don't want to get my parents in trouble I just want to live somewhere else that's safer for me but I don't what to do.

5,"Hi there. As the title says I believe I am mentally ill and I cannot get treatment. I have suffered from suicidal thoughts and self-esteem issues for the past 8-9 years ever since my mom left. From December 2015 to September 2016 I was suffering from bulimia because I figured out most of my family was largely unsympathetic to the abuse I suffered from my single parent dad. I had to beat the disorder myself. I still suffer from bouts of depression from time to time. Recently my conscription into the Army has probably exacerbated anxiety issues I have also put up with since then. I believe I have had anxiety issues since my mom was separated from my family. She was separated due to the fact that I had exposed her infidelity to my dad.  She too would abuse during the last 2 years in our family.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that my anxiety issues and depression have had a correlation to my poor academic performance. If you asked me to study a book for a test in 2 months I would spend 2-3 weeks reading the first chapter because I would get so paranoid because I worry about missing something important for the test. I would then move onto Chapter 2 and while I am studying Chapter 2 I worry about forgetting stuff from Chapter 1 and would go back and forth between 1 and 2 for 2 weeks. The same cycle repeats for Chapter 3 and 4 and so on. Eventually I get depressed because I know my grades aren't gonna be great because I spent too much time studying the first 4 chapters. I would give up for a bit and then at the last minute cram everything. I would end up with usually a D or a C+.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know I need to address these issues somehow but the problem is that I can't get treated. I have never been diagnosed with any of the above because I cannot afford to get treated. What do I mean by this ? I come from a lower-middle class single-parent household. My dad is 65 and is still busting his ass trying to make a living. I can see he is going to hit his limit anytime soon. If I ever got a diagnosis for any of the above issues I would be rendered unemployable. I would be obliged to tell employers of my mental health issues and they would immediately cast my resume to the bin. I have seen it myself and my dad has done so too. In our country we either believe someone with a mental illness is trying to feign mental illness to avoid combat roles in the military or that person is a ticking time-bomb who is going to relapse and cause a huge meltdown in front of an important client or business partner.

6,"I have vivid memories of my dad threatening to chop off my dick. Though one very CLEAR one was of him seeing me gettin changed and coming back with a knife and cutting board and yelling at me.

7,"I have been dating my boyfriend for about a year. When we first started dating, he told me that he was bipolar. I have severe anxiety, so it really didn’t intimidate me as I’ve struggles with mental illness myself and wouldn’t want someone to judge me for it. I didn’t think anything of it honestly. He was on medication at one point, maybe a couple years ago, but stopped taking it. 

A few months ago he decided to go sober. He didn’t have a major alcohol problem at this point, but he did in the past. I have grown to love how he acts while he’s been sober. I didn’t realize that his drinking was a problem until he stopped. I also think that the longer he’s able to stay sober, the more confident he’s been. He’s really proud of himself and I’m also really proud of him. 

There have been a few instances in the past few weeks where I have really been noticing his bipolar tendencies. Like, he just woke up this morning and decided he “hates” me and has been at his friends house all day. I don’t blame him for this because I have been very anxious and stressed about work and school. I think he just needs a break. 


What I worry about is his alcohol problem and his bipolar disorder. I just wish that he would go to therapy and/or go on medication because I feel like its just a matter of time before his mania kicks in and he starts drinking again (I would never say this to him). I feel like he has to get a grasp on his bipolar disorder before he can do all of these other things, like going sober, successfully. I’m just really worried. 

I really don’t want anyone to say anything mean about his alcoholism or bipolar disorder and tell me that I shouldn’t be with him or anything of that nature. I have tons of flaws that I am working on. I can’t judge him for his flaws. I just want to talk about all of this with him so that he can get better, but I don’t know how.",07Jun2020,1
8,"I (27M) started actively seeing a woman (43F, we will call her Sarah) about 6 weeks ago. It was on a whim, a fun weekend out. It then progressed to a dating relationship. Sarah is incredibly generous, kind, funny, and seems to truly appreciate me for me. Something I have never had before. The sex is amazing, and she is actively helping me recover from a surgery by helping with groceries, driving me places, helping with my physical therapy. Hell, she graduated me from the twin bed I had been using to a queen bed. (I never had the need for one, not having luck with love before. That, and I am not as well off financially as she is. Her generosity astounds me.) She gets along with my family, friends. When I met her friends and family, they all loved me. Her best friend says that Sarah has always had an edge to her, but when she talks about me, that edge is gone, and Sarah is a softer person around me.

She seems perfect. We even have started to say ""I love you"" to each other. I believe I feel it, and yet In my mind, it feels so fast. I mean, 6 weeks.That quote ""Love can hit you like a bolt of lightning"" seems to strike a chord with me. That and, I never have had luck with relationships before.

Can love be different for every person? Can it be fast for some, as it can also be slow for others? Am I worrying too much? Am I crazy for letting us both move so fast?",07Jun2020,1
9,"What should I do as a student facing a very lazy teacher an inefficient school system? This summer I am taking Calc II at a local community college. since signing up for the class I had run into many problems with both the school system and my teacher. The class started on the 16th of last month and goes until August 1st. About five days in I saw that I had been kicked out of the course completely, when I questioned the teacher he told me its because I ""failed to attend"", by that he meant that I missed a single homework assignment, yet I submitted the first, well before this happened.  I explained that I was new to the portal system and said it wouldn't happen again. He said he had no idea how to add me back and was very sassy/rude in his emails to me. after 2-3 days I was back in the class. I wish that's where the problems stopped, his lessons are almost impossible, he does not explain topics, he quickly goes over topics by merely solving problems on a youtube video without explaining any context or background as to what we are doing. homework takes 5-6 hours per homework for 12-15 problems. on a Q/A zoom session he had, he stated that we were making this ""harder than it needed to be"" and that ""it's our job to figure out what we don't understand"". His tone is very rude and answers students' questions very reluctantly. When I asked for additional material in which to practice, he replied with a single ""No"", in the email. its also worth mentioning that I was kicked out of the class again and not the professor, advisors, nor department head know how it happened, and it slowed me down by 2 days...AGAIN. I understand it not against the law to be bad at your job but what should I do to remedy this situation, I don't want to fail a class I'm paying 1600 dollars to take. This class is also vital to my course schedule at my primary university.",07Jun2020,1

12,"I have 2 children who, until it was shut down due to COVID, attended an after-school program for a few hours every day after school. We paid $135 per week for both of them combined. They continued to charge our credit card full price all during the stay-at-home period when schools were closed and our kids were home with us.

Should I bring it up with them and try to get a partial refund or credit towards their summer camp program? (which my children will also be attending). My wife thinks I should but said she will leave the decision to me.

We we not financially impacted by the pandemic. We both still worked full time and if anything we ended up spending less money. 

 I value the relationship with the manager/director (not owner, I don't know the owner) of the after-school program. My kids look up to him and he is also their karate instructor. I know he has some expenses, like rent, that didn't go away but he was surely spending less money on staff, electricity, etc because the whole thing was shut down.

I realize many families suffered during this time and one thought I had was maybe he did something for them, because at one point he asked us how we were doing and I said we were fine. 

I'm really torn. We work hard for our money and I don't like the idea of spending nearly $1,500 and getting literally nothing in return, but at the same time maybe I just need to let this one go because there are more important considerations.",07Jun2020,1

14,"
I’m not sure if this is a good thread to put this in, but if any of y’all have advice to help me, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this. Im 18 if that adds anything

Recently my girlfriend and I broke up. It was mutual, but she was the one who did it, if that makes sense. After talking, she said she wanted time to focus on herself and to work out her issues. I personally didn’t want to break up, but I didn’t fight her decision because I want her to get better. We both said that in the future when we’re both good and ready, we would get back together. But I’m scared that won’t happen. After a few days, her and I had a really deep talk. During this time, I told her that I made a decision to not make any efforts to talk to other girls and to keep to myself so when she feels ready, we can try again. I promised her that even if I found someone else, I wouldn’t pursue anything because i want to be with her. She said that she was really happy that I made that choice, and that it would help her through the process because she won’t be afraid of me leaving. She said that she wasn’t planning on talking to anyone and that she would come back to me when she’s ready. However, she said she wasn’t going to promise that we would get back together, and she didn’t want to promise that she wouldn’t find someone else. This broke my heart. I understand that things happen, and she’s free to do what she wants because I don’t control her and we’re not in a relationship. But it hit me hard knowing that she’s not willing to make that same sacrifice. I want to be with her, so I’m more than willing to sacrifice a potential future with someone else because I want to be with her, but it hurts me that she doesn’t feel the same. Will we get back together? Possibly, but the thought of her leaving me behind while I was waiting for her kills me. It might be selfish for me to think like that, but it hurts that out of all the sacrifices I made in the relationship, and the sacrifice I’m making while we’re not in one, she doesn’t want to. It feels unfair that I’m willing to put my love life on hold so she doesn’t have to worry about me leaving, but she won’t do the same. I just want to be with her again. I want her to get better, and for her to becoming who she wants to be, and I fully support us being apart in order for her to work out her issues. It’s just hard on me knowing that I can’t get the same treatment back. She wants me to get better too, but it’s hard knowing that I’m willing to stay loyal to her, but if she felt like it, she can leave me behind. I still love her and she still loves me, but it’s slowly breaking me every time I think about the potential of her leaving. I want us to get back together again, and for us to fall in love again, and for us to make the roots of our relationship stronger. When i think of my future, I picture her in it, for every high and low moment. But the fear in me takes over, and it’s hard for me to stay optimistic about it.",07Jun2020,1

17,"Around November or December, my girlfriend broke up with me after something happened concerning her mental health. I tried to get her to stay with me, then she said something that I interpreted as a suicidal text, then she stopped responding to me. In my panic, I called the police for a welfare check, and when she did respond, I realized she wasn't suicidal, but I couldn't call the police back in time, so I made whatever was happening at her house worse. She didn't speak to me again that night, but we tried still talking to each other as friends. I thought we could hang out as friends later, too, and we started the process of planning that out, but I figured I should talk to her about what happened, closure, and whatnot, so I told her I wanted to talk to her once I left my dad's house since I wasn't comfortable talking there. After a few days there, I figured it would mean more in person, so once I left and she asked me what I wanted to talk to her about, so I told her I thought it would be best to wait until the meet-up, but she thought that was the only reason I wanted to meet, which I tried to explain otherwise. We ended up talking over phone, and she asked me not to talk to her until she gets everything figured out. I complied, and I haven't talked to her since. But I can't help but feel like I never truly apologized for what I did to her, and I want her to know I care about her still, but not make it sound like I'm trying to beg her to take me back.

20,"My father, who raised me by himself most of my life, passed away two days ago.  There's a lot of thoughts and feelings I've been having to work through, but there's one that troubles me more than any of the others.  Should tell my mother?  This sounds like a no brainer, but there are other factors.

Number one and my biggest concern.  She is an addict.  She's abused heroin and other substances most of her life.  She was sexually abused regularly as a child and used drugs when she was older to cope, and it only spiraled onward from there.  This is a key factor as to why she's not in my life, and also a key factor as to why I worry about her if I try to reach out to her.

Number two, I have only spoken with her maybe a dozen times over the last fifteen years.  Each time she was either out of it, asking for money, or trying to make me feel bad about not keeping in touch.  There would be a little mother/daughter bonding which i craved, but after every phone call I always felt like absolute crap anyway.  Emotionally exhausted.

Three, she and my dad divorced nearly two decades ago.  They didn't keep in touch much, however, she did reach out to him over Easter and they caught up.  She seemed like she wanted to be in his life again.  She tried contacting me at the same time, but I never responded.

The last time I visited her, fifteen years ago, she was clean.  She relapsed while I was there, and tried to blame me.  I know addicts will try to rationalize anything to justify their behavior, and I don't blame myself.  Still, I'm afraid if I reach out to her, especially over a tragedy, it could lead to something worse for her.

I know I've stated a lot of negatives about my mother, but I'd like to say I wish her only the best in life even if I'm not in it.  Writing this all out, it makes me feel that I know, truly in my mind, that I should not contact her if I really care about her well being.  I may just be wanting to reach out to fill a the void of the parent I lost.

Possibly worth noting that there isn't anyone else who would give her the news, and my father wanted his death to be very low profile so there won't be obituaries, funeral services, or anything.

Any input at all helps, even if it's just stating what I feel is obvious.  I need to hear it from someone other than myself otherwise I will keep doubting and revisiting the thought.",07Jun2020,1
21,"The situation is as follows,

My father is coming home tomorrow from a business trip and I'm afraid he's going to hurt my family. 

He's threatening to take my niece away and send her to foster care, and destroy my mothers life. My niece lives with me, my mother (her grandmother), and my sister (the aunt). The birth mother (we'll call her the Birthgiver and who is my other sister) abandoned my neice barely at the age of 1 years old to be with her boyfriend.

My father has threatened to send her back to her Birthgiver even though she's EXTREMELY UNFIT and a drug addict. As well as neglectful when she was in her daughters life. My father will not EVER change is mind about the thought process of ""a mother should raise their child"", when clearly she doesn't want to.

As of right now too my parents marriage is basically shit and I wished they have gotten a divorce years ago. My dad favors his other family more, and says we ruined his life. He actually is currently WITH his other ""favorite family"" right now, or as he put it on the phone, ""I'm with MY family right now"".

He comes home tomorrow, and I'm afraid he's going to hurt my mom and sister and niece again. He has in the past and I have proof. I don't know if I should call the cops and give them a heads up about what's going to happen. Because really, I don't know if it'll case more harm than good to my niece. Because there is a GAL (Guardian ad litem), assigned to my nieces case right now for a battle of visitation right for the Birthgiver to see her daughter. Even though we NEVER denied her visitations, but she chose to live her life without her daughter in it.

I need to know. Will this cause more harm than good to call the police about the potential threat of my father ruining our lives, or stay quiet and wait to see what happens?

my job is boring, to alleviate this my friend suggested downloading some chromestore extensions that were crappy flash games. i thought sure, this guy knows WAY more about computers than me, i trust him.

so i played it a little bit, kept me occupied for maybe 20 minutes then i closed it.

later i get home and boot up my laptop, kaspersky warns me i suddenly have a trojan file on my laptop (i have NEVER had a virus or anything on my computers, im usually very cautious) and i freaked out immediately because i know just from the name trojans are bad.

i run my antivirus, remove the file (it didnt infect anything else) and kaspersky says everything is back to normal.

problem is i didnt ""download"" anything today, except add those chrome extensions. my overthinking anxious brain immediately connects the two and i freak out thinking i infected the work computer (a HIPAA violation!!!).

so i rushed back to my work and dug around to find the antivirus and get rid of the trojan, and even manually searched my recent file folders to see if i could find anything.

nothing.

now, i guess this should have brought me relief but its only brought me more anxiety. what if its hidden itself from the firewall/antivirus and now it's wrecking havoc on the company files?

my mom said maybe it was just a coincidence and something downloaded on my computer, and that's why the file was on my laptop and not the work computer... but i havent downloaded anything else i know of today.

i honestly just feel so uncomfortable every time i’m around him. it’s gotten to the point where i look out the window before i go outside to see if he’s there, and if he is, i wait until he’s busy with a task or goes away all together. i’m seriously tired of interrupting a nice walk for a 30 minute “chat”, and then having the rest of the day ruined by my parents arguing with me. how do i tell him no and make it clear enough so he won’t come bothering me every time i’m out of the house, without being a bitch?",07Jun2020,1

30,"Hey, I can guess what kind of advice I’ll get on this one, but I just needed to talk to someone. 

I’m kinda messed up, emotionally. I messaged a guy online offering to send him pictures, when he asked how old I was I said 15 (I’m really 19). He didn’t hesitate, immediately responded with “U horny?” and “show tits”. I’ve been sending him pictures and videos ever since. 

I have a feeling that’s hard to explain, a need to feel abused. Pretending to be an underage girl like this makes me feel that. He’s using me for his gratification, callously indifferent to the abuse of a child and how it could affect me. 

As I said, i don’t quite know why I need to be abused. I sometimes cut/scratch myself, to punish myself or express my feelings. In some ways, wanting to be sexually abused is an extension of that self harm. 

But I think it’s more that in my mind, love and abuse are intertwined, perhaps because my dad sometimes expressed his love in hurtful ways. My difficult childhood left a void, that I need to fill with love and attention. Sometimes I think, I’d be willing to be hurt, if it meant I could to fill that void. 

Those are just theories, really I don’t know why I do this. I do know that feeling abused makes me sad but I also feel like I need it. 

It’s not all bad though. I do feel genuinely excited and aroused when we chat. And his attention makes me feel sexy, when I’m usually quite nervous and awkward. It makes me feel good. 

I kinda swing back and forth from happy to sad about what I’m doing with him. I don’t want to stop doing it, I need it. But when it upsets me, I just need to vent and get some support. 

TLDR: I’m sexting with a man who thinks I’m underage because I want to feel abused, due to my messed up emotions.",07Jun2020,1

I was cuddling the whole night with a friend of mine and i thought something was going on between us 2. Something romaticaly. So i started to lightly touch her and ended up with my hands in her bra. I can almost not remember this but i can remember me saying in my head that i was touching her boobs and that i had the feeling she was fine with it. I didnt saw her the rest of the night and after about 3 hours i went outside with a friend od mine. I sobered up a bit and i started talking and crying about what i did. I also was rll irritating when i was drunk. The day after i messaged her that i was sorry and didnt knew what i was thinking but my whole friendgroup still hates me... I talked to someone whos in the same friend group and he explained me everything. He told me that i was noy allowed to drink again and that i would need to keep my head low. I said to him that i wasnt gonna attract attention and will be primarly focussing on school.

Did i do good at the end and do anny of you guys have anny tios about how i could fix/proces this i am rll scared that im gonne lose my friends.

She intends to quit but another server mentioned that by receiving unemployment during furlough they can no longer ""quit"" without Red Lobster persuing legal action or compensation. 

Is this true, or can she leave without a problem?

38,"We have been really close friends for years and always hang out when I am home from college. We even got matching tattoos last summer. As of lately, every time I ask her to hang out there’s a reason why she can’t. First it was her mom said no (we are both 20 so there is no reason why she can’t leave her house to see me especially because she leaves her house almost every day to see her boyfriend who lives in a different state). 

I think a big factor in her not wanting to hang out anymore is because she recently got a boyfriend. She seems him almost every single day but can’t see me. That is what bothers me. 

I just don’t know how to feel about it. We have always been really close and I love her, but I’m tired of being the only one making plans and putting any effort in. She keeps saying we need to hang out but she always says no or ignores me when I make an effort to. I don’t want to assume that she is being malicious about me asking to hang out, but normally when I ask to hang out she will try to work something out and make our plans work.

- she told my fiancé about her having revenge sex, when she found out her husband cheated
- she tells male coworkers specific things about her sexual past at work

Bob and i had a close bond throughout our childhood  and enjoyed spending time playing games together.
One day, when we were playing football, a game I can no longer stand due to the memories it brings up, and bob suggested that we start doing something else and called it ctc, cousin trust club, in which we do things together that we can't tell anyone else. At first it was mostly normal activities but then he started making them more sexual, at first it was letting him see my penis or making me touch his, which as a young boy I still had no idea what any of it meant, so it escalated until he made me put his, flaccid, penis into my mouth or letting him touch my ass and eventually he wanted to put it in my ass.
Fortunately soon after he started wanted to put it in my ass we moved further away so we didn't play or see each other as often so couldn't.
Now he has a one and a half year old son with shared custody with his ex and we speak once or twice a year at Christmas time or on birthdays, the entirety of it being awkward silence and tension.

49,"So I've been over this many times in my head, and of course I can't break up with her for him, although I wish I could.

About her: She is in many ways a nice person, but she is very demanding, controlling, dramatic and guilttrips my brother all the time.

About him: He has wanted to break up with her for years, but he is emotionally damaged from a very traumatic childhood, and doesn't have the guts. (yes, he's in therapy, but it hasn't helped much)

On both them: She wants children, and he has described having children with her as ""his worst nightmare"". He really wants a dog, but she hates dogs. 

I want them to break up, because I see how negatively their relationship is affecting him. He doesn't have time for the stuff that makes him happy, he is always exhausted, he doesn't sleep well anymore, he has severe neck pain, but he has stopped working out, because she complains if he spends time at the gym. 

Also, he is being unfair to her, wasting her fertile years with him. I know he has told her he doesn't want kids, but I think he hopes she will eventually convince him otherwise, or trick him.

My brother and I have spoken about the relationship many times, but the last year we have spoken less about it, because I don't want his conversations with me stressful.

I don't know exactly when it became like this for me, but it's been this way for a long time. Even if I do something productive or fun like swimming, exercising, or doing homework, it feels like I did nothing and got nothing out of it. It makes me sad and feel like I wasted time. Even when I do something I enjoy, like drawing and writing, I eventually just want to get it over with.

I usually regret spending my time to do different things, even if it wasn't bad. Sometimes I have trouble deciphering if I enjoyed something, I just think, ""oh, if nothing went wrong, I guess it went ok"". For example, I like going to the movies with my family, but when I get home, I feel weird/different, since I obviously don't go to the movies everyday. Thinking about having to go places in the near future like the store or someone's house doesn't make me feel good at all. I always think I could be in my bedroom doing something else. Ironically, just staying home and listening to music feels way more productive for me than homework or exercise, because at least I know that my enjoyment for that is genuine.

While his Mum was shaving their dog (a miniature Schnauzer about 12-13 years old) something spooked her and she fell off the table. They rushed her to an emergency vet and it seems she either broke or badly dislocated her hip. From what he's told me, his parents are asking the question of whether or not she can come back from this. 

There's been no final decision yet, but she's rather old, losing her sight and hearing and at this point, and now she had a severe injury on top of it all, so it's not looking very optimistic right now.

I've only lost one pet in my life (my cat) 8 years ago and it shattered me. Even though she's not my dog, I feel so devestated and I'm getting a bit emotional because I loved her too.  My fiancé and his family will be hit even harder if things go south because she's a part of their family.

So Reddit, how can I comfort my fiancé of they lose her? I know I'll need to let him grieve, but I've never been in this situation with a partner so I'm at a loss of what to do. Any advice?

Ontop of this i did studying and i failed so many tests because i simply had no time to do them. I still passed my semester by some grace of God. My boss was the worst she would scream and yell at us for the most minor of mistakes. Yes we did make some big fuck ups but i was new never EVER Did work like it befor and probably had one day of training. Oh i also had to somehow train new people who came in for a job many left after a while. I got so stressed i cried every day at work, i never at my food and lived on Coffee. One week was particularly bad i got yelled at by my boss every day told how stupid i am because of mistakes i made because i had only been there 2 weeks. My boss also talked to me like i was a invalid.
I cried i was so broken. In the middle of all this drama i got a vag infection had time off but it did not get better i made it worse by treating it with a home remedy and had burns all over. I had to deal with my boss my work my studies my pain all together. I could not even go to the shop with out telling my boss and this is while i am on a off day and still had to do work at home. Then when my vag healed and i felt better i broke out into puss filled blisters on my hand and my buttocks.it was horrible but i treated them with a special herbal ointment and they healed but left scars. After just 2 months of all this crap..i had panic attacks, i began vomiting at work. I just decided i am not going back...i messaged them on the app and never went back. I was done i could not handle it anymore. Since leaving i have had nightmares about working and going back to my job ive had a fear of looking for a new job my fiance looks after me. Its been almost a year now and i still sometimes have nightmares...still have no job and have been studying very hard.  I think this job has left me with trauma and i am scared to get a job in fear of having a similar boss and believe me the only way a new boss could be worse then my ex boss is if the new boss beats me when i make a mistake.",07Jun2020,1

65,So like the caption says I've always hated my home state (Missouri) I find it super boring and it's definitely the cause of some of my depression. A buddy of mine lives out in Washington state and I went to visit him a couple months ago and just absolutely fell in love. Everyone was friendly to me the scenery was to die for. The prices of things like gas and groceries were definitely high but the amount of things I could do and see definitely outweighed the prices. I'm currently a 25 year old I've been doing HVAC installation for 2 years now. I just don't even know where to begin for if I could get a job out there or a place to live? How much should I save up before going out there? Am I overthinking all of this? Any advice is greatly appreciated,07Jun2020,1

71,"Hi reddit.

              So my sleep schedule is messed up, and I’ve only recently been trying to go to sleep without using my phone, but there’s something random that’s keeping me up; my cheek muscles.

              I have absolutely no idea as to why, the muscles in my cheeks naturally bunch upwards towards my eyes whenever I close them. This is really uncomfortable and when I manage to relax them, about a minute later they’ll tense up again. I find it really difficult to ignore it, even when listening to podcasts.

Is this normal? 

If not, how can I stop this from happening?

79,"Hey there! First real post.

So my best friend and I have been friends for at least 5 years now (middle school/highschool) and she's like a sister to me. Our families are best friends, similar interests, all of that. We do everything together and have been through a lot. 

For context: 

This is from over a year ago. I was already noticing things about her character that I wasn't sure I wanted in a best friend. Thinking about: if this continues, I may not be able to stay friends with her. I broke up with an ex and everyone knew: cheerleader/football player type. So my ex told my friend, \*Gigi\* that my best friend, \*Lily\* was hitting him up for streaks on snapchat and they would text. This gets back to me, I say let's see where it goes. The homecoming dance was coming up and a boy wanted to ask \*Lily\* however she told us/anybody who talked about it that if this boy were to ask her to it, she would be annoyed and/or say no. We told him this because we didn't want him to get hurt and he ends up asking ME. We were all just friends and I wasn't and still am not not into him at all. Unfortunately, this left \*Lily\* as the only one in our group w/o a date. We figured she'd get over it, until the next week she shows up at a cheer/football banquet with my ex, completely ignores me, and acts scared around me even though she also posted a snapchat story that my ex was in. I am livid and give myself the day to breathe and confront her the next day, saying ""This is not what a friend would do... this shows no loyalty""-calling her out basically. She eventually says ""It's not like I did this to get back at you or anything"" through teary eyes and I couldn't believe she had outed herself like that. We weren't friends for about 2 months but became best friends again, cuz well... we did miss each other. She apologized and I forgave her. The above was only for context- I do believe she has changed and is better than what she did. But she still did it which could mean it's still in her character somewhere.

2) She has a handful of toxic exes. I have literally taken her phone blocked them, confronted her about getting to the bottom of her attachment to them, trying to get her to realize they are not good enough for her. She's such a gorgeous person and has a dope personality she could literally get anyone, but her exes are trash. Her most recent one has been on and off for years. I've always tried to tell her he doesn't truly care, but then she comes up with excuses for him or for herself and why she continues to talk to him.

3) Theres a guy who has a crush on her and who I have always found quite a good-looking guy. She will not send me his username so I can also see what he posts. I don't even actually want to get with him, I just think he's attractive. But IDK. 

Now to recently: 

I've been noticing more that sometimes, \*Lily\* can be a little inconsiderate/shady even if its not intentional. She makes food for the both of us, and she gives me the burnt piece, rather than give it to herself. I talk about hobbies I might want to get into and all of a sudden she's interested in them too, almost ignoring that I said it first. (which I don't mind doing things together but more obscure things) I try to be someone that other people can go to and trust I am in their best interest, give someone else the bigger piece, the last slice type things. Not that I don't have my faults and selfish mistakes. But I think I set high expectations for others and not everyone thinks that way.

Well, there's a guy that I have been obsessed with for like 3 and a half years. Schoolgirl crush type things but always talking about it and making jokes with my friends, FOR YEARS. I still have a crush on him, but we're older now so I'm not as obsessed in the same way, but it's still a crush I will admit. I get a call from \*Lily\* super giddy, giggling, and excited. 

""Guess who just slid in my DMs!? Like literally guess ! omg!""

""Who?? \*Insert random past boy who's name we've brought up recently\* ?""

""NO! Better! Just guess!!""

""I have no idea who is it??!"" Excited too at this point because it seems like she's happy about it.

"" \*Insert high school crush\* !! Crazy right! He followed me and then sent a message!!""

I tried to not show that it bothered me because I really wasn't expecting it. I didn't think she would say the guy that I've talked about for years. 

So I say ""You mean my high school crush!??!?! THE GUY IVE BEEN OBSESSED WITH?"" 

""hahahaha omg"" 

Now I just feel a bit ignored and like it didn't matter that I liked him. I called a friend and asked if I thought I had made a bigger deal about him but if I actually hadn't made it clear how I thought. But unfortunately, she said she has heard me many times talk about him. So I thought, ""Ok, I'm not going crazy and thinking I didn't make it clear enough because I know I did"". 

\*Lily\* calls back and continues to say how she's finally realized that her toxic ex is not a good person, and how she'd been hoping that talking to him again was going ok and he was becoming a better person, but that wasn't reality. As if, for I can't even tell how long, I have repeatedly told her over again that he's a terrible person and he deserves to be left out to dry. He 100% is immature and she never listened I guess. 

So again, I felt hurt that it feels like she never listens to me. How can you not hear me talk about the guy I've like for forever? How can you call me talking about your sh\*tty ex that I have told you to drop multiple times? 

It's mainly the principle of it all. I don't care about the guy, of course I care a little bit, but not enough to be writing this post solely about him.

So, how can this friendship continue in a healthy way? I seem to be sensing some type of competition forming and I really don't want that. Something is off and maybe it is just me and I should just sit back but I don't know.

Or people who go ""MuH mEnTaL hEaLtH"", even though the event was fairly minor. (Once again, differences in trauma processing.)

And then my friends go off about their anxiety, depression, and ADHD and how it makes them feel, and I feel an itch to tell them to get over themselves. I don't ever vocalize it, but I think it. I'm nice to them about it, but in my mind I'm just going ""stop"". 

I think a part of it may be my work. (I work as a firefighter/paramedic for our city, and even though I haven't been doing it for very long, I've seen some things and that's all I'll say about that for risk of sounding like an emo-medic) and I'm losing patience for complaints about things like anxiety/depression even though they live comfortable lives. 

I feel awful for the lines of thinking I've fallen into recently, and I wanna know how I can get back into being nicer. I may never get back to the way I used to be, but I hate how I'm thinking now, and I don't want to devolve any further than I already have into these thought patterns. I know that if this continues I'll alienate several people who I actually really like.

Sorry for the long story but there is a girl I went on a date with about 4 months ago and she told me after the date that she wasnt feeling any romantic feelings. I liked her though and wanted to give a little more effort in trying to create a spark so I kept talking to her and learned new things about her weve also hungout a couple times since then but my feelings have become stronger like way stronger.

 I dont want to say I love her but It feels like im starting to fall for her a little bit. At one point I thought she was becoming interested because for like a week we were talking alot and one of those nights she told me she was horny and sent me a pic of her boobs and wanted to see my dick. I think I messed up big time here because I didnt know what I was doing and turned her off. We dont text each other as much as we did that week since then but we still hangout sometimes. 

She knows I like her but I dont think she realizes how much. Ive been feeling really depressed about her lately to where I dont feel like eating or doing anything sometimes. My friend said I should just tell her how I feel about her. He said there is nothing to lose and if she feels something after that then great but I know its probably not going to change anything and I know Ill lose her completely after that because im going to need to stop talking to her at that point. I dont know if I should do that or try the no contact thing first and see if she reaches out to me instead of me who is usually initiating. What should I do?",07Jun2020,1
85,"hi um I don’t really ever post on this like this is my first time ever posting and uh I just need help sorry if this is all over the place a lot is going through my mind (pls don’t be mean to me lol)

ok so im a 16 year old female &amp; my mother is bipolar. Since February of this year my mom has been having her “episodes” at first she was just like out of her mind saying stupid crap that didn’t even make sense. She was hospitalized 3 times in the same month (she kept signing herself out) and since then she’s been really easy to ‘set off’. since February she’s called the cops on me 3 times for arguing &amp; physically fighting with her (all fights that she started) and she has a pfa now and i have to go to court bc I touched her. last month i started cutting myself every time i got upset with her or anyone else in the house and they weren’t like small cuts they were pretty deep a few of them I got down to like this purple color stuff after the yellow bubbly nasty stuff (Ik I’m stupid I don’t go to school &amp; I don’t really have a desire to learn)
anyway I tried to hide the cuts from her but she saw them one day &amp; she freaked out. she went to my dad crying and was like “oh my god look at her arm oh my gaahhahd” blah blah and so I was forced to go to the ER. there they wouldn’t stitch them bc (this is what the dr told me) “we like to sew within the first 6 hours”. and then they made me go to a mental hospital. i was in the mental hospital for 3 weeks and I could not wait to get out I literally just got out today around 11am. so after I got out my parents were like “we’re gonna go visit your moms cousin ____ in New Jersey” so I was like ok. like I never met this lady before so I was just like cool alright going to meet family I’ve never met before.. in the car ride there my mom would not sit in her seat correctly and wouldn’t put a seatbelt on, she just sat in the front looking at me in the backseat just staring at me. eventually we get to her cousins house and everything goes good for about 2 hours. her cousin (my aunt ig?) wanted to see my cuts so I showed her them under the bandages and I didn’t bring any to change them so she took me to the dollar general to get some antibiotic ointment and some gauze covering. we get back and my parents aren’t there. When they get back to her house my mom just starts arguing with my dad for NO REASON. Saying stuff like “if you have someone else then go be with her” (all the same crap when they argue) I went outside to go see what was happening and why and my mom started walking away from me and then so I asked my dad “what did I do?” and he got so mad at me he screamed at me “nothing go back in the fing house” so I did. they continued arguing outside for like a half hour and then they came back inside and my parents &amp; aunt decided that I was gonna live with my aunt. I’ve never met this lady before. I didn’t do anything to my mom today. I just wanted to go home and see my baby brother n my cat but now I’m stuck in a different state for god knows how long. I don’t have any of my stuff. Clothes, toothbrush, hairbrush, deodorant.. all my stuff is at my house.. I don’t know what to do I just want to cry but I don’t want to cry in front of people that I don’t know and I kinda want to die. but uh yea um sorry if this is long &amp; like all over the place.. sorry if I didn’t do this right I don’t really think I did it right but I tried typing this kept me from crying I’m gonna go to bed now I’m scared and idk what to do (pls don’t be mean to me)",07Jun2020,1

I'm 19 in community college almost finished 2ish semesters left. Hoping to transfer to UVA
I work in a pharmacy as a technician.
I'm alone tho.
I have three real friends. 
All which are relatively new friends.
My oldest relationship which is my freshman year of hs. 

So I guess I'm a bit antisocial and not really good at relationships I'm really unsure if its my personality or was I raised that way. My mom is very antisocial she has friends but they are very few and most live halfway across the world. My family isn't close like at all. Me and my brother were when we were younger but rn no. My dad has been getting closer to be cause I have been trying to be more involved he's doesn't have the longest future ahead of him. 10 years give or take.  My first friend besides my brother was when I was about 7 or 8 been awhile. I started elementary school late and wasn't really allowed to socialize outside of school. My first friend that I was able to hang out with outside of school was when I was about the age of 10. And we don't talk anymore. I had lots of friends in middle school but they weren't solid relationships. After that we haven't talked. My HS days were full of depression I hated it to some degree and my mother didn't allow me to go out. I have been stuck inside a lot. I remember being a child and supplementing childhood fun with friends by watching TV. And TV has literally been the only solid person with me. Dang that's rough to admit. But I have made friends in HS but they seem to make no effort to add me into their group or ask for my # or just wanting to hang out after school. Rn I'm stuck in a boredom. Have been for a while. I mean it doesn't help I didn't get my first phone till highschool. But my first phone was parentally locked. So yeah not really good for anything. Till about 2nd year of high school was I able to buy my own phone that I saved up for. It was under my control but yeah. A lot of times I am afraid to get into relationship with others maybe cause I don't think I deserve it and am a super piece of shit. I mean after all most of my friends over the years have bailed on me. Which is cool ig. Idk im unsure if I'm toxic to others, myself, or just a dummy. Of course yeah I haven't dated anyone and I attribute that cause of fear but yeah. I'm aware of r/looking for a friend. But rn it's not about friends I need clarity on who I am as a person. I mean I am well aware some people I went to hs don't like me. My friend has asked them why they don't like me but their answer is a vague so idk.

For the past couple of years everything in my head has been negativity, its honestly very dark in there. No matter how many accomplishments I get in high school I always end up shutting myself down with things like “I got straight A’s in high school, but ill probably not do that in college.” Its always been like this for me, Ive never really been able to be proud of myself. Ive always doubted myself literally through everything, and I see myself as less than other people like I don’t think ill be accepted at a good college, with all the amazing people who apply, why would they accept me? This also happens with dating, I never really go for the girl that I like, never really go up and talk to her, for what? They’ll probably just turn me down. 

Ive graduated high school now, I really want to be a medical doctor, but im not good enough for that, not even close. Science, although I love it, were the hardest classes for me in high school. How could I keep up with all these very intelligent people trying to be neurosurgeons, dermatologists, etc. Im not sure I could even clean a floor correctly. Also, im not sure I could manage to learn all the things they teach you in medical school, hell, I got good grades in high school and I can barely remember what I learned in the beginning of twelve grade. I always see people posting how good the did on their USMLE’s and im always like “can I do that?, am I capable of this?” Probably not. I guess thats in a very long time, enough time for me to change.

92,"My best friend(21F) called me a little while to tell me of something she was going to do to get revenge on somebody for bullying her 13 year old brother. I immediately hung up because I wanted nothing to do with it and she told me there was no convincing her otherwise, and the kid she was getting revenge on would be a 13 year old child. She wasn't going to kill him or anything, more along the lines of just scare the living shit out of him by threatening him with a knife.

While I'm super against bullying, I also am super against scarring children for life as I'd imagine is normal. Maybe I'm wrong since I was a little sheltered growing up, but i think somebody showing up in a full face black mask to threaten you could be scaring for a kid. She called me back after to tell me that my abrupt reaction had convinced her otherwise. 

I'm not the queen of morals, but the fact that this crossed her mind freaked me out. She's been on a bad path lately, but I've never thought she was the type to hurt or threaten to hurt a kid. I don't know that she actually would've gone through with it, but it makes me question if I want somebody like that in my life.

Moral of the story is that I need advice on what to do with the friendship - I've questioned how good of a person she is before as she's stolen from friends in the past and isn't always very nice to people outside of her inner circle, but I never imagined she'd be the type to hurt somebody before now. I don't want to be involved in it in the future if it were to ever happen again, but I do love her as she's my best friend and I want to continue to be there for her and to talk her out of doing these things. If anybody has any advice on what I should do, if it makes sense to end a friendship over that, or if you think I'm totally overreacting to what isn't that big of a deal, please please let me know I would really appreciate it! 

(PS: I've questioned ending the friendship over her lifestyle choices before, like the meanness and stealing and general attitude towards life, but have always been able to get past it because she's a really loyal and great friend, just not a great person, so it seemed silly to cut ties over)",07Jun2020,1

Even if i wake up early, do sports, put earbud, if they wake me up by coming back home late and i'm not deeply sleeping i'll wake up and have insomnia.  


I'm looking for tricks, mainly psychological, to try to support it. I'm just looking for a new flat but it's not easy, so in the meantime i would just like to sleep more than 4 hours per night sometimes.   


I know when i'm in specific situations, like in a family / friend house with people i love, i tend to not be that bothered by the noise.   


For now, my technic has been to usually make noise when they do, kicking the celling, anyway it's not transmitting that any noise at my home is transmitted. Kind of a rage, but it help for the nerves.  


The problem is that it's not enough / not the good solution.  


I literally often try to exhaust myself the maximum just to be able to sleep even with some noises one in a while. But it's not liveable especially when the neighbor have a not fix schedle (before they were working and it was silent at night, now they are i guess in holiday and come back at 3.30am things like that, in the middle of the week).  


I even tried to pray, although i'm not religious and not what you would call a strong believer, but it's not working.  


The real problem is that it have enormous consequences on my life. I can't work anymore, i missed important apointment sometimes, when i give up and sleep when i can (sometimes it's in the morning).  


I'm sure there is a way. There is always a way. For now an other thing i need is to learn to have a strong noise in the middle of the process to be deeply asleep, being awake by that, and then, even if you missed the ""sleep train"", having the optimal attitude to sleep the quicker, again.  


I tried to just not consider the noise, wait it stop, and then not moving my body, praying, trying to focus on my breathing when i have other thoughts, keep eyes closed at all time etc but it's not working : when you awake me it's like a new morning and i need to restart the process of getting asleep (at 3:30am).  


So i think next time i will wake up straight, because it's how my body /mind react, do some things, and then re go to bed, because staying in bed is not working anyway.",07Jun2020,1

97,"Hi everyone. 

I'm a 26 year old female and I hate who I am when I'm around my family. I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same. 

I'm from a really working class family and currently temporarily living at home. I'm moving out in two months. I've felt throughout my life that I strongly dislike myself when I'm around my family. They're loud, reactive, overly emotional and overly sensitive. They don't think about things logically and constantly tell me I'm insensitive, cynical, and cold. I don't consider myself to be insensitive or cold--they're just super overly emotional people. 

I've struggled a lot with my class and ethnic identity. I attended an elite university and when I was 18 and left home was the first time I ever realized that most people (or the crowd at elite schools/the ""professional class""/upper class white people) don't speak loudly to each other, constantly argue and get overly emotional over everything. It made me hugely self-conscious over whether I myself had any of these ""less refined"" traits or behaviors. I noticed early on that I did. I worked really hard over the years to overcome some of these things like being overly emotional for example, and now I'm truly not. 

But every time I'm with my family, I sense myself getting worked up over stupid things and generally just being on a different wavelength. For some reason, it makes me hate myself. Maybe because I don't want to go back and be this way. I worked really hard on overcoming anxiety issues and being reactive to being calm and logical. Around my family, sometimes I snap at stupid things like they do and it makes me question who I am. 

I also just can't relate to them because my interests are mostly intellectual in nature, so I try really hard to suppress these interests to not be perceived as elitist and so I engage in conversations about really banal things that I have no interest in which for some reason makes me dislike myself. 

This is a class issue, a cultural issue, and an individual issue. I'm non-white and people of my culture tend to be extremely overly emotional which I resent. Working class folks also tend to be less calm in my opinion and more expressive, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but I've struggled with anxiety issues so the best way for me to be is just in a constant state of calm and rational thought. It's also an individual issue. I've always been more intellectual and can't stand to have shallow conversations, and every time I talk about sports or pop culture or whatever, it makes me cringe--NOT because I look down on these things, but because I can FEEL myself acting, being someone else, and it makes me cringe inside. 

Does anyone else feel this way?",07Jun2020,1

101,"Hello. Throwaway account because reasons..  
As everyone knows, the coronavirus pandemic has forced most of us to practice isolation. I've been no exception, and it hasn't been bothering me too much until now.

I go to therapy with a really good psychologist. He is however rather old, in the age range that puts him at risk of serious injury or death if he were to catch the virus. That's why, for about three months now, we have moved therapy over to video calls. I hate video calls. It's pretty common nowadays to feel anxiety at phone calls and such so I don't think I need to explain how much worse it is when the whole call is you talking about your issues, your vulnerabilities.

Up till now I had been dealing with it quite well, nothing too major had been bothering me and I decided to only talk about more superficial, day-to-day issues that came up and what I learned from them, etc. etc. However, I've come across an issue which I have unsuccessfully tried to ignore until the isolation situation is over. It has won over me though and it is slowly making me feel worse and worse as it goes on. 

It's not a life or death situation. I am kind of reluctant about openly talking about it here. I will however say it relates to lgbtq+ issues and relationships.

What I'm looking for here is if someone can point me to a place where I can just talk to someone. I have very good friends, but none I feel comfortable talking about this to. I feel perhaps the anonymity might help me speak openly about it to someone who'd understand. I found three websites but they all seemed sketchy. Betterhelp is much too expensive for me. I can hardly afford the therapy I got right now, and it's only because I need it. 7cups has a lot of horror stories surrounding it. There was another one I can't remember right now but all of its wording was very loose as if they were trying to hide something.

I'm at a loss on what to do. I'm afraid it might only make me feel worse as long as I don't talk about it to someone. This is really my last resort",07Jun2020,1

TL,DR- I have had the realisation after being really selfish and emotionally abusive to someone I really care about and I am really embarrassed and ashamed in my actions. I realise this has been a behavioural pattern for a while, and I am really disgusted that I am this person and have not seen it before. How do I consciously make a change so I never have to hurt someone I deeply care about ever again? How can I make it right with someone I may have hurt through this pattern




Hi Relationship Advice,

I would just like some advice on how to make some changes to my behaviour, and if there are any good ways to go about it. I would also like suggestions on how I can make something right with someone I really care about so I can forgive myself and let go of the guilt I carry for my behaviour.

A few days ago, I was really mean and not understanding towards a close friend of mine. She always saw the best in me, and while I would never intentionally hurt her, I realised that some of my behaviour and things I was saying to her were manipulative and abusive and it was not right. I was upset over a really stupid dumb thing, she was ignoring me for a few days and I was just so stupid and assumed that I did something and she was just doing it to hurt me.  In hindsight, she did nothing wrong. I was the idiot who made a problem out of nothing, and I created a whole big scene which would have brought her great stress and hurt, which was totally uncalled for and unfair. I have done this a couple of times now, and while I didn’t realise until now what I was doing, I realise I have been abusive.

I am absolutely ashamed and so embarrassed. I really didn’t think I was this type of person, and now after reviewing my actions and behaviours, I realise that I am. I am disgusted in myself and I hate myself for doing something like this, especially to someone I deeply care about and someone who always believed in me. She was my closest friend and someone I could trust. 

I don’t know why I do this or ever thought this, but I always sub-consciously in my head have this you either ride with me or against me mentality, and while it drives a competitive flame in some other aspects in my life, it has also given me this behaviour pattern in which I always hurt the people I care about the most. She is certainly not the first person I have hurt like this, but I really hope this is the last time I ever do it.

Now that I am conscious of it, I plan on working on it with my therapist, and have been looking into strategies on how to release anxiety, and stop overthinking things in my head into problems that are non-existent. I never want to hurt someone the way I have been treating them like thi is again. I never thought I was selfish but really I have always been the most selfish guy in the room. 


I am completely disgusted in myself and I don’t know how to forgive myself. I can’t sleep, I haven’t really eaten and I spend all day feeling guilty about hurting someone I care for a lot in my life. She really didn’t deserve that. I have tried apologising unrelentingly and have told her everything I have realised, how truly apologetic I am and I would understand if she never wants to have any form of relationship with me again and wants to cut me out of her life, however I just feel so guilty. I obviously do not want her to cut me away, I just want her to talk to me, look me in the eyes so she can see how truly sorry I feel. I really never wanted to hurt her, but she won’t respond to any of my messages. There really isn’t anything more I can say, I don’t want to hound her with messages, I kind of just have to accept that I blew it and have to live with the guilt that I hurt someone I really care about and I am a monster.

I just want to be able to forgive myself and find a way to live and cope with my guilt. I really am hurting in myself. I don’t want to be this person. How can I make it right to her and to myself?",07Jun2020,1

I just had a job finished for a fence. We paid for materials (and a bit more) up front, $3,000. Total job cost was around $3,800, materials were $2,800 and I'm trying to figure out how much more i should actually pay him.

The guy started two weeks late, which i was not concerned about. He said he was behind on his other project, due to rain. Got it, no problem. Our project, he said, should only take two weekends.

12 weeks after he started, he finally finished this past week.

He used all of the following excuses for not showing up when he said he would or showing up late: rain (numerous times), flat tire on truck, death in the family, found out his girlfriend is pregnant, COVID, riots (4 miles away), highway was closed, ""my guys decided not to go but didn't tell me"". 

Additionally, numerous times he would say ""i'll be there monday or tuesday"" and then monday would be perfect weather and he wouldn't show up, then tuesday it would rain and use that as an excuse.

He gave us numerous ""I'll have it totally finished by ??/??/2020 date"" and he wouldn't.

Lastly, only 2 days after ""finishing"" I've already had to repair both gates because they were fitted poorly so i had to sand/saw wood off or readjust shit.

117,"My grandmother is a bit of an odd one. She has never been really close to or grandmother like, towards my and sister and I. There has always been a sort of “at a distance” approach.

She doesn’t favour my mother and has done some shitty things to my mother. My dad says this is because my mum moved in with a man at 18 (who cares, why is this such a big deal in 2020?) and had her children before marriage, again who cares? Pretty much all my nephew’s were born before my sisters married (one has no plans to marry) and are doing ok.

My grandmother treats us sort of like guests and visitors to her house. Never totally family. 

When we visit she does feed us but I get the impression that this is a thing done in her time, not really something she wants to do. Because she sometimes give us cheap food I.e ham and fries or cut up frozen veg and spam. She always whines if we don’t eat all the food, so I stopped saying “yes” and I now don’t eat it anymore. She called me a picky eater, but in reality, I’m not, I just don’t like the food she cooks, it’s all very cheap and not nice. My father even made the same remarks when we talked about this privately, so I’m not the only one who thinks it’s rubbish. I do appreciate the fact that she cooks for us, but I gather it’s not something she wants to do but feels she must do out of tradition. 

Honestly I’d be happy with a nice biscuit and tea. 

She gives us money at Christmas and Easter which is kind too. 

Growing up there were various stages were my mum wouldn’t take us because of rows and being ostracised. I always noticed my mum’s sisters would give cutting remarks like “I don’t like that dress” or “you should cut your hair short”. I do think they’re jealous because my mum is much, much more attractive than they are.

It always hurt me how they gave her cutting remarks. I would always but in during my young years and they would give my mother dirt looks, so it did nothing, even though I wanted to slap them for being hateful towards my mother for no reason. 

They still do this, but in subtle ways, for example, not inviting us to all family dinners, ignoring my mums texts etc. (My mum used to cry about this). 

Tbh with you I really don’t know why they mistreat my mum. What has my mum leaving home early got to do with them? I really don’t get it.

Anyway, then comes along my granny’s favourite daughters children.. by god does she do a lot more for them. She has them up constantly and looks after them. My mum told us that she did not offer to look after us or do anything of the sort. I remember my mum asking my aunt to look after us a few times and her response “awk why would your children want to be looked after by me, I’m a boring old aunt”. Well now she’s looking after my young cousins constantly.

So there are double standards there.

Anyway, what raised this ultimately was a change in dynamics after the current situation. I used to go to my granny’s every weekend, I would enjoy the talk  and jokes. But I stopped because there was a blow out about me not eating the food, between her and my mum.

I came back after six weeks, but stopped going again shortly after the pandemic because I thought about her response and realised that she didn’t care so much that I stopped visiting. I then noticed that she didn’t ask about me when she rung my mum. I also had a phone call one day and it was her, she just said “hi can you put your mum on”, she didn’t ask me anything or try to talk to me. My mum asked me afterwards “did she talk to you” and looked disappointed.

I thought “you know she isn’t really that interested in me”.

I don’t know why because I was the grandchild that visited her the most.. yet she seems more interested in these young children who are only into her because of gifts, and my other adult cousins who actually rarely visit her.

I’m somewhat confused as to why this is or why she wouldn’t be bothered about me not visiting after visiting every weekend for years and years.

I don’t get her behaviour or why my aunts mistreat my mother. I have never had that super close relationship with my granny, it’s always been at arms length.

I don’t know if that is normal. But I feel hurt sometimes.",07Jun2020,1

my ex was the one to break up with me, as he didn’t feel like we worked out, and thought it would be best if we split up, we would practically fight every night and it just wasn’t a healthy relationship. 

before me and my ex started to date, his best friend liked me for a while, meanwhile i didn’t know, now we both like eachother but he doesn’t want to hurt my ex’s feelings by asking me out.

134,"Bear with me on this one. I tried to shorten it as much as possible.

I want to start off by saying that I’m not the type to have best friends, I’ve been hurt a lot of times by people that I care about. Because of this I don’t just let anybody into my personal life and when I do I take it pretty seriously.

About a year and a half ago, my best friend told me he was crushing on some girl in our college cafeteria. I went out of my way to befriend her so that I could set them up. She was a theater kid like me and we became really good friends so it wasn’t hard to introduce them to each other.

I mentioned to him multiple times before and after the relationship that I felt like we were drifting and he reassured me that it would never happen and that it wasn’t the case. I was graduating and he was a year under me so i felt like we wouldn’t be able to see each other much now that i was leaving. After almost a year of dating he dumped his girlfriend and basically disappeared. He not only really hurt her but he kind of started blowing me off consistently. He would forward my calls and texts and when we would make plans he would just not show up and I would end up finding out through mutual friends that he was hanging out with them instead. And it hurt a lot. I tried to be understanding and give him space because of the breakup but I feel like he made a negative amount of effort to see me or even shoot me a text or two. This went on for about a few months. And after trying multiple times to reach him and hang out and him forwarding and canceling or giving me really ridiculous excuses I gave up and dropped him. I was going through my own stuff, probably some of the hardest stuff I’ve ever gone through and when I needed him to be there he wasn’t. 

It’s also worth mentioning that because of the way he treated/broke up with his girlfriend (who is also my friend, she said she loved him and he dumped/ghosted her)my friendship with her changed dramatically and I spent most of my free time making sure that she was okay and I hated seeing her that way. He broke her down and I felt so bad, she was really good to him. 

Him writing me off wasn’t the only thing I had an issue with either. On top of that, I found out that he was casually dishonest with me. I asked him if he could set me up with his friend and he agreed to (since I had done it for him), it didn’t work out, crashed and burned. II found out (through a mutual friend) long after that apparently the entire time I was talking to her she wasn’t really ever interested in me and she used to make up wild stories, some of which I still haven’t heard. He let me embarrass myself and continue to try, telling me that it would eventually work and to keep trying because she was DEFINITELY interested knowing that she was calling me a creep and leading me on, etc.

So fast forward to present time, he texts me and tells me that he wants to make up. And that he wants to be in my life. That he feels like I’m making a big deal out of everything that happened and it shouldn’t destroy my friendship with him. I already have trust issues and the way that he was writing me off, the way he treated my friend, and the way he let me continuously embarrass myself in front of his friend really hurt. Am I wrong for not wanting to be his friend anymore?",07Jun2020,1
135,"I’m an introvert with anxiety and I’d be quick to react to stuff

One of the examples are, when friends makes fun of me, or just say something that I feel is being directed to me, or basically just ACT in a certain way to me (facial expression and body) I would feel hurt, sometimes it makes me not wanna hang around with them. 

When a friend at work buys water for his friend and not me, I would straight away think that he hates me and he just don’t want me there. 

I know what I said might sound corny af, but it puts me in a lot of stress emotionally and it does not last for a day, it goes on and on. I’m paying too much attention on everything

137,"So I am in need of some major love/life advice...and my story is a little long so bear with me, but anything would be helpful. 
...
So anyways I was in a relationship with an individual for about 4 years. After my first real relationship ended unexpectedly(death) I was distraught and didn't know what to do with my life. After 4 months I had moved on, getting a job and transferring to a new college to continue my education, while getting ready to move in to the dorm at the end of the summer. That summer I found the person I was with for these approximate 4 years, meeting him at an old friends surprise birthday party. Over the er we hung put and things quickly grew to a new level. Halfway through that college semester I practically moved in and am still living with this person, despite the fact that I ended the relationship. I learned a lot from this person and I enjoyed the ride while it lasted, but i found they are not the perso. for me. I'm still living with this person but in my own room, considering the fact that I've been paying for everything.
.......
Here's where the advice is needed.
So the person that moved in next door, who is also the landlords son, moved in a few months ago. I dont know him that well but this is what I do know.....
The connection I have with him is phenomenal in that there is this energy and vibrations that just feel like electricity running through me. Not only that but I feel more myself with him than anyone I have ever met. And the attraction. It's like a goddamn magnet. 
Issue is he also just happens to be the best friend of the person I just left. 
I dont want to assume anything because I dont really know how this person feels about me but I feel like I want to try with this person.

138,"I’m a sophomore. Let me preface by saying that I’m an okay student. I’m not usually a slacker who doesn’t do anything. I turned in all my work on time this school year and made mostly A’s with a few B’s. I have good relationships with my teachers. 

I’m in a health science academy at my high school. The pressure and amount of work is grueling. I would have around 5-7 hours of homework every night on top of sports and other ECs. I would have to stay up all night a couple nights a week just to get everything done.

This made me extremely depressed and suicidal. I actually had a plan to kill myself on March 15th. Then, corona happened and school got out on March 13th. I was completely burnt out. That day I turned off the notifications on my phone from Schoology and said “F*** it, I’m done with school.” I had the mindset that I it didn’t matter because I could always just kill myself in the future. 

Well, I’m feeling better now. I want to live. I want to have good grades and I don’t want to be held back next year. I logged onto Schoology yesterday to start catching up only to find out that grades close this Monday/Tuesday.  I had assumed that grades closed a week later. I cannot possibly get 5 weeks worth of work in 2 days. I just don’t know what to do. Should I give up and face the consequences of getting kicked out of my academy or held back? Or should I try to explain the situation to my teachers? I don’t know because I feel like they won’t have sympathy for someone who didn’t do any work at all for 5 weeks. I also don’t really want to get into the nitty gritty of my mental health with them. 

I apologize if this shouldn’t be posted here. I just figured another teacher’s perspective would help. Thanks.",07Jun2020,1
139,"So basically, my (13M) brother talks a lot. Monologues a lot, really, because he's not very good at 'conversation'. Whenever he starts talking about something he likes such as video games or Legos, I mentally resign myself to not being able to say a word for the next 5+ mins. He also has very little volume control, something that I attribute to the fact that he's been homeschooled his whole life, so he's always loud. But he didn't talk pretty much at all until he was seven or so and because of that, my parents get mad if I interrupt him or ask him to talk quieter. They believe that it's better for him to talk a lot loudly than never at all. 

He really is trying not to talk so long and I let him know when my attention is wandering and I just can't focus on his monologue anymore, but recently I haven't been able to handle his talking as well as I usually do. 

For the past six months or so, especially when I'm tired, the sound of his voice while I'm trying to read or do another quiet thing in a main room of our house has been enough to give me headaches, or even send me into sensory overload. When that happens, I can't tolerate any sound at all and I usually end up hiding in my room with headphones on (although noise travels in our house so I hear most things even then.) Sometimes, I insist that he has to stop talking because I'm about to hit my limit and go into sensory overload. 

But when I do that, my dad gets really mad at me or my mom suggests I go to my room (even though that doesn't really help) and encourage my brother to keep talking. They rarely side with me and honestly I don't blame them because it sounds ridiculous. However, with quarantine the seemingly constant noise has me on edge pretty much all the time and I really don't know what to do.

140,"(throwaway account because I don't want my parents to know I made this post)

I (21f) just finished my third year of college and have been home with my parents since March due to the COVID-19 stay-at-home situation.

The situation has been OK overall, though I have an increasingly strained relationship with my mother due to her tendency to yell at and overly criticize me for minor mistakes I make. Her yelling stems from anger issues that have developed as a result of her growing up in a dysfunctional family, and I have tried to be understanding of that and remain calm and/or leave the room when she gets upset with me and/or my dad (I rarely argue with my dad or with anyone outside my immediate family, but my mom argues with and/or yells at me and my dad on a regular basis), but it is incredibly difficult to keep my cool when she yells at and/or argues with me and my dad so frequently (typically at least once every other day), and I admittedly have gotten defensive and snapped back a few times (which only makes things worse and results in both my parents getting mad at me).

I often don't realize I have made a mistake until after my mom has started yelling at me, which has only made it more difficult to manage my emotions due to being confused as to why my mom is suddenly yelling at me during what I thought was a civil conversation. To make matters worse, I have found that I am much more likely to forget the mistake I made and how to not make it again when she yells at me about it (I think this is due to my brain blocking out the lessons learned due to their association with bad experiences), which only results in her getting more upset when it comes up again due to her being tired of me making the same mistake multiple times.

In recent years, my mom has also started criticizing me during arguments, saying that I am argumentative, emotional, and over-dramatic, and the constant criticisms have really worn on my self-esteem. She has also often ended arguments by saying ""(insert thing she is currently upset with me for) IS WHY WE ALWAYS HAVE ARGUMENTS."" in a really angry tone, which has made it more difficult for me to grow and learn from my mistakes, and she regularly feels like nobody listens to her. I have tried telling her about how these arguments make me feel when we are both in a calmer mood, only for her to go on about all of the things I need to do to keep her from yelling at me (which isn't always the same for each yelling situation) without pausing to consider ways to keep herself calm when we are having a discussion.

I also have a very difficult time expressing negative emotions of any kind in front of my parents (especially my mom) due to being criticized for it in the past. For instance, my mom has gotten upset with me for crying in the past because she thought I was emotionally manipulating her (her mom emotionally manipulated her during her childhood by crying in order to get my mom to pity her). I have tried to be understanding of her, given her dysfunctional youth, especially since she is gradually learning that crying does not necessarily equal manipulation, though I can't bring myself to feel comfortable crying in front of her until I know for sure my mom won't get upset with me for it.

I have also been dealing with anxiety issues on and off for the past 6 years. I've talked with my mom about this and about how I think I could benefit from seeing a professional to help me work through my anxiety issues, only for her to encourage me to work it through on my own (I've tried multiple coping methods for my anxiety, and they have helped some, but I still have a lot of anxiety issues even with the methods I have tried) and say that therapy is something you pay hundreds of dollars for only to be told the same things you could just figure out on your own. She also thinks I just overreact a lot and doesn't realize the severity of my anxiety issues, and I'm starting to think she probably isn't someone I can go to when I need to talk about my anxiety.

In recent years, I have started reaching out to one of my former teachers in order to get a different and calmer perspective on things, especially for things that I don't feel comfortable talking with my parents about, and I recently told her about my anxiety and issues with my parents. She immediately became worried that I am in an abusive and overly controlling situation due to my mom taking her anger issues out on me (and me feeling like I need to walk on eggshells to reduce the likelihood of her yelling at me), and she urged me to seek counseling for my anxiety through my school's counseling services (very different from my mom's stance of avoiding counseling unless absolutely critical).

I don't think it helps that my mind frequently plays flashbacks of when my mom suffered from alcohol abuse issues during my middle school/early high school years. During this time, my parents had especially bad arguments that involved screaming, slamming doors, and threatening to divorce/separate and never see each other again. I cried in my room almost every time this happened due to a growing fear that my parents would divorce. Thankfully, my mom is now sober, and years have passed since the last time happened. I know this is in the past now, and I really wish I could get over this, but it still affects me to this day and has only increased the strain in my relationship with my parents.

All of this has left me wondering... Is it normal for these kinds of situations to take place with one's parent(s) this frequently? Regardless, I wish I knew of a way to de-escalate these situations for both of our sakes, and I was wondering if you have any advice on how to cope with these situations?

TL;DR: My mom yells at and criticizes me frequently due to anger issues stemming from a dysfunctional childhood, and she has discouraged me from seeking counseling for my anxiety due to thinking I am just overreacting. My former teacher, on the other hand, has encouraged counseling for my anxiety, and has had a much calmer perspective on things in general. Is it normal for one's parent(s) to yell at them this frequently? And do you have any advice on how to cope with this?",07Jun2020,1

(13-16) Lately I’ve been saving up for some books I wanted to read, and my parents were fine with letting me purchase them. And (Please don’t make fun of me for this, my friends and I were only having a bit of fun haha) then my friend group decided to go back and play some of our childhood games. We actually got really invested in roblox again, (though i will admit it was just for shits and giggles) and most of my friends got more robux, made aesthetic accounts for the heck of it. (unruly teenagers am i right?) I really wanted to change my account name, as I had named it something embarrassing years before. Unfortunately to do this you need robux, and I had already changed it before. (I used cash in a store to purchase a gift card.) But now I couldn’t go out to the store and buy a gift card, I’d have to ask my parents to use their card, and I give them the cash. However, they think that everything money is used on that is not study-related is a waste, and won’t provide any growth. Honestly, I just want to have some fun, and the purchase I have in mind is less than £10. That is the equivalent to a couple ice creams. I really need them to trust me with money, not even just because of this. My point is that although I would very much like them to allow me to make this transaction, it’s a little harsh to not let me decide what I want to do with my own £10.",07Jun2020,1

151,"My father and mother are married. I am the youngest and back in October I saw a text message from a woman pop up while alone in a hotel on my father’s phone. I opened it curiously and regretted it. I saw kissy face emojis and “I love you” and he called her by the first letter of her name. (I.E. Goodmorning H! 😘) I panicked because I thought my family was stable and confronting my father about it. I cried and I remember him telling me that the relationship was platonic and that they were just really good friends who had been through stuff together. I didn’t really believe it, but tried to for my own good. I left it alone until spring break where we were stuck in another hotel because Corona was just getting really bad and we were going to go home. My fathers phone was left open on the page where they had been texting. He had informed her of the trip, she called him the “best father ever” and I remember trembling and I began scrolling. Fearing he would walk in and see me, I took a video scrolling up fast. When I examined it I found more of the same: “I love you” “Good morning love” “You’re beautiful” and I found a picture of her in a bikini only. I forced myself to stop and looked away. Last month in early May, she and her husband came to visit us and they stayed at our house for a few days. (They live about 5 hours away, we moved away from the town about 12 years ago.) I observed them and didn’t say anything. I have no proof of any link-ups while they were here, but I did see them talking outside at the pool next to each other. I turned away again and moved on. Now I’m here, and wouldn’t you know, my fathers phone is open on the messages app. The top one is her name, and I knew I was going to regret it but I clicked and saw a nude. I scrolled up and it appeared he had deleted the previous conversation, and the last thing I saw was him saying “What a nice surprise! You’re so amazing 😘” I am now sitting in my room having no idea what to do. Please help as. I am confused and I need help.",07Jun2020,1
152,"About two years ago, I had an epiphany: I wanted to help people, and I wanted to be a cop. It just clicked, it was what I wanted to do unwavering. Now my sister said in a sentence ""what about all then racism?"" my rebuttal was ""I can be one of the good ones, and I can rise through the ranks and enact change"".  


But now, I'm seeing cops in a whole new light. It's just sad. I'm not educated on the specifics but I know the general details of what's happening. Now my question(s?) is do I still want to be a cop? If that answer is yes, will I be one of the good ones (I've heard that being a cop is you follow their ideology)? If that is yes, can I even enact change? If the answer is no, how else can I help people?",07Jun2020,1
153,"Around a month and a half ago I found an item from some guy on etsy. I contacted him through email and he sent me an invoice to pay through PayPal. I was a little sus, but I said what the heck. From my experience PayPal is ""trustworthy"" enough and whatever happens they'll be on my side. I sent him the money and I waited for my item. I was given a tracking number but I soon realized it was the wrong one. It was a tracking number for a purchase made BEFORE mine, even though it delivered to my city. I contacted USPS and they couldn't provide any more details regarding the package so I sent the guy a message. He told me that the right tracking number couldn't be ""provided"" for some reason and to just wait for my package to arrive. I gave him a week and nothing. I messaged the guy and he said he would provide a full refund through PayPal as soon as he could. Another week passed. Nothing. I sent a claim to PayPal and then it escalated to a case. I provided details of what happened saying, I never received the right tracking number and the guy claimed he was going to provide a refund (fucking lie). I waited for like a month to finally get a response from PayPal. I saw that they closed the case and favored the seller because he provided tracking. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE WRONG ONE. I'm seriously so fucking upset right now. I just lost $300+ and PayPal customer service is closed because of COVID 19 so no one is helping me. Is there anyone I can call or anything I can do to get my money back? Anything helps. Thanks",07Jun2020,1

Hi, so I’m using a throwaway account, I don’t really want anyone to know I’ve posted this, not that I’ve told anyone about it really, but the issue is my usernames are the same for most sites so it would be too easy to link back to me. 

So, I’ve been on Tumblr since 2015, and have only ever posted 3 pictures of my face, one in 2015, one in 2017, and one in November of 2019. My blog is fan fiction for a sub-genre of games mostly aimed at girls. For Halloween I did my first ever cosplay as a character from one of my favourite anime, and made the decision to post a face pic on Tumblr of said cosplay, but only a face pic, nothing sexy/provocative, with no tags as well, just something to show my followers, and I continued onwards posting fanfics, January swings around and around the end of the month I get a anon message about the cosplay, I thought it was odd because it lacked tags and was hidden amongst all my other posts, it was short and simple just a ‘u should post more cosplay pics, ———— was super sexy’, I reacted awkwardly to say the least, just basically said it weren’t the vibe I was going for, that I wasn’t really going for this sort of comment, and then that I’d say thanks and take the compliment, where I’m at now I’m not sure if this was a good move or a bad move. 

Skip a week or so ahead, and another message appeared, just another sexy comment about the cosplay, I left it in my asks, didn’t make a comment, just left it there to rest, then the next week, another you’re sexy one, so I decided to block the user, that removed the one anon message so I also blocked the other one, then the next week and this time it had changed started with a comment about ‘going back to my cosplay’ about how it ‘killed them’, the usual sexy remark followed by offer to pay for my nudes while cosplaying and asking if I’m single, another block, and this time I made the decision to turn off anon on my ask box. 

A month and a half of my ask box anon being turned off and I kinda thought I would be okay, after all, it was a few creepy messages for a few weeks why would they carry on? (The reason I wanted to turn them back on is due to writing fanfics a lot of people prefer to request on anon)

A week or two later the next one comes in ‘onlyfans or sexy images please?’ and another comment about me being sexy, this one using my name, which is stupidly part of my username. 

Another block. 

About a fortnight later, the next one came in asking again if I was single, saying that it might seem personal and intrusive, another block, and then I decided to overhaul my blog, changing everything including my username with hope that would stop them from being able to find me at this point. 

And then another came through today, simple asking me for an onlyfans, the thing about all of them is they’re all written in the same way, and progressively making me, more and more uncomfortable especially since I’ve tried everything from the blocking to a name change and turning off my ask box. 

**So anyone got any advice?** I’m creeped and due to it being anon short of getting rid of my blog that I’ve worked to build up since my mid-teens I don’t know what I can do. 

**TLDR- Run a fanfic blog, posted cosplay, started getting creepy anon, blocked and they keep coming back.**",07Jun2020,1

158,I got married in January and therefore had to start paying my own insurance. I think I'm technically still on my moms plan (from her job) but my husband and I want to have an insurance plan together. After inquiring about different plans I got reeled into an ASH plan (allied shared health). It seemed to be similar to the affordable Care act act which is why I wasn't apprehensive at first. We never received our physical insurance cards and the costumer service is really wierd. I was only educated about the structure of big brand insurance in school and my husband and I are young (and still learning ((dumb)). Has anyone heard about this??

162,"My boyfriend (20M) and I (18F) have been together a little over a year, long distance. We felt like it was a risky decision, but we made it because of how we felt about each other. A good time into the relationship, I decided I wanted to move to his country and we planned on it. I’ve been researching moving to his country for over a year now. 

I actually got accepted into the school, but with covid I’m afraid my plans might be put on hold especially in regards to having saved up enough money.  I’ve met my boyfriend in person, and I loved him and loved his country and was pretty firm in my decision making that this is what I wanted to do (I had always wanted to go to the country in question) and I’m a bit on edge about it possibly not happening. 

Right now, I’m trying to remain calm because we are both under a lot of stress and he has a tendency to want to take on my problems, so I’ve decided it best to remain calm seeing as he can’t handle supporting me emotionally at this point. 

Today we had a conversation where he announced he had talked to his parents and decided that if I can’t come this year that we should break up and resume our relationship when I can come. 

He feels this is what’s best for both of us. I’m not proud of it, but I blew up.  Hard. I told him that I couldn’t believe he was willing to give up on me the second that there’s a delay and that I’ve worked tirelessly to make this happen. He responded that he was scared that we’d be bogged down by each other and I told him that if we felt that way, the door was open but that I wasn’t ready for that if that wasn’t how I was feeling and that thus far I never felt bogged down. 

I called him selfish, and told him that he’s speaking for me when he doesn’t know how I feel and that he has really hurt me. I told him that I didn’t want to speak to him for at least a week so I could accept his decision, but that I expect him to understand when I don’t want to be friends. It got intense, but I basically told him I wanted someone who would fight for our future together even with delays and that I won’t beg to keep him if this is his decision. 

He told me his heart didn’t want to leave me, but his parents told him this might not even be real love, and that this could be what’s best for both of us. I mentioned that his parents weren’t apart of this relationship and while I get valuing your parents opinion, I think we should know what we feel is worth it. 

I’ve since told my boyfriend that I do not want to speak for a week and that if this is his decision I need to learn how to accept it. He’s since said if we can’t be friends after, he doesn’t want to split and that he doesn’t want to lose me, but I feel like he’s said so many things that blindsided me tonight. I’m just in desperate need of advice on how to proceed.

Also please don’t comment on how stupid you think long distance relationships are. I don’t care to hear it.

My parents don’t believe in therapists. I also failed a nursing class last semester as a second year BSN student. 

I feel so terrible. All my mother talks about is divorce. I haven’t spoken to my dad (he’s avoiding everyone right now) and my sister is miserable. I go to work and get torn apart for simple things.

167,"So I know this may sound dumb to some,
But I work with this girl. Let’s call her Butterfly. She is incredible. Like everything I could ever want in a partner. She incredibly smart, thoughtful, funny, she has a heart for the work we do, and just radiates this energy that I can’t describe. Not to mention she’s beautiful as hell. We’ve been friends pretty much since I started in October. I’ve always had a bit of a crush on her, but I’ve never known how to approach these feelings. In the past, I’ve been hurt countless times by going after girls who aren’t interested in me. So I’ve kinda developed this complex of having no doubt before I confess my feelings. But I can’t figure Butterfly out. I mean there’s times when I think the feeling may be mutual. We always tease each other at work, people will sometimes say “you guys bicker like you’re married”. Early on, I saw that she noticed and remembered small things about me, but that went away. Then there’s other times I think it’s not mutual. On Valentine’s Day, I got her a galaxy rose and some candy and her favorite drink from Starbucks. All of this info I got from a group chat that we have between my self, her, and another co-worker of ours. That’s our main source of communication outside of work. I put all the things in her locker at work with a card that said “Happy Valentine’s Day from me to you”. She did not respond to this gesture, only a thank you. Which I’m not sure I could’ve asked for more. There’s other things that I could say about our friendship but I’ve already made this post too long.

171,"I’ve worked in a high-end restaurant for about a year now. I started out as a bartender when the restaurant opened and moved up to my first ever management position very quickly. At this point, I’ve been managing the bar for about 10 months. I’m making great money and am genuinely grateful for the opportunity (this is the career path I want to follow), but I’m starting to wonder if the place is worth it. Not to sound cocky, but I’m very good at what I do. In the 10 months that I’ve been manager I have made the bar profitable, had almost no staff turnover in my department, met all my deadlines for menu work, wrote a policy manual for every FOH position in the restaurant (with no help), and kept an absurd wine inventory under control. The employees like my management style and the bar staff respects me. I have full creative control over the bar menu, which is amazing. I get to teach the staff about beer, wine, spirits, and mixology and that makes me genuinely happy. On the other hand, my boss and the rest of the management team undermine me and I feel do not respect me. As far as the other managers are concerned, nothing I say goes unless it has to do with the bar staff directly (I also schedule and manage the hosts), even if I’m the only MOD. I have been hired out from under, ordered out from under (and I’m not talking one or two bottles of Tito’s, I’m talking THOUSANDS of dollars in wine), employees have screamed at me, stolen from the company, and been drunk on the clock and when I have written up or attempted to fire said employees, my disciplinary actions are null. I’m held to a different standard than the other managers (examples include: my schedules are done on Friday and on Tuesday of the next week I might see a server schedule, I ask off weeks in advance, other managers jet off with no notice).
I’m just at a loss. The final straw came when I sat down with the owner (not a silent owner by the way, she works) to go over the assessment I’d done for the bar for the 6 months prior to COVID and she picked up her phone while I was mid-sentence to watch Tik Tok videos and stopped listening to me. This place has taken a serious toll on my mental health (had to be hospitalized in October), but no other bar in town will give me this freedom or pay most likely.

The other problem is that she normally tends to laugh at people proposing to her, she finds it funny and stupid and proposing to her would risk my relation with her, and I really don't want to.  


The real problem I have is that I'm having doubts about if she likes me or not; she's playful but shy with me at the same time, but open to do whatever we find funny, and would normally attend my phone calls at 4 am to read some random fanfic to use as laughstock.

175,"Some background info... my mom and I have a horrible relationship. She has never shown me any love and has always belittled me. She is incredibly annoying and difficult and i’ve cut her out of my life. She is also incredibly irresponsible with her money and very immature. Dads out of the picture. My brother has a mental disability but my mother never had him properly assessed so I don’t know what his diagnosis is. All she has ever told me is that he was born with the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck. To me, it seems as though he has autism. He is incredibly loud and immature, he has definite social impairments and is generally socially unaware and inappropriate. Fortunately, he is fully verbal, able to shower himself, use the bathroom, make basic meals, etc. He can’t drive and he lives with my mom. He can hold a part time minimum wage job but has gotten fired in the past due to inappropriate behaviors. He is not able to live on his own and he can’t afford to do so. He’s 28 and I’m 27. 

I feel horrible saying this but I can’t stand him or my mom. He is incredibly annoying. Just as an example, he will call me and my wife 50 times if we don’t answer the phone until we do. My wife and I make an effort to see him about once a month despite the way I feel about him. I am also disgusted with my mom for never seeking out proper treatment for my brother like social skills training or OT. 

It’s not so simple for me to bring this up to my mom as we have a strained relationship and I try to avoid seeing or talking to her, but I don’t understand what will happen to my brother when she passes. I am 99% sure she isn’t doing anything to plan for that and is not setting aside any money. When that time comes, I don’t feel it’s my responsibly to take care of my brother financially. Group homes cost around $3000 per month. And I refuse to let him live in my home and become a burden on my life. I know how selfish it sounds, but I didn’t ask for this. I didn’t ask for an irresponsible mother who likely isn’t even preparing for this financially. 

What options does my brother have once my mother dies if I refuse to cover his living costs? I have no idea how that works. If anyone has any idea I would truly appreciate it. If I’m posting in the wrong sub please let me know and I will repost elsewhere. Thank you in advance.",07Jun2020,1
176,"So I didn’t exactly know where to post this, I wasn’t sure if this was too much of a loaded question to be asked here. I hope this works because i desperately need advice and help and have needed it for basically my whole life. 

I’m not going to write down my whole life story here, so I’m just gonna say this. Recently its come to my attention that my parents have been neglectful in certain ways my whole life and that this environment that im growing up in is entirely unhealthy and it’s gotten to the point where my mother made me want to kill myself again after a long time. 

Ive always hated my life here but I had to learn to deal with it because I was too young and stupid and didn’t know any better. Also I was conflicted as to whether im being treated okay and if it was worth it to be moved away knowing that I had a home and parents who bought me stuff that i wanted sometimes.

But recently my mom admitted something to me that changed everything and made me realize that she is deadass neglectful and selfish and is causing me mental distress to the point that i want to either kill her or kill myself. Im not gonna get into what she said or what ive had to deal with. The important thing is that I finally realized that if i want to survive and have a chance at having a decent life i need to take charge and something needs to change.

On wednesday im going to see my family doctor so he can operate on my toenail (its ingrown, not important at all) and ive been thinking and im going to give him the gist of the situation and ask him to get me in contact with somebody who can help me.

But my question is this: with everything thats going on at the moment, would it be realistic for me to be able to get in contact with someone to give me professional advice on this and come to a decision and actively build a case for me and have me finally taken away from here? Who would i even talk to about that? And if it turns out that i can make that happen, should I? Because i have no job, have lost all social skills, and have no clue what to do with my life or how ill manage. On the other hand the situation has always been bad but right now its gotten to the point that i want to kill myself again and this time I KNOW it wont get better unless i get out of here. So im not sure that i should just suck it up and deal with it until im older and can support myself, because im hitting my breaking point. 

Im scratching the surface here but honestly my life is so bad right now and its been shit for so so long and its still been able to get even shittier and shittier as it goes on.",07Jun2020,1
177,"Hi all. I am making this post as a last resort for some advice. Even beginning to type this is terrifying for me because I always push these thoughts away. 

I (19f) have been with my boyfriend (21) for about three years now. We love each other deeply, in ways I have never loved another person. He is my best friend. He is handsome, sweet, an absolute musical genius, incredibly intelligent and witty, and has a goofy sense of humor. I can always run to him with every hang up in my life, and he’s always there to make me feel safe and loved. And, of course, I  reciprocate that for him, because I love him and care about him deeply. For that I owe him everything. Our lives have become deeply intertwined over the past few years. His family and my family are very closely connected, we both share the same friends, etc. From the outside we are your typical couple - we play games together, have long and interesting talks about everything under the sun, we have similar interests, and we really do make each other happy. There’s just one issue with our relationship that I can’t run to him with, and that I don’t know how to fix. 

He is not a woman. 

I have always identified as bisexual, and I have known that I have always leaned toward women (both romantically and sexually) rather than men. But lately I’ve been questioning my sexuality again, and I think I’m just a full-on lady lover. 
My boyfriend and I are often very intimate, and while I enjoy this time we share together, I don’t find myself feeling satisfied. I have come to believe that I am fulfilling him sexually to make him happy and for no other reason. I don’t think I really get anything out of it. 
As far as other intimacy goes, we always cuddle, and I very much enjoy being physically close to him.
However, despite my love for him, I find myself thinking about women obsessively, all the time. . I love everything about girls. They’re soft, beautiful, sweet, gentle, poetic creatures. All I want in the world is to hold a girl’s hand, kiss her, run my fingers through her hair, run away and live on a gorgeous blueberry farm and sing to her and adopt a cat and holy fuck I’m terrified and I don’t know what to do. 
I’m terrified because he is all I have ever known as far as serious relationships go. I’m terrified because I don’t want to hurt him, or betray him - he suffers from serious depression and I’m not sure if he could bounce back if I left him. To be honest, I’m the one source of stability in his life. It would destroy him. And I just can’t do that to him. 
The guilt is destroying me. I feel guilty because he’s so fucking perfect. He treats me like his everything, because to him, I am. I feel guilty because I think about women during sex. When we kiss. When we hug. I feel like I am living a lie. At this point I am just wishing that he would leave me so that I don’t have to do it to him first - selfish, I know. I feel so fucking selfish. 

I love him, I really do. I just don’t think I could love him the way he needs and deserves to be loved. I want to do what makes me happy, but I can’t hurt him like this. I don’t know what to do. 
I don’t know if I could ever work up the courage to tell him how I really feel.",07Jun2020,1
178,"Hey there reddit, I’m looking for some advice on a situation that happened a couple weeks ago. I just can’t shake it off, and I feel like a huge entitled jerk for being upset. 

A couple weeks ago was my birthday, on that same day I had surgery. I spoke to my friends multiple times throughout the month about how it’s going to be an odd birthday, and how I’m looking forward to it. This surgery wasn’t cosmetic, but a medically necessary one to reduce pain and improve my quality of life, so needless to say I was pumped. 

The day comes and I get out of the recovery ward early afternoon and let them know I’m alright. We talk a bit and I nap on and off. That night comes, and eventually early morning (around 3/4am), and I mention how this was the best bday present I could have gotten. 

One friend is immediately apologetic about forgetting and wishes me a happy birthday. The other one posts a couple gifs wishing me hbd. The third is asleep, as it’s nearly 2am where he lives. 

The next day comes and he doesn’t say anything, nor the day after. I don’t want to remind him because I’ll feel like a dick so I just let it go. 

I know that I shouldn’t feel upset, because god knows they were worrying about my surgery and hoping that I was alright. 

I think I’m upset because I put a lot of effort into their birthdays- I say it at midnight in all their time zones, I search hard for gifts I know they’ll like or have one personally made, and I try to make their day special even though we’re far apart. I would never expect them to do the same for me because it’s honestly silly, and they have more important things to do, nor do I expect presents or anything of the sort. 

How do I approach expressing to them that forgetting my birthday upset me? Or should I just let it go at this point? We’ve been friends for 5+ years now and they’re practically family to me.

181,"I quit my job this week due to poor handling of a situation at work. I worked at a sheriffs office in a small county as a Court Security Officer. On my last shift me and other officers were discussing politics and it came to the recent situation involving George Floyd and protests. One officer began to go on a rant about how this wouldn’t happen over a white person. I stated that while that would be just as awful, white people are not going through systematic oppression like black people are. This resulted in him using the n-word. Another officer joined in to add “there’s a difference between black people and n-words” but used the slur. This officer is the sheriffs father. I reported these actions to the sheriff to which he agreed the usage was wrong. But he seemed to be more upset that I “advised” a senior officer that he couldn’t say something. Which I did tell the officers in question they should not be using language like that especially while in uniform and on duty. He also compared the usage of the “n-word” to “bitch” which in his opinion is “another bad word.” I promptly resigned due to the lack of action from the sheriff.

186,"Hello y'all. 

So I used to know this friend of a friend (lets call M) who had an extensive collection of ball jointed dolls (go ahead and google it), and it was a hobby my friend and M shared. It's some weeb shit, but they're neat.

around 11 years ago, I was leaving the city I lived in with these folks to go to university in another city. He and my friend had a falling out, so we were hanging out together and he was unboxing some of these new dolls he got in the post. We're talking $6k dolls that are around a yard tall. It wasn't (and isn't) really my thing, but i commented on how beautiful they were (because WOW the artistry). He offered to ""let me hold onto one"" of these super expensive dolls, and I kind of pushed back because ?????? but he insisted, so I told him I would get it back to him sometime when I returned to the city.  He had the other components (it has a second set of legs that were hooves?) so I hadn't intended on holding onto it.

We kept in touch for a little while, maybe a year after that - I still had this doll and some of my classmates at uni were into it and knew how to airbrush, so I had asked him if we could do extremely light airbrushing on joints and he seems cautions but fine with it. 

....aaaaand thats the last time I took it from its case. 

Folks, I've been gently carting this three-foot-tall, VERY niche and VERY expensive doll in a padded case for over 10 years and I'm OVER it.

maybe around 6 years ago, I started really not wanting this damn doll around, so I began asking around if anyone had his contact information. Its like this mf dropped off the face of the earth. I'm sure hes moved on from the crowd we knew because they were pretty toxic at the time, but no one so much as has this guys number. I'm moving to Europe soon though, and I CANNOT bring this damn thing with me.

so, it's been 10 years. And even now I feel it would be super unethical to sell the doll. He has the other leg set as well, so idek if collectors would be interested in it since its missing components. I know its limited edition, but I have no idea what brand or model or whatever. I don't know what this is or what its worth. also.... it isn't mine to sell.

some of my friends are telling me I should just sell it, and that ten years later with no contact probably means he doesn't care. but I don't know how comfortable I feel with this.

So. Should I keep sleuthing or should I sell it?",07Jun2020,1
187,"So... over a month ago, my friend and I planned for me to drive 5 hours to see him (10 total hours of driving and my gas money because he can’t drive). I haven’t seen him in person in three years, so I was really excited, but now I’m really conflicted. 
Last year, I ghosted him after he refused to put any real effort into our relationship, but a few months ago, we reconnected. Soon after, I fell in love with him once again. It was good for a while, yet, recently he’s showing to lessen the amount of effort he’s putting in once again. For example: I had tried calling him for over a week, nothing. He would only text. Finally last night he has time to talk and 20 minutes in, his brother’s friends come over and he dips. Another turn off is that he is constantly posting videos of him and his “friends” hard core smoking pot. I’m not against it, it’s just that he so obviously wants attention on his bong skills. It’s just cringe. So, the trip is next weekend and I just don’t want to go. I mean, I do, but I don’t.. any advice for a confused girl? I don’t want to say “hey I’m not attracted to you anymore and you’re super cringey” because I still like him as a friend, but I also reaaaaally don’t want to waste my time and money seeing him.

192,"I don’t think I’ve ever heard my parents say “I love you” in my entire 20 (F) years of living. I’ve never seen any type of affection between them, even hugging. I think they only got married because my mom felt like she had no other options? I honestly don’t know, I don’t want to ask them any questions about their early relationship.

Just for some background information my mom is very...set in her ways. She tends to be very clean and is into eating healthy, buying organic foods, and more recently into buddhism (which is kind of funny and you’ll see why as you read on). She has a Type A personality for sure. My dad on the other hand is pretty laidback, not as neat and organized, and can be a bit clumsy. A Type B personality. 

Ever since I can remember, they have always fought. I think back to my earliest memories and I remember hearing the sound of my mom breaking plates in the kitchen (she used to do this because my dad has a fear about broken glass) while screaming at my dad. Their personalities don’t mix AT ALL and since they live together, fights occur almost on the daily. Their fighting always consists of my mom confronting my dad about something he did (buying bruised fruit, not washing certain dishes properly, not communicating well, etc. which always seemed small to me but I guess years of it has bothered my mom extremely). My dad would try and explain his thinking behind whatever he did and my mom would end up berating him calling him “stupid” “r*tarded” “an animal” and so on (this is why i think her recent interest in Buddhism is funny). My dad rarely would yell back because that’s not the kind of person he is. He would then try and ease the situation by saying “I’m going to try and do better” and my mom usually replying something along the lines of “But you’re so fucking stupid I know you won’t and I’ll get mad again. Sometimes I think you do these things on purpose to make me upset because I can’t imagine anyone being this dumb.” 

Separately, my mom tends to have very little patience in general. The amount of times I have felt embarrassed while shopping with her is far too many because of the way she will talk to retail workers.

Seeing this kind of behavior from my mom throughout my entire life has had a negative impact for sure. We don’t have the best relationship, it’s constantly up and down, and usually based on whether or not she’s currently upset with my dad because I usually get angry at her for treating him this way.

So today I told her very calmly how I felt. Basically that it upset me to see them fight and specifically, how she dehumanizes him a lot as she says “he has a lower DNA type than me, he’s a completely different species from me.” She basically said that she doesn’t feel bad or sorry at all for any of her actions towards him. She said he deserves it. She then called him into the room so it was the 3 of us. I told her she didn’t have to yell at him all the time, that she could address these issues in a calm manner but she said “I’ve tried doing it that way and he never learns, so at least when I yell at him I get to punish him for what he’s done to me.” She also took what I said about calmly addressing the issues as “Oh, so you’re saying I should k*ll myself? My personality, my interests and just take this kind of behavior?” I then told her these fights have a negative impact on my and she turned to my dad and said “See what you’re doing? You act dumb, which makes me mad, which hurts the kids so you (my mom referring to my dad) are the one hurting the kids.” She also added that her actions and behavior is actually her holding back some of her anger because my dad apparently makes my mom so angry that she could k*ll him. Ultimately, me speaking out about this did nothing but maybe make the situation worse, as now I feel that my dad feels he’s to blame for everything.

And as for them getting divorced, my mom wants to but we just don’t have the money for that. She’s hoping to get divorced in 2 years after my sister goes to college.

I hate living in this environment because it has a negative impact on me mentally. I am constantly anxious and have fallen into bad coping habits again. I’m too embarrassed to talk to my friends about this because it’s so insane. So I keep to myself but I am so overwhelmed. And with everything going on, the pandemic, the BLM movement, I feel like I shouldn’t complain because I am fortunate enough to have a roof over my head and my dad is still employed.

I don’t know what to do at this point. Speaking out about how I feel didn’t work, and I’m afraid by staying silent my dad thinks I have sided with my mom. I feel so lonely.

198,"  My whole life I have known that I have a unique Gift. It has been readily apparent for as long as I can remember that I have an extraordinary mental aptitude, specifically for learning, speaking and communicating complex and nuanced subjects. Over the course of my life nearly everyone who has gotten to know me personally has told me in some way that I have a unique gift and that I should use it. The importance of not wasting my gift is always stressed in these interactions. Yet I feel like I have been running away from it. I feel that I have been running away from my destiny; running away from who I truly am. 

As a result of much inner work I have had the very apparent realization I have a deep fear of my own greatness, my own ability, of my own power of expression in this life. I have only expressed my unique innate ability over the years occasionally in small amounts such as whenever I have had the opportunity to speak in front of a group of people, when I am in deep conversation with friends or when I share a profound insight online. The response has always been overwhelmingly positive. However, thus far in my experience of life the expression of who I truly am has been limited to small spurts. As a result this has created a significant disharmony within myself. I can feel the constricted energy in me every day. I can feel how the flow of it is blocked and it is painful mentally, emotionally and sometimes physically. I know who I truly am and exactly why I chose to incarnate on this specific planet. Over the past 6 years on my path of spiritual awakening I have had multiple nondual unitive experiences and yet I still run from my True Self. Why is this? 

I know that this subconscious fear of my True Self is a result of a core subconscious belief or a faulty definition that I have been operating with. My question is what core belief or definition do I have that is causing me to fear my own ability and greatness in life? 

Whenever I have expressed my gift for speaking and communicating knowledge, afterwards I will be overcome by a feeling of, “there’s no way you could possibly live up to that”, I feel that I subconsciously relegate my residual self-image to something that is small and meek, unable to inspire others and live a powerful and truly profound existence. The feeling is of not being good / skillful enough or being unworthy. It is almost as if I am subconsciously repressing the expression of my True Self. This is infuriating and makes no sense to me because on a deep level at the core of my being I know exactly who I truly am and why I am here. 

I can feel the resistance in me even as I write this; as if some part of me does not want me to find out and let go of whatever core belief or definition is causing this inauthentic and constricted expression of myself. I feel that this is the biggest obstacle that I have to full self-actualization. I feel that whatever core belief I have that is generating the fear of my own greatness is causing me to subconsciously self-sabotage and place myself in undesirable circumstances so that I do not fully realize expression of my gift in life and thusly keep the current fear based ego configuration and remain small and inauthentic in my expression in life. I feel that this will continue until I stop fearing my own greatness, until I stop avoiding my destiny, until I live fully as the expression of as who I truly am in this life. Why am I so afraid to be me?",07Jun2020,1

[F26] [M28] This is about my close friend. I know I should stay out of it but she told me about the whole situation and doesn’t care that I know and I’m just curious about everyone’s opinions.

So my friend met a guy on tinder three months ago two months in they became official. Going good at first but after like a month and a half in he started not hanging out as often. Most of the time he would use his depression and anxiety as an excuse (which I get depression and anxiety is hard but all the time 24/7 I don’t think so?) why he couldn’t hang or she would make plans and then he would agree to go and then when the day for supposed plans came he ignored her for the rest of the day.

Sometimes he would tell her he is going to shut off his phone and wouldn’t talk till tomorrow or make excuses when he didn’t text for a while that he was sleeping (apparently has a sleep disorder) then April they saw each other once the first week. Then the rest of the month he never would hangout. He always would say his depression was bad, he fell asleep or ignore when she would ask him. 

But then she told him if he wants to be together that he can’t go months without seeing her. So he says he wants to be with her and to not leave him that he knows his anxiety and depression are bad and he’s working on it. So she waited respecting his mental health and then 4 weeks he finally saw her again (her words, “only because he’s on a weed high so that makes him more outgoing and feel like he can actually get out and do things”.) then he came and hung out after that for 3 days in a row. 

Then this past week he came to see  her again and they planned to go hiking this weekend. She said he agreed but had to bring his dog. Then he came over three days ago to spend time with her again and he still planned to go. THEN out of nowhere yesterday he blocked her number, snapchat and she found him on tinder when he had told her a month ago he deleted his tinder account completely. (She made a new tinder by the way to see if he truthfully deleted his or not. I was with her back when she deleted hers when she thought they were for sure official) She even had her friend text him and see if he would respond to her about what was going on and he didn’t respond to her either.

218,"Throwaway account. 

With all the attacks on journalists in the last couple of weeks, I am afraid to keep reporting the news. Police are targeting us directly, sources are being more and more hostile and it no longer feels safe to do this work. 

I feel torn about this for a few reasons. 

I like my job. I like talking to people and I like telling their stories. I like that my one small sliver of talent can really help someone. 

I started a new job as a reporter in a small town a month ago. Things are not as crazy here as they are in the cities. That said, there are protests here, too. People are showing up to them armed. A couple weeks ago, at the COVID-19 protests, people were screaming at one of our reporters that it wasn’t a protest. There were a ton of people with guns and signs, but sure. No mask, no self-control, completely in denial about their actions. 

Online, in local Facebook groups, people are justifying the armed groups. They call us liars. They really got mad when a reporter wrote that the armed people were “counter-protesters.” Again, the armed people showed up specifically in response to the protesters. 

The barriers and boundaries that used to exist are gone now. It used to be I could walk into an event and be treated with respect. Now, people treat me like I am the face of CNN and not a small-town newspaper reporter. I am The Media, not somebody who lives there. 

I got into journalism by accident. I like to write and wanted a job that would let me do it consistently for money. Seven years ago, I moved to a small town and there was an opening at the local paper. I liked the job then, but I’ve become more jaded by the year.

I’ve worked at three different papers and the last one really did a number on my self-esteem. Long story, but the short version is: bad management. Now that I’m at this new paper, it’s hard to tell if I just need more time to adjust and for the world to calm down a little or if I am just permanently stuck in this place and news is no longer the right career for me.  

I take being objective seriously and I try to bring compassion to every interaction I have with the people I write about, whether I agree with them or not. I care about this work and about my town. 

But I don’t have that same attitude a lot of journalists have that seems to drive them. The one that makes them jump up to chase a cop car.  I imagine it’s more common in people who have journalism degrees, which I do not. 

I wanted to write. I get to write. I do it well, at least according to the people who hired me. But those people who really get into the field for the right reason? I’m not so sure that’s me. 

Financially...we’re okay. In case anyone here is under the impression that journalists are swimming in money: I make $17 an hour. No overtime. That is the most I have ever made. 

Our budgets are being slashed and like newspapers everywhere, people are being let go. I’ve been told that I am safe from that, for now. 

Regardless, my spouse has a good job that would cover our expenses until I found something else. He wants me to stay on for a while longer, but says he will support my choice if I need to quit. 

Because this town is so rural, and because the paper is struggling, I worry that if I quit, they won’t be able to replace me. 

I also worry about looking for work in this job climate. 

...and I seriously worry about dying on the job. Since the protests started, I have not been able to sleep. When I do, I leave the lights on. I have cried nearly every day. 

But. I am not a person of color. I’m scared, but I’m a very unassuming-looking white woman. I can walk away, but a lot of people with more to lose don’t have that choice. 

Further, I know that I will tell the stories of locals objectively. If I’m not there, will my replacement be so careful?

I’m really scared. I want to be thoughtful and do the right thing. I just wish I knew what it was. Please help me.",07Jun2020,1
220,"Essentially, I know that we do not mix romantically. We have fights over important relationship things and he constantly challenges some of my core values, the sex has always been terrible and every time we do it, we end up pissy and upset. Not to mention, he cheated on me two years ago but only told me one year ago. At the time I had a lot going on mentally and just forgave him because he’s always so supportive and I didn’t know what I’d do without him. Now he’s talking to her again because he “wants to be friends” with her and she’s moving nearby. It hurts and he said that he would break it off with her, but she was also a family friend and it doesn’t change the fact that he did it. So by all accounts I SHOULD break up with him. 

But he’s also my best friend. 

He’s the only person who I can share a random million things throughout the day with and respond every time and be excited about it. Like dog photos, good food, a random thought, anything. He’s always there for me. He’s not afraid to come to me either. And we work well together like that. He’s the only person I can be myself around.

And I’m going to miss that, having someone I can so effortlessly confide in and act myself around. Not to mention, I’m scared I won’t find anyone else who I can be myself around. I’m hard to get to know at first since I’m either too closed off or over sharing and have a traumatic past with men starting from when I was a child. 

By the same token, I know I’m leading him on by keeping this going although I can’t envision a future with him. I’ve heard from mutual friends that he wants to marry me someday (not anytime soon as we are still in college). I can’t play with his feelings cause I don’t want to lose my best friends but I’m also so scared of losing him as that friend. Because I will have to. 

So yeah, I need advice on what to do/how to do it because I’ve bothered my friends and family with it a lot the past few days. And they’re biased.",07Jun2020,1

So due to the Quarantine mass gathering is off limits, obviously, so church is basically closed for big groups. Missionary quarantine themselves to protect themselves and  others when it started hitting here in the states. Stay at home is now over, there a bit more freedom to leave the place they staying at. However to prevent the spread anymore to the missionary and the people they meet(try to meet lol) to teach. the church has told them to not interact others ,knocking on doors,(yes I know the annoying church folks that knock, but hey people never know that it might be something they want dive in more and have in there lives)or community service. They can met through video and teach. But considering how difficult it is meeting people  in person to teach already, calling or texting to have a session to be ignored, say can't make it at agree time.

To make things worse, I’m freaking out because I’ve gained weight and I don’t want to show myself to anyone when I have to go to my school. Lately I’ve just been eating a ton and then not eating anything after. It’s this horrible cycle of eating and starving. This takes up 100% of my time. I can’t do anything else.

I've never felt like this before but I've been hearing more of it recently, and the social pressure makes me feel bad.

I tanned once when I was 17 and I didn't like it, I looked orange and all my skin looked the same tone, uniform, which is kind of weird and unnatural. People with natural dark skin have different skin tones on their abdomens, arms... Also, now that I'm in my 20's aging is starting to become visible and the time I tanned definitely made it worse because after I tanned I suddenly had some facial lines, red and white freckles and skin defects I definitely didn't have before.

I just don't want to fuck up my damaged skin anymore because of a trend but the social pressure is strong and apparently people casually commenting that ""you should tan to look prettier because pasty skin is not"" with those exact words is socially acceptable.

So I didn’t exactly know where to post this, I wasn’t sure if this was too much of a loaded question to be asked here. I hope this works because i desperately need advice and help and have needed it for basically my whole life. 

I’m not going to write down my whole life story here, so I’m just gonna say this. Recently its come to my attention that my parents have been neglectful in certain ways my whole life and that this environment that im growing up in is entirely unhealthy and it’s gotten to the point where my mother made me want to kill myself again after a long time. 

Ive always hated my life here but I had to learn to deal with it because I was too young and stupid and didn’t know any better. Also I was conflicted as to whether im being treated okay and if it was worth it to be moved away knowing that I had a home and parents who bought me stuff that i wanted sometimes.

But recently my mom admitted something to me that changed everything and made me realize that she is deadass neglectful and selfish and is causing me mental distress to the point that i want to either kill her or kill myself. Im not gonna get into what she said or what ive had to deal with. The important thing is that I finally realized that if i want to survive and have a chance at having a decent life i need to take charge and something needs to change.

On wednesday im going to see my family doctor so he can operate on my toenail (its ingrown, not important at all) and ive been thinking and im going to give him the gist of the situation and ask him to get me in contact with somebody who can help me.

But my question is this: with everything thats going on at the moment, would it be realistic for me to be able to get in contact with someone to give me professional advice on this and come to a decision and actively build a case for me and have me finally taken away from here? Who would i even talk to about that? And if it turns out that i can make that happen, should I? Because i have no job, have lost all social skills, and have no clue what to do with my life or how ill manage. On the other hand the situation has always been bad but right now its gotten to the point that i want to kill myself again and this time I KNOW it wont get better unless i get out of here. So im not sure that i should just suck it up and deal with it until im older and can support myself, because im hitting my breaking point.

251,"Please don't say anything about me being a simp. That was old behavior.

I'm gonna put the tl;dr up here.
Screwed up a friendship, drama happened, friends changed dramatically and that lead to many arguments and friends being lost.

Now what I want advice on is on how to cope with these feelings, which I will explain later.

First, some context. (I don't want to hear stuff about meeting people online. You can meet some very genuine and nice people online.) I'll keep try this as short as I can, but basically I met a girl on discord, who I simped for. (Don't attack me please.) I'm also friends with a few of her friends. There are about 3 of our mutual friends involved and 1 of their friends (I am not friends with this last one.) My simping continued after the girl I met got into a relationship. (Stupid, I know. I had a disorder called Obsessive Love Disorder. You can search it up.) Eventually, I was confronted by 2 of our friends and I stopped some of my behavior. It lingered slightly, and I was confronted again, by everyone mentioned previously this time. It was a lot of telling me what not to do and stuff. So, I stop contact with said friend because that's what I was told to do. In the discord server, I was previously a staff member but was booted and replaced by their friend who I was not friends with. (I don't do posts like this often so sorry if it gets confusing. You can ask for clarification.) In the server, we had previously changed our nicknames to Sailor Moon stuff. For example, mine was ""Sailor Sol."" This time, they added something afterwards, such as ""Sailor Sol: The Speed."" Apparently the friend I was previously simping for had done this again, however I saw some of my other friends doing it and joined in. I was accused of doing this to get her attention and was admin-abused by the person who replaced me in staff, who was constantly changing my nickname to ""Stop copying,"" even though he himself copied the nickname and despite me having stopped my behavior and cutting off contact. (He does this again afterwards, when the owners put ""issa"" in the beginning of their nicknames and he does the same. I don't know what the joke was but he was copying them.) He also has broken the rules several times when I searched his messages (racial slurs, disrespect, etc). An argument ensues because of his abuse and eventually, the friends who were against me start turning against this person.

Fast forward a few days. The people who confronted me were my friends now, but the girl I simped for and her friend were getting into arguments with them. The guy told one of them to kill themselves and the girl was acting overall toxic, calling them insults and even banning them from her servers. The point is that now, they're gone from our servers and we all (besides her ex-girlfriend) hate her. 

I'm conflicted between hating her and wanting her to come back. I believe that her new behavior is due to her friend's bad influence. Part of me wants to give her a second chance, hoping she'll realize her mistake and come back. Yet there's still a lingering part of me that's wants her to suffer. I want to yell at her and attack her (not physically) but I need to hold myself back for the sake of not causing drama and for my friend who is still on good terms with her. I'm very confused on what I should do and how I should feel.",07Jun2020,1

Is it normal to not get messages from friends for like a few weeks?

I don’t really hangout with a set group of friends cus I’ve only hung out about 3-4 times in my 3 years high school. That normal? Or like idk what to think about it.

Also like does one go to parties often? I’ve never been to one.

254,"I've posted this before but didn't get any answers, wrong subreddit I guess, I'm new to this and I'm still not sure I'm in the right place.Either way any insight would be so appreciated, even a simple 'I don't know'.

I've had anxiety for quite some time and have been prone to panic attacks, however, whenever my anxiety spikes up, it always seems to end up to do with doors. I'm sure that sounds stupid but Just hear me out please. Whenever I have a panic attack I end up just staring intently at the nearest door that someone could enter. I get literally petrified just thinking about what could be behind it. This has been going on for some years now, since I was about 12. When I was having a panic attack, I was back as far away from my bedroom door as possible and just stare until my eyes ached. Another time there was a lock-down at my school due to there being someone on the grounds- it was a small class and there was a substitute, I was sat right next to the door in this class, the seats were in rows, so it would be very difficult to try and get away from it. As soon as the alarm went off and we figured out what was happening, I started breathing quick and stared at the door as everyone else tried to figure out what to do. I definitely freaked some classmates out who noticed my staring and asked what the hell I was looking at.

This idea is also a reoccurring and near constant in my nightmares, situations where I find myself desperately pressing against a broken or unlock-able door while someone/something pounds on it, trying to protect myself and sometimes my family, or sitting against a locked door, away from something terrifying that's waiting outside, almost taunting me- these doors are usually front doors, or rooms in my house if that makes a lick of difference. One other way it manifests (and this is childish so don't judge me) is that I'd curl up in my wardrobe and close the doors, I'd sit there for ages in the dark, cramped and breathing heavily, feeling so terrified, and just staring at the crack between the doors, waiting for an attack that never comes.

Now that Quarantine in upon us, when I'm waiting in line to enter a shop, you can bet it's a source of panic, just staring and waiting. Not to mention just being at home so much has had me just sitting on the floor and staring through my back door, sometimes for over an hour during the day, other times in the middle of the night when I can't sleep.

This has been happening for so long, so consistently and I'm extremely unsettled by it, but curious enough that I'm asking the internet for help decoding my fucked-up brain. Does anyone else have this issue or have advice for how I can deal with this? Thanks for reading.

256,"Dealing w/ struggles &amp; im trying to start a relationship soon that is aiming to have a family.
28f(me) How I can help myself to start a relationship after I’ve been single for 4 years ( struggling with career + mental health issue)
I’ve been living in the states for 8 years, and I couldn’t get a job offer in the past year. One of the reason that I heard from feed bacl; ppl said that I’m not confident.
( but one interview this manager said to me I have the skills; but I didn’t get an offer. )
 I have commitment issue( &amp; depression, biopolar) I’ve been fighting these issues since I can remember. 

[ 1 how to spot red flags before or during a relationship? 2 how to accept potential new relationship 

I am afraid to commit. My ex cared about me but he was manipulative. We were in 4 yr relationship. I’m 6 yrs younger than him, both introverts. I want to know how to find the right person who wants harmonious sexual lifestyle as my bf / future husband. How to spot red flags before marry someone that might cause dead bedroom??

I’m single (who should be married with kids as in my culture) who only had 1 longterm relationship. Ex refused to be passionate and Acted gross out when I asked him to give me oral; Did help me orgasm( play w my clit and other things). I was younger I felt that he doesn’t care about my requests, also he didn’t wanted to get back in shape to offer better sex.

I’d like to have another relationship asap; now that I’ve been single for 4 years. I had sex with some singles it was passionate some were really good, i enjoy climax a little before sex. Some guys have amazing personalities.

I had a convo w/ a friend I couldn’t tell her that I have commitment issue. She know that Id be better off to have a bf. I couldn’t even let the guys I dated to know that I prefer to have sex w someone whose in a relationship w/ me. There were guys asked to be in a relationship w/ me without me bringing it up(sweet), but I was not ready (didn’t find the one) The last guy( 2 -3 yrs younger than me) I dated we slept together a few times, I told him that I’d like to be w/ him (guess that I’m not his gf type, obviously I can’t get enough of him; I was catching feelings) but he didn’t want me. ( of course it is usually the guy asks the girl, this is probably going to be my first time and the last time to ask that question to a guy)

I haven’t had sex since 2020 started. This time im hoping to have that special relationship first... Celibate a little bit more is not going to hurt my feelings or anyone elses... How can I be more open minded and accept better ppl( potential bf), start to date my future bf/husband?

Thanks I hope ppl can understand the writing and I’m all ears. ]

257,"Hi everyone, I'll be using *fake names* for anonymity, but I was wondering if I could get some advice on something. I'll give some backstory and a quick introduction. My name is *Stefan*, and I've been best friends with this guy *Archie* for 7 years since the first year of high school. While he is a very generous, caring, and empathetic person I connect with on a strong level, I feel as though he puts no effort into this friendship. In 2017, he started dating this girl *Clara* and they dated for a year. In that relationship, I saw him four times. I made constant efforts to hang out, talk about how we need to spend more time with each other (and him with our other friends) instead of forgetting we exist and devoting all of his time to her. After a couple of fights with him in 2017-2018 about our friendship, he promised he would try harder to be a better friend. This has been promised a couple of times and still isn't the case. When he and *Clara* broke up, I finally felt like he was putting at least the bare minimum into seeing and spending time with me and I figured he realized that he needed to make up for the lost time and fix an almost broken friendship. This was the case for a while, and honestly, I was really happy we got past it. In May 2019, he started seeing this other girl, *Melissa*. I met *Melissa* prior to *Archie and Melissa* meeting for the first time and right off the bat I didn't vibe with her, she was judgemental, condescending, pessimistic, and had this awful superiority complex. Regardless, when I hung out with her and *Archie*, I was always respectful, polite, and kind because I knew how happy he was, and from someone that loves this guy like a brother, that's all that matters to me. Since May 2019, I've hung out with him one-on-one once.  


**All of the events that transpired occurred in just 7 days, so I'll keep it as short as possible.**

**Monday:** I decided that I wanted to rent out a cottage to be able to see my friends and celebrate my birthday. It was a bit last minute, but I had everyone's confirmation that I can book and they would chip in, pay, and come. On FaceTime with *Melissa* and *Archie,* they said they can come for sure, and I asked ""Are you 100% sure? I'm booking right now"" and they said yes and that they don't have plans.

**Tuesday**: I book the place and ask everybody for the money to chip in. I get the money from most people.

**Wednesday:** So far everyone has sent the money except *Melissa* and *Archie,* so I messaged *Melissa* around noon ""hey r u coming lol"". I didn't think this would even happen. I get a response 9 hours later ""i dont think i can :("". I was really upset, especially considering I wasn't given an explanation, and she said she could come prior to me booking the place, which was 75$ a person and makes me short in money. I'm fine with them not being able to come but don't say you can, and then wait for me to book, and then bail. I replied, ""Booked a place bc u guys said yes tho so now its coming outta my pocket but thanks for letting me know"". A couple of minutes later I receive a text from *Archie ""hey thank you for inviting me to ur bday plans but i cant come""* I felt like his message was so impersonal and I didn't want to say anything I didn't mean or harsh so I chose not to reply. *Melissa* messages me an hour later and says ""really wish i could make it"". No explanation given, no apology.

Thursday: I'm still confused as to why they can't come, upset, and just feeling a whole range of emotions. I decided to head to my local park and hang with another friend group I'm a part of. While I was there I saw a large group get off the grass and start leaving. It was my entire friend group (not the one I was with) with Melissa, Archie, and all of my other friends. Archie didn't see me but Melissa and I made eye contact for over 10 seconds, I waved and she pretended she didn't see me, walked over to Archie, and started distracting him and walked with him in the opposite direction of where I was.

Friday: My birthday, Archie wishes me a happy belated by text and says we'll hang out just him and me sometime after this weekend. While I was still upset over what happened, he could have decided not to text me at all but still did so I respected that, and I replied thank you and how I'm looking forward to seeing him soon. Found out from a direct source later that day that they bailed because Melissa ""needed"" Archie with her Friday and Saturday for ""emotional support"" while she dyed her hair. 

My ultimate goal is to talk things over with him and really be vulnerable and explain how I feel about our friendship, his girlfriend, the cottage situation, and the overall mood of our relationship. I will obviously say this without attacking him as not everything is black&amp;white, there's a side to everything and I definitely need to hear him out. I just don't know how to tell him (for at least the 10th time in the past 3 years) that when he is with a girl, he disregards his friends (this was just the tip of the iceberg for me, not the entire reasoning completely). I've even tried speaking to Melissa about it and asked her to encourage him to see his friends but I doubt she's ever said anything. Archie is a good person and has a big heart, but he's also turned into the type of guy that won't reach out to me for a month if I don't since I'm constantly putting in the effort to see him and see how he's doing.  


Anyways, the moment you've all been waiting for, any tips on what to say when speaking to him in terms of approach, or rather any thoughts or feedback on my situation? Anything helps! Thanks so much :)",07Jun2020,1
258,"Hello.  I don't really know how to properly express and describe my feelings to the extent that I experience them, but I'll try my best.

I  feel so disconnected and different from everyone around me. I've struggled with this my entire life. No matter where I go or how hard I  try, I just can't seem to truly connect with anyone. I constantly feel like I'm the black sheep in my family. 

When I try to initiate conversation, I usually get talked over and ignored.  When they do respond, their energy seems to drop immediately and they just seem different when they talk briefly and simply as they can as if I was a stranger to them. It's been like this since I was little. Even my own siblings and parents barely acknowledge me and aren't as close to me as they are with each other.

It's not just my family either. I've never had a genuine friend before. I really struggle with making friends and I can never pin-point the main reason why. I know I'm awkward, but even when I was  doing my best to be confident and outgoing, it never worked. At school, I was always by myself. Everyone thought I was weird and dumb. It was so crushing and I was so desperately lonely despite my efforts at socializing. The closest I've gotten to getting friendships is by texting people, but then the relationship always fades to nothing when they gradually lose interest in me and stop texting altogether. It happens every single time. I can't understand why. I don't send one word responses, I don't try to act obnoxious, I don't talk badly about others...the list goes on. I don't know what else I have to do.

I  feel like even strangers online are driven away by me. I frequently get ignored in chats and games no matter what I say or how loudly I say it. I know I may be overthinking this part, but it's happened to me too many times just to call it simply a coincidence every time.

It's been like this for me  since I was really little. I've always felt completely lost as to what is wrong with me to make me such an outcast from everyone around me. Is it that I have some kind of mental disability? Is it just who I am as a person? Or am I just paranoid? I don't know. I wish someone could just tell me the answer to my problems instead of leaving me in the dark. 

Please, if someone could just give me any kind of advice or maybe help me figure out what is wrong with me, I'd really, really appreciate it. I just don't want to be alone anymore.",07Jun2020,1
259,I'm 24 and I've been going to college for about 5 years. I was a nursing major finished all my pre reqs and all I needed was to take my nursing entrance exam to get into the program... but i was depressed really and i dreaded the thought of going into the program it just wasnt for me. The reason why I was doing it in the first place was because of parental pressure. I finally decided to change my major to forensic science a year and a half ago and it feels like it's going so slow I still need 3 or 4 more years and it feels like its dragging along and I'm so disappointed in myself and I know my parents will be disappointed when they find out I didnt even apply to the nursing program. Btw I still live with my parents and I'm basically a second mother to my brothers I feed them and i clean the house and i help with their hw( I live in a Hispanic household) where women are still seen to be the ones to do all the things a woman should do. Also my parents are strict so going out to enjoy life in my 20s hasnt happened. I feel like I'm stuck here and I'm not progressing in any way. Is graduating at 27 or 28 something I should be ashamed about? Because I really do feel like that especially since I see all these people who I went to high school with that already seem to have their life together already.

262,"My natural skin tone is pasty and I've always been okay with it, I mean if I wasn't I'd be fucked because it's the only one I have and the only one I'm going to have the rest of my life.

But lately I've been getting more comments about it than the usual. Mostly family and friends that keep telling me that I look too pale, that I should tan so I look healthier and more glowing, and that more clothes colours would fit me more and that it'd help me to hide my skin imperfections.

But I tanned once when I was 17 and I didn't like it. It made me look orangish and my skin looked kind of uniform, which is weird because people with natural dark skin have different skin tones on the, abdomen, arms, legs... so they look natural, not uniform.

But most importantly, it fucked up my skin. After I tanned I suddenly had so many expression lines, red and white freckles, brown spots and so many skin defects that I definitely didn't have before. I was mortified, and now that I'm pasty again they're more visible. So I said ""not anymore"" and I started wearing sunscreen and I've been aging well since then.

But the social pressure is insanely strong. The first thing everyone does when they say hi is to comment about my skin and that I should tan and at some point it started hurting. Even a stranger yelled at me ""hey tan a little"" once because they thought it'd be a friendly compliment, which was a very wtf moment for me anyway. 

I just don't want to fuck up my skin anymore and enjoy it even if other people think I should change it. How do you deal with social pressure? :/",07Jun2020,1

265,"FAIR WARNING THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY LONG, BUT I REALLY DO NEED HELP.

My mom and I have never had the best relationship in the world. When I was a kid she beat me all the time, at the age of 10 she kicked me out and my dad and I slept in his car that night, growing up I was always held to higher standards than my siblings, and when I would complain about the higher standards my mom would just belittle me and call me ugly names. She always told me I had to share, but my siblings didn't have to; she always told me that family doesn't charge each other (as in hey you owe me this much), but my siblings still do it; and she always told me that we are stronger as a family, but then proceeded to make me feel below her. As a kid I always hated my mom, and I swore to never be like her whenever I am raising kids of my own. So keep this in mind as context.

The second time I was kicked out of my house was when I was in high school. She basically told me to, ""find somewhere else"" and I did. My friend let me stay at her place until they couldn't have me anymore, I slept in my car for a couple of days until my friend's mom let me stay at their place for a year. After a year I moved back in with my parents, mainly because I didn't have enough money to live anywhere else. I was told that my mom cried for days when I left, and that she was ""extremely worried about"" me. I figured after a year of being apart things would be better, but oh boy.

I work as a tutor at a middle school, so during the summer I don't have a job. This isn't normally a problem but, ha ha, COVID-19 happened. My sister is immunocompromised, so I didn't--and still don't--want to look for a job because if I bring the virus home to her I COULD KILL HER. Now, I'm not using my sister as an excuse, if anything I'm being pretty selfish about it. I don't want to find a job because I would HATE myself if I brought the virus home to her and caused her death/intense hospitalization. So basically, I'm out of work this summer (3 months). I applied for unemployment in Texas, but I haven't gotten anything yet. So I have absolutely no steady flow of income coming in for the next 3 months, and I only have about $3,800 saved up.

The other day my mom asked me to bring her a baked potato to work. I said, something along the lines of, ""I don't have any money, my unemployment hasn't come in, and I'm not getting a check anymore."" So she asked me, ""where is all your money going?"" And I responded, ""Well..."" and then listed all my recent transactions. Most of the transactions were for the family, but I didn't care because if I live in their house I should pay some part too, you know? Even if I have nothing I should still contribute because that's what my mom always taught me. After I tell her my transactions she starts going off on me. ""You're selfish, you charge everyone for everything, your sister always helps and never asks for anything in return, you don't do stuff to help you just do it because you expect to gain something, etc.""

This was really a shock to me, because I just wanted her to understand that I wasn't going to have money for the next 3 months. I understand that I messed up, and I should have been clearer about it, that I was going to get her the potato, and I just wanted her to know that I didn't have money to be spending. I told her, ""I have bills to pay, I have to buy my own groceries, I have to fix my car, and I'm not going to have money coming in."" But she didn't want to hear it. She just kept calling me selfish and that I only want to charge people. When she got home from work she told everyone to not ask me for help, that THEY were going to figure it out (basically excluding me from the family). She told my sister to take me off of my Dad's health insurance, and to take me off the car insurance. She told everyone that I'm selfish and can't appreciate anything, and therefore I don't belong on any of the insurance policies and for me to figure it out by myself. 

I spent over an hour crying and arguing with her. My entire family backed me up and told my mom that I hadn't ever charged them for anything I've done for them. But, even though everyone proved her wrong, she didn't care and wanted me off the insurances. At the end of the argument, after my sister finally convinced her that she messed up too, she said, ""Well, we all need to learn from our mistakes and come together as a family. We are stronger as a family."" She then said a half-assed apology and left it at that. The next day my dad tells me that she is still going to take me off of both insurance policies, and that I should find a place of my own because my mom doesn't want me at the house anymore. 

So now I'm here. I don't have a stable job, no one wants to hire right now, my unemployment isn't coming in, and my mom wants me out of the house. I tried looking for an apartment, but I'm scared. There's so many fees, and the places I CAN afford have horrible reviews. So I don't want to pay so much money for an apartment just to have to pay MORE to either fix the problems or break my lease (which many people say they have had to do in their reviews). If I can't afford an apartment I absolutely cannot afford a house. But at the very least, if I go buy a house I'm my own boss. I can fix my own problems, no one will bother me, and I'd basically be paying the same as a nice apartment. Of course, my boyfriend said that he would move in with me and help me pay the mortgage, but I don't want to depend on him for everything. I have to help too. So now I have to find a way to pay for: my car insurance, my health insurance, a place to live, renters or homeowners insurance depending on what I decide to do, and groceries and other stuff. We were thinking if we get a house we could rent out the other rooms to our friends, but we're scared that they might leave at any time or do things that we don't approve of.

Another problem is I'm a college student. I work with the school district and: I love my job, I love the kids, the hours are perfect, I make decent pay, and it's leading up to my dream job. I want to be a professor one day or get my Doctorate and help fix the school district I work with. I don't want to quit my job because I absolutely love it, it's right up my alley, and it allows me to go to school. But if I want to get a house with my bf I can't let him pay all the bills. If I find a full time job with health insurance then I would be set, but that means giving up my dreams.

268,"Hi everyone. I am a doctor and I run a small General medical practice. I employ one other doctor and three nurses.

My wife and I have been married for twenty years and she also acts as the accountant for my medical practice.

I have a policy that every patient regardless of gender or age is to be asked questions regarding their domestic happiness.

Basically what we do is try to assess whether the patient feels safe at home with and around their partner.

Often, a man or woman is being abused by their partner and they are so used to keeping quiet about it that they don’t speak up. So we ask some questions to assess their situation and let them know that we are A safe Party to talk to about if they’re being abused or not.

Well, the other doctor had not been following the procedure with men. She had been diligent in assessing female patients and actually we had several cases where they opened up about abuse that they were experiencing by a husband or wife. We referred them to several resources and a few of them managed to confront the abuse and left their abusive relationships. For that I am extremely grateful.

I am upset that this doctor was not doing the same for men. That is why I fired her.

I actually didn’t know at first she wasn’t following procedure until we had a male patient who was covered in scratches and bruises. She (the doctor I fired) asked me to step in and provide my Professional opinion on Some symptoms that the patient was dealing with . I do have about 20 more years experience than her so she asked me as she typically does.

I noticed the patients bruises and scratches. I pulled her aside and questioned her if she discussed his home situation and she acted caught off guard. She said of course! I checked the patient notes and there was no mention of asking the question.

I ended up questioning the patient myself and deduced that he was indeed a victim of domestic violence and helped him with some resources. Yes there are Plenty of resources for men!

Anyhow I decided to go through all the patient charts that my employee doctor maintains. All female patients were asked about if they feel safe at home, etc. No record in any male chart of the same questions.

This is why I terminated her. For not following procedures. Which put many men especially this one patient, at risk.

This doctor has already threatened me with a lawsuit and I am dealing with the legal nightmare right now. 

Did I make a bad decision in firing her because she wasn’t following procedures around ensuring that male patients are in safe domestic situations?

I decided to tell my wife what happened and she thinks I made the wrong decision and I should have given her a reprimand and another chance.

My wife ended up calling her to apologize and is taking her side. Wife told me to sleep on the couch tonight and I am unhappily obliging. Idk where this is leading but now I’m worried I made the wrong choice.",07Jun2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

My friend is a very conflicted person, who probably has Asperger's but isn't properly diagnosed, even though his mom is a psychiatrist. Since our teenage years, his relationship with sex has been troubled. He used to punish himself when he thought of masturbation, and went through a heavy Catholic phase (he'd go to Latin mass and everything), even though his parents are atheists. It doesn't help that his father is extremely homophobic, and he is bisexual.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of sexual experience, he's practically a virgin. He allegedly hooked up with a prostitute and with a male co-worker, but we can't know if he's telling the truth because his accounts are poorly detailed. He seems ashamed of talking about sex.

&amp;#x200B;

He's a very intelligent person. He studies at the best medical school of the country, and is the kind of person that would know all the answers without paying attention to the teacher. It's hard to describe how smart he is, but I have to paint the picture because I don't want him to sound like an unreasonable person. He's extremely rational, but not exactly sensible - if the distinction exists in English - and wouldn't be the person to share fake news without checking twice.

These days, we had conversations with him in which he admitted to read a lot of incel literature. Even though we tried to convince him otherwise, and he seemed open to our objections, he still sent us a lot of ""peer-reviewed"" arguments that seemed to corroborate the incel views of women, flirtation and sex.

As his childhood friend, I feel it's our duty to convince him he's wrong. But how can we argue that his views are mistaken when he seems impressed by (supposedly) scientific literature? I need help.",07Jun2020,1
271,"I have told this story so many times on Reddit, but I keep deleting it out of shame.

In my freshman year of college, I met a woman I fell for very hard. We kissed once and from that moment on, I fell even harder. However, I asked her to date and she turned me down, and I did not take it well at all. I had an incel level meltdown and we didn't talk for six months. I reached out after that and we rekindled our friendship, but even after that, I posted on Reddit about the situation and she read it and ripped me a new one. We didn't talk for a little bit after that, but eventually I asked if she wanted to go on some walks with me, and I gave her a long overdue sincere apology for all the dumb shit I pulled. She accepted it, and we went back to being good friends.

Years go by and even now, to this day, I still feel that same level of attraction towards her. I think about her weekly and I hope she is well. We talk once in awhile but we're both busy with life and what not. What really got me was the death of my mom about a year ago. I talked to her about it and she helped me through it, even told me I seemed like I have changed for the better.

I just don't know what to do. I feel like Jim talking to Pam outside casino night. On one hand, if I talk to her about my feelings, I risk throwing away a friendship. On the other hand, I want so badly for her to know how much she means to me.

I've asked about this before on Reddit, and the response was real 50/50. I am hoping to get some solid advice so I can move on from this. Thanks for reading.",07Jun2020,1
272,"Boyfriends racist family

I love my boyfriend we’ve been together for 3 years but his family is so racist I can’t be around them for long. He has 3 brothers that still live at home and they are so racist it’s awful. I’ve honestly never heard anyone talk like how they talk and they aren’t even joking!! He has 2 brothers that aren’t bad but the other 3 are just awful and it drives me insane I talk to him about it and he’s like just ignore them they’re stupid. Like his dad is a little racist but not really and his mom is the nicest person ever but I just can’t even be around his brothers like one of them is a literally neo natzi I don’t know what to do. My boyfriend is a little racist but he’s gotten a lot better and he is getting nicer and nicer as time goes on but where we live there really isn’t that many people that aren’t white. (Small town North Dakota isn’t very diverse) and with how his family acts it’s no surprise that he would be a little. I just don’t know what to do I love my boyfriend and his parents but his brothers are just awful idk what to do. I don’t understand how they can be so hateful to people they don’t even know just because of they’re skin color. And with all of this George Floyd news and the huge black lives matter movement it’s really opening my eyes on just how awful people can truly be. I love my boyfriend and we don’t share the same views on a lot of things but he’s still the one for me I just don’t know if I can handle his family and it’s important to me to be close with family but I can’t with his what do I do.",07Jun2020,1
273,"I'm on mobile and this is going to be big. Sorry.  I'll post a TL;DR at the bottom.  After explaining the pretext, I'll have a big gap before writing the current dealio.

**Pretext**


My girlfriend and I had a pretty solid relationship before quarantine hit (at least I think, this is my first relationship).  Our relationship began in early-mid November, and we haven't even had a serious fight in our entire relationship (just over 7 months).  


We go to the same high school (South US), me being a senior and her a junior.  Pre-quarantine we had time to do things together.  We shared some clubs and activites, and typically I took her home after school (she didn't have her driver's license at that point) and there would be a 50% chance we would hang out for a bit afterwards.  I didn't realize it yet, but looking back, a good 60% of our hangout time was watching movies and cuddling.  Another 20% was playing video games, and the last 20% being walking around parks and the like while talking.


I am not a super extroverted person and I can appreciate calm times, however looking back I think I was too blind to see all of the issues.


When we would cuddle and watch movies, I think we were just getting rid of the awkward silence that would surely fill the room.


She plays video games, but more things along the lines of lego star wars and animal crossing, whereas I am more attracted to things like monster hunter world, halo, arma 3, and destiny.  While I can play her favorite games, the skill cap is low and I can get bored more easily, while when she would try my games, she would become confused or frustrated.  There is nothing wrong with either of us, we just simply like different games, which means when we would play, at least one of us would be suffering while the other has fun.  The closest to a middle ground was minecraft, however we had completely different goals to the point where we might as well have been playing on different worlds.  While I would focus on creating automated farms and traps, etc. She would enjoy things like gathering flowers and watching sheep.  Equally valid playstyles, I just personally prefer more intense gameplay than her.


When we walked around and talked, we never talked about anything deep, it was shallow conversation about what was happening at that time, or how each other's day was.  While not inherently bad, it was never super in-depth.  On the off chance we did have an actual conversation that wasn't small talk, it was likely because I initiated it.


After quarantine began, we were talking and texting everyday, but as I'm sure you could predict, the conversation quickly became stale.  I can't tell you how many times we have had the ""argument"" about who is cooler, or cuter, or hotter, or funnier, etc.  


As quarantine went on, I grew tired of many things.  I grew tired of being the only one initiating conversations.  I grew tired of having all of the compliments I gave her being disputed and dodged.  I grew tired of having uninteresting conversations. Most importantly, I grew tired of investing so much into the relationship.

**Current Situation**


My area has slowly started reopening, and as a result some small groups of my friends have started hanging out together.  My gf and I decided to do a drivethrough date, which is straw that broke the camel's back.  When I picked her up, we hugged, asked about each other's day, and then proceeded to not have a meaningful conversation for the next few hours.  When I asked her where she wanted to go for dinner, we weren't able to choose a place, as both of us are highly indecisive people.  I eventually dropped her off.


A few days ago, a small friend group that we are both in got together for a small pool party.  We went shopping, and after going shopping for swimsuits together, I realized that despite how physically attractive she was, because she constantly deflected my compliments and pointed out her flaws to me, I no longer found her to be as attractive as when I first saw her.  At the actual pool party, it was clear to me that her personality clicked better with one of the other guys there (a close friend of mine).  There is nothing going on behind the scenes, it just happens that they have a better friendship than her and I have a relationship.  Similarly, I clicked a little bit better with some of the other girls at the party as well.  


**Advice/question below**

I think I know that we should probably break up, as we are only wasting each other's time.  I just don't know how to do it.  Even though I no longer wish to continue the relationship, I don't want her to feel bad or anything, especially since she has history of suicidal thoughts/actions.  If she were to do start cutting again or actually commit suicide, I wouldn't be able to live with myself.  I'll be going off to college in the fall, so I'm wondering if I should wait until then so she won't feel as bad.


\

TL;DR: 

My relationship with my girlfriend was never meant to be. Quarantine shoved this reality down my throat.  I need to know how to end the relationship in a way so that she doesn't blame herself or restart bad habits.  I've never broken up with someone so I would really appreciate some advice on this one.",07Jun2020,1
274,"My dream since I was a kid to be a writer. The only projects I cared about enough to do well on were essays and other written projects. I’d spend all my free times reading. I always pictured myself becoming an author. 

I (26f) went to college right out of high school with the intention of becoming a journalist. Halfway through my first semester, my boyfriend, who I was INCREDIBLY in love with and had been my best friend for years before it became romantic, committed suicide. I won’t get into details but it was the first in a series of traumatic instances that led to me dropping out of school. At the time I was working in one of those wing restaurants where the girls dont have a lot of clothes on and fell into the misogynistic, self-hating culture that often comes with that kind of premise. I was having a lot of underage sex, doing a lot of new exciting drugs, I had basically become the opposite of the fit, driven, clean-living athlete I had been for years. I eventually ended up almost dying of an OD and having to clean my life back up. 

As as any other addict will tell you, the cleaning up part didn’t come so easy. I ended up in an abusive relationship for several years, kept lapsing back into drugs, and didn’t really take my career aspirations seriously. I sought treatment for what ended up being undiagnosed bipolar disorder and once I was medicated and in therapy things got better. 

Now, I’ve been in an amazing relationship for two years, we recently got engaged and are in the midst of planning our lives together. Over the beginning of this year, I turned freelance writing into a bit of a side hustle. It took off quicker than I expected and knowing I had work I loved at home and was wasting my days in a job I hated, while also hogging a job during a pandem*c when people were desperate to work. I expressed this to my fiancé and he encouraged me to drop the shit job and chase my dream, even offered to take over my half of our rent so I wouldn’t have to stress about money. That night he built me an office in our garage and I did decide to quit my job. 

It’s going okay. Better than a lot of plunging into the deepend seems to work for my past self and some others. My bills are paid, I’m maintaining my small client base, objectively I should be grateful for this. I’m starting to feel overwhelmed though. If I want to get to a point where I’m making my bills AND rent again AND saving for a wedding, I really need to step up the amount of work I’m doing. I want to write articles and am missing out on some jobs by not already having an existing blog to showcase my skills, I’d be able to get more ghostwriting work if I had my own kindle published work to present, I need to quite quickly learn how to handle finances as a business owner. These are all things I want to do but all that pressure plus the pressure of acclimating to a new, more personal, much more cerebral job so quickly is getting really heavy. 

The advice I’m looking for is kind of a broad range:

1. Any other small business owners have tips for how to focus more on the grind to make this happen? 

2. Who’s got good stress relief tips in general that aren’t self numbing? It feels like that’s all I’m doing. 

3. Any success stories greatly appreciated as well.",07Jun2020,1

277,"I (22F) was raised in a conservative family who were pretty modest about swimwear. My parents made me feel like swimwear that showed stomach or cleavage or didn’t fully cover the butt was too revealing and sleazy, and attracted the wrong kind of attention. Therefore I never wore a bikini growing up; neither did my mom or other women in my family. I only wore full piece suits that kept me pretty covered. Since I’ve been older and living on my own I’ve bought a couple bikinis because I wanted to branch out and feel good about my body. However, in the 3 years I’ve owned a couple bikinis I’ve only worn one on a single occasion.

I have issues feeling comfortable wearing one. It really doesn’t have anything to do with my confidence in my body; I think I’m in pretty good shape and look good in a bikini. But I can’t help but have my family’s conservative ideals in the back of my head making me feel self conscious and sleazy for wearing one, even though I know I shouldn’t. On the one occasion I wore a bikini to a pool party I got hit on by a creepy old man that made me feel uncomfortable and fed into these underlying issues I have even more. I’d also feel embarrassed posting any pictures of myself in a bikini on social media because my family might see it and judge me.

I’d love to be able to shake off these feelings and enjoy wearing a bikini. I hate that I carry around these stupid ideas in the back of my head! It’s hard not to feel like I’m attracting the wrong kind of attention by wearing one, and to not care about what my conservative family thinks.

278,"Open for advice for self improvement. 

I dislike having conflicts/dramas in my life, whenever I sense one coming , ill either try to avoid the situation, give in, or just be two-faced (ie: on the surface I act like I give in but I bitch behind the persons back). I’m not assertive on my stand, and am a fence sitter because I want to please everyone! Which makes me wonder if I’ve been a terrible friend to my friends. 

Example.... I have a female co-worker whom I’m really close with. However , she doesn’t seem to get along well with anyone else in the team, except for me. Clearly, she’s got some attitude issues, which I’ve experienced it first hand and disliked. But me being me, If She pisses me off , I’ll rage only for a while and bitch about it to my other co-workers but I move on very quickly. Sometimes I’ll tell her what’s wrong &amp; why I’m angry. But most of the time , I try to bring across to her why our other co-workers do not like her &amp; what she should work on. She can’t seem to accept criticism &amp; will never accept any blame, she always justify her actions. All my other co-workers dislike her &amp; none of them are in talking terms with her. Whenever they bitch about her to me, I’ll listen but try not to actively engage or have any input. Mainly because I DO agree with them, but at the mean time I don’t want to be a bitch to my friend. But I gotta  admit , I do bitch about her too... How do I deal with situations like that? 

I do appreciate her as a friend , but I sometimes do not appreciate her working ethics. I don’t want to lose her as a friend too. I feel like I’m constantly caught in the middle, trying to please with everyone because I really hate conflicts. Which I’m ok with it, but I’m coming across as two-faced? Or is this just normal social survival skills ? Is it necessary for me to take a side ? I noticed I tend to do this to many other friends too. Which might be a problem in the long run.",07Jun2020,1
279,"I am so sick and tired of living with this person. For the past nine months, my best friend and I have had to deal with numerous acts of inconsideration from our third roommate such as not pitching in to buy toiletries, not cleaning the house, dishes, etc, but putting the dirty work on us WHILE she continues to use the home to her advantage. While that’s annoying, things started to turn for the worst when her cheating boyfriend came to our house all the time dirtying it up even more and bringing all sorts of pets not registered in only to have our landlord tell us we’re in violation of the lease when SHE was the one messing up not us. My best friend and I are so over it. Today was the last straw however. She brought a freaking raccoon into our home and let it stay the night and that the “pet” aka a nasty wild animal, was going to her boyfriend’s house once he moves into his new place.

I just don’t know what to do about her and the raccoon situation. Never would I think she’d pull something like this despite all the other things she has done. This is a whole other level.

Some background: I’m 20, live with my parents. Didn’t go to college, working a job I hate. Blah blah blah, you know the message. My parents are first immigrants, I’m the oldest of 2, sister(10), brother(13).

If I could go to college I’d major in business, as owning my own business is a dream of mine. My siblings are also getting older and I want them to go to college too, I know money will most likely be an issue so I want to be able to help them with that too.

283,"I have always believed sexuality was rather fluid, and my entire life (starting from age 11) found women sexually attractive. However, it wasn't until college that I developed my first actual crush on a woman. She is my best friend to this day, and I never quite told her my feelings (she identifies as A-sexual) in fear of harming our relationship. however, this crush was not different than what I experience with men. Same butterflies, same smitten facial expressions, same thoughts..everything. I've met plenty of ""bi"" women in my life that are more so straight, with the occasional interest in women. (I mean, sexuality is mostly fluid, right?) but for me it's a both sexual and emotional interest.   


My husband is away for work, and our relationship is quite rocky. In fact, i'm quite unhappy. However, I'm also stubborn and want nothing more than a long lasting, loving happy marriage. We got married under circumstances that were pretty awful, and well before I was ready. We had no wedding, engagement, nothing. And most of our 2 and a half years together has been hell. We rarely see eye to eye, and my husband acts more like a father than a husband. I have curfews and bedtimes, even while he is away. But i do care for him greatly, that is undeniable. 

This girl I work with, and have plenty in common with, has me smitten. She is gay. We have hung out outside of work several times and we (kinda) flirt, but it's mostly innocent. She knows i'm bi, but as a gay woman her perspective on bisexual women seems to be frustrating, but it makes sense. I don't believe she takes it seriously, and I understand why. Being truly bisexual is very frustrating, and I'd much prefer to be 100% gay, or 100% straight. Quite frankly, I detest it. 

My husband, oddly enough to fine with me and doing whatever I want with women. However, I think he has in his mind I'll be hooking up with other ""hotties"" while listening and giggling to Katy Parry's ""I kissed a girl"". However, that is most certainly not ever been the kind of girl i've found myself emotionally attracted to. I like women (note, I am bisexual not pansexual) who are girlish but with a very tom-boy aesthetic and personality.  This girl, we will call her T, is more on the tom-boy spectrum. Most certainly not what he likely has in his fantasy mind...I find her beautiful in every way, but certainly my husband never would. And I want to tell him I met a girl I like, but it will not go as I would like it to. I already know this.  


Naturally, I am frustrated. The last thing I ever want to do is somehow accidentally hurt this woman. Hearing her stories of past relationships, she seems to have (some) set of animosity toward bisexual women, which makes sense. ""they just don't know what they want"". I hate when she says that, it almost feels invalidating to my sexuality, BUT i know it just comes from a place of past hurt (being cheated on, etc)   


T is exceptionally pure hearted, and always sees things as half full, while I see them as half empty. She is a very purifying person, and being around her has done nothing but brighten my dark, sad and traumatized world. I like her more the more I get to know her, and so many times I want to just tell her, and ask to kiss her. However, I know this is a dangerous road to toe on. Her being gay is different than me being bisexual. My husband will return the beginning of 2021, he will not approve, I will stay committed to the person I married (as I should.)..and what? 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I expect? Her to let us have a secret fling? Then just go back to being just friends when it's all over? yeah, in what fantasy world would that ever end up with someone NOT being hurt?   


I truly don't know what to do.  Do I push my feelings to the side, and keep this friendship? (despite the emotional and sexual tensions....like yikes, it's bad. ) if so, how tf do I do that? I work with her, remember that, so ghosting is not an option nor a desire.

285,"I have always been a sad and damaged person, emotionally unstable and endlessly clingy to the few people who show me love. Emotionally, I'm a mess, but only those closest to my know that. To everyone else, including all the people at my university, I'm able to concert a very persuasive facade of emotional fieriness and vulnerability, but not instability. 

I tend to get deeply involved with my male professors. They all tell me I'm an amazing student, but that rarely satiates me. I tend to go to office hours, talk to them after class, discuss current politics with them, etc. 

The problem is that my motivations for this aren't entirely clear. I think they just see me as a really enthusiastic and perhaps slightly lonely student. But for me, it's so much more fundamental than that. 

I fantasize about having them as paternal figures. I have a good relationship with my dad, by the way. I don't know why I continue to have these issues. 

The other problem is that most of my professors are really receptive to me and my behavior. I attend a small private school, and the professors are pretty caring and have a lot of time for their students. Or perhaps they just prioritize them. Regardless, they have never made me feel unwelcome. If anything, they've very strongly encouraged my behavior with them. 

Perhaps they see me as a normal student, and they are similarly enthusiastic about our connection. 

But I know for me it's more than that. I don't think some of them realize how much I think about them. Every time I'm sad, which is every other day, I imagine myself clasped in their arms, being soothed and reassured by them. 

  
Trust me, I am as disgusted by these words as you are. I'm 22. I fully realize the yucky implications of my thoughts.

290,"Hello,

It's basically as the title says. My parents are getting old and sick (cancer and a few major issues), and usually we have a few people taking care of their cooking and cleaning, but due to Covid-19 that's all changed. I moved back in with my parents to help look after them, but balancing that with work has been tough.

I work 54 hours/week, and the salary is fully used for groceries and some bills. One parent has a job that's not requiring them to work right now, that salary is used for the medical expenses and the remaining bills.

On a daily basis, the cooking and cleaning and extra care for parents is difficult because of the workload despite working from home. My employer is understanding and very lenient about how I get my work done, but the increasing workload ends up biting me in the ass if I take time off (everyone has their assigned tasks).

I'm considering quitting to become a full-time caregiver. I love my parents very much and want them to have a better life than they do right now despite the current situation. I can do that if I can make more time for them.

295,"Here is some background, my dad has recently had a near death experience due to his health (not covid related) and because of this my parents have made the decision to move back to my dads home country for the health care system there. This all happened within a week of my dad being in the hospital, and has put a lot of stress on my family as we are all getting ready to move across borders again. 

Not even a week after all this happened my sister (19) found out that she was pregnant with her boyfriend’s (22) kid (they have only been dating for three months). This also put a lot of stress on my family as nobody, other then my sister, likes the guy, let alone has any respect for him (this is due to unrelated issues that have happened before this, but this doesn’t help at all).

This has put our family at odds with each other as none of us want my sister to stay here, as she is pregnant out of wed lock and we have no other choice but the leave.

She insists that she loves the guy and she doesn’t want to take the baby away from him, like our mom had to do to us when we were younger.

I really don’t like this guy, and that is a lot coming from me, I know none of you know me personally but it really takes a lot for me not to like someone and he has managed to do it in 3 months.

I know it isn’t my place, but in the end I believe it is best if my sister at least comes with us to have the baby, and have the support not only emotionally but financially due to the country’s system with child tax credit and maternity leave laws.

Here is a text message she sent to me a few minutes ago after I told her that I thought she was being stupid for wanting to stay: 

I don’t expect you to understand. You won’t understand unless you got pregnant outside of marriage and had your hands tied completely. I’m not taking my baby away from it’s father. He is not a bad man. There’s no good reason to do to my kid what mom had to do to me. He is a good man. I love him. Mom introduced us... how can she expect me to fall out of love with him. He’s my person. He’s the only person I can talk to without feeling judged these days. He’s the only one who truly understands. I’d be furious if I were in his shoes and he took the baby away from me. 

Do you think I am wrong? Should I support my sister in her decision even though I am 110% against it?",07Jun2020,1
296,"I know this is gonna sound stupid and panicky but this happened to me today. 

I was eating one of those small creamy triangles of cheese. It was a creamy Asiago. I was eating it straight out of the wrapper. I noticed on the bottom of the wrapper there was what looked like blood. I checked my tongue but no blood. I immediately looked through the rest but saw there was none in the others but just in case threw out that box. 

This happened today however the day before I was bleeding in my mouth from somewhere. When I was spitting from brushing my teeth I noticed some blood because I think I went a bit to hard when brushing by mistake. Can I have gotten anything from this? Would HIV or Hepatitis or other things be able to survive being at the bottom of a piece of cheese, stored for however long, and still be able to infect? Maybe it was blood from my mouth already but I would have felt pain to bleed I'd guess. I've already been stressed from a bunch of things going horrible at this time, and seemingly getting worse and now this is just making me worry more and just unable to do much. It's another bad thing to add up on the list. I'm sorry for how this sounds and that this is a stupid question but Idk I can't handle another thing possibly going wrong right now.

297,"This might be a long one, but for the past few months I've been working towards my entry to the acting and music industry. And I've come across a very big dilemma with what I should do about my online friends, I've been a very active and well known member of a community with 50,000+ members and I have many close friends I've made over the 3 years. And the reason this is a problem is because I wanted to let everyone know about my career and keep contact with my friends but I'm afraid if I do that and my career goes well that the public will find my messages and go through them. And there's really no doubt in my mind that someone out there will exploit this. Admittedly I've made many many bad mistakes, and I'm really not afraid to own up to them because I know I've grown. But my problem is there are a lot of things I've said about myself, my family, and my personal feelings that I really just dont want to all be revealed to the public. But at the same time, I don't wanna leave my friends behind. And there are certain friends that I plan on meeting and working with that I *can't* leave behind. Idk if this is sloppy, theres so many things to this problem. Whenever I think of a reason I should stay I come up with 2 more  reasons I shouldn't and vice versa.

302,"I have been struggling with this for a long time and even more so now in recent years because of the BLM movements and black voices beginning to be heard.

At the beginning of high school, I was incredibly ignorant and did many ignorant offensive things. The two that come to mind are thinking it was funny to Nazi salute and say many other anti-semitic things. The other is a picture of myself on Snapchat where I didn't commit blackface but used snapchat art to essentially do the same thing.

None of these situations have been brought to light and I haven't been ""outed"" per se but I am confident that people remember this and some may have screenshots of these images.

My question is now what do I do? I am in college now and have done the work to educate myself and have begun to chip away at my internalized racism and try to not contribute to institutionalized racism as much as I can and support POC. I truly feel like I have grown and would never do any of those heinous things again and am honestly disgusted that I did in the first place.

310,"I’m 26F. I’m my dads ONLY daughter. But growing up, even before my parents divorce, it’s like I had more of a friend than a dad. And a bad one at that. Sometimes I wonder if I’m even his because he’s never shown me affection. He loves me, yes I know but he’s not good at showing it. Growing up when I hit my early teens I’d call him and be like, “dad my birthday was yesterday why didn’t you call?” And he’f say, “I know! It’s your job to call me.” Like WTF? My mom said my dad told her many times that if he had to choose between us (his family) or his business he’d always choose his business. My dad is a hard worker and loves his job. He should be retired by now but he keeps working. I just wish he loved me as much as he loves his money and business. What makes it worse is when he met his new partner years ago, she had 5 kids with another man And yeah they were all little and maybe that’s why he showed them more love but he didn’t do much of that with me. He never calls me to see how I’m doing. We are going for a year of not talking. And I just stopped calling HIM over the years because he said he expects me to call. But he doesn’t do it himself. He also donates a lot of his money to a church and gives to homeless and people in need. But growing up it pained my dad to give me (again his ONLY daughter!) money for things she needed growing up. He would also constantly tell me to ask my mom to remove the child support. My mom was kind enough to just ask for $50 a week. My friends who had divorced parents would tell me their dad would weekly send  them $150. My grandpa (his dad) and all his family know how is is and they’d always tell me to ask my dad for money. That I needed it and I’m his only daughter. But the older I got the more embarrassing it became. It’s not even about the money, it’s just like he’s lazy to be a father. To make it worse I’ve found out that he constantly travels to Mexico. He’d tell me himself or I’d hear it from my grandmother (super small town) He’d also tell me very happily how he would buy land and he was planning to sell crops and he was giving jobs to many people. Things like that, and it makes me happy because somewhere in the is a good heart but he never opened it up to me. Then he was planning one marrying this girl, yes a girl my age! She just wanted him for his money and that’s why he’d constant donate big amounts to her church. I’m still so disgusted by that because I stalked her. She was born the same year as me. Plus he’s a dog and has been cheating on his US parter with a younger girl in Mexico! I would try a lot like 5 years ago. I’d call him ever month or so and tell him let’s go out to lunch. That became harder and harder. He’s have to reschedule a lot. Get this. I also got a Siberian Husky back in 2012. Don’t meant to brag but he is by far the most handsome one out there! Lol anyway. My dad took care of him for a whole year while I relocated with my husbands family (the temporary home didn’t allow pets) and well whenever he’d come by my house to pick me up for lunch he would show the dog way more love than me. Seriously! he would hug him a lot kiss him tell him how much he missed him. He never hugs me, kisses me or tells me that he misses me none of that! Idk I’m older now and it doesn’t bother me anymore. He wasn’t a good dad and I have no attachment to him. I didn’t need him growing up anyway because he was never there so I learned to get by without a father. But I’d like to tell him how I feel one day. Should I even bother? There’s this scene in the movie, “ sisterhood of the traveling pants” (I know cheesy) but it’s the scene where actress America, calls her dad crying and tells him how angry she is with him and how she feels like his dad traded up and doesn’t love her. That’s how I kind of feel. Except I don’t feel like my dad traded it up. I feel like he loves everyone and everything else but me. Idk what to do or if I should even bother. As I got older, when I would call him he would in the car with, “you know I love you right girl?” And like I know he’s does.

I have not told him these feelings and he has not expressed any feelings that mirror mine. This is completely one-sided.

I find it such a tragedy that our relationship can't move past a friendship. He's so nice. I'm not losing sleep over these feelings, but it does make me sad sometimes. I don't want to lose him as a friend and I don't want to tell him as I don't think that would do any good.

322,"I knew I would grow up eventually, one day. Since I was really young, I acknowledged time as a measure  of our lifespan, and how it has the power to change us, immensely, over the course of flying years. 
I was and still am an avid collector of old stuff: things like cassette players, 8mm projectors and vintage clothes, pretty odd stuff to be collecting as a middle schooler/high schooler. I guess it just made me feel closer to the old lifestyles that I've always appreciated and admired. But now, as I face a future college adult life before me, I feel like those old pictures and videos I saw when I was younger. I feel like time is now starting to bottle me down into a memory, and will continue to do us, until I get older and seize to be, like everyone in those seventies footage I've seen. 

I find myself in a position of animosity for what is to come, resentful for having time push me forward so quickly, already delivering me into the ""real world."" I have always held this attitude of ""we gotta do what we gotta do."" and I have always pulled of a very dominant attitude about what is to be done about a situation, but this transition into college seems daunting and like a calling of ""get a move on, your time is ticking."" Especially due to this whole coronavirus quarantine mess, I've had more than enough time alone to reflect and feel discomforted, thinking and thinking in a loop without fully quelling my concerns. I've always considered myself a very emotional being, but not in an openly manner. I don't show it, but I feel it, and the feeling of abysmal discomfort only seems to resonate more as days go by.

I know this might be what you'd diagnose as a warm plate of ""existential crisis,"" but I'd like to hear some thoughts from people who might have gone through something similar.
Any input or comments, I am glad to hear.

323,"I don't normally talk about my feelings due to the adults around me normally acting in ways that discourage me from telling them when I upset them.

Here is some context. A girl gave me her number and I started to feel like she only spoke to me because she thinks I'm smart and could help with her work. Let’s call her A. A sent her friend to me for help also and got angry at me when her friend failed the test, I helped her study for despite the fact she asked me to do this the NIGHT before. I was up until 3 helping her a girl who knew nothing about the subject and she somehow thought she should get mad at me. Let’s call this second girl B.

Fast forward two days ago. A text me out the blue, don't even think she asked me how I was. Then she basically trailed off the conversation and her replies took longer, and the messages got shorter. Got tired of it and seen-ed her last one-word reply. So today B""coincidentally"" calls me asking me for help with some, idk, a mail in exam. She was asking me for help with an extra credit question. I, out of the goodness of my heart, decide to help her.

She sends me the question. I know what topic it is. I ask her if she's ever done it. She replied with, paraphrasing ""…something something ""this is due at **11:59pm**"". At this point my emotions are lit. Not only did she text me out the blue, she had a deadline and thought I would somehow magically drop everything and use 100% of my life energy and focus to help her because of her oh so important deadline. Maybe she was asking me to just give her the answer, but I don't role like that so fuck her if she was.

I tell her the deadline isn't my problem and that wasn't the question I asked. She gave a not-so-straight answer so I just ignore that and say she doesn't know what the fuck the question is saying.

In the middle of me helping her she just ups and says ""nvm. It's fine"". I'm asking myself ""wtf"" and then just reply with ""what?"". She says by the time she gets it the deadline would pass. She was 2 steps from the answer.  TWO!! I told her that and she says she's not getting what I was saying. So I told her to just say that instead of suddenly quitting. She replies with two emojis that look like (&gt;M&lt;) so at this point I'm livid. 

Few seconds later A texts me asking me B asked me to help her with her assignment. It looks like A was trying to look ignorant while being completely aware of what B doing. I tell her I'm pissed and I'm gonna tell B off. She tells me not to. Said I didn't need her permission. And I told her that I think the situation was bullshit.

I tell her that I feel like she's using me, and she keeps trying to brush the blame on the other friend saying stuff like she said she told her not to ask me. I'm pretty sure that's bullshit. After I finish telling both off, they somehow have the nerve to try and find fault with how I reacted. A said I didn't have to use such foul language or whatever and that I should have just said no if it bothered me that much. The other girl said that in her defense even though I'm complaining about having to stay up she ""dID AsK"" so I guess I should just be fine with that. 

I know their reasons are bullshit. I know I was taken advantage of but I don't normally get honest when people take advantage of me so I felt a bit guilty. I feel stupid for feeling guilty. I'm at home and people rarely text me. I feel slightly depressed. So I was really, REALLY pissed that this girl reached out to me after months only for me to help her friend out.

The advice I'm looking for is ""was I too harsh?"". I was blunt. Very blunt. I didn't ease up at all. I told the friend that gave me her number to never ask for my help again because she was abusing the privilege of asking me for favors. I feel like she was very upset. B can get fucked tbh. But I thought A was my friend. I was raised to think everyone was out to get me. I’ve been trying to ignore those advices because I don’t want to isolate myself like my mother does. I want to trust people. And starting to doubt my friends feels like the first step down that path.

And for the people thinking it, yes I was simping. 

TL;DR – For the first time ever I’ve called a friend out on their shit and I feel kinda guilty but I don’t know if I should or how to deal with it.

It's to be used for any circumstances where we believe we need to stay home as a result of this outbreak, be it from self isolation to looking after a household family member.

The gripe I have is that there is an overwhelming majority of people I work alongside and get along with that have used this as a two week vacation and have openly said it, with no consequences. Which means are workload has increased as we aren't able to have over time workers join us as it can lead to cross shift contamination.

The biggest annoyance that I, and a few others, have already voiced is that we are all receiving a bonus for coming in to work at this time. We all get the same bonus, regardless if I've gave an extra two weeks of labour whilst &lt;insert generic name&gt; has had a two week paid vacation.

I'm a very honest person, and I'm proud that I've never taken any period of time off during my nearly twenty years of being employed. However, this really doesn't sit well with me and I would like some advice on what you think I should do please.

Thanks you to any responses I get in advance.",07Jun2020,1
329,"I don't know where to begin, but i can only say that i'm on the edge of a panic attack and i'm feeling very very very guilty, i never thought that i would be able to ""fool"" someone.

I started talking (texting) to this girl in the beginning of this year, we have a lot of things in common and live near each other. We kept in touch through 2 months with casual conversation, a normal friendship. At the time, judging by photos and stuff, i found her overall attractive and then after 2+ months i started flirting with her and it was successful, she corresponded it. There is a important point to make: she is a shy girl, kind of introverted, said before that have low self esteem, never had a boyfriend before and had a very hard emotional time recently. I myself ain't no extroverted, i have low self esteem too and never had been into any serious relationship, only hook ups. After flirting for a while, we combine to hang out (in the pandemic context), i can't remember but i think it was April. When we met i was in no surprise with her face, i still find her face beautiful, but i noticed that she is overweight (not a big problem for me at certain point) but was wearing long clothing so it went unnoticed. We kissed and had a little bit of physical contact (we were in my car). Weeks passed and last week we went out again, this time we had a lot more of physical contact (including very sexual contact) and i had a better understanding of her body... and it was a big turn off for me... she is way overweight than i can find attractive. I can't explain how bad i feel when i write this. She is a very sweet girl and i can't even think on break her heart. I simply don't know what to do, i lost all my sexual interest in her... i can't think on a relationship working this way. Also i fear for the worst, like she going suicidal, depressive, isolating herself from the rest of the world (she told me that already did it when had some complications back then).

I'm really bad but i think i can do her way worse... i'm the first guy that she actually had something. I must admit that this whole pandemic thing awakaned a lot of my bad character, things that i didn't do normally, things that all this time grounded at home i couldn't countain. I haven't already commited to her or propposed a long term relationship, only that i would like to wait this covid pandemic end to go into something more serious, but she's already telling her friends that i'm her boyfriend. I really like her and i wish that we could still be friends after this... i don't know what to do.

So about a year ago before I knew my girlfriend she ran away from home, she got raped while in the streets but didn't give police a proper response so they were never able to find the guy who did it. She went to therapy and a mental hospital and she thought she was over it. Fast forward to when we start dating the event caused her to lie, a lot, the last guy she had told before left her when she told him so she was terrified to tell me fearing I would do the same. Today she told me because from what I understand it's the 1 year mark and it all hit her again, she started cutting and she feels alone.

332,"One of my friends called me Saturday afternoon and asked me if I was going to one of our friends surprise 30th birthday with anyone. I said I’m going alone. Don’t have a date. He said would you like a date? Im like sure. His girlfriend, one of her friends was going with them. So she doesn’t third wheel. I figured I would go. My friend told me she messed around a lot and she is extremely wild. So I went with them. We got there. The whole time I had a feeling she was never interested even though my friend told me she likes skinny, tall tattooed guys. I tried making conversation and getting to know her, but she was never interested from the getko. I just played it off and drank and vibed with other guys that were at the house. It was about 30 other guys there with their girlfriends. Beer pong, music and alcohol and food. I observed and she was talking to some other guy and by the end of the night smoked weed with him and probably went home with that guy. While I left with my friend and his girlfriend. I try not to care since you can’t have the mentality every single girl will be attracted to you. I’ll get over it, but I’m just curious from a mans perspective or a woman’s perspective how do you cope with being rejected like that and not just being on a date at a bar or restaurant compared to a birthday party at a house with many other people? I understand if she is not attracted. I will always respect that no matter what and she’s free to talk to someone else at the party and go home with them. I could definitely use some advice since we all went to the party together and my friends girlfriend even told me listen my best friends is the type that’s ghosts a lot of people and messes around with guys she’s attracted to you.

333,"This is a very long post because I feel so incredibly guilty for feeling this way and I want to know if I am just a horrible person. I’m also not sure if I should talk to her about it.

Ok, so my friend (A), has been claiming that she was raped since January last year by her ex boyfriend (N). 

She told me a few years ago that she had been sexually assaulted by her ex boyfriend, N, which I believed. She said that he had done it several times and that she only had the courage to break it off after a few years of being with him. 

I started to believe she was lying when she told me that after she broke it off with him and she no longer had contact with him personally (their parents are friends) that she went to his house with her mum. I thought that this was odd since he had been saying she would never see him again. I still believed her at this point.

She told me that while she was visiting him and his mum that their parents had left and gone shopping, and that he’d attempted to rape her but failed. She then proceeded to leave with her mum without telling her this. 

So, for the next few months A says that N was trying to contact her (she still had him on all socials and still had his number) she said that she ignored him completely. Until, he said that there was going to be a reunion for their group of friends from school. She said ok which I thought was crazy since she has claimed that this guy had been sexually abusing her for at least 3 years. She asked me if she should go and I obviously told her not to go. I couldn’t convince her not to and told her to ask one of the girls N claimed was coming if she had been invited. This girl said that she hadn’t heard about it and urged A not to go. She knew about her history with N.  Eventually I convinced her not to go and we stopped talking about it and I assumed that was the end of it and that her and N would never have contact again like she had told me.

Then, in January of 2019 she messaged me telling me that she had gone to this “reunion” and had been raped. I was shocked and felt so guilty. Then A told me what had happened. 

This is the story; she had gone to meet this group of friends in a public space. Her ex was the only one there. He then proceeded to tell her that they weren’t meeting in this place and that they were meeting somewhere else and that they had to go somewhere else. She said ok and got onto the car. There were 3 or 4 other dudes in this car. She knew 1, he was a guy she had known in school and was friends with both her ex and her. 

The driver of this car then went into an alleyway and the 4 guys (including the friend) got out and she was locked in the car with her ex. She asked what was going on and he proceeded to rape her.

After she told me this I was obviously horrified and so upset.

She told me she went to the police and that they took samples because she escaped through an unlocked car door and escaped these men. 

Then N was apparently arrested for this although she said she was unsure about weather or not he had been arrested. This confused me.

After all this her ex still posts on Instagram and I have seen him in public (I don’t know him because me and A only became friends after they split). She told me that he had been found guilty and that he had been arrested an d out into prison. He was still posing on instagram a few days after the assault and I saw him maybe 3 months after A had been raped. 

A then tells me that she got pregnant from the rape. She said that she had attempted to have an abortion with a prescribed pill a few weeks after she had found out about her pregnancy but the pill didn’t work. She then told me that she suffered a miscarriage. Then a few weeks after this she claimed that the miscarriage was in fact one of the twins she was pregnant with being absorbed? This is a real thing btw. Then a few months in (around 12-14 weeks) she got an abortion with another pill.

That was the end of this and she doesn’t really talk about it much (which is understandable) but I can’t help feeling as though she’s lying to me. 

I feel awful about doubting her as we have been friends for years. I don’t know if I should say anything to her. Help!",07Jun2020,1

Basically I need advice about how to talk to my parents or what I should do because for the last 4 years of my life my parents have given me no trust whatsoever and have been so strict on my that I have experienced panic attacks after having to interact with them in any sort of negative matter. This lack of trust is completely unwarranted, as I have never given them a reason to not trust me having followed all of their rules for the last 19 years of my life. Recently I was approved for unemployment after being allowed by my parents to work a single job in my life. I thought with the money I might be able to save for the next few months and be able to maybe escape after not having any way to break free as they control every aspect of my financial life and I rely on them for gas money as I haven't been able to work due to them and their rules. Unfortunately I fear the worst because despite having been approved a week and a half ago I still haven't received my card.

338," So, I need brutally honest answers here, I want no pity. Today I got in an argument with a friend (ex friend) and I'm gonna give backstory.  I often like to make jokes about me....consuming things I probably shouldn't consume. Like old food, objects that aren't food. My friend has told me often that it's harmful, to which I tell her it will be fine. This has gone to her worrying about me, and I try to convince her not to because I genuinely don't want her to. Well, recently, it feels like whenever I try to have an intelligent conversation with her, I'm regarded as an idiot. I figured it was maybe anxiety and decided to ignore it. Well, last night, I had recently discovered a pitcher had a bit of mold in it, for idk how long. I cleaned it out, but I still had tea in that cup from that pitcher, and it tasted fine, so I figured no harm no fowl. I made a joke about it, saying I had a high CON for not getting sick. To which she then said I was ""a fucking dumbass"" well I was really upset and left the voice call, then dmed her. I'm going to post a long screenshot, bc I don't want to subconsciously manipulate the way this conversation went to be ""in my favor.""

I want to fix whatever the bad parts are even if its not all of me. At this point I want to remove myself from the friend group, because I know she told someone else, and I'm unsure how they feel. I want to forget about all of this and start fresh. But would it be shitty of me to leave without a warnings notice? I'm just so confused, and scared.

345,"I've known her for years. We were close to being in a relationship a few years ago, but it didn't work out because I said something extremely dumb, besides the point currently. She has always been someone I could just talk to about anything, and even through some really hard times for me, including fights and drama between me, and some close friends of both her and I, she was the one who came back and said she missed being able to talk to me and be my friend. Since our initial sort of split we had stayed friends, and continued talking, hence her coming back and reaching out after the drama.
I dated around after her and I were done, and ended up in an over a year long relationship I shouldn't have been in for any longer than 7 months (I realized I didn't love her, but was too afraid to hurt her or anyone else). That relationship ended in March. My dad and I went on a 12 hour trip to pick up a motorcycle he was buying, long 12 hour drives tend to bring up conversations, and I had yet to speak with him about it. He mentioned it, I explained it wasn't that painful, and it was then I had realized that the one ""breakup"" that really hurt was the one we weren't even dating. I realized that I had really loved her. My dad told me that if it was meant to be it would come around...
Fast forward a week or two after the trip, the girl I've been talking about's boyfriend breaks up with her. That was enough to convince me. We have since been talking much more than usual, and have even been staying up talking to eachother, sending hearts to say goodnight, something I wouldn't do to someone unless I really care about them.

348,"AITA for cutting off my friends who I feel crossed a major boundary?

I was out with a group of five friends who I have known since high school and we were drinking. I’m especially close with two of them who I consider to be best friends. It was my friends 21st and we ended up making a big night of it. I hadn’t been drinking for quite a few years and so I ended up getting drunker than expected, my tolerance must have waned. We ended up sharing a cab and crashing at a friends place who lives nearby. 

My friends know me to be a fairly shy person when it comes to showing my body. I was raised in a religious household and whilst I’m not religious I don’t feel comfortable showing skin. When I’m at the pool I wear shorts and a top, for example. I also have a couple of scars from physical abuse which I’m very self conscious about. Only my two best friends know about the scars and the abuse. 

Anyway, I ended up falling asleep on the couch whilst my friends were still up chatting and eating. I ended up waking up and throwing up on myself. I couldn’t talk properly and could hardly move, I couldn’t sit up or stand or coordinate myself. 

To cut a long story short, two of my five friends ended up carrying me to the bathroom, stripping me completely naked and bathing me. I remember feeling hands all over me including genital regions as they soaped me down. I tried to say no but it just came out as slurred speech. They dried me off and put a dressing gown on, and put me to bed. The two friends who did this were not my best friends.

One of my friends (not either of my best friends) stayed with me in the same bed. This friend has had feelings for me for a number of years and I had always set a boundary with them emotionally and physically so as not to lead them on or give them the wrong idea. During the night I apparently woke up overheating so they removed my dressing gown and continued staying in the same bed. So I was completely naked with them. I recall at one point my friend was rubbing my back and telling me I was okay when I was making noises but couldn’t make out words. I also remember them cuddling me whilst my dressing gown was off. 

When I spoke with my friends about it after I had sobered up, I expressed that I felt a boundary had been crossed, and that they didn’t look out for me in the way I thought they would have. That I felt violated that they saw me and touched me whilst I was naked. 

They said I was overreacting. That we have all known each other for years and that they knew I was safe and nobody had sinister intentions. That all of it was just out of care and concern for me, and that I was upset and not seeing it for what it is due to my childhood. That as my friends they acted in my best interests at the time even though they knew I would be feeling “dramatic” about it afterwards. 

I am upset because all of my friends knew how uncomfortable I am with my body and they all acknowledge they know had I been sober my preference would have been to stay in my own vomit than have them see me, touch and sleep with me naked. I can’t fully express in words all that I’m feeling right now. 

I ended up telling the group I need space and haven’t spoken to them in a week. They’re pretty angry with me and said I am disgusting making out there were sinister intentions. I don’t think that at all I just feel awful that they crossed a boundary that they knew I wouldn’t want them to. 

Please give it to me straight, am I overreacting? Did they do the wrong thing? I don’t know what to think anymore. Every time I think about it I feel like I want to disappear.",07Jun2020,1
349,"**tl;dr** Cut off my dad because he's going to vote for Trump again despite all that's happened lately. I'm scared for my life and don't want his energy bringing me down. But I feel guilt severing ties. Should I try to reconnect?

---

My dad and I always had conflict growing up. I ended up cutting him off for a few years because of his abusive behavior towards the family (and also to undergo my MtF transition). Years later we sort of reconnected. I forgave him for his abuses and he ended up being accepting of me.

I spoke to him more, went out for dinners with him, and genuinely tried to reconnect. I got him a new laptop because he needed one and helped him with technical issues remotely via Chrome Remote Desktop. Unfortunately this is where my image of him gets a little tainted.

Most (almost in the thousands) of his Facebook ""friends"" are these young looking Asian women he doesn't really know. This just grossed me out, knowing that he is currently seeing someone. (And I know for a fact that he isn't polyamorous.) It just felt icky.

His Facebook is filled with conservative posts and Trump images. With regards to his voting, it's fine with me if someone aligns with more conservative ideals. I respect the differences and even agree with some of their points. 4 years ago I would have understood why people voted for Trump. But not this time. With all of his actions in the past week, I just can't abide by it. I tried looking past it for a few weeks but it was always a nagging thought in the back of my mind.

As someone who is trans and deathly afraid for my rights as well as those in the red states, I just couldn't deal with this. I even wrote him a letter (with a translation in his language) to try to get through to him. I explained to him why I feared fascism fully taking over and that I was willing to risk losing my job and life protesting.

His response? He sends me a video of black men breaking into a Wells Fargo during the protests and riots. Out of all the crap that's been happening, this is what he's focusing on. Not the cops beating peaceful protesters, not the DC protesters getting tear gassed. But black men looting a Wells Fargo. I don't like the looting either, and I understand the anger of the unheard. But these looters are a minority! And for what it's worth, he definitely has exhibited anti-black sentiments in the past. I doubt that has changed.

It's as if he didn't even read my letter. It felt like such a slap in the face. Despite him escaping a war torn country where their cops treat their citizens like shit, he shows that he's willing to vote just for that here. I promptly blocked him from Facebook, my phone, and all forms of contact.

I feel sad and guilty. We were just starting to mend things. But right now I just can't have this negative energy in my life. Am I the asshole? Should I try to reconnect again at a later time?",07Jun2020,1
351,"A week ago, I got a random email asking to confirm my email for this website called milfplays or something. I deleted the email. I never even heard of the website until that day. But that means that someone used my email somehow to make an account.

I got two emails today from bots that say some dumb shit like “hey you, I sent pics, send some back” and “boring weekend? Hit me up” 

I marked them as spam, and for the first time, decided to check my spam folder (not sure if this has been going on for a while, or if it’s happening because of the email I got a week ago), and I have HUNDREDS of these emails just from today alone. 

I really don’t like that I’m getting these emails to begin with. It feels like someone has access to my account. I don’t like that someone used my email for some adult dating/porn site. What do I do?

I’ve changed my emails password, but is there anything else I can do?",07Jun2020,1
352," 

Context: I (28M) got fit, joined clubs and followed the usual advice to get better when I wondered why I got rejected all the time. It didn't bring much, people don't consider me as friend or boyfriend material and I spent my life lonely so far, never had a relationship or intimacy.

Without saying too much, I told I had been single for a long while to some  acquaintances, one of these told me let's go eat together and consider it a date. We talked more there, and I admitted it was the first date I ever had. She dropped it there, saying that not having a single  experience at that age was a red flag. I asked some other people and  they told me the same, basically people in their twenties try, stumble, but also learn what they can give and want in a relationship. People want other people they can connect with, including on a relationship  level, and it was a red flag for them too.

In short, my self-esteem that wasn't high before died that day and for the sake of my mental health I just cut contact with the outside world. So my question is, for those that had a very (very) long bout of intense loneliness with no friends, SO or intimacy, how did you cope and make peace with it?",07Jun2020,1

365,"So get ready for a bit of a long story. About 2 1/2 years I met my bsf she was a girl who I honestly didn’t even expect to talk to outside of our one meeting (through a mutual friend). We were really close and she would come to me about her problems I would come to her about my problems and she was just the greatest friend I’ve ever had. She helped me take back control of things, she helped me with my frequent drinking, I had stopped getting into mischief with my friends, I helped her with her mentally abusive bf, I helped her with fitting in (she was bullied when younger) and we were just amazing friends. Last September I met a girl who I was absolutely love sick over(didn’t work out) but I had abandoned my bsf for some chick who I later learned would play around with all but 4 guys in her life. I had abandoned my bsf for 3 months and in December I finally just went back to my bsf after she warned me countless times. I would text her later just because I was too busy doing my own stuff which was literally just texting other ppl. But she still took me back as being bsf after all of that. Then the new year hits and she gives me a bracelet that symbolized our friendship it had our respective nicknames for eachother on them. Well In March I meet some other chick we go out for a while I was unhappy but I was trying to make it work cuz yk was still kinda hungover on the previously mentioned ex. Yeah me and bsf start having problems because we start arguing and fighting because of her and I’m trying to make both my friendship and relationship work except they both dislike eachother. I give up on the relationship cuz I realized I wasn’t happy and then me and my bsf still get into fights because I had become cold and she was basically done listening to me whine about some bitchy chick that she warned me about. I started flaking, being cold to her, she’s prolly heard me say some excuse I made up or a meaningless sorry more than her own name, would just stop responding or even texting and then I started drinking again. She texts me one day saying “wtf is going on with u?” And I tell her off. She texts again while I’m drunk and she hates the fact of me drinking because she knew of the problem I had. And right there she tells me to just leave the friendship and to not talk to her again, the bracelet she gave me she told me to burn it and the last thing she ever said to me was “you burn the bridges of friendship you burn what represents it, adios”

But it was just me and her for about 6 months around the start of the new school year and it was going fine. Then one of R'S friends started to hang out with us and R started to get really upset often. She would tell me how much she hated that i would talk to P, and that P was trying to ruin our friendship. I stopped talking to P for a few months after that because I believed R. Towrds the middle of the school year, I wanted to know more about P so i tried to make her be my friend and it worked. R was pissed because she 'wasnt good enough to be my friend' and that 'P is dumb anyway, why do you even need her?' But i convinced R to give P another chance and thought R was being childish. It was just R,P and me for the rest of that year.

The next year, R and I did not have the same lunch schedule and only had 2 classes together, so i made about 5 new friends to have lunch with, including P. I told R about how i had made new friends and she wasnt really happy with that. She would try to make up rumors about my FG (friendgroup) and with the 2 classes we had together, she would be clingy get mad if I would talk to anybody else. I started to try to drift off from her but after school she would kick my ankles and legs, saying it was a 'joke'. I told her I was mad about it and she threatens to 'leak'  lot of my personal mental issues if I stop talking to her. Thought if I spent more time with her she would be fine but it got worse. 

When our school changed semesters, every student had to take a new 'special class' like art, stem, music act. I got put in a group with P , a lunchtime friend (LT) and a class mate friend (CM) . we always have to do group projects in that class and it was always us 4. P would always get mad at me when i would talk to CM and LT and work on the group project. It got to the point where P would make fun of LT'S weight in front of her face and would always try to fight CM.

370,"This is a bit long but only to explain all the details and why I’m so conflicted and need help 

I’m in a large group chat with my friends and before you call this petty middle school drama..... yeah we’re 20 year olds with middle school drama pretty much. BUT I still need help because I’ve never been in this situation and I don’t know what to do. 

One of my friends (A) is really sweet. She introduced me to this group like a year ago and I’ve met some nice people. Another guy in the group (M) also seems cool but I never talked with him much directly, only interacting with him in group settings. 

Drama started between A and M a while ago and no one in the group knew about it until recently when A let it build up inside without telling anyone and exploded. She left the chat and later told me what happened because we grew really close. 

Later M texted me individually and said he doesn’t know why A is acting like this, she’s over reacting and such. I tried to speak neutrally since I don’t know the whole story, but A sent me screenshots of M saying some really hurtful words to her and accusing her of things that weren’t true. The messages A showed me were full of him guilt tripping her about her smaller friend groups and stuff and not being included (he’s been invited to everything that I’ve been invited to, so this was a surprise to me). 

A few days ago though M was talking about A in the group chat saying how she’s been over dramatic and just wants to start drama and that’s why she made a big deal and left the chat. Other people were joining in and saying like “yeah it’s not that big of a deal, she’s a clout-chaser, etc.” Some people were defending A saying we don’t know the whole story and maybe she’s going through some stuff and it’s not nice to talk behind her back. 

I’ve had this chat in do not disturb for a long time now, just checking in now and then to see how people are doing. I checked it this morning and saw all of these messages, M brought up this topic multiple times when the conversations had changed already. 

There’s such a stigma around “snitches get stitches” but I feel like I owe it to A to at least tell her that her friends are talking about her behind her back. I took screenshots of the messages but haven’t done anything yet. I’m afraid I’d be taking it too far and the group will ostracize me for being a snitch, but I’m also afraid for A. She’s so sweet and always has people’s backs. She’s like the nice friend who always bakes you cookies for you birthday. 

I FEEL like the right thing to do is to tell A. But I don’t KNOW for sure because I’ve never experienced drama like this. Am I being naive? Am I really being a snitch? I promise I’m trying to look out for my friend but I know it could get twisted in a bad light. She doesn’t deserve this hate people are talking about her.",07Jun2020,1

I’m constantly paranoid my neighbors son (18) is watching me from his window, even though he has no reason too. I’m also paranoid that I’m going to get kidnapped or murdered when walking my dog. I live in a good neighborhood, but I still get terrified when a car slows down next to me. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t want to go outside (referring to both the neighbor and walking my dog). 

I sometimes start arguments with my parents that end with me crying and my parents lecturing me.

I want to change, but every time I try to do something different, my parents say something like “wow! you hung up your clothes! i asked you to do it for a month, and you finally did it!” in a sarcastic tone. It makes me feel like I’m not supposed to do it, and makes me afraid to try anything new.

I have also started hating my face/body. I sometimes look in the mirror for a few minutes trying to imagine what I wish I looked like. This is making me concerned because I used to love my body, but now all I see is flaws.

Last semester in college I flunked on all of my classes (3 classes with 11 units) ever since the COVID-19 outbreak was to be feared where I lived. I was on  top of all of my classes before the pandemic took place. One of my classes english is a general ed. Class that I had to take despite my animosity for it. That class for E-learning took up 98% of my time and I had no time for a break. I litterally worked on essay after essay. Even working on it overnight. The teacher was nice and made the work fair but for some reason I had such a hard time on a few essays. I'd sometimes have a break down overnight because the work was just too overwhelming. And I hadn't touch anything from my 2 classes. I had to EW (Excuse withdraw) because if I failed my classes it would put me on grade probation. It sounds bad but realistically I don't know what grade probation is but I know its bad and its basically for people who had failed classes. Though the consequences of an EW is that it will affect my financial aid. So I had to put and EW for the classes and only focus on my english. On May 23rd was the last day to turn in anything and it was finals day. I screwed up on the finals and my grade went from a C to an D. When I found out about it like about a week later. I just felt devastated and I felt so ashamed and humiliated... now I never told anyone this but... i actually wanted to... harm myself.  when my mom found out about me failing english, she was just so disappointed.

Everyone who graduated in the same field as me has a job, but because of the virus, I was put off and still won’t be able to work in my field. Seeing all my friends and classmates post that they’re back at work and doing what they love hurts me a lot. I see them posting pictures and videos and it makes me want to crawl in a hole. Everyone got their jobs before the pandemic, even the ones who graduated after me, and somehow it took me until the middle of the pandemic to be “hired” where just as things opened back up I was basically fired.

My friends hang out with each other, talk to each other all the time, but the second I get in the conversation it’s “oh we should hang out soon?” When is soon? I ask, and it’s just “soon.” I have also let go of people who have been nothing but negative and shaming and racist. It has really narrowed down my friendships. I’m also the one who always has to start the conversation, and unless I post something on my snapchat story or ig story, no one talks to me out of the blue, I’m the only one.

My boyfriend and I have been together over a year, and we plan on moving in together when we can. I thought I would be moving in sooner, but it doesn’t seem like he wants me to, because he mentions the lease, and how I’m not on it and how I need to be if I move in and he’s not sure if he can get me on the lease. He also doesn’t text me very much anymore when we are apart, and I feel annoying when I text him. There are times he won’t even reply to my text for days. If I don’t text him first or ask him when he’s free, he rarely texts me; I think he’s done it twice if not three times in our whole relationship. I know he wants time to spend with friends, and I completely understand, because I would too. But he could have the decency to text me why he’s busy or why he can’t get together until a certain day? I just feel less enthusiasm when he texts me like he doesn’t want to hear about my day or what I’m up to, when I want to hear all about his. Sometimes when we do get together I’ll just try to stay quiet until he does something to acknowledge me, which he normally does. Things are usually better when we’re actually together. I just get this sinking feeling that he’s slowly starting to realize he doesn’t want to be with me anymore, because it’s not the first time it’s happened in a relationship for me.

I just feel really unwanted. I can’t go to my mom because she’s not helpful and the last advice I want to get is “break up with him.” And she’s also really not that sympathetic. Plus I don’t like her being in my business anymore, then she’ll try to find more things like a diary or something and invade my privacy.

Anyway, I’m probably just sounding like a whiny bitch. Also, I’ve tried therapy, but I broke the bank and I’m not comfortable with going to something that’s attached to a church for free.",07Jun2020,1
390,"Hey, 18f here with severe depression and an awful/rocky family history that caused me to move out in March. However, right after I moved out I went through a messy breakup, covid hit hard so I couldn't see any friends or go to school, my new medicine made me super sick, and my dad's cancer came back. For the rest of March and April I was holed up in my apartment basically just sleeping and playing video games all day, I didn't have a job then but I got one mid-April. My new job is closer to my parents house. In the beginning of May I had a massive breakdown, over nothing really, I guess everything just piled up, and I came home to stay with my parents. Mom primarily, dad is a hoarder and lives in the garage. I thought I would be here for a couple days or a week, but its been a month of me living here with barely any of my things, I just sleep and work and thats it. Not to mention I fucking hate my job and am looking into doing something more flexible. 

Anyways, I signed a 1 year lease for the apartment so I can't just leave. On one hand I want to go back there and have my own space again, but I barely even have any furniture and I really can't afford to buy any and make it comfortable. I think that maybe if I break the lease, I guess I'll have to pay the security deposit and 1 or 2 months rent(?), then I'll still have leftover money saved and I can afford to make my bedroom at home more comfortable. But I also don't want to be that kid in college going into their 20's and later still living with their parents. My sister especially shames me for this and makes me feel pathetic. I don't know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",07Jun2020,1
391,"I 27m afraid of talking to new women.   
I have something I want to change about myself. If I see a beautiful  woman I like and she gives me good social feedback (like eye contact, staying close to me, laughing at me) I want to be able to approach and flirt with her. I always feel like I'm getting stuck in my mind when an opportunity presents itself. I missed lots of beautiful women because of this and most importantly there were some women I really liked and think it would've get somwhere with her and share a beautiful story. Unfortunately I almost always fail. Somehow I always miss my chance, by not making a move or by waiting too long.

392,"So, I only hang out with this 1 person, and that's like once a month or so bc I have no friends and two of us have nothing in common, we met in high school and stayed 'friends' only bc (how I view it at least) everyone else from our group lives far from us as so I figure that the person settled for me bc I'm only one close. I never fully consider them as friend more like acquaintance bc we have way different point of view on so many things and I hate myself for hanging out with person that doesn't make me feel comfortable bc they're both racist and xenophobic also very religious which makes them stuck up on so many other things among being homophobic. I've tried so hard to find middle ground with so many conversations about all of this but they're not even opened to fully listening what someone says. Can't ever confy to them bc they don't believe in mental health being a thing.
I don't know how to end this 'friendship' bc truth be told even if I don't feel good around them I still settle for their company bc it's only one that I have. As a person they're good but have a mindset of a person stuck in like 17th century.",07Jun2020,1

394,"Hi I’m sorry if this isn’t on the correct thread but I didn’t know where else to ask.
Due to the pandemic, we can’t wear our uniform to and from work and have to have temperature checks and wear a mask . I’m perfectly fine with this as I understand it’s a hygiene issue , however when we’re actually paid is getting later and later .
To explain, our clock -in machine is in the back of our store . We cannot enter this area until we are fully in our uniform and any protective gear , so the whole 25 minutes that we are required to be there before starting is unpaid .Then, when we go on our 45-minute unpaid break we are required to change into our own clothing. There is only one toilet for males and females and this often means waiting whilst on our breaks (as this is where we get changed).We then have to change into our uniform again and put on new ppe before returning to work. This whole time is unpaid .  This eats into a lot of our free time where we’re supposed to be able to do whatever we want as we are not paid for breaks (it is timed on the clock in system ). We then have to get changed again before leaving. This seems to me and my colleagues like we’re doing a lot of ‘work’ for the store and being unpaid . Anyone know what our rights are ?(UK)",07Jun2020,1
395,"I got suspended for theft that I didn’t do. I have a coworker that accused me of letting somebody walk out with an item. Funny thing is he is always stealing. Anyway, he told my boss this back in April and I heard about it through other people. I never brought it up because I wasn’t worried about it, I didn’t do anything so what was there to discuss right? Well, Friday comes around and asset protection talked to me over the phone trying to interrogate me, giving me chance after chance to make me tell on myself. He kept trying to act like my friend but I knew where it was going. It got to the point where I told him I had no idea what he was talking about and had no recollection of letting somebody walk out with something unpaid and that I had nothing else to say to him. I offered to pay for it because I was the manager on duty and if due to my lack of diligence the item disappeared then I would take responsibility for it. He said that I can pay for it (about $140) and had me right a statement of what we had talked about and told me I was suspended. 
Here is some background: there were no cameras at the time of the incident. 
I have no reason to steal because I am more than fine financially. 
The item was gone the day after I worked with the guy that accused me, because the manager asked where it went the next day so a cycle count was done. 
Asset protection told me I was suspended and that my manager would be in contact with me. I’m not sure what to think or do, I have no idea what they are talking about and I was about to get a promotion. I don’t see why they would come at me with that kind of accusation if they weren’t going to fire me, and why would they wait almost two months to take action on it? I’m not sure what to do or where I stand with the company at this point. Any thoughts or advice?",07Jun2020,1

397,"Just before I write all of this and ask for advice, I want to say that I have seen a neurologist for over the past year: right now they’re having difficulty discerning what’s happening to me and are making me take tests over time (it’s already been a year and a half)

This is beginning to be incredibly scary to me. For the two years, I’ve begun to forgot the name of some common objects and then can never remember new people’s names unless I actually really try. Or I forget acquaintances’ names all the time. I forgot the faces of very few acquaintances as well when I saw them again.

I am a senior graduating university at the moment and pretty academically gifted. What’s begun in the past year has been the most bothersome and crippling to me and is thoroughly impacting progress in my fields of interest. Perhaps this should be less of the worry than the fact my general well-being has suffered immensely. I have been excluding myself from talking to as many people out of total fear in either having to share what I’m going through and put more stress on them, or simply for me to get stressed at the potential of my memory slips happening while spending time with them and me dreading on it later. It’s also hard to hang with people when I feel fraud if anything about the future comes up. Dreams. Even love.

I even feel bad already for the amount of times I’ve been crying to my mother about this because I don’t know who the hell else to talk to.

What made me go back to my neurologist last fall was when, all of a sudden, I was constantly switching words (and even worse than words that just sound like or are similar to the word I try to write sometimes) or forgetting to write words in my sentences. This also began to happen to me while I speak, and this has been TERRIBLE. I’m a writer, so it just throws me into never-ending panic while I’m working. This hasn’t disappeared even though it is now June. I also began to have spatial navigation issues and balance issues.

To quickly explain the PTSD incident. It was caused by weed. I might’ve had a seizure, it was unknown. I went home from the hospital with blindsight! For a year after that, constant panic attacks. Myoclonic seizures (which could be anxiety-based) to this day. Life-crippling anxiety. Bodily-spatial confusion.

That stuff got a little better, then I started noticing the worsening memory problems. And I still probably have real bad anxiety, still have occasional panic attacks from every now and then. Still have derealization/depersonalization but less.

What I need help with is how to keep calm, how to stop fearing the idea that I may not be as loveable or not be able to mutually love someone if things don’t turn out well for me...maybe even advice on if I need to let go of this existentialist mindset that is set on being prepared for the idea I might have this terrible terminal illness. Is it not bad to be prepared? And lastly, if my perception is deceiving me and I should instead sit in some form of hope? I have never been so scared in my life. Please if you have any advice or words of comfort I will GREATLY, GREATLY appreciate it during this time.

I can’t help but realize I have written this for some glimmer of hope. I don’t know what form that may be possible in for my situation, but I can only hope. Love to everyone. Thanks.",07Jun2020,1

Every time I told them about family problems, anything about my music, or even about what I’m going to wear, they always comfort me and tell me my music is nice and tell me I dress well. But after we get into a friendly argument (As a joke to one another), they start takin it serious only on me. They tell me things suck as, get your family together, that’s why your dad almost left you, you should stop trying to make music, we always know what your going to where before you even come. And the thing regarding clothes, they know my family is going through a little bit of money issues because there trying to save for a house, but they never try to understand that. They just try to make me feel like shit all the time.

And recently I started growing out my hair, and my family likes it so does the girl I talk to. Not to long ago( I would say like 2 days ago) they just started talking about my hair telling me it’s bad and they asked do you really feel ok with your hair like that, and I told them yes, and just laughed and told we’re just looking out for you, so you should just go back to having short hair, long story short they told me the girl i was talking to was delusional if she talked me looking like myself. After that I hung up the Group FaceTime call and haven’t talk to them since.

Tbh I just feel like they don’t respect as a person and they just bring up anything from the past to make me feel worse and worse and I hate it.

I really value our friendship but he says a lot of things that really throw me off track. After these past couple of months I’ve started to gain feelings for him. 

He would always tell me how he wish he could protect me and is always there for me regardless of the situation. He always gives me his support emotionally.

I was really looking forward to seeing him on campus and more often in person. When he told me he would be leaving I expressed how sad I was but I didn’t really get the reaction I was expecting. 


He said he would really miss me too and that we could talk on the phone and he’d come visit on breaks etc . I’m just really thrown off by this sudden news.

407,"My mom has been an alcoholic for pretty much my entire life. 

She will not admit she has a problem and thinks getting drunk 5 days a week by noon is completely normal. The worst part is that my dad, even though he knows how horrible she gets when drunk, just enables it. My mom doesn't have a job or any savings, she is completely reliant on my dad financially, meaning that she cannot buy the shit on her own. 

Instead, my dad just leaves her an allowance (she cannot be trusted with money, she'll just run to the liquor store and buy booze, she's stolen from me before) or worse, he'll cave and run up to the liquor for her. We've talked about this many times and he's promised to put his foot down but he won't. I almost think he likes seeing her drunk and belligerent,

She'll pick fights with anyone who's closest to her. She's been physically and verbally abusive to me since childhood. Some of my earliest memories are of her being ""loud and scary"" (before I knew what liquor was.) She's given more more bruises and black eyes than I can count. When I got older and became a teenager, she got more aggressive and started threatening to kill me. Once when when I was 12 or 13, she wrapped her hands around my neck and choked me. I got away somehow but I think blocked most of the memory out. When I confronted her about it the next morning, she told me that I was exaggerating. Now I'm 18 and can defend myself now but the scars are still there.

I've confronted her about how horrible she gets but she either, gives me a half-assed (borderline sarcastic) apology or just makes excuses for herself. Sometimes, she'll get defensive and call her drinking ""self medicating.""

I can't live like this anymore. I struggle with my mental heath and  this environment is horrible for me. I'm almost 19 but I can't find a job right now (I've applied with no responses) and have few savings, so I can't just move out.

413,"So one of my only hobbies is gaming and a year ago my dad bought a gaming pc which I found for the family. It was acctually supposed to be for my mom and me because our laptops have stopped working. Gaming is one of the only things which really makes me happy, so about a month ago I decided to buy a mechanical keyboard and a mouse.  I payed all of the money for it but my brother decided then that his laptop isn't good enough and he has to use the computer to watch lectures all morning. It would be fine but with one of the lectures, he could listen to it on spotify from his ipad and the other is something which he needs a app for which he can't get on his laptop since he put linux on it. My dad has one of those things to put windows on a laptop or pc but my brother won't use it. Now everyday when I want to game he is there and is watching videos. Each time I tell him to do it on his laptop but he always says: "" Well my laptop has got linux on it so I can't use this app which I need. And in my bedroom there isn't any wifi."" 
Today I checked and the wifi in his bedroom is perfect. 
He could put windows  on his laptop but he doesn't want to and keeps on using my keyboard and mouse at the computer which where really expensive. When i tried disconnecting them and taking them away he hit me. ( he does this alot ).

419,"Recently I (25M) found myself being ignored by the people in my close friends circle. I’ve noticed my light hearted joking has been misconstrued as if what I had said were very hurtful insults. The individual in mind got very upset one night, when I was drinking with a few friends. That person asked who would pick up food for everyone once we ordered online. Seeing as this person was the only one who hadn’t had alcohol at that point, I snakily suggested that they should go. I was grinning the whole time and really didn’t mean anything nefarious...I don’t even know how that is a bad suggestion. Maybe I was being a prick, idk. In the same night I overheard my name being thrown around behind a closed door followed by cadences in this person’s voice that I would say was very negative. Now I am scared that I may lose all of my closest friends to this person’s over exaggerated “stories” about me.

A quick summary of why I think this person is narcissistic:
-every story is quickly “one-upped” by them
-most conversations end up gravitating to them being the center of attention
-as I have stated above, their ego is easily touched
-they try to control others like an angry mother for small infractions
-their stories usually involve them being a major victim
-they try to be the smartest person in the room by repeating trivial facts most people know

This is the first time I have really experienced this and I am having a lot of anxiety. I normally am fairly neutral to most things and don’t get emotional easily, but I don’t know what to do and have resorted to reddit for help. Thank you to anyone who could give me some advice.",07Jun2020,1

Our sex life is suffering, as her excess makes it difficult to fully enter, and usually she doesn't seem to even (seemingly) want to have sex.

I've been told it's wrong to ask for advice and I should do my own research as a white person, but I'm seriously at a loss with how to respond to family members that are ignorant towards racism. They say they aren't racist but they also won't accept any factual information I provide on why the Black Lives Matter movement is so important. They won't read any articles I put forward or change their way of thinking.

The thing is my family were affected by the IRA bombings in the UK and as they are Irish they were subject to racial abuse themselves, but more along the lines of how bigots treat Muslims because of ISIS and not due to the colour of their skin. I thought they'd understand how important the protests going on today are as black people fight for equality and justice. But I'm at a loss.

428,"Hi redditors,
It would bei super nice, if someone could help me on my problem because I have absolutely no idea what to do with it. So let's start.

A few years ago my grandmother sadly passed away and I was entitled to inherit a large amount of gold, because my grandfather was a goldsmith (who passed away way earlier). The problem is that I live in Europe and the gold is in South America, so it's a bit difficult to import it, because of taxes and I would lose a fair bit of the value. However, the biggest issue is, that it is very old gold and some bars are smolten from scraps of rings and thus have no serial number. I don't know how much value gold loses if it doesn't have a serial number or if it is even possible to sell it. Maybe there is a dude who can put a serial number onto them, but I don't have any idea what would be the best choice. So I ask you my fellow redditors, maybe you can help me. Maybe someone is a gold expert and can help me with that unusual situation. It would be super nice if you could help me. Thanks!

429,"I don't know how to start these,  but i'll start with some background information.

I've known this girl for 3 years now, and for the majority of those 3 years i had feelings for her and we ended up getting really close. We spent so much time together that i could tell what type of joke she would make before she said it, the point is we were close. After 2 years there was a night where she just looked so pretty dancing with her friends and I couldn't help but feeling frustrated almost that I didn't know anything about her feelings toward me. That very night i told her how i felt and she told me she had been thinking about it recently, but that she didn't feel ready for anything at the time. I waited a month and asked her to the movies so we could spend some time together, but she wasn't comfortable because it felt too much like a date, something came over me and it made me upset. After that we stopped talking for 3 months and when we started talking again i felt guilty with how i reacted, i told myself i would wait until i was emotionally mature enough to handle rejection to even bring up dating again, if i lost feelings for her in that time then I would just move on. But as i tried to convince myself i wanted to be with someone else i realized that there was nobody that could make me feel the same way i felt when i was around her. So it's been a year, we started calling each other almost as frequently as we used to, we stay up till 3 AM talking about the future, we play games with each other and laugh till we're too tired to stay up any longer.

Its only been a year, but do i go for it again? Should i approach things a certain way?",07Jun2020,1
430,"I come from a small town of a little over 1200 people. I just graduated college in a different state, and I’m visiting my hometown until my next job starts. 

I went to a bar last night/this morning. I eventually had to walk back “home” a couple blocks down the road to check on my lizard. When I came back, I walked through an alley right next to the bar I was drinking at. While I was doing this, I saw a man hit a woman with her back against the wall. I was shocked. He then proceeded to threaten her.

Since I was walking by, I called out “What the fuck is wrong with you!?” This may have not been the best choice of words, but I was intoxicated at this point. When I said that, the man started threatening me as well. He started following me until I rounded the corner to the back of the bar. I then got one of my friends to come with me to see what was going on in the alley. I saw the woman who was hit leave the other side of the alley just as I got there. The man remained lurking near the back of the bar.

Next I tried to find the woman. However, I went a long way around to try and avoid the man in the alley. As a result, I couldn’t find her once I got to where I last saw her.

I returned to the bar after that. I was drunk and angry. I told my friends what happened, and found out who h the man is. I know who he is now, and I feel like I should do something.

431,"I’m a 23 year old who graduated university a year ago and am at a point where I’m able and ready to move out. My parents, however, don’t want me to. More specifically it’s my mom; she can’t fathom having me move out and pay someone else’s mortgage. My dad has always supported whatever I want to do, but even so he thinks it might be better for me to stay home right now. I have a toxic relationship with my mother and have always felt belittled and controlled by her. I really do believe moving out is the best choice for my mental health, even if not the ideal choice long-term financially.

I was about ready to sit them down and tell them I had found a place and was moving out, but then a few things happened:

1) They tried to get me to stay at home by offering to purchase an apartment with me. Supposedly COVID will impact the housing market in my city greatly, potentially making it possible to get into what is currently an unafforable market. Owning a home is something I never thought I’d be able to do in my city, but I don’t think I want to own a place with my parents. I’ve spoken with friends who say it wrecked their relationship with their parents and led to a lot of guilt.

2) We just found out our beloved dog has cancer and only has 1-3 months left. We started her on chemotherapy, which should extend her lifespan to 6-9 months, but it requires feeding/meds 7x per day. My parents have gone back to the office now, but I’m still working from home and my sister is doing school online so it’s mainly up to her and I to look after the dog. I worry if I move out my mom will stop the chemo because she can’t manage it and then when the dog dies she’ll blame me (she loves to blame me for things). But if I stay, it may be another 6-9 months, and perhaps longer by the time the dog dies and my mom recovers from her grief.

How do I handle this? Should I be waiting to move out until a potentially better time for my family? Do I consider purchasing with my parents? If I just decide to move out now, how do I have that conversation and what do I say? It always ends in a huge family argument that lasts for days.

I was raped by my brother when I was about 15 and it fucked me up really badly. I couldn't tell anyone and it ruined me slowly. I cut myself severly, dropped out of school, wanted a socially acceptable reason for my depression. I abused valium, zolpidem, etc. I also had sex with a stranger I met on the internet which leads to my problem right now. I also had an abusive boyfriend, starved myself. I thought I would kill myself in a few years so I didn't care about myself, actually wanted to be in a accident, hated myself for not killing myself and still having that 1 percent of hope that it would get better.


I am grateful that I had hope. I started getting my life back together. I actually enjoy being alive. I feel normal, got into a good school, have good friends who really care, an okay relationship with my parents, got therapy/took medication which I quit now. I am so desperately hopeful for a happy future, which seems possible now. When I think about my shitty past, I feel disgusted by how low I have hit. I am scared that I might lose control again, but I try to stay strong and keep going. I try to take responsibility for my past actions but at the same time don't feel like the same person who was so self destructive.


A few months ago I got a message from the guy I met on the internet. He had sex with me when I was a minor. It was under consent, and the app I used was usually for sex for pay kinda stuff. I didn't take money, I remember I felt like I wanted to face having sex which so traumatized me, with my own decision. Anyways he wanted to meet me again and I refused.


Yesterday while talking to a friend, she told me she got a dm from a stranger, who I believe is that guy. He told her I used to be a sex worker and not to keep me around. This friend knows I used to be stupid and depressed and she just wanted to let me know. 


I don't know how to feel. Even if it was illegal bc I was a minor, I did it on my own consent. I was very stupid and regret it deeply and didn't do anything about it.
I feel weak because I can't do anything about past actions I made. I don't ask anyone to understand my shitty actions, but I don't want it effecting me in any way. I just wish for a normal life. I don't know what to do when something like this happens. What should I do?

435,"Hey guys,

I'm not really sure where is best to post this, but figured this sub may be a decent guess.

Two months ago I got a call from a friend of mine who works at a vet surgery. They'd had a young cat (approx 9 months at the time) brought into their office with a broken leg, no microchip and not neutered. At the point she had called, she had looked after him for a week and had posted many flyers / posters / online adverts asking whether anybody knew of his owners and nobody had come forward.

She called me and asked whether I would be interested in adopting him, but informed me that he would require surgery for the damaged leg which in the end cost me £3k. On top of that, I got him neutured and microchipped as well as defleaed and dewormed. Plus two lots of x rays on his leg. Overall, I've spent approx £3.7k on vet bills alone to get this little guy cleaned up. They estimated that his leg had been broken for quite a while, as it had started to heal itself in a terrible position.

Fast forward to two days ago and somebody I know contacted me to say that there had been a knock on her door around the area that the cat had been found. A lady said that her cat had been missing for 2 months, but she had only just started looking for him that day. The description she gave matched my cat, but she didn't speak very good English and so we can't be sure.

My friend didn't say anything to her, but she let me know just in case she went on to contact the vet surgery.

I understand that in England I don't really have a leg to stand on when it comes to the legalities of cat ownership. However, I would obviously like to keep the cat as we've grown very close but I get that if she asks for him back, I would most likely have to hand him over.

Has anybody been in this situation before? And if she did ask for him back, would I be in the position to request the £3.5k back from her as she clearly didn't look after the cat in the first place?

Thanks in advance.",07Jun2020,1

I tried asking her about the distances and why we haven’t hung out/talked much and she told me that she just wanted to give me “space.” The last time I tried asking, she said I was going through a lot and that I was being was selfish. 

Whenever someone is going through something no matter what it is you don’t want to give them “space,” you want to be there for them.

438,"Since the start of this year, my relationship with my family (mainly my Mum) has changed in a negative way. 
I've been thinking about the cause of this for days and I think i've come to some sort of conclusion.

I'm (23F) currently in a commitment relationship (27M) and have been for the past 18 months. Since meeting my partner i've changed. I believe it's for the better, but I think my family sees it differently. I've become less dependent on my family, I spend most of my time with him and my interests have changed. For example, (this is a big one my parents always bring up) I used to be heavily into Triathlons, but stopped training and competing a couple months into dating him. This WASN'T because of him and I've told my parents that multiple times. I just lost the love for the sport and it become a core! 

My partner and I been share the same interest of moving overseas and living there for an extended period of time. And because we share this interest, we have planned to actually move there in the next couple of months/year (obviously this plan was affected by Covid-19). When I told my family they weren't impressed and didn't come across as very supportive. 
I feel like whenever I tell my family something involving my partner, for example going on a weekend holiday, they don't show interest and change the subject. They never ask me how the relationship is going and ask how he is when I speak to them. They don't show any interest. 

My boyfriend has a rough past. He was addicted to weed for approximately 5 years and was abused my his stepdad. I tell my Mum most things, so she knows a bit about his past. After telling her this, I noticed she started acting differently around him. I felt like she was watching him closely and stopped making conversation with him. I bought this up with her a couple of months ago and she denied it all, saying it was in my head. But she's still doing it and my partner even said something to me the other day about it. He said he feels like she's cold towards him and doesn't try and make conversation. He also believes that they look down on him because he doesn't have a full-time job (this is mainly due to us wanting to move overseas) and doesn't have much money. I honestly don't think my parents would judge someone because of that, but i'm not sure anymore. 
I understand that my parents might be worried with me dating someone who was into drugs, but that's in his past and he doesn't do it anymore. They know this. 

During ISO, I moved into his house so we could see eachother. We work in the same industry and are both out of work, so it just made sense. My family supported this decision and even suggested it because it would mean I didn't have to travel as much and risk getting sick. While staying here, I've felt amazing! His family have welcomed me and have made me feel as if I'm part of them. I've honestly had the best time! But I've noticed that my parents NEVER call me to check in, I have to call them. 
Now when I go home to see them, I feel awkward and don't feel like I'm part of the family anymore. They make jokes about me coming home and make comments about me not living there. For example, they always tell me how much cleaner the house is without me and how how nice its been since I haven't been there. I leave feeling horrible! 

I've spoken to my Mum about most of this and she just pushed it away or tells me she just wants me to be happy. I tell her I'm very happy but its like she doesn't believe me! She makes me feel like I have to walk around with a smile on my face 24/7 to prove that i'm happy!
I wish there was a way to show them how happy I am. My partner and I spend most of time laughing and very rarely have arguments. We share the same dreams and values and I can honestly say I can see myself spending the rest of my life with him. He's helped me achieve lots of things since dating and makes me feel like I can do anything. 

I used to tell my Mum everything. She used to be my bestfriend and used to support me doing anything. 
But now I can't even stand being around her for longer than 10 minutes. 

PS - My close friends have also noticed the way they act around my partner and treat him and agree that my Mum has 'changed'.",07Jun2020,1

Nothing big, just regular old grocery store jobs. I've never had a job in my life due to circumstances I don't want to get into. I am going into the next school year a sophomore in college, and want to work through the summer so I can save up some cushion money. 

My resume is practically blank. I have no work experience whatsoever. I do, however, have certificates in Word, PowerPoint, and Word Expert from a class I took in high school. I also have 1&amp;1/2 years of experience in JROTC, which included a little over a semester as a staff member, and around half a semester as XO (like second in command). 

Other than that, I've got nothing. And those few things aren't relevant for the type of job I can find right now. My town is very small and there aren't many opportunities. I can't drive, because I was unable to get my license before quarantine began, so any job would have to be close to my home
That limits my options even further, as not every business in town is within walking distance. 

My questions are: do any of you know how to make my resume sound appealing, even as blank as it is? Are there any tricks I can use to help me seem more professional in applications, interviews, etc? And finally, is there any way to keep myself calm and collected during these processes (I have ADHD and anxiety, so this stuff is nerve-wracking)?

It stresses me out because I don’t ever want to hurt him. I feel like I hurt him because I don’t know. He’s so fragile that even if I say my point of view of it or say my opinion it hurts him. I want to talk about all the times he’s hurt me but I know if I do then he’ll leave. I don’t ever want him to leave. I feel so bad that I can’t help. He asks me questions that I don’t have the answer to and it hurts me that I say I don’t know and it’s like every time I open my mouth I hurt him. He’s such a sweet loving and amazing person. It makes me think that I don’t deserve him. I think he deserves so much better. Someone that knows how to help him. I just get so stressed because I feel so bad that I can’t give him the help me needs. I don’t know what to do. I feel so stuck and I feel like I’m walking on eggshells while I talk to him because I know that I’m going to say something that’s going to hurt him.,07Jun2020,1
442,"So title looks bad, because it was bad. Maybe not so bad as you'd expect, because chances are I'm entirely clean, but a manipulation on some levels was still happening. There were two principle lies in this situation. I can't explain this properly without being long-winded, so sorry for the long read. 

The situation: sleeping with a friend of mine, have been for a while. We go to have sex, situation ends up where we decide to use no condom. I agree, we have unprotected sex. At the time all that was on my mind was avoiding babies rather than thinking about STDs. Afterwards, she asks when I'd last had a STD check, I say it'd been ages, and we have the shock realization that this was probably a bad idea. This was the first lie, because the truth of it was that I'd never had one before. 

She then asks me if I had any symptoms, to which I said no. This was the second lie. A few days prior I'd developed what I'm 95% sure is a minor fungal infection of the balls (jock itch). Undeniably minor, but still there. Despite know of this, I'd still decided to sleep with her anyway. It isn't technically an STD, but can obviously be transmitted in the right conditions. Regardless, I lied to avoid an awkward conversation, and in ignoring these symptoms put her at risk. It was a selfish lie, designed to make my life easier. I go to sleep, promising myself to get tested and not do it again, because infection doesn't always happen on the first time. Naturally the morning comes, and we say ""eh fuck it, probably too late now"", and I go back on my word and do it again. I'm a real class act, clearly. 

I'm getting a test on Tuesday, and it's very likely it'll come back negative. I've been responsible with all my partners up until now, and there'd been a significant gap between partners due to Covid social isolation and a dry patch for a few months before then. But the fact of my deception still remains. If my deception were to end up causing her real harm, I'd be absolutely destroyed, because it represents everything I stand against in terms of my values. 


My question: how do you think I should handle this situation? I want to talk to her about it, but obviously this involves several massive breaches of her trust, and will likely irrevocably change our friendship (and quite understandably so). If you were in this situation, what would you do? How would you handle that difficult conversation? What would you say? I'm feeling quite lost on this, beyond knowing that I want to have this conversation, because I care about her as a friend, and the guilt of my deceptions would continue to weigh on my soul for a good long while.",07Jun2020,1
443,"To explain the title: I’m 18 and I grew up in one of the worst cities in England to live, bad reputation that it definitely earned (north west). Not only worst city, but the worst part of that city all in terms of quality of life, crime, salary, drugs etc. Down the road from my first childhood home was a crack factory and i regularly saw people hopped up and/or overdosing on spice, zombie, heroin and all these kinds of hard drugs. When i was very little (around 4) i remember my mum telling me and my cousins to try and ignore the sounds we were hearing outside and to not look outside (later found out it was because a man had been stabbed, when the police arrived they realised the house he was in was the crack house and it led to a drug raid). I also was often around regular smokers. We moved far away to one of the most safest places in england when i was like 7 and my parents could afford to leave. 

Recently, my friends have started experimenting with drugs. Obviously not hard drugs, just small ones and nobody has had any bad experiences yet. They respected i dont want to do it with them and dont force me to, but i always panic when i know theyre doing things like that and seeing videos or photos of it really upsets me. Hearing even stories or mentions of any kind of drug and i either start to panic or i just simply shut down. 
Im not trying to stop them doing it or trying things out, i want them to have fun and do what they want, but i want to know why i react like this. Does anyone know if its something to do with maybe trauma or any other explanation why i am so distressed about it? And does anyone have any advice on how i could overcome it? Im considering seeing a therapist. Alcohol is the same. 

Summary: I lived in a place where i regularly saw overdosing on hard drugs between the ages of 0-7 and now i have extreme reactions when people mention any kind of narcotic.",07Jun2020,1

445,"hello everybody,

this is something that really makes me sad... i have a good friend, we grew up together and were very close. 
when i moved to university we didn‘t see each other a lot but still held regular contact over social media!

Now it is very apparent, that we both live different lifes: (i don‘t want to sound braggy i just want to point out the differences)

• i grew up very privileged
• i went to university
• i work a well payed job
  
they quit high school, did community college, work a tough, very badly payed job.

now i lost 25Kg over the course of a year and a half and i think when we finally went to a hen do together it was the last straw:

she completely ignored me, was kinda cold towards me and since then we never spoke, eventhough i reached out multiple times. 

now i heard from another friend that i am the theme of a lot of their chats and that she said that it was unfair i had everything and they had nothing and that they couldn‘t stand looking at me because it would make them want to develop an Eating Disporder or because it downright depressed them. that i wad the reason that they had no luck in life and so forth. 

i was absolutely shocked because i love that person so much - how am o supposed to react to this? obviously i kept my distance but... i just don‘t know what to do? 

in the time when we hardly had contact i tried to explain to her that everything i did for myself, like losing weight, buying nice clothes, wearing make up etc, was because of my own insecurity and that it was not because i wanted to show off... but i guess that wasn‘t the reason they hated me now. 

i don‘t know. it really takes a toll on me... i am who i am but losing a loved person because i make them feel bad about themselves is just such a horrible feeling. 

any advice?",07Jun2020,1

447,"hi! this is gonna be pretty long but i just want an advice from someone :(

so my ex &amp; i are in the same group of friends. ever since we broke up, i cut communication with these so called “friends” because i felt that if i want to move on, i should let go of the things that reminded me of him. 

plus, another friend of our group also said that these “friends” didn’t really like me &amp; pushed my ex to end the relationship. this part truly broke me because i thought they were supportive of our relationship. 

they also kept on teasing me with my ex which is really insensitive because i’m still hurting &amp; they’re making fun of what i’m going through. they send our photos in our group chat (which i’ve ignored but my friend told me) and teased us. 

they also a posted a photo of me &amp; my ex in an instagram story which i didn’t approved of. they asked for permission when they already POSTED the story. i didn’t respond to their message which later on made them mad like what?????

i know that it’s all fun but i just feel disappointed that they’re not thinking of how i would feel with all these “jokes”.

anyways, what do i do? i know in the future i’ll cross paths with them but now i just want them out of my life but at the same time feels that i’m too cold :((

448,"Forgive me, I'm new to Reddit and am still learning here, I apologize for any mistakes or if this isn't the right thread. 
So, since the pandemic, I obviously haven't been going out or seeing friends, so I've had a little money to spend. And even though some restrictions have been lifted, my parents are high risk and I want to keep them safe. 
Since I'm stuck inside mostly, I've been ordering a few things online. No problems, except that some of those products have been art prints. The most recent even had ""Do not bend!"" written across every edge of the package. 
Yet, our mail lady hasn't been so considerate and refuses to read. Most of these orders have been bent and shoved in our mailbox, and it's happened on more than one occasion, even before the pandemic. Recently delivered was a custom sign for Father's Day which was admittedly large (long.) Instead of simply placing it on our doorstep, she stuck it in the mailbox, half sticking out. It could've easily been taken.
She's hardly been nice, the few times we've interacted with her, and we've been thinking of filing a complaint. I don't know if this is too harsh, I'm sure it can be a difficult job and I don't want to make anyone's life harder. But I also don't think it's difficult to simply walk to our door and place it there if you have to FORCE it somewhere it won't fit.

452,"Hey guys! With Corona my already messy plans have evolved even further and I'm at loss. I'll try to keep it short:

Currently I have a job that I'm not happy at all with. I work in shifts and study part time but it's hard. I was planning to get further education in full time - found a program that aids me financially, therefore I want to do it. It takes two years and I should have earned an acknowledged degree by then. This one could help me probably the most, concerning my current job. While doing this I'll continue my part time studies; should be easier with a regular sleep routine. I take the studies more as a hobby, something I personally need to do but won't benefit me and my job in the near future. (Full time studies might be an option but I'm very unsure about me taking it seriously as my it's my last straw, costs and really getting use out of it later)

And now, Corona: before I start I want to quit my job (saved some money, could go a year without any earnings) and travel for 4-6 months. But I'm not sure if that's a good idea now. Plan was to start travelling in April next year and start education in October. But I'm afraid of a general price increase and a new Corona wave. It would absolutly suck to break up the tour only to sit at home for a few months. Not to metion the money I might lose when an emergency kicks in. 

There's also a course starting earlier, in May. So I could postpone my travels, do a smaller tour for a month during vacation. This might me the best compromise but I've been wanting to do this for so long now that a month of travel as a reward seems like mocking myself. Just wait another two years! Ha. Also I'm becoming older.

Thing is I don't want to stay at my Job for longer. During Quarantine I had time to be at home and noticed how much this job killed me inside in such a short amount of time - I need to get away, quickly. For more than a year I was looking forward to the next and now it is just a big maybe..

Do I miss the obvious or am I too concerned about things turning out bad? Has someone been in a similar situation and can tell what they did? I'm just so discontented with everything..",07Jun2020,1
453,"I (25f) moved to a new city just 6 months before Covid, after accepting a great job from finishing grad school. I consider myself a pretty social person, so it came as quite a shock to me that it was quite difficult to meet people and make friends. I work for a really small tech start up, where I only have 5 other colleagues. I do really enjoy my job, and my colleagues are great and we get along well, however there isn’t much opportunity to socialise since they are all a lot older than me and have families to go home to at the end of work. 

I’ve been struggling with how to make friends outside of work. Whilst I was at grad school, I guess I had a it pretty easy and I made friends fairly easily - some of which I still keep in touch with, but they’ve all moved to different cities. In this new city, I don’t know anyone except my boyfriend, and a childhood friend, but I can’t exactly hang out with them all the time, and they are already established in their own social life. 

I often feel very frustrated, I’ve tried going to a few meet-ups to try and meet people, but I found constantly being around new people was actually a lot more exhausting than I thought. I went to a karaoke night, but it ended up being so many people 70+ , I just found it hard to talk with people to get a conversation going and I didn’t feel a major spark with anyone. I went to another meet up that I found online, and got a few numbers and hung out 1-1 with a guy I was friendly with, but on the hang out - he turned out to be really rude, and was rude to the restaurant server and so I sort of cancelled any future plans with him. 

I understand I probably just need to keep going out there but I’m wondering if anyone has any advice or experience or stories on how they made a group of friends or how long it took. I can’t help fantasising about living like the show friends, and having great fun with people that you really get along with and getting to that stage where you already feel comfortable, instead of where I’m at now where I constantly have to put on my “ new person face”. 

These events , you only seem to be able to chat to a few people and even then you only seem to be able to make 1 acquaintance, I just feel overwhelmed on the idea of how I’m ever going to make a group of friends, when it seems difficult to just make 1 friend. I really just miss having a group of friends nearby. I can’t help but feeling jealous of my boyfriend, who has the same friend group from college and high school, and they all happened to move in together after grad. I feel jealous of how effortless it is for him, since he’s never had to make any new friends, whereas I’m struggling to meet even a few new people. It makes me feel like I’m socially inept or something, because I’m struggling where it seems other people aren’t and it seems to be affecting our relationship, since often I’m not doing as much since I don’t know as many people in this city, whereas he’s always out every night socialising with his friends. This Covid situation has sort of reminded me that I’m not where I want to be socially and I want to make sure coming out of it, that I put a lot more effort in, I’m just not sure if perhaps there’s something more I could do- or maybe I just need to be more patient.",07Jun2020,1
454,"fuck, this is an awful thing to have to ask for advice on.

I'm 20 and my younger sister is currently 10.

2 years ago, while I was overseas, she was sexually abused by a cousin. She told my parents pretty much straight away. They ""talked to her about it"", helped or process or whatever (they never were good at this during my childhood so not sure how helpful it was to her)
They NEVER talked to the cousin about it, or his parents.
I only found out months later. I was furious, especially at their lack of addressing the abuser, but we have a lot of drama w our extended family and they didn't want to ""start more drama"". A stance I strongly disagree with. 
My sister has also experienced several cases of sexual harassment at school, which was brought to the Principle and dealt with.

A year ago I did a course on the basics of counselling, and as I learnt more on the affects of abuse and trauma, i messaged my mum and urged her and my father to get my sister into therapy to avoid future trauma that could otherwise be lessened/prevented.
My mum ""Thanked me for my input"" and never did anything about it.

Another year on, I'm back living at home w my family for a while. 
My sister is very close to me, i had a pretty big role in raising her so she kinda sees me as a 2nd mother.
I have had a chat to her asking her if she is still facing any more problems at school, which she isn't. 
She has awful nightmares almost every night, and although they aren't about sexual abuse, i feel they may well be connected to her trauma. 

I'm at a loss. I don't want her to grow up and deal with any more pain than she's already been through. 
But I'm not her parent - it was, and is, our parents responsibility to protect and help her.
I want to see her in therapy, i want to see our cousin held accountable.
I want to help her as well as I can.

458,"AITA - Two-Sided toxic long distance relationship

So, I recently discovered this reddit and felt it might help with something that’s been on my mind for awhile.

For starters, I struggle with mental disorders. ADD, Depression, Anxiety, possible personality disorders, so on. Around the age of 13 I was first sent to a mental hospital, and from then through high school, I’d have 15+ more ranging from suicide attempts to idle threats taken seriously.

Between that time, I found myself particularly lacking in the “friends” department, usually only having a small group of people while the rest of my school saw me as an outcast, so naturally I gravitated to the online world too. There, I met someone who I’ll call “Paige”. The first few years I’d know Paige, she’d grow to become someone who I’d text once or twice a day to someone who I’d facetime from the moment I got home till I went to bed. In 2016, we started dating and things, at first, went really really shit.

Back in 2016, politics were one of my main interests, occasionally I’d post something pretty right wing on my social medias. There was a handful of times where Paige would get mad at me in the comments, I’d respond, she’d get mad and get her friends to start siding with her in the comments (usually one friend sided with her while the other just insulted me), eventually causing some huge 300 comment argument with my friends and hers. Things were rough for a bit after that, but It’d smooth out up till 2017.

2017 came, and I was going through some new experiences. Despite being happy with Paige, I always would find myself at times where I’d feel genuinely sad with the idea of spending my teen years with someone online, instead of actually exploring romance physically, and at the same time I’d find myself growing an attraction to someone who liked me. So, I tried to break it off with Paige, to which I’d discover a new side of her. With her also struggling with mental illness, she seemed to get a bit weird at times. Particularly, any time where I found myself wanting to take time to me, or when she felt our relationship was getting rocky, she’d tend to get “worse”.  Through our whole relationship, she told me that she had experienced seizures regularly (which kinda just, stopped existing after awhile), vomitted blood, was told she might have multiple personality disorder, was told she might be bipolar, and would constantly mention either suicide, or giving up her life to become a stripper. However, she’d always be sad around me. It’d go on after we’d “break up”, I’d eventually fall in after feeling bad, and missing the concept of love and come back. This would go on to happen a several times throughout the relationship (every time a different problem) up until late 2018. Around then I’d start smoking weed a lot to cope with emotions or boredom, to a point where eventually i’d be high for weeks straight. By then, having dated nearly two years, and both growing up to be older, we’d eventually call it quits after Paige found romantic interest in someone popular in her school who’d end up dating her and introducing her to his friends.

By the time Summer 2019 came around, I was “addicted” (psychological) to weed, and finding myself to get more and more depressed over the situation. At some point, Paige and I talked about us, and Paige insisted that she had never done anything wrong, and I was the only toxic one, since I could “never dedicate my love”. The argument got heated, but I’d step back after a few minutes. A month or so later, the same argument happens, and I say my point of view, she calls me a manipulative asshole, and doesn’t respond. From that point forward, my mental health would get worse and worse, I’d smoke more and more, and I’d drop out of high school. I went into rehab for a bit, spent a month out, and would later find myself in a situation where I found out the police were coming to my house to make sure I’d go back in. At this point, I didn’t really have anyone in my life anymore who was a close friend, so I texted Paige about what was happening, to which she responded “K.”. In return, I called her a bitch, and we went a bit without talking. She ended up blocking me, telling all of our mutual friends “her side of things”, which everyone kinda just believed and stopped talking to me, and became a popular girl e-girl in her school, even making an indirect tik tok about me “To the person who caused me to lose my friends and have mass amounts of trauma, how is it being a drug addict?”

At this point I’m doing a bit better, my biggest struggle just being maintaining sobriety at this point, I still find times where I’m lost in thought.


So, really, I dunno. Some part of me says Paige is a massive bitch, others say I should’ve been stronger and left sooner, or I could’ve done better, or maybe I’m just blind to my assholeness. Either way, it’s been on my mind for nearly a year straight now. What do you guys think?",07Jun2020,1
459,"Hello internet, 

I reach out to you today regarding something I’m ashamed of. But it’s gotten to a point where it’s impacting my life and I feel like I need a bit of a talking to to set my head right. 

I have amazing friends, I love them to bits. More than they could ever possibly know. But on the complete opposite side of that I struggle day in and day out with this ridiculous, bitter envy of them. It’s not something I’m proud of. 

My three best friends are all stunning. Drop dead gorgeous. Beautiful symmetrical feminine faces and amazing slender but curvy bodies. They’re all smart and funny too, but this post relates more towards the superficial side of things despite how much I resent myself for that. 

I’ve always felt this way but as I’ve gotten older it’s gotten worse. It’s impacting my social life. I’ll make it known that I NEVER outright lash out or let my friends know I feel this way. I don’t hate them or blame them for anything. They have no control over any of this. But I’m at my wits end with being quite literally the ‘dud’ (in terms of appearances) friend. Going out makes me anxious and depressed and I always end up either cancelling plans or going home early because no matter how hard I try it’s actually kinda hard being the least desired person in the room. 

I’m not trying to have a pity party here, it’s a fact. It’s something I know I’ve got to come to terms with. But for now I’d rather tackle first the issue of how envious I feel of my friends because it’s slowly but surely starting to drive a wedge between us. I don’t want that to happen because of me not being able to get over myself. 

So reddit: as stupid and superficial as this may be, how do I learn to stop being jealous of my friends?

460,"For the majority of my life I've been what people call a lazy straight A student. I was at the top of my class without ever trying and everyone had a thought about what I would eventually study at University. My father knew that I loved learning new things, loved the human body and its wonders, loved new challenges so he told me to become a doctor. My mother who knew I was a little lazy (because nothing ever really challenged me to the degree of losing sleep because of it) and I wanted to get married young and have a family told me that being a doctor wouldn't be suitable for a mother and that I wouldn't get to see my children growing up which is really important for the child's development. She told me to become a pharmacist because a family friend of ours is a pharmacist and she is an active mother and also has a great income. My brother that studies medicine told me that with being a doctor comes great responsibilities and if I couldn't take over those, I shouldn't even think about becoming one. He also thinks like my mother, that I should study pharmacy instead of medicine. In the end, I decided to follow my heart and study medicine. And if I ended up not liking it, I could always change my study course. And no the decision of where to study has come. One place is a university 30 minutes away from home. A place where I wouldn't have to pay for living, because the government will give me a house. A place I can come and go whenever and wherever I want. I get to see my cousins that I love and who work at that city. My brother will come to that city in 3 years time. I will possible be a doctor at that city's hospital. But the thing is, the city is not huge. It's not really small but... Yeah. There is no amazing campus and great library that you can brag about. Sure the transportation is easy and I get to know the professors since my cousins work at the hospital (and the medicine department is the hospital). While my other option is being a scholarship student in one of the world's greatest cities of all time. A city of a population which exceeds my own country. A city of culture, history and amazing sights. A campus overlooking the sea. Huge libraries I can practically live in. Great experiences I can never get anywhere else. But it's far away from the people I love. I will have to return to my country after finishing my studies and to work in my own country I need to waste a year of taking exams in a national University. I will possibly have living expenses and going back home won't be easy.

461,"I started high school online not long ago and I cheat. I look up the answers. But I've been cheating since the 4th grade when I started a new school and didn't understand anything. Especially in maths class, I would look at other kid's answers just to get by. I probably have ADHD given,, so many things,,, but it's pretty much impossible for me to even try to get diagnosed. So it's just like, I really just can't learn the material. So I cheat, and now with the new rules my school has for the pandemic, it's made it alot easier to pass classes. And now, I'm a senior when I was really supposed to be a freshman this year (although I was a junior before covid hit). I feel like such a fraud. My mom knows about the cheating, there's not exactly a way I could've lied to her about it, but just the way she looks at me and sighs at the fact that I'm a senior makes me depressed about it too. And I just know my older sister who's worked her ass off through highschool and college resents me for this. I feel horrible and I don't know what to do to not. I'm supposed to take the SAT sometime after quarantine ends or something, and I'm trying to study really hard for it and genuinly and honestly get a good score to make up for all this but... My older sister had a tough time with the SAT and was really hard on herself about it and I feel like even if I did get a very high score she'd hate me anymore.

462,"I thought the quarantine period would last around 2 weeks, when my country first found out its first case of COVID-19, but then, time passed and now we are close to complete 3 months locked in home. 😅😅 I don´t seem very affected with that…in my house we have plenty of video games, books and other activities to stay entertained and healthy (like doing virtual volunteering, watching YouTube, and exercising my abs and arms) ...

My mayor challenge, however, is to keep the contact with my friends and teammates during quarantine. I have this constant fear that if I chat too much or too little, they will reject me (just as a close friend at college ghosted me when she failed to comfort me during a sad time. She rejected me later saying that I was too intense interacting with her though social media...when we live far away from each other...but that is another story for another day 😂). I have to deal with this sometimes in my online classes, and at my volunteering group. My volunteering group doesn´t seems to stop working, even during these trying times. I often stop looking at my WhatsApp and wait until it is necessary to reply...except in the case when I´m attending my father (who lives in other province) or some other family member.

Do you have any ideas on how to deal with this kind of social anxiety? I don´t think is very difficult of a matter because my brothers, who aren´t very extroverted like me, they are able to pass though the days with ease, without worrying too much of the outside world. Specially, because they aren´t in school/university/volunteering yet like me...spending their time sleeping and playing video games...and I am the only one in my family who is truly extroverted. As a matter of fact, I am fearing getting too much introverted (by influence of my family) without being able to meet my friends outside of the online world...😅🙈 any advice will be appreciated, and for thanks reading all of this 🙏",07Jun2020,1

466,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for just over a year, we started off as best friends for 2 years but constantly flirted and ended up going out. It’s lockdown in the U.K. but we’ve been able to go out and meet people recently so that’s what me and him have been doing, everything was perfectly fine until I started overthinking. 
Around 2 weeks ago I started overthinking things I had done in the past from stuff like calling a rapper attractive to past people I had relationships with and I just feel awful. There are things I forgot to tell him / just never did tell him that I have no reason to because it’s in the past and doesn’t matter however i overthink and convince myself i’m a horrid horrid person. 
I have a constant stressed feeling in my stomach which has affected up massively as I now act weird with him due to feeling undeserving of him etc, he has as a result become bored of me being weird, which anyone would. 
We have decided to just be friends for a bit and then decide how we are going to move forward but I still feel awful about things that really should not matter e.g. things i’ve masturbated over and how my ex boyfriend told everyone he snorted cocaine off my boobs, which me and my boyfriend and his friends laugh about, he did not but I believe at one point he may have snorted sherbet off them as a joke, i didn’t remember it until yesterday and feel constant stress and if i don’t tell him i’m a liar however it wouldn’t positively affect anyone and really doesn’t matter? 
Does anyone else experience overthinking of the past and thinking they’re horrible? Or any advice on what I can do? I don’t want to ruin our relationship/friendship because he’s the only person I can be truly comfortable around and i’m worried. Thank you

I (f16) had a close friendship for about half a year with a now-boy lets call him Lee (15 ftom). When quarantine came he texted me (a day after we last met up to dye his hair) that he needs a break and I shoudnt text him.
I was a little annoyed but obeyd his whishes and acted kinda unresponsive when he started (for like 2 days) acting like he wanted to stay in contact.

2 days ago he came over in the evening without any notice and asked to talk with me. I was like okay and we went for a walk (social distanced of course).
During this walk he told me he came out as trans and is trying to recover from anorexia and depression (both undiagnosed) I told him I would support him no matter what etc., because I am very open to pretty much anything.

The thing is I dont buy her stories.
Here us why: I've went to school with him for the last two years and he never ever acted anything then super feminin. We bonded over preferring skirts and dresses over anything else and our thing for feminity.
In the past he also did a lot of things for my attention (before I we became friends he was really into Kpop and the typical weird artist kid but changebd into a MiniMe (Goth-Emo-Grunge-Punky kinda thing)).
I know he is currently going through puberty and stuff but my understanding of trans isnt sth. you spontaniously decide to be but something you grew up knowing.

482,"So, I'm going to college soon- and it was always my plan to give my mother her once a day call that she asked for and just leave it at that. I love my mother, but her decisions concerning my brother and I weren't always in our best interest and more hers. 

(Cons) 

For starters, I never felt she took care of me emotionally and often physically- when I was real young, my mom found out that my dad cheated on her and she fell into a heavy depression where she'd lock herself into her room for most of the day, occasionally coming out to make dinner. While I don't blame her for having depression, a lot of responsibilities were shirked off to a seven-year old me. I was expected to take care of my little brother, often helping clean his room, make breakfast and lunch, and so-on so-forth. The only time my mother really bonded with me was when she was looking for an emotional outlet- she'd often come into my room just to vent about my father for hours, while I sat patiently and listened. She's also often hide ""evidence"" in my room despite me asking her not too. (Printed out papers of my father's text message history, etc.) Beyond that, she'd also constantly put my brother and I through an emotional rollercoaster of ""I'm going to divorce your father."" always eventually leading to ""I'm gonna give your father once more chance but that's it."". She'd also often have me send text messages to these woman my mom thought my father was talking too, asking me to call them ""slut"" or ""whore"". (I'd always get grounded by my dad- and my mom would later come into my room and thank me.) Some of this stopped when we moved later- around age 11, but my mom's emotional dependency on me didn't. Around this time, I developed a severe eating disorder, dropping from 120 pounds to 95 pounds- It was very noticeable; I had a fear of eating food and constantly talked about diets and exercise. My mom didn't do anything to stop me though- besides forcing me to eat five cupcakes in front of her. (Which I later threw up.) Also during this time, my mum found porn discs on my dad's computer and fell into a deeper cycle of consistently venting to me. (One such case resulted in her forcing me to watch the first part of a porn disc despite me asking her not too.) We moved again when I turned around 14- I fell into a pretty hard depressive episode over missing my friends and having to deal with the aftermath of an eating disorder by myself. I was consistently considering suicide until around sophomore year where group activities and clubs helped pull me out of a funk. Somewhere in the middle of that- I had a stalker that my mother and family didn't take seriously until very recently; often forcing me to go outside to tell him myself to go away. (They'd never call the police like I asked though.) Also somewhere in the middle of that, my father showcased erratic behavior where he hid guns all over the house- which really spooked me and even had me running barefoot to the neighbor's house after jumping out a window- I had thought he shot my mom; but he actually just wiped his desk with his arm. (He stopped after I ran to a neighbors house.) I also finally got my mom to stop constantly venting to me, but it was after I had to get my dad involved- an action that caused my mother to stop talking to me for days on end. My brother has taken on some really radical right ideas recently, and has semi-incel behavior towards women. Despite pleading with both of my parents, they won't do anything about it. (My mother blames it on the lack of my father's support while my father keeps telling that's how boys just are.) I'm also still shirked off most of the household duties since my mother is old with a bad back and my brother doesn't do anything. (My mom thinks she'll teach him how to do chores after I go to college- which I doubt due to him only having three years left at home before he goes to college. )

(Sorry for the long backstory.) 

(Pros) 

Due to the BLM movement currently happening, I've finally decided now was a good time to talk to my parents individually about politics. (I'd always avoided it before- but educating myself on how dire situation is, I've decided that I need to talk about with them.) My mother has finally agreed to read some books about racial inequality in America- (In a book club format where I pick a book to read and we talk about it once a week, while she picks the next book: so-on so-forth.) I've never been able to come to this sort of compromise with my mother before and it makes me feel hopeful. Both my parents have also started speaking more tolerably to me in discussions. (I found that I have to speak to them individually or else all three of them gang up on me; my brother doing most of the screaming.) I've always felt really lonely and isolated without a lot of direction in my life, and my family finally reaching out to me makes feel like there's some hope. I have good grades, a lot of extra-curriculars, and a decent sat and act score- (That I'm hoping to raise by the next test I take.) So at the very least, I should be accepted into a semi-decent college, (far-away from the state my family lives). If I keep this bookclub thing going, I wouldn't have to completely cut off contact with my family, (other than the one phone call a day), while also keeping a healthy distance. 

Can anyone with similar experiences give me advice on whether at least a little bit of my relationship with them is salvageable?",07Jun2020,1

Imagine this...

You want something. Let's say that something is X. In order to get to X, you have to go through some steps. So if X is step 10, you need to go through 1-9 to get to it. That whole journey is called a process.

You can't get to step 3 without covering step 2, you can't get to step 2 without covering step 1.

Basically, you can't skip steps, especially since what's in a step is contingent upon the step before it. 

What that means is that step 3, for example, is the conclusion of step 2. So even if you wanted to skip step 2 and jump from step 1 into 3, you can't, because there will be no step 3 to jump to. 3 is created from 2. It's the result of 2. 

So if we say that X is achieving a certain amount of money from a project, step 2 would be one of the negotiation steps with the source of the money where they would have to agree to giving any money.
And step 3 would be agreeing to how much money. 

That means there wouldn't be discussion of how much money when agreeing to giving any money has not even been established yet.

Now, imagine each step has a combination lock. In order to successfully complete a step and move on to the next one, you need the correct sequence of numbers to unlock that step. 

Let's say step 5, for example, has combination numbers of 224. No sequence of numbers will work to completing that step until you enter 224. So 221 isn't going to work, 557 isn't going to work. No numbers but 224 will work. What that means is that you can't reach X until you inter 224.

Now the question is, if you are hired or delegated to do the job, to get X. And if you already know the codes for each of the steps, and you can get X...but the person who assigned you the task wants you to use combination codes that will not work, and wants you to skip steps, even though using the correct combinations has zero harm on them, and whether you go through each step or skip steps has zero  harm as well, and they don't even want to discuss why they don't want to use the correct combinations, or put heads together to come up with an alternative to the combinations, but they expect you to get X with tools that will not get you there, and on top of that you do not have a choice to decline the assignment, so you do it knowing that it's destined to fail, but they blame you when you fail, and you are just doing it to help with no real benefit to you other than to make them happy...what would you do?",07Jun2020,1

490,"# in happy longterm relationships, what resulting qualities or skills are more valuable than learning how to solve problems creatively?

**heres a quick example of sovling porbelms creatively:**

* before the laundry machine was invented, a big kind of a problem was girls didnt have much free time to do anything like develop hobbies or run for ceo prime minster president director aircraft engineering etc
* i dont know the history of the invention of laundry machine but automating this process of cleaning clothes  in total saved time for ppl in general
* this was a way of solving a problem that nobody thought about
* creatively = outside of what is the norm at any given point in time

&amp;#x200B;

in happy longterm relationships, what resulting qualities or skills are more valuable than learning how to solve problems creatively?

for example say the couple had the quality of cooperation, the question is why does that quality matter and what does it lead to? cooperation along with otehr qualities would lead to creative problem solving

* the end result of what things lead is what are    **resulting qualities or skills**
* i cant think of a better phrase atm
* see [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/asmvxc/til\_a\_harvard\_study\_found\_that\_hiring\_one\_highly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/asmvxc/til_a_harvard_study_found_that_hiring_one_highly/)

&amp;#x200B;

other possible options i thoguht about for things that are more important than solving problems creatively are:

* **being open**\- being to new thoughts, and new ideas (that are based on good evidence and reason ofc), but thinking about it, this actually is just one of the many prerequisites to being able to solve problems creatively
* **loving the ideals &amp; going towards the ideals**\- even if a couple had this if they didnt know how to solve porbelms creativly i dont see how this would be more important than solving porbelms creativly
* **initiative in starting new things**\- showing leadership stuff like that, umm i dont where i would place this in what is valuable, but its def not  more important than solving porbelms creativly
   * but maybe it actually is more importnt tho gotta tink abojt this one
* **compromise**\- ok this is really bad, and this is a large reason why solving porbelms creaitlvey is so much better
   * compromise = to give up something you care about and/or selfish about
   * compromise is really bad cos its \[not\] creating more value or more wealth in society, for example there's 1 pizza, to compromise theere's still gonna be 1 pizza at the end no matter, well i guess there'll be no pizza which is worst
   * or rent, landowners that rent from residents arent creating any extra value, the value is still the same at the end usually.
      * same goes the residents, they arent imporoving they arent making anything better
* **being thoughtful-** i dunn o what this word means its too vague and i dont know hwo to descibe it using words so there's no way to compare and see it was more important than being able to solve problems creatively cos i dun even know wat this means to be 'thoughtful'
* etc other things somewhere... duno where i put them..  cant think of anything else off top of mind atm

But if I don't, he would beat me up, spit on me, and probably steal the money instead. What should I do? I can't tell my mother because he would beat me up and spit at my face. What's the best option?",07Jun2020,1

I (19M) found my first love (18F). It happend more than a year ago. I was taken back by my emotions towards her. I always think about her, I always want to be with her, but my happines is ruined right now an I am lost in my feelings. She has became the only person I care about. If I have a problem or I feel bad she´s always there for me. 

We were together for 10 months. It was an emotional rollercoaster for me. When I was with her I was at my happiest, but there were also moments when I felt so hurt, that I didn´t know how to deal with it. She was always truthful to me, the problem was my obsession with her. I got jealous easily, I taught she didn´t really care much about my feelings. She wasn´t really commited to be with me. I respected it and tried to give it time. It was hard for me to be always positive about our releationship while she was uncertain most of the time we spent apart from each other. I believe that she really loves me and cares about me, but she isn´t ready to make serious ties with someone. She wants to focus on her education and career. It´s her decision and I understand it. She broke up with me about 4-5 months ago. It was the most unreal experience. I was sad, I felt swindled. All my effort disappeared in thin air. I started smoking because it felt relieving. I wanted to do anything just to occupy my mind. I loved moments when I didn´t have to think. Just blank mind with no emotions. 

We couldn´t break contact. We share most of our friends. I couldn´t stop texting her. The problem was, that her feelings stayed the same to me so she didn´t really try to ignore me. She also cared about me, she was sad when we didn´t contact each other for a long time. She wanted me in her life, but she couldn´t commit to an long-lasting releationship. We basicially behaved the same, but less often. And then I fucked up.

Three months after our break up I went to see her. We kissed and fooled around a bit. It made me happy for a moment, but I realized there´s no chance of us getting back together in the near future. It felt like breaking up for second time. I wanted to stop my thoughts. After few days there was an party where went most of our friends. I drank (in Europe the legal age of drinking is 18) more than I should. It ended up with me hooking up (not having sex, but close to it) with two of our shared friends. I felt ashamed, full of regret. I immediately texted her because I felt guilt overflowing within me. I shared the pain with her. It frustraded me. But after a while it calmed down. 

And then again I fucked up so much. I was supposed to go to an another party with my friend. Three boys and 9 girls. I drank and I couldn´t control myself. One of the girls tried to get personal with me. I didn´t have the mental strength to stop it and what´s worse I liked it (not when I was sober, I hate myself for not stopping this). My friend that invited me there is mad at me right now, because it was his longtime friend. He dated her when he was really young ( I think it was during elementary school) and he still have feelings for her which I didn´t know of because right now he is with another girl. He won´t talk to me now. And I can´t confess to the girl I love because of the pain that it´ll cause her. I am afraid that someone will tell her about it. I don´t want to lose her and I always wanted to be with her, but now I feel like I don´t even deserve to talk to her. Yes she did end our releationship, but still that´s not the person I want to be. For now I decided that I won´t drink if there are girls around, I stopped buying smokes and I want to pick up my old hobbies. 

The problem is it´ll take time for me to pull myself back together and I don´t have anyone to share my feeling with. I would gratefully accept any advice what to do in my situtation and how to cope with feeling of being an failure.",07Jun2020,1

Feeling very very sad

I’m feeel very sad

I have talk to her about a month and daily,  we could talk for hours. We met online and have exchange social media . We can talk for the entire day but recently she told told me she’s gonna deactivate her social media acc but didn’t do it because I encourage her that you don’t need to delete it to be productive . I was so sad when I see her text that , it’s like she doesn’t care about me . Aren’t I suppose to be one of the main reason for you to not delete social media ? I was sad.later she spent the whole night talking to me where things got cold suddenly. I always says gd morning ,eat ur breakfast ,lunch and all .last time she replied yes I will and talk to me a little bit and go have her breakfast or lunch .now she doesn’t even reply to these and she is online on fb yet she doesn’t wanna reply . And when she did it’s just  `oh hahahaha ‘ I cant even continue the conversation I felt so shit. And when I get the conversation going it lasted like 5min and she would just go off . She make it seems she uninterested and distancing me . I waited and waited the whole day while seeing her online .it really hurts .i think about her the entire day .she can even post story and not reply me .it really fucking hurts .i can’t take it and I asked her y. This is what she replied , (First, I’m not distancing myself from u oki. I just don’t feel talking to anyone. I already told u, I might not reply sometimes coz I want to spend time more alone. I don’t like much talking. I’m moody lol. But I’m not mad or anything I’m just like that)
(I just want to apologise oki. Uhm I just want to spend more time with myself lately. And don’t need to reply or something I’m so sorry for only thinking about myself without considering what would u feel.)
(I’m not talking to anyone else , u know that.) 
(Uhm ok learn from this. I should or we should learn that we must not get attached easily to someone. Sorry for making you feel that I’m avoiding your messages. Sorry)
( maybe I will contact u much more in college )
(You should learn from this oki? You can’t give your all time to someone. Other girls may want that but me? No babe growing or self growth is very important to me. It would be a burden if you give your all time to someone. Maybe just give a little but all your time. Babe giving your all is too much oki.)

And she proceed to leave me and watch anime while I am sad and she knows . It fucking hurts . I want to let her do her things but she can’t even spare me a few min of her time replying , make me feel sad ,sick and hurt as fk . I think about her all day and everytime when I wake up it’s her on my mind .how could she hav just let the conversation go so easily how!?! It really hurts what Shld I do ? Can anybody reply and tell me how do I go over this .i still want to talk to her but she’s like this now I’m really sad and hurt . She told me to do my things but I have no mood or so to do any.  my mine is just her , when will she reply ,why is she not replying ?  Please someone tell me  something .

Update :

I couldn’t take it and I asked her . I asked her what am I to her ? She replied : “Your a friend. “ I’m just heartbroken I told her I thought I was more than that ,someone who u can talk truthfully and shares ur feelings with  . She said : ur a friend who I can talk about my thoughts ,what I’m doing ,personal stuff. And I have guy friends too whom I just talk about sch and laugh at random funny thoughts but we nvr talk about personal matters . ‘ I replied :I feel that your not interested in talking to me now ‘ Her replies: yeah , dunno , maybe , I like to be alone right now ‘ I asked : you don’t miss talking to me ? ‘ she replied : “before yes , like I think I can talk for you the whole day. And while I’m doing my stuffs I always want to finish that immediately so I can talk to you again . But now I think some feelings change. “ I was so damn heartbroken when I see that . I was stunned . I shld have asked y her feelings changed but she’s gonna cm up with I want to be alone right now I think but I really wanted to know y . Then I proceed to ask her :”does you replying me makes u feel forced to reply? “ she said : “ I reply coz I want to , I’m watching vid in fb and replying when I want to” damn this make me feel like I’m not even worth her videos but I know she has her life to do her things but she replying like this is really damn sad for me .  She proceed to say: “ I can’t use my phone all day. I have my stuff to do like watching anime and K drama.before meeting you I’m doing all this .i can even not use my phone for a month . So ya ,I’m sorry I’m being like this and not replying u often like use to before . I know the problem is me coz like I gave u false interpretation .sorry. i just, There’s someone who understood me .😄” I saw this ok I agree U do ur stuff , ok but what the false interpretation what does she means ? “I just , theres someone who understood me”. What does it mean ? Means I’m the someone who understood her or who? Then I proceed to ask her again ? Why can’t she just reply a quick text , she thought I’m forcing her to reply but I want to understand.i told her I thought I was special to her , she replied this :“As what I’m saying, I’m watching FB videos I didn’t reply often. I feel entertain . That’s all but you think your not special or if you are forcing me to reply. My answer is no . Ur a friend , my friends are all special to me. The reason why I can’t reply you sometimes cause I have my stuff too.like I’m watching vid on fb or I’m in the house and spending my time talking with my siblings . ” wow just I understand the time part but it’s just now I’m just her regular friend , she treat me just so sad and sudden . I shld have asked y her feeling changed I dk . She asked if I’m ok . I said no this time she just tell me “be ok” “I’m sorry” “ gonna eat my breakfast now “ Haha my heart just went shit like shit shit and I’m damn sad .

So I think the conclusion is ,shes not interested anymore , she changed and she dun give a shit about me even though I’m the one who she shared all her deepest though or secrets . Just feel shit now .but I’m really curious y she changed ? Or shld I just accept the fact and her reasoning ? Haha she even said she was not talking to anyone previously .i dk now feels like damn saddd.",07Jun2020,1
496,"Hey all, I'm an aspiring CompSci major and I'm having trouble pinning exactly what it is I want to do with my degree. I've lately been heavily influenced by the George Floyd protests, and what has been getting to me the most is the manipulation of information. Media has been manipulated since it was created, and it's only gotten worse since the dawn of the internet. People with money and power are able to abuse it to hide or otherwise manipulate what exactly they do with their money and power. 

How do I do something about it? Do I become a white-hat hacker? Should I aspire to make a social media app based on reporting and sharing news, free of censorship and manipulation? Are there any companies already doing this, or are there other ways to advocate for information transparency?

Any thoughts are welcome, thanks for taking the time to read this.",07Jun2020,1
498,"I'll give an example of my common pattern to start. Three months ago I decided enough was enough again and began putting in large efforts to study a topic I'm interested in and began working on a small project related to it. All for personal interest and in hopes that in the future maybe I can make something useful to other people with the skill. This lasted for a week and a half, but after just about 35\~ hours of effort total, I felt the lack of desire kick in, again.

This happens once every 3-6 months, and I haven't completed even a small simple project for 7 years or so (24 years old) because of this cycle. In between these bouts, I do nothing but vacant mindedly go through life, like an idiot. I think it relates to not having a clear goal, but even when I feel like I do it eventually drains away and I wind up rewatching shows I've seen countless times and playing games I don't enjoy.

It's almost like my mind can't cope with long term effort, of course all of this alongside working jobs I dispise to pay bills I feel are absurd for living as basically as I do (food, rent, utilities, internet, netflix, phone, no car, nothing additional).

People give tips like waking up early and setting a schedule, I've done all these things. They don't stick, eventually you realize there isn't any real rational behind them other than doing them to keep doing them. It's like working out purely to get through the next workout, pointless.

I've read threads with advice on this kind of issue given by people who have illegedly gotten over it, but every time I do my mind says ""This is just a temporary burst of motivation the OP is having, the community offers phony hurrahs and cheers (phony because they suffer from the same problems, thus their use of the forum/subreddit), but in a month they'll be back to the sluggish sloblike life that I live.""

Something is evidently very wrong in my brain, but I can't even see it clearly, it feels like a heavy cloud that is abscuring my problems and pushing me down deep into my couch, making me an angry resentful person that hates the obligations he has to maintain in life like work, eating, standing, even talking.

500,"Someone else on here suggested this. I thought I would give it a try. I know the world is hell right now. But I think I may have some of you beat. We are Americans stuck in the Philippines. Not on vacation. I was working. Had no clue about Corona, until I had soldiers telling me I can't go outside! We are only renting and cannot afford rent. We have no money for food. We are allowed to go out only 1 day a week, with a special pass. It's been 3 months now! The news says that the rules are relaxed and people can go out now. All lies. We can't work. We can't go ask for help. Only 8 hours a week out to buy food. 6 of those hours are left standing in line for food. Often we can only get 5 cans of sardines, and 5 ramen noodles. For 10 people for a week.

There are death squads here. And bandits. And terrorists. And the Philippines does not have anything like food or cash aid. Not for foreigners at least. Even though I pay taxes here. On top of all that, it's been 120 degrees here. They make houses here with just a metal roof. No insulation at all. We don't have a fridge, AC, or even furniture! We do have a fan, water kettle, and rice cooker. Currently the electric bills are deferred. We have 8 kids. and I don't want to see them die. I don't want this to be the end of our lives. For those that do not know, the US Embassy offers NO HELP AT ALL to US Citizens abroad. Nothing. I will post links and e-mail quotes for those that doubt me. Heck, the US Citizens Services is not even open!

We do not have a ""goal"" for help. We are a long way to escaping. We have a child born here. Which under Philippine law makes them an illegal alien that entered the country a criminal at birth. Seriously. So after getting their passport, we will have to deal with their immigration paperwork and fees before the baby can go. I am just going to screw off rent for now. Sorry. And we just need some food, basically. Anything helps. **If someone could spare 20 bucks, I could make it keep us alive for another week maybe.** The only thing the government has done during this Martial Law, is shutdown the biggest news agency, and create the Cyber Terrorism Law, to arrest anyone complaining online. So I cannot post anything public. I can't post pictures in public here. But I can post photos from home. And I am willing to provide any documentation in private. Passport, ID, birth certificates, etc. One friend sent us a little some time ago. And Paypal worked with just an e-mail address. So that would work for me. I don't know what else. Thank you for reading!

516,"I am a 32yo female and my dad is a man whore who had a bucket load of kids like they were on sale at the local supermarket, he is also an alcoholic or I guess was. Due to some family issues I had to come back home to take care of something and I've been informed that he no longer drinks like a fish. But thats not what this post is about. I am the oldest daughter, with 4 younger sisters. I have two older brothers and two younger brothers. My dad had 3 wives and 3 kids with each wife and I am from the first group of kids. 

I am the first person in my family on either side to graduate high-school, and even go to college and graduated that as well. I invited my dad to my HS graduation, he didn't show up. I called and he told me he had a bender the night before and was too drunk to attend. I moved across the country. When I got married, I didn't invite him, he never made an effort so I stopped trying. When my kid was born I gave him the choice, you're either all in, or all out. There is no in-between. For the first few years his wife called religiously for him and sent presents and things were good with them. When they split the calls and presents stopped. Then my college graduation happened. Again, I didn't invite him. He didn't say two words about it. 

Fast forward to now, I'm in my childhood home dealing with the drama of aging family and ignorant choices of other family members and I'm told, all those times I didn't invite him my mom took it upon herself to invite him. She also tells me that because he is getting so old and everyone is positive something is going on with him, I should mend the fence. She never had a dad and just wants me to have one. I'm 32 now, am I wrong to think that my life isn't going to change much at this stage if suddenly he man's up today and I now get a dad? Truthfully, I don't want him. He was there for some of my younger siblings. Treated them way differently. My brothers and I were abused physically and emotionally. I try to keep the drama out of my life, but my mom keeps trying to apply her feelings to me. 

On top of all of that, this man has literally never even once tried to be in my life. A few years back he had a heart attack. I dropped everything drove across the country and showed up at the hospital because my siblings swore he asked for me. When I got there, I told the nurse I was his oldest daughter, I heard him say my other sisters name. When I walked in, he seemed disappointed. The man does not care about me. Never has, and I'm pretty sure he never will. 

When I showed up this time around my siblings who are still here (6 of them) were telling me how he has changed and seems to be way better. Maybe I'm just a half empty glass kind of person, but all I saw was a beer in his hand and him making two inappropriate comments towards me about working and not taking care of my kid full time (I never was the barefoot and pregnant type).

Tldr So reddit, I ask you I have another week here before I go back home do I swallow my 32 years of pride ignore the fact that this man is/was an alcoholic prick my entire childhood and adult life and mend the bridge between us. OR leave it and go home leaving things just like they have been.",07Jun2020,1

It's weird because I've been going through a lot recently personally. My girlfriend is pregnant, I am moving house soon and a few other smaller things. What makes it a bit more awkward is that it' just us two in our little bay, so we usually sit next to each other for about 35 hours per week. 

So the question I'm asking, is do I just continue to keep everything in my life to myself regardless of what is going on? I just wish I had a bit more of a relationship with my colleagues (or colleague! haha).",07Jun2020,1
523,"Tbh with social media &amp; all , I always feel the pressure to have a “girl gang” to hang out with, ie: have a groupchat where we can rant about literally anything in life and be there for each other through life’s ups and downs. 

I do have quite a number of friends, but I hang out with them individually. I do try to cross-introduce my friends to each other , but none of them seem to “click” or get along very well. 

How do I deal with this ? I know it’s ok to not have a girl gang and all, what we see on social media is always the “ideal” picture people paint. But I just feel SAD ... no group celebrations during my birthdays and all. How do I get included in groups ? Am I too told to be part of groups ? I’m 25, working adult. It’s hard to meet new groups of people",07Jun2020,1
524,"I’m from Singapore and I am genuinely questioning this. Back then when COVID-19 in SG was quite low, around about only 80+ cases, I was really scared so I made a statement, “Don’t listen to the Government and just wear a mask.” 

Now the Government is telling everyone to wear a mask. However, the first part, “Don’t listen to the Government” kind of baffles me. Also my friend said she felt that the Government should have taken quicker actions and stuff like that and I stated about how it was important to wear a mask but it had only been required to wear in SG only until around April. 

Please give some advice? Even if you’re not from Singapore, I’m curious if such statements can get me into trouble. Especially since I am not a Singaporean, I just stay here. 

I don’t want to get into trouble...",07Jun2020,1
525,"Title’s a bit out of Marriage Story, but it’s basically to the point. I don’t know how else to word it. It’s not a very solvable problem at all so it’s more just me ranting. 

My family is middle class. My mum got laid off because of Covid and hasn’t been working for the last two or three months but my dad’s salary and their general savings are enough for us to continue life pretty normally. I’m going into Year 12.

I can’t classify my parents’ relationship as romantic. I can’t remember a single time in my life where they’d held hands in public, or kissed unless I was jokingly pressuring them to, or basically any affection at all. I never really thought this was odd, but even in their best moods they only seemed to talk as mutual friends. My dad works long hours so he’s usually tired in the evenings, even more so lately. And he’s becoming very... authoritative?

My family is quite traditional. The gender roles mostly apply. Me and my mum’s done basically all cooking and cleaning and any domestic thing for my entire life on top of her working, while my dad’s worked and worked and worked. But now being the person who provides for the whole family, he almost seems to know it and hold it over us? I’m obviously grateful for my parents and how much they’ve given me, but it’s starting to become unbearable. 

For example, dinner last night was three dishes and rice. My mum spent about an hour total cooking. He ate about two bites from each dish and promptly left the table after five minutes. Or today (his day off), he told her to go out and walk twenty minutes at noon to buy a certain type of bread he likes from a bakery near his office. His reasoning was that he couldn’t wait to buy it tomorrow and absolutely wanted to eat it NOW. Which she did, because both of us feel like we owe him everything. Even the smaller things, like getting her or me to pour him a glass of water by pointing to the tap pitcher across the room, as if we’re unworthy of even being talked to.

Don’t get me wrong, I love my dad! He’s fantastic when he’s in a good mood. It sounds so petty and overdramatic typing it out, but when she’s at home trying to apply for jobs and interviews and all he’s doing is treating her like a maid because we’re financially dependent on him... I hate it. It’s humiliating for her. I’m starting a minimum-wage summer job at a local café, so at least there’s some sort of money there.

The only reason I’m asking on Reddit of all places is because they’re starting to argue, and I want anonymity. Not full-blown fighting, but strained screaming and pleading behind doors so that I don’t hear. It started off with snarky retorts from her after a month or so, but sometimes I wake up at 1 in the morning because they’re screaming about him getting her to turn the AC off when he was the last to leave the room. I can’t deal with it.

I don’t even know what to think or who’s right anymore. Around me, she’s openly rude now while he ignores her presence and orders her around passive aggressively. There’s not much danger of a divorce because she doesn’t know when she can get a job again, but I hate it. They used to at least tolerate each other, you know? They won’t have a normal conversation with me without trying to get me to be one of their sides. I don’t know how to say anything without the other being upset for me going against them.

Sorry for the long read. Is there any way I get them to at least be civil again? And possibly back to their somewhat-friendly relationship? I don’t know if I should stay out later after school, or come home straight away to provide a sense of family. Any advice would be really, really helpful.",07Jun2020,1
526,"I've had dreams involving a friend of mine from 2-3 years ago pretty consistently. Dreams with her occur every few months and are ones that I remember better than others. 
Despite that I can't tell when they started to occur.

She and I (m/17) weren't really close nor did our friendship last very long because she moved away. The relationship was solely platonic.

In the dreams we have (basic) conversations or she's part of a group environment, in which she is pretty much herself. 

I haven't had these experiences with other people, at least not as consistent or as memorable.


Why do these dreams occur?",07Jun2020,1
528,"So I'm 20yo in the UK, currently finishing my second year of university in a degree on Classical Civilisations (ancient Greece n Rome etc). Despite the degree, my dream has been to break into the film industry as a filmmaker and genuinely give that a shot, I've always loved films and people have always described me as creative. 
My issue comes from the sheer amount of young filmmakers at the moment. I like to think that I'm quite a grounded guy, and when I see dozens of people in the same spot as me already putting out short films and the like, it really makes me wonder if I'm too late/not special enough for film/not driven enough. There's also the concern of no matter my ability I have to get noticed, is it worth all the stress? 
I helped make a film last year for a friend's university dissertation that went on to win UK Student Wide-screen film of the year, and it was really fun on set, but I wasn't involved enough in it to use that as an example of my work.
I'm quite handy as well, good with tools etc and consider vocational jobs to be the most secure in our day and age, so would it just be smarter to aim for an apprenticeship after uni and go for that?

But over the last week seeing the horrific acts around the country of just cops beating innocent people, people beating innocent people stirred me in a way I've never felt before. There is a protest today, a 9 mile march for Black Lives Matter, and while I feel moved to participate, I'm just uneasy about it. I feel like I would stand as an outcast and having thoughts of just going into my loft and retreating to my games. My girlfriend is telling me to go as we're prepping dinner, but I just don't know.

531,"So here's the story. I have not always been a saint. Around 2-3 years back I disrespected many of my teachers, fought with a lot of people without no reason.  Basically I was an asshole. All these acts led to nothing.

Slowly and gradually, with time I started to realize how I must develop myself. I learnt anger management, improved my grades from F to As and Bs and ultimately became a good human. 

Now I have a lot of great friend's and some of them keep bringing up this past I worked so hard to escape from just for a few laughs. I don't want to sound rude so I just leave it and laugh with them. In all honesty all this hurts me very much

What should I do if they do this again? Tell them this, leave them or something else.

532,I've found an HP Elitebook 8560w on a second hand site for about 140$. The others i've seen on said site usually go for about 250/300$. The only visible problem with this laptop is that the touchpad is pretty scratched up although the seller claims that it still works. The other two things would be that the laptop is covered in stickers and that the battery lasts for about an hour and a half which is expected from a laptop at this age. Now I've scheduled a meeting with this guy to check the laptop out in real life and he's already told me that's he'd be willing to drop the price a bit but im thinking of trying to take about 30$ out of the price. So the question is: how do I try to bring it down so much without looking like im ripping this guy off for this already pretty nicely priced laptop?,07Jun2020,1
533,"Tl;dr: My little sister (23F) is stuck in child/teenager mindset. She can’t grow up and has been obnoxious and a total brat towards me since quarantine. She decided she doesn’t wanna talk to me anymore after I “provoke” her, so we haven’t said a word to each other. My family is asking me to reconsider and sympathize with her because she hasn’t grown up yet and I’m all she has since she doesn’t go to my parents for everything. What should I do? 

My parents were struggling with rent after my dad got laid off in February, so I moved back home to help and their apartment was closer to my work place. My dad was also taking care of my little sister (23F) who is diagnosed with depression since 20 years old and she tends to double up on medication/not taking enough if no one is watching her. 

She is very immature for her age and my family believes she’s stuck in this child/teenage mindset that everyone is provoking her/world is against me stage. She comes to me for EVERYTHING, which also means we don’t got along well because she throws a fit if I don’t offer her a good solution/can’t help her. Here are some examples: 
- she got upset because I told her that my boyfriend could help her fix her game when he’s available. He missed two weeks because he was out of the city and she send me a long text about how I’m making fake promises and provoking her even though I explained that it’s out of my hand because my boyfriend is not here (he ended up fixing it for her). 
- I was helping her with a case after she got scammed and the first thing I asked was, “did you give them the gift card number” and she threw a fit saying, “Are you calling me stupid?Get out. Get out. I don’t want your help anymore.” 

Ever since quarantine, she’s been on my case because I refused to let her borrow my car to attend her friend’s birthday party during shelter in place. She can’t seem to understand what’s going on with the world like how my mom’s hours got cut and I work from home and pay majority of the bills now. Anyway she started screaming and turning the tv volume to max when I was on a conference call. I went to my room and she started blasting music on her iPhone outside my room. I was charging my iPhone on the living room couch and she knocks it down to the ground and left a major scratch on my iPhone. I told her to be careful with my iPhone next time and she started screaming saying she didn’t do it and I’m always blaming her for everything (she was the only one in the living room - sitting at the edge of where I was charging my iPhone). 

Our biggest fight ended a month ago with her telling me to get up from the couch while I was laying down and I said, “no, there’s a couch right there” and so she sat on the side of my hip until I got up. She left a bruise on the side of my hip and then she said she didn’t wanna talk to me anymore because I was “provoking” her. At that point, I was done with her with her obnoxious behavior and didn’t wanna deal with her bullshit anymore. I said, “ok” and we haven’t talked since. 

I’ve been so much happier not having to deal with her since she’s leaving me alone, but my family (including my big sister) is asking me to sympathize with her and that if I’m not there, she’s not going to come to anyone. They told me, “I know what she did was wrong, but she’ll grow up eventually.” My parents doesn’t want bad blood between us. What should I do?",07Jun2020,1

536,"I met this person on an international trip and after the trip, we started talking everyday. I thought that they were a really good friend and they told me several times that I was important to them. However, I always had to message them first; they never messaged me first. 

I stopped messaging them for about 2-3 days in two separate occasions and they never messaged me. I confronted then about it and they said that they were busy with school or some work and apologized. They also told me they're just used to me messaging first. I know that they are shy, but I'd think after continuously talking for 4 months, they'd be comfortable with me. 

Normally, I'd think that they're not actually my friend if they never messaged me first, but when I do message them, they are heavily involved in the conversation. They ask questions and actually contribute to the conversation so I'm a bit confused. They send me posts on Instagram from time to time, but I always feel to start a conversation, I need to send a snap first or message first.

542,"More info: I used to suppress my bisexuality when I was quite young, but came to terms with it when I was about 18. Was always equally attracted to women and men and gender never really played a role in my partners or crushes.

I am now in a longterm relationship with the absolute love of my life, the kindest, most loving man I've ever met and generally the best person I know. I would never ever forgive myself if I lost him.

I don't regret anything now, I'm still very young but I want this relationship to last and in very sure about that.

549,"I had to drop out of band tutoring that he and my nanna pay for because the anxiety of catching the train at rush hour to the place was too much, and the stress of having to practice songs and turn up every week was causing me to feel stressed sdn experience suicidal ideation. I thought it would work out and I tried to go along a few times but I didn't want to let people down as there were times due to my anxiety that I could not attend. Thus, I told the tutor I could no longer attend and that I was sorry. She said she completely understood and that I was welcome back any time. 

To preface this I have a complex motor tic disorder (similar to Tourette syndrome) which causes me to feel like I am being suffocated at times, I am diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Bi Polar type 2, OCD, high functioning autistic spectrum disorder, and psychosis. I am on a sickness benefit as these currently prevent me from being able to work, and take 5 medications for my conditions with a 6th incoming in the next few days.

I have been on a waiting list to talk to a psychologist about traumatic events I have experienced in my past but that's been 2 years and counting. My country has a poor mental health system. I say this not for sympathy, but just to give you some idea of what caused me to not want to do the band stuff and what causes me difficulty day to day. 

I called my granddad to tell him this, expecting support, and he says ""I'm disappointed in you, so many people have done so much to make this happen"" and that ""its time you grow up, put on your big boy pants, and face the world."" He said also ""you're making some progress, and that's good. Do twice as good."" 

I said that that is a 1960s view of mental health as it just isn't as simple as magically feeling better when stuff is that bad. He then said ""well I was born in the 1940s and that's where I get my values from, I had to work a job where 2/3 of my wage went towards my family bills"". He said that people had come from far worse situations than me and do more than I do. 

Basically his stance was that I needed to grow up and put myself out there. That they'd been supportive towards me but now it was time I sorted my shit out and functioned to a level that they expected. 

When I again brought up the fact that I had expressed that I was suicidal/having ideations, he said ""well how many times have you said that to me? I'm sure you've heard of the parable of the boy who cried wolf"". I told him that it's a myth that people who say they want to kill themselves will never do it. He said that he believed I said it to emotionally manipulate members of my family into feeling bad for me or doing what I want. 

I feel it goes without saying that I say I'm suicidal because when I try to think of solutions to my problems a lot of the time I arrive at ""it would be so much easier if I were dead"" and then get stuck in that thought loop. Recently things have been particularly bad due to my tic playing up and some interpersonal issues outside of my control. 

I told him to go fuck himself multiple times and he laughed at me before I hung up on him. This is someone who I thought previously to be supportive and understanding. I was shattered that someone who had been good to me for so long expected me to just magically not be how I am. 

I ended up calling a crisis hotline because I didn't feel safe and they said they're going to help me get more prompt mental healthcare, but I have to wait until tomorrow or the next day for this appointment with my psychiatrist. I'm so lucky to live with a friend who understands my perspective and my brother upon hearing of this said he's gonna try and talk to him, but yeah I don't feel great right now. I took some clonazepam because I ended up having panic attack and a few hours later here I am writing this up. 

I'm sure I could have been more diplomatic in my descriptions of my problems and I shouldn't have said ""fuck you"", but the dude said my suicidal thoughts were attention seeking. They see me about once every few weeks to a month and have little to no concept of the extent of my mental health issues.

551,"I know my best friend for 6 years.I love her and she is the only person who can understand me.She started dating this guy and I started feeling replaced.I mean she would spend time with me but not like before.Her boyfriend’s house is near to mine.It felt like it was just an excuse to meet me and then go and meet him.When I plan to hang out,she brings her boyfriend.When he is not around she calls him even tho Im there and I didn’t say anything nor could I complain cause she was so happy.Its been 2 years that I have been in another place far away from her so its a long distance friendship.I cant talk to her everyday because of our different time zones.But I feel relieved because her boyfriend is there for her so I was not worried about her.Soon our communication starting to go on and off there was no problem.Even if we haven’t talk for a month,we still talk as if like we’ve been talking everyday.We were pretty chill and we understand each other.Then things started to change,when I make time to call her either she was busy with her boyfriend or her new friends from the college.i understand she has her life so I started to feel lonely cause I was really new to this another place I live in  and there was no friend and my depression was really getting  worst.I relied on her for a month but I felt like a burden so I started to hide up my emotions and pretended that Im okay.She knows Im having a hard time but its my fault to hide it.If we call then all she can talk about is that guy and she don’t ask me whether I was okay or not before venting things,she straight up vents up the things.So I started to pretend that Im okay and stopped sharing my struggles.Then the guy she was dating was emotionally draining her and he was really toxic.Even though I was struggling to be stable with my own mental health.Even though she chose him over me,she came back for help and advice.I feel really grateful to be a person that she can really rely on. I was there for her every-time when she needed me.Even if i was struggling to be okay.I know the relationship she had was everything to her but at-last she broke up with him.I was so proud of her and suddenly I realised she is not the person who I used to know.Idk if this counts as privacy boundaries but she used to use my accounts to talk to other people which I don’t like and I have told her multiple times that I don’t like this and she was really mad and acted rude.She blocked a friend from my account without letting me know because she hated her and she thought she is toxic to me as well.Well I know she was trying to be protective.But that really bothered me.I told her not to use my account without my permission cause this my privacy but she acted childish.She started complaining about even little things,she only talks about her problem and never asked me how I was.I don’t know I mean yes friends are suppose to be there to listen and help their friends but I felt irritated and drained idk why? I can understand cause of the breakup she started to overanalyse things and I feel bad for her.I also realised because Im a really chill person,people are crossing my boundaries I mean maybe or am I overthinking?I bottled up all this feelings.Idk what was wrong with me ? I started to avoid calling my best friend.I only text her when she needs me.I stop sharing things to her.I have nothing to talk about to her even there is so many things going in my mind.When she has problem,I just give my all as if it was my problem. I just give my best to the person I love the most. I feel so drained and Im at that point of my life that I don’t even want to talk to anyone and stay alone. Im so drained to pretend and drained of listening.I felt guilty cause I started to pretend to have the energy that I don’t have.Im forcing myself to talk to her.I felt irritated to listen to her complains but I was there for her and listening.I feel bad for her cause she only has me who she can rely on.She recently broke up with this guy and I cant just leave her.But I feel so bad,I told her what bothered me.She was speechless.Idk what made me do that,there was a voice inside me idk if that was intuition or my inner demon.I feel bad to make her feel that way but I feel bad to pretend too.Idk if this was the right thing to do? I pushed her away and I expected her to fight for us but she didn’t bother to even say anything.She didn’t text me for 2 weeks.I miss her.Even if I try to recover this friendship,we wont be the same again.But I have stay away from her.Im so grateful to have her but she deserves a good friend.Was it a right thing to do? Im so messed up.I think about her everyday but I don’t have guts to text her or even say anything.Idk what am I suppose to do? Am I being so selfish?

He admitted guiltily that he liked reading incest fiction of people around his age when he was 13/14 as he thought it would be so cool to have a sister around his age so he could see what someone his age look like and maybe he could experiment? He feels super guilty over it now and can't believe he ever thought this. I feel really really sick. He said he never ever wanted to do actual incest and hasn't looked at it since he was 14 at the latest and is ashamed and worries that maybe this porn at a young age made him less grossed out by incest? He seems disgusted by it now. Is this too much? I am so repulsed. Is this beyond the scope of stupid teenager?",07Jun2020,1
559,"So at the beginning of quarantine, things were pretty good. I got a good routine for myself. I'd wake up early, have a healthy breakfast, do voluntary online classes just to learn new things, exercise, take a walk, practice painting or drawing, watch some shows, etc etc. It was pretty good. Now, three months into it, I'm so over it. I've lost interest in everything, because I've done everything, over and over. I don't know what else to do any more or anything else to capture my attention. I'm a teacher who can't risk passing anything onto my students or fellow teachers so I still got two, possibly three more months of this. I can't do it. I see a therapist and I'm on medication, but I just don't know what else to do to keep from going insane.",07Jun2020,1
560,"I'll start from the beginning. I was stretching and then I got a sudden pain twinge by my shoulder blade that felt as if my muscle had folded in on itself and it made me feel like I wanted to fall backwards.

Days later, I have a constant pain in that same area. I can't stretch properly and I can't stretch my right arm out completely because that's the side where the pain is.

It's hard to lie down and sit up. So I've been losing sleep because I'll wake up with a sharp pain in my back.

561,"Ok, this all just happened and I'm still pretty flustered so bear with me here. I (white, female) work as a merchandiser for a large pop company in the US. I live and work in Minnesota and service a couple of different counties. Neither include the MSP area. Since protesting began I have been wearing a facemask (which is required by my employer and some of the locations I service) that I have painted ""Black lives Matter"" on in an effort to show solidarity and support for those individuals in my community.  I service four different large store chains at multiple locations and so far no managers or employees have had any issue with my mask. However today at a location that I service only once a week and who I drive a fair distance to service, a manager asked that I remove my mask and replace it with a disposable once. I understand that this is within their right to require, as they are essentially acting as my employer while I am on location, but I would very much like to find a work around to still show my support to Black lives Matter efforts while ar work as well as just in general. The immediate thought that I had for how to do this would be to tattoo the statement somewhere on my body that is not easily covered. However I dont knowing this would be seen in a bad light, being that I am white and perhaps my anger and frustration at this managers poor excuses for asking me to remove my mask are causing me to jump to make decisions that I may come to regret. (Obviously I would not ever regret making this statement on my body, as I will never not agree with it, however I want to make sure that this would convey the meaning that I intend). I'm also very much open to other suggestions on how I can continue to openly show my support as an ally to everyone. Thank you for any and all suggestions and comments.",07Jun2020,1
562,"So I signed a lease for a room several weeks ago in the middle of May for a Summer sublet. I was indecisive at the time, but because it was such a good deal, I couldn't resist as I didn't want to lose it. I spoke to the guy leasing it, and mentioned that there's a very small chance I may pull out due to circumstances related to coronavirus. For the next two weeks, I was still indecisive about taking the lease for personal reasons (not related to corona), and was looking into something that would better fit what I preferred. At the end of the month, I reached out to the person subletting and pitched the idea of me changing the lease time. He said that would be difficult to arrange with the landlord and that he didn't want to do it, as he already was in a difficult personal financial position, because he owed payments on two different places, as he was currently taking an internship elsewhere. I said okay, and that I'm fine with that. I also felt bad for the position he was in. 

A few hours later, I came up with another idea. I called him back and said that what if I could find a tenant that could take over, while I would renegotiate, or maybe cancel the lease. He was very reluctant, and when I told him my reasons, he countered that if I could find a place that matched what I wanted, as opposed to what his place offered (which he doubted I could), he'd let me revise the lease time. This kind of secretly upset me, because I don't think the reasoning for my decisions are frankly any of his business, and shouldn't be relevant when I'm just asking to renegotiate a lease, at least to him. After telling him that I did already find a place that better suited my needs, he reluctantly agreed. I offered again to find a different tenant, and he said, in a rather melancholy tone, that it was okay. I felt bad in that moment, as he sounded a upset. He then texted me and said that he didn't want to do that, and that it wasn't okay with him. I felt so bad, that I apologized profusely, and agreed to take the rental as is.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue I'm thinking, is that as bad as I feel for him, his personal situation is not my responsibility. On the other hand, I signed a lease. But I did let him know two weeks in advance, which I think is a decent amount of time.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm thinking of just flat out refusing to pay. Aside from the possible legal ramifications (which I'm honestly not 100% sure of in this particular situation), would it be cool for me to do this? It feels kinda bad when I think about it, but I mean, I don't want to be walked all over either.",07Jun2020,1
563,"Hi I’m M20 and at University right now.

With lockdown and everything else going on I really don’t get to see anyone as much as I used to and I really feel like it’s hitting me hard. How?

I’ve been single for as long as I can remember and always found it hard to reach out emotionally to others maybe because i suppressed those feelings as a child and didn’t have the same connection with my caring parents. Moving on, this leads me to believe that I’ll feel sort of triggered whenever I see other couples or watch tv shows where the protagonist or even side characters engage in relationships. I realised that whilst and university on my own in my apartment with a couple floor mates I keep searching for an intimate connection but I don’t know how to form it to more than a friendship. And it leads me to feel lonely and keeps my mind racing. It’s been noticeable those past week especially with university work. 

Okay that’s a lot thanks if you’ve read this far I do see a psychologist and we have our chats but I really wanted to vent this out and ask for advice. FYI I am also on meds. 

TLDR; Im satisfied with who I am as a person but i feel a need for intimacy how do I work around this when I can’t form those types of relationships? Or how do I form those relationships?",07Jun2020,1

I hadn't seen her for a few months and saw her yesterday...  

had a brief conversation and yet I recall that twice I had to ask her to repeat herself because I couldn't hear her.

her: ""do you want a bag?""
me: ""what's that?""... she repeats herself.

a few seconds later she told me what's she's been up to in quarantine, and I had to ask her to repeat herself again because I couldn't understand her.

566,"Little backstory of me: I'm a 27 year old who recovered from a 5 year heroin addiction (yes, I do think some people fully recover, I don't even feel like the same person) and 10 year overall drug addiction. I got married to the woman who gave me my beautiful child in 2016. I only did it because I felt it was the right thing to do. I was no good for her though, she was sober for 18 months when she found out she was pregnant and I was doing dope everyday in front of her, which eventually caused her to relapse. We weren't good for each other. In February 2017, I was arrested nodded out in my car in front of a gas station. DUI for being behind the wheel while the vehicle was on and I could hardly stand up. I had warrants. I spend the next 10 months in county jail. Wife found somebody else very quickly. We didn't make it a year. Oh well, definitely for the best even though it was hard at the time.
     
So that and two other situations have left me with some abandonment issues.

Now I have a decent job, my own house (rent), and my own car! At this decent job, there's this girl, let's call her C. C has worked with me for 1.5-2 years. About 6 months ago I started really thinking about asking her out, although I'd talk myself out of it every time thinking she's too cool for me. She has such a great personality, so funny, and just good energy. I always sorta felt we were closer than her an other coworkers. Three days ago I finally got the balls to ask her on a date. She said yes! Monday night. It will be me, her, and my 5 year old. (They've met each other 3 times and really like being around the other. Asked my friend and she thought it was weird, but C doesn't mind one bit.) 

Now C has always said she doesn't want a boyfriend. I think past relationships have ruined it a little. I was thinking this is my one chance to really wow her and maybe change her mind. The fact she agreed to a date means something? 

So here is my question, how can I make this special for her without being creepy or overbearing?

I haven't been excited about a girl since my ex. I haven't had time for girls because of the emotional drain of getting to know someone, but I've gotten to know her some and she makes me happy, makes me smile. Just don't wanna f this up.

Also any date ideas that would include the kid? I was thinking dinner and maybe bowling (open in my state) but the other voice in my head says that's lame. Help please.",07Jun2020,1
567,"My bf and I have been together for 4.5 years now. We're both currently working towards finishing our degrees, we've been living together for 3 years and have a cat.

We recently spoke about marriage and both agree that getting married would be disadvantageous to both of us as where we live, you pay more taxes as a married couple and you get a smaller pension when you retire. Basically, you only profit from being married if you're a class nuclear family with kids and only one person works. Since we don't plan on having children and both want to work, this doesn't apply to us. Also, you can get all the ""advantages"" of being married (e.g. decision rights in the medical field and an inheritance and so on) by drafting some extra-agreements, which would take some extra-effort but basically mitiage any disadvantages from not being married in the long run.

Nevertheless, I in particular would love to have a (non-religious) marriage ceremony with friends and family in the future - just not one that is legally binding. So my question now: has anyone here done sth similar? Is that super weird? How would you feel if you were invited to such a ceremony?

569,"So this situation happened a while back with my wife’s sister’s husband. I’ll call him h for short. Short background before I dive into the story. I come from a more middle class family and was given a generous amount for inheritance. H comes from a financially not so well background and I’ll leave it at that. Now to the story, I had a flight and he offered to drive me to the airport. I chose to take my car and drove to the airport along with my wife mother in law and sister in law and h. H was to drive my car on the way back from the airport. The ride to the airport went smoothly and my trip was for around a month. Well when H was driving on the way back he got into a minor bumper to bumper with an suv. As far as who’s fault it was I’m not sure regardless my cars hood was bent and the headlight was out of place. Now my wife didn’t mention any of this to me as I was away and only when I had come back and I saw that my headlight looked a little out of place did she tell me the incident that occurred. I didn’t get mad it happens but what grinder my gears was the following. I had left money for my wife so she can spend on herself while I was gone for the month I come to find out she spent that money on the repair. The repair cost $400. When I saw H he told me he went from one salvage dealer to another looking for a hood replacement for my car and thankfully found one for “cheap” and it ended at that. Him stating it was cheap is what ticked me off. Neither did he offer to pay nor cover at least a minor part of the repair. I didn’t say anything and I kept my cool. So this brings me to my question am I jackass for having a sour relationship with this guy or do I have a right to not really like him as much. In terms of cost for me it was a small amount of money but none the less I don’t think I should’ve been the one to foot the bill. So please give me closure on this issue thank you my friends.",07Jun2020,1

Due to this it's been very hard to eat. I get nauseous when I eat food. A few times it's taken me an hour to get down a banana, I've started snacking on a few almonds here and there throughout the day. I can usually get in most of one light meal a day, but as a 6ft dude that just ain't cutting it.

Just going off a few times on my parents' scale, I weighed 193 somewhere shortly after May 10th and weighed myself at 175 today. 

I figure even if I had a bunch of food or water in me on the 193 day that's a significant drop? I feel like I'm not doing so well and really need to eat but it's not like I can't access food, it's just that I feel like I'm gonna throw up...

One thing I miss the most about my old home was my dog. A German Shepard I bout with my own money when it was just a pup. Sometime after I left my mom asked me if I wanted to take him because he was howling every night for no reason and without rest. I would have loved to have taken him, but there was no room for a large dog where I am. They eventually sold him, apparently to a friend of my step dad’s. He’s never had the most respect for animals and I doubt any of his drinking buddy’s do either. I’ve regretted this decision.i felt like I should have tried something to get that dog, but I didn’t try anything at all. I used to play with him and walk him, I was the only one. Of course I was it was my dog. I don’t know why it took me so long to realize this but his howling at night was because he didn’t have me. I might sound self centered but I believe it’s true. He never did that once when I lived there. I did manage to sneak back to the house to visit him a few times, and  by then they had another, tougher looking dos who didn’t know me and tried to attack me, but my dog actually vouched for me. He went crazy when he saw me, licking me and jumping on me and whining. Now I don’t know where the hell he is or how he’s being treated. I’m usually a “keep it to myself and work it out myself” kind of guy, but I’m finding this a hopeless situation. I can’t just check up on that dog out of the blue.

I was in shock after i got away and called the police, but somehow she managed to convince them to leave the situation alone.

But many times during weekends, we go out for long distance biking trips (just the two of us). There we talk about all sort of things,  our take on love, relationships and marriage, her abundant sexual experiences and my lack of,  and many other topics. 

During these discussions, I often tease her about some story she shared with me. Or I try to put some lowkey pick-up lines in the conversation to which we make further jokes. In the flow of the conversations, I also side hug her sometimes. That's all.

Important information: Now, I had developed an attraction towards her over past year. I had asked her out few months back and she had said she never thought about it. This was before we hung out one-on-one.
Though I am not exactly over her, but still I consider her as a very good friend and I am well aware that she considers me just that. I have not yet started dating other people due to quarantine, but I am in a different mindset than I was before I had asked her out.

I’ve had similar feelings but less intense and less frequently then she has. We mutually decided that we’d stay in the relationship for now as we think there’s a chance things will get better.

The things is, she says she believes these feelings started when the quarantine started. We went months without seeing each other and got into fights a decent amount. We actually broke up once but that time was more out of emotion than reason. In the past few weeks we started seeing each other again and hanging out, but she still feels this way, more so when we aren’t together.

I don’t really know what to do. For now we just said we’ll keep going as we were and see what changes. But she doesn’t have a concrete reason why she’s losing feelings so I don’t know if it’s my fault or if it’s just natural.

The main problem is whenever I watch or hear about something “impactful” or negative it never leaves my mind. So let’s start from when it first started. Back in 2019, I watched 13RW and there was a scene where a guy got raped with a mop and holy shit it scarred me for like months. I couldn’t bring myself to forget about it. Finally now after a year I forgot about it. Then again some months later, I watched a film about terrorists and for months I couldn’t help stop thinking about it, relating it with my life thinking “what if I become like them”. Then the next. I remember watching a documentary or something on Jeff Dammer the serial killer and oh my god, after that, I couldn’t help but think for MONTHS about it. Relating it with my life and thinking “what if I become like him”. Then this “problem” stopped. But recently, during the quarantine, it started again. I can’t quite remember how or when but I’m guessing I stumbled across something about Jeff Dahmer and I haven’t been able to not think about it for the entire quarantine months. My mind just keeps thinking about the things he did, the cannibalism, etc. I think “what if I become like him”. And not just this, like I'm always so fucked.

* For meeting up with other people we’ve been told that we can meet up with a maximum of 6 people from outside your household. The birthday celebration would have seven people there (not including me) from three different households. If I went it would be four different households.

* For me to actually get to my Dad’s house he would have to drive me over which leaves no room for social distancing 

* I have been seeing my dad every few weeks for a walk outside but we’ve social distanced.

* I’ve been keeping the circle of people that I interact with to a minimum. I’ve only seen the people I live with, and anytime I leave the house to go to the store I social distance. 

I’ve told my dad all of these things including how many people with no underlying health conditions are severely sick due to Covid but his response is just ‘you’ll be fine’. He says that he takes the pandemic seriously and that he social distances and uses gloves and a visor at work but the fact that he is still visiting family members of different households makes me doubt that.

 I understand that he has joint custody of my sister and that’s why he still sees her despite the fact that she lives in a different household but I don’t see why he isn’t thinking about the rest of the people he’s putting at risk. 

I don’t have a problem with seeing my sister, it’s more so that I feel uncomfortable travelling to a separate county and mixing with people when it’s not necessary and could put everyone I live with at risk as well as all the elderly people my aunt works with. 

I don’t think it’s ridiculous of me to not want to go considering all the people who have postponed weddings and graduation ceremonies and held funerals with no guests. I personally lost out on my graduation ceremony and my debs (prom) due to covid, I don’t see why my sisters birthday is more important than everything else. I don’t know, am I being ridiculous?",07Jun2020,1
587,"There’s this annoying homeless guy who comes to the store I work at even though he is banned from coming onto the property and has been kicked out several times. He’s steals, rests in one of the bathroom stalls for hours because he’s drunk and has even attempted to sleep in the store a few times. When he’s not doing that he’s sitting outside on a bench either talking to people not interested in talking, starring off into the distance or he’s got his shirt off. This dude has recently been coming by everyday and will hang out for the entire day. Now he’s not a threat, he’s actually kind of nice but he’s really annoying. He’ll just walk up to anyone weather they be a customer or an employee and just talk and talk and talk, usually for half an hour. He constantly interrupts you even if your answering one of his questions and will not let you leave the conversation until HE’S done. Being the parcel pickup guy I have to deal with him constantly and have to watch him make people uncomfortable first hand. I am scarred to bring carts up to the store in fear he will get up and start talking to me. Everyone has had enough of him yet management will not deal with him. A few days ago I caught him resting in one of the stalls for 2 hours and reported him to management. They called the non emergency services, which is a waste of a fire truck and an ambulance just to get this douche out of here. They got him outside the fireman told him he had to leave the property and his response was “No”. So the assistant manager who is a nice guy who felt bad for him bought him a jug of milk and told him to hit the road. He still came back but he hung out at other stores in the plaza and didn’t come on store property for a few days which felt great! Now cut to 2 days ago we had a massive thunderstorm hit and of course this bum runs into the store. We let him stay because it there was practically a tornado outside but we kept an eye on him. Now this guy thinks he’s welcomed back in the store and is back to being my problem. The thing I hate the most is the violent thoughts I have of this guy. I want to hit him with brass knuckles while he’s telling me how there was a forest where the library is now built, I want to kick down that stall door that he’s resting in and drown him in the toilet. The sight of him just gets me angry and it makes work terrible and makes me feel like shit. I want to tell management but they keep just slapping him on the wrist and not actually solving anything. There’s something wrong with him mentally but I don’t know if it’s that or if he knows management won’t do shit to him. What can I do to get rid of him for good? I don’t want to hurt the guy (I mean not in real life) I just want him to stop coming back here everyday.",07Jun2020,1
588,"I really wasn't sure where to post this, so I hope this is a good place.

As many of you know, there are lots of protests for BLM around the world. And the movement is getting lots of traction on social media. It is making me feel really self conscious about everything I do and say, which I don't see as a bad thing. I believe everyone should be treated equally. 

However, I recently saw a news article with pictures that showed protesters gathered in one place and very close together. I live in the UK where social distancing rules and lockdown are in place.
I sent that news article to a groupchat with my friends. Along with a short message saying that I don't like this way of protesting as it is not safe and means that coronavirus will hang around for longer as it can spread easily in an environment like that. Nobody replied to that and everyone ignored it and continued on the conversation we had hours earlier. 

This made me think that perhaps what I said was not right. I want to hear other people's opinions on this matter. Was I being racist by saying I did not like that protest? And does anyone have any advice on how I can better myself to be anti-racist, or at least educate myself further? 

Thanks.",07Jun2020,1

597,"Growing up gay in a small rural town I heard a lot about the predatory lesbian stereotype. I heard some jokes and stories from my friends and even had a small bit of it directed at me by my teasing friends despite the fact they thought I was straight.

The fear of being or being seen as a ""creepy predator lesbian"" has stopped me from even trying to make friends with women I find even the slightest bit of attraction to. It could be as little as ""oh she's pretty"" and that's it. I purposely distance myself from women who could become my friends because I don't want to feel like a creep. Even if I have no interest in actually dating them. I just can't get past the fear and guilt.

This has led me to miss out on a lot of possible friendships. I don't want to keep doing this but I can't seem to stop myself from getting overly cold and distant to avoid being thought of as a perv.

Now to me, a best friend is the closest I will ever get with someone and I'm cool with that, but I yhink i completely love Amy more than she realises. She's strange like me and is unsure of her sexuality atm, we're both students but I'm fairly sure she's leaning towards pan/demi atm.

599,"He has a history of anxiety and severe depression, where his mom kept him on medications all his life. He’s 25 now, started around 13 years old. He attempted suicide shortly before the medications started.

His father is abusive (was, physically, to his mom) and was absent most of his adolescence, and up to now his father has constantly told my friend that he’d never be anything in life and that he’s a failure. Meanwhile, his mother has coddled him ridiculously. He was never disciplined nor guided, and it shows in his work ethic now. He has a long history of job-hopping minimum-wage jobs and dropped out of high school at 16 years old, to which his father scolded and verbally abused him for it instead of taking action as a dad to help and convince him otherwise.

My friend doesn’t know how to do most things without having to be instructed directly, and sometimes forcefully. I think that because his mother coddled and did everything for him, he lacks patience and initiative. Every job after his first one, he got because of connections, and now that he’s on his own, his spotty job history and lack of diploma/GED is his biggest thorn in his side.

From what I’ve seen of him these last several months since meeting him, though, he has potential. He wants more responsibilities and a career, but he doesn’t understand what it takes to be a hardworking adult. Because his mom made everything easy for him, he doesn’t like challenges, and therefore doesn’t enjoy anything that requires hard work. He’ll work hard even if he doesn’t like it, but I’ve learned that he’ll only do so if he’s been handheld in the beginning and if he’s treated with leniency. He doesn’t know how to teach himself most things other than keeping up his health.

He’s passionate about health + wellness, and he’s always eager to help anyone in that regard. He’d be a great trainer, nutritionist, physical therapist, or anything in related fields, but he needs to finish school and gain some more skills. In order to do that, he needs to defeat his demons surrounding academics. He’s been studying for his GED and wants to get a second job to save, but he’s a slow test taker and struggles grasping academic material. I’ve seen some strides in his ethic, such as making phone calls to handle and resolve bills (his mother did this), managing his finances (he used to blow it all and his mother did his taxes), studying for his GED...most of the basics of “adulting.” 

But he needs to learn how to tolerate the grueling process, at the bare minimum, because he gets frustrated easily and is quick to quit.

How can I motivate and edify him better?

I love this guy to death because he has a good heart and is a blank slate to be someone great, and I don’t want to leave him in the dirt when he is striving for change, so I’m here for him and want to be that person he’s never had in his life, even if it’s just to be the kick-start he needs.

He said he will work with gay people or help them if they need a favor but he won't support them or encourage their way of living because he doesn't agree with it. I've heard this all before, but I felt a bit attacked by him when he said these things because I'm gay and I think he knows and was using this opportunity to shame me or confront me.

We live an hour away from each other, but are in different states, so to hang out it was always me driving back and forth. I also was the main income in our relationship for a long time since he had trouble getting hired. 

It was draining, but it only recently hit me that it was just too much. I felt like I was putting in way more than I was getting out. I also was feeling that we grew apart over time, or that I was growing and realizing I deserve better.

611,"Please help me clarify something. This is really awkward to discuss with anyone in person so I've resorted to discussing it with the  kind strangers on Reddit. This issue concerns my childhood and I think it might have(or might not have) affected my personality. Here it goes.
When I was about 10 years old, my mother's dad, my grandfather, died. All the family members(about 14 or 15) used to live in a single house, in different rooms. Me and my parents arrived 12 days before he died. I was told to share the room with my elder cousin, he was a straight-A student at that time and my parents thought that he could help with my studies. We got along okayish; you know how you behave with your cousins when you see them after 3 years. Since my grandfather was hospitalized at the time due to stomach ulcers(he succumbed eventually), all the adults used to leave the house at 9AM and return only at the evening, around 8PM. My cousin was the oldest sibling and was advised to take care of us. We were 4 siblings all together. 
It all started on 16th June 2011, when we were watching something on movie which had a hot girl as the lead actress. He started talking about hot girls and started describing what horny fucks his friends at school were. He told me that they would jerk off in the class at times and that he used to do that as well. I didn't even know what jerking off was at that time. Being a curious fucker that I've always been, I tried jerking off in the washroom but nothing happened. While I was getting it on, I realized that the window to the bathroom was open and I could see my cousin standing on something and staring at me. It was really awkward but I don't think he noticed that I saw him. When I came out of the bathroom sometimes later, he was on the bed and asked me to sit beside him. He started talking about how he saw me naked when I was born and wanted to see me bare it all again. I had absolutely no clue what he was talking and since I was taught to obey the elders, I stripped down completely. He held my penis in his hands and started massaging it. At a point he took out his own thing and started jerking it. I was absolutely clueless as to why he was doing that. For the next 4-5 days, this cycle kept on going, he told me to strip down, and would jerk off while looking at me. This kept on going until the day my grandpa died and we went to the crematorium. Since the adults started staying home, he stopped doing all that and everything got normal. 


Now, I'm a decently attractive dude(thank you puberty) and I play guitar and piano, so naturally I get a lot of attention from people. However, the first time I made out with a girl, I remember that I was kinda distant, both physically and emotionally. It freaked me out that someone was touching me and I had a panic struck moment or two. But it got all right after some time and I got back to normal. 
 I'm 19 right now and I've never been intimate with anyone, both emotionally and physically. I was casually suicidal between the age of 13 and 17 and I still have no reasons for it. I chalked off the self harm and suicidal nature to me craving attention and being immature. But now that I get a lot of attention, I'm still afraid of people. I have serious trust issues and I don't even trust my parents. I feel that everyone will betray me so I keep them at an arms length. Surprisingly, I still meet that cousin once a year or two and have normal casual talks. We've even slept on the same bed and it was perfectly normal. Now, there are reports about him losing his mind, hurting people and breaking stuff but I don't think that's related to my case. 
I've researched a lot on this subject(yeah I'm a nerd) and everything points out to say that I might've been sexually harassed. I still can't rationalize the fact though, I have a good self esteem and comfortable with friendships and stuff. Just intimacy issues, many people have them right? I'm at the end of the road with my thought process and don't know how to rationalize that incidence.

616,"Hi, 

So my boyfriends google account was hacked in to two nights ago at 2am. They’ve forgotten our devices from the account and changed the password, and the google recovery page won’t let us recover the account because we aren’t ‘using a recognised device’.

We think they did it to gain access to his old school RuneScape account, which is probably worth close to £500 on the black market, as he’s been locked out of that and the email address changed. Every recovery request we submit is being denied, despite information provided being correct. Obviously as the hackers have access to the emails, they also have access to all the question answers RuneScape asks for (creation date, transactions, etc.) 

The thing I am more worried about, though, is the fact that he has an android, so all his phone backups were on that account. They also have our names, home address, absolutely loads of data on us. The thing I am MOST worried about is the fact that there are copious amounts of very explicit photos/videos of us over the past 4 years of our relationship. 

Assuming they did just hack him for RuneScape, do hackers ever sell account details on? And anyone know what the best thing to do to get the google account back to him? (Also, if anyone knows how he could win this request for account ownership back, that would be great, too. He’s been playing for 3 years and it’s distraught.)

We’ve tried deleting photos from the phone itself, and clicking the box for ‘also delete on google’, but that doesn’t work. 

I am really, really worried about how having this stuff leaked could seriously affect my career.",07Jun2020,1
617,"To begin with, I have not lost hope in attaining the perfect relationship with them.

My parents are very conventional and follow their culture more than anything else and this has often been forced upon me but I yearn to be my own person just like all my friends are able to. However in my family it is near difficult to ever speak out without aggravating my dad because he has the tendency to snap in an aggressive manner which has always been subjected to my mum and I have witnessed twice now for myself. I’m 22 now and I have slowly been growing the courage just in case at any moment he snaps again because of my inability to conform to their wishes or I have also started expressing my own views. However it is very likely that any time I resist that he will snap and I can’t believe that I have to fear a parent and don’t believe I can love person who I fear in life, who id rather have complete trust in and will allow me to be my own person whilst at the same time love me. They have still a bit to go in fully accepting my brother for being gay, and don’t understand they can’t keep making me live in this environment anymore. My mum is the instigator, whenever she spots something she doesn’t believe is correct manner by me she tells my dad. And then he attempts to force me to conform to their way. 
I know there are stricter parents out there and I am still privileged to live the life I do but my goal in life is to have a perfect family at one point in my life, even if that means I can’t have one with my current family, I’ll be 100% sure to have it with my future family. 
Am I going about this the right way? I’ve just always had this mentality and never told anyone so I wouldn’t know my other options.

619,"Throw away. My (f31) little sister (f28) is engaged to an awful person (m28) they have broken up a few times over the years and the last time we were sure it was the last. He has been physically and verbally abusive. (This was confirmed to me after their breakup.) His parents have also been verbally abusive to her and she lives in their house (heavily advised against) They secretly got back together shortly after breaking up and she is now pregnant with his kid. They are talking about getting married again (this was being planned before the breakup) I was slated to be her maid of honor but after learning the things I did after this most recent split, I can no longer be in support of the marriage. I fully understand it is not about me in any shape of form. But I am not in support of her marrying this abusive person. When we finally figured out they were back together I told her flat out I am not her shoulder to cry on anymore. I put myself and my kid at risk the last time when we went to remove her from his place. He makes no effort to be involved with our immediate family (it is quite large 7 kids 9 grandkids 2 more grand kids on the way. This does not include active spouses) He also doesn't ever offer to help in the way families do (moving, babysitting, help with a jump start those sorts of things) unless he is paid for it. This isn't one of those situations where she is trapped and has no where else to go and no money. She is the provider of income at the moment. (He is dealing with some medical things and hasn't been able to work for a while. That I am not holding against him but his treatment of her while all that was going on is terrible. Including but not limited to telling her his medical issues where her fault) All of us who live locally (including our parents) have a place for her to stay but she refusing claiming ""they are working on it"" I know it will cause a huge problem if I drop out but my feelings on the situation are not a secret to her and I can't use ""she's my little sister"" as my only justification for staying in the wedding. I am happy to attend as a guest. But I don't want her looking back on all of her photos knowing I am pretending to be happy for her (I have experienced this so I understand how tainted those photos can feel) my husband(m35) is in full support of whatever I suppose and I know is leaning towards drop out as I always end up doing WAY too much for other peoples weddings. (The last family wedding somehow cost me close to $800 and I was only a bridesmaid. Dress and shoes were less than $200 so the rest was just extras I kept getting asked to pick up) sorry this is so long and not terribly well organized.

I’d say for probably as long as I can remember I was always kinda made to be a people pleaser, if i did something wrong when I was younger my dad would scream at me (like full on scream) , once I remember I was like 7 and got sick and the entire night he was exploding at me for being sick , that’s just one example of HUNDREDS I’d probably have ; but it’s one that sticks out . It basically now led to me being over apologetic and over thinking a lot in my day to day tasks. My friends pick up on it , etc, and it’s starting to fuck up actual conversations . I’m also pretty sure it’s getting onto my boyfriends nerves, and the absolute last thing I’d want is to make him feel uncomfortable with me or anything because of it . But I basically just uncontrollably feel bad over such small things all the time , a conversation will be going fine and I’ll get the sudden feeling I said/did something wrong (when looking back I probably didn’t) in these situations and immediately start apologising, but I do it with good intent because the last thing I want is for people I care about to dislike me but this whole overthinking and over apologising thing is starting to get out of hand . I really need to put a stop to it at one point . I’m hoping somewhere here has any kind of advice.

623,"While mental illness is in no way an excuse for what I've done, I believe it's a vital part of the backstory to how and why this happened.

I am currently 17 years old, and since around age 10 my home life has been awful. My mother has been heavily drinking almost every day since then, so It's impossible to get any advice or affection from her. Similarly, my father is very stern and refuses to acknowledge her problem. He used to be violent to the point of giving my mother blood and bruises, where the police were called and he was arrested (in jail for one night). This only happened once, however. My mother used the police call as a way to get back at my father, she was being far more aggressive towards him (although domestic violence is never ok) she admitted she never felt in danger. While the physical abuse stopped, the emotional abuse didn't. I've always been told I'm a bitch/ bastard and I'd end up working at McDonalds, and should go to social care if I hated home so much. Whenever I'd try to get advice about school issues, my mum would call my friend a 'fat pig' and other horrible names. It got to a point where I hated myself so much I didn't go to school anymore, and became suicidal. I didn't leave my room for a whole year and was self harming. I was eventually put on antidepressants and given counselling, so I managed to recover. I had to take my exams in half the time as I missed all of year 10 (I live in the UK), yet managed to get outstanding grades and got to the college I dreamed of going to. There, a friend I've known for a long time (but didn't keep in contact with) was also going, so as I didn't know anyone/ was extremely socially anxious I saw her as my safety. There we met a group of friends, with the future boyfriend  in question. My friend told me he had an ongoing romantic relationship with his best friend's girlfriend at the time, and he still didn't know (this happened about 4 months before). Despite this, they soon entered a relationship. This boyfriend was extremely flirtatious to many girls, even in front of her, but it was written off as his personality. They had been dating for about 2-3 months when he started to tell another close friend of mine that he was developing feelings for me. I was confused, as I realised how immoral all this was, but as his flirtatious behaviour was so normalised and accepted this seemed just like another classic thing for him to do, so I didn't look to much into it. I've been diagnosed with Body Dysmorphic Disorder, which means I see myself as completely unlovable and repulsive. I told him about his, and he reassured me that I was beautiful, and many other people thought so too. Since compliments in my family were nonexistent, it felt incredible to be told the opposite of what I thought. One day in December he invited me over and explained how he felt. We both got very drunk and ending up kissing on his bed for several minutes. The whole time I was telling him how awful i felt, so he called my other friend to ask her opinion. She said it wasn't that bad, but I didn't know this particular friend had slept with him the night before (who is also very good friends with his girlfriend). I saw her advice as honest, but still felt disgusted with myself. I went home and cried, and wrote him a text that everything was a mistake. But as pathetic as it is, I still loved the attention as it filled a void. A couple of weeks later, after hearing about my other friend sleeping with him, I almost saw this as justification that it wasn't that bad. So, at a party, I kissed him for several minutes again (he tried to go further, but I stopped him). After a couple of weeks I felt so awful so decided me and my friend had to tell her. We came clean, and she was understandably distraught. I felt so awful, and tried everything I could to make it up to her. I wrote her long notes explaining the whole situation, bought her flowers on her birthday, gave her space etc. Eventually, she began talking to all 3 of us again, although it had gone round school, so now I'm afraid everyone sees me as a slut. This boy is the only boy I've ever kissed. This whole situation has made me hate myself. Is there any way I can recover from this? Am i extremely immoral or do drunk 17 year olds make mistakes? 5 months down the line, both me and this boy are single, and kiss again. Why do I feel so guilty about doing this?. Around this time I decided I didn't want to hold grudges and move on, as everyone else has done the same. Is this a bad idea? As I have no one in my family to talk to about this, I'm genuinely so lost at what is right and wrong. Can anyone offer me any advice about what to do?",07Jun2020,1

I’m only 17 and i met this girl like 10 months ago.  I was so beyond happy with her and she dumped me over text because she lost feelings for me. And i get that life has people come and go.  I know this might take you back because of my age but i really thought she was the one, she was my first love and i thought she was perfect.  I haven’t told many people this but my moms is terminally ill with stage 4 metastatic breast and bone cancer, and they’re doing everything they can but i don’t know how much longer she has left, I don’t if she’ll see me graduate or have kids or get my first big job.  I thought at the very least i could show her who i thought it was gonna be and i feel like that’s just been thrown back in my face.  Other than that i live a very privileged life, i have my problems but it’s always small things that you can make up in day.  I spent my whole quarantine with her and face-timed her everyday, and played Minecraft with her, i spent time with her, and the only reason we weren’t officially dating sooner was because i wanted to do ask her in person.  And now that’s all gone, I can’t stop thinking about her, every song i listen to game i play people i try to talk to remind me of her in some way.  she broke up with me over text and i was super upset about how impersonal that felt and i wanted to call her and hear her one last time.  She said she broke up with me because she lost feelings and i think i know her well enough to know that’s true, and she’s not lying.  I want her back so badly and everybody tells me i need to move on and forget about her and someone better will come my way, but i wanted that one.  She said she needs space and i understand that but i feel if i let go I can’t even be friends with her.  I feel like she hates me now.  I thought i found the one, and now she’s gone.

626,"As the title states, I dont know what major to pick. I'm not good at anything nor am I really passionate in anything either but I also want to live a comfortable life. I already applied for a CS degree since, to me, it seemed like the safest option with almost a guarantee in living a comfortable decent life. I already dabbled in a bit of programming and I genuinely sort of enjoyed it at the time but now it just feels boring and it kinda urks me thinking about studying it. I thought of a degree in math (which is a subject I'm kinda decent in, in highschool) but I have no idea what I'd do with that degree.

I considered just foregoing University altogether but I'd probably feel more lost then. I wouldn't know what to do with my life at that point and I'd probably also get kicked out because my parents REALLY want me to go to University and as I said, I would like to live a comfortable life and I dont think that could happen for me if I decided to not go for college.

Next day she invited me and she said ""hey sis"", so she thought i was a girl and i wanted to tell her i'm not a girl but for some reason I didn't and just responded with ""hey"",and again started playing without much talking for a couple of hours,meanwhile she asked me for my discord which also has a girly resemblance.

Then she was busy the following day,so the last time we did anything was yesterday.

We we're both online and she invited me, this time she asked me to vc and my heart started beating whilst making an excuse so i told her I lagg if i vc whilst playing and that my phone is charging,and she asked me for my social media which i told her im too uncomfortable to share those.

Later at night I felt really bad for lying so much and decided to stop and as we were having a convo for the first time, she mentions that she just got out of a 3yr realtionship and her dad passed away, and she only sees comfort in the game we both play and her friends and how good of a friend I've been.

633,"So, this is a kid I see from time to time and he from the first time I saw him I realized he is a troubled child. He is around 6 or 7. Over the course of our conversations I came to know that he is one of the children of a rich businessman bigshot in this town. He told me about his father's exploits and new enterprises that were opening in the town. Just 20 minutes ago, I came by him again on my walk. He had a bruise on his right eye. It was an oval shaped bruise you get when someone punches you with a fist. 

I inquired about what happened to him. He got all twitchy and nervous. I could see his eyes running away from mine. He said he probably fell somewhere. I acted stupid but pressed him further and he told me that he fell on a rock while riding a bike. Now I was sure someone hit him.

He left and from the group of his friends that were playing nearby i invited the oldest one and also the one I know and trust. I asked him about this all. After a minute or two of conversation, he told me that the boy's father is really strict and abusive towards them. He told me he suspects his father did this to him. When further questioned, he told me that the boy had new wounds every week. He described a medium to big sized bruise on the boy's stomach and ""an enourmous one"" on his left arm. 

I acted indifferent and told the lad to leave.

That was around 20 minutes ago. I understand that I need to call the child protective services. There are four problems.
First, I am a minor.
Second, the father is a rich and respected man
Third, every institution in this country of mine is corrupt. I can't call them because they will just inform him who called and why. I'm not saying every person in CPS is like that, but there are loads that would take a bribe.

642,"I’m (23F) engaged to to be marry to my finance (24M) whom I have dated for almost 6 years now. We’re both atheists and neither of our direct family are religious besides my fiancé’s brother and his wife (they’re Catholics). 

Since his brother and him are close, they suggested us doing a marriage prep with a local church they go to (not because we’re getting married at a church but because they think it’ll be helpful for us). We agreed because I value premarital therapy and want to take my future BIL’s advice seriously, fiancé is the same way. And although we’re both atheists, I understand and value religion as part of people’s life, just not personally my life since I have never been formally educated on any type of religion besides Buddhism briefly. 

We came in with an open mind, then the Deacon shit all over us since we were honest about our living situation (we’ve live together for 4+ years now) and how I’m not planning on having a kid until I’m 30 (I’m missing my primal child bearing years as he says it). I think part of the reason I’m so shocked is that no one every has scold me for something that is so normal and acceptable in today’s society before. 

So we told BIL we’re going to find another marriage prep counselor to talk to who isn’t going to shit on the very core of our values. We found a great Christian marriage prep counselor who focused mainly on us and our issues and we all had 5 great sessions.

Well now, whenever we see BIL’s wife (I guess SIL), she constantly talks about how because we went through the marriage prep with a Christian counselor, that God loves us and he’s looking over us and our relationship constantly. I don’t know how to politely tell her to stop, but I’m so uncomfortable. Before going to the church they recommend, I had an open mind, but after our experience there, it just really solidifies my general beliefs and pushes me away from religion even more.

Summary: I wanted to go to marriage prep primarily for mine and my fiancé’s sake, for our future to see what we need to look out for. But now our BIL and SIL thinks we are open to being converted and will talk about God continuously. I want it to stop but I don’t know how to.",07Jun2020,1

He responded with, ""I know from prior experience that it is not, go ahead."" Now this made me think, if I actually did it, it would shock the hell out of him, and it would be hilarious. I sent him a picture of one of my tits, with a knife censoring, y'know, the important parts. He replied, ""MAKU. WHAT THE FUCK."" and then calmly asked me what kind of knife it was. He didn't really care. And I didn't consider it a big deal to send him that, it was more of a lewd than a nude anyway. I sent a screenshot of that interaction to a groupchat that he, his girlfriend, and a few of our other friends were in, because I found it funny and thought others would too. It wouldn't be the first time I sent the groupchat a screenshot of a funny interaction between him and I. But,, his girlfriend got INCREDIBLY upset. I went to DMs with her and showed her exactly what I sent, expecting it to calm her down because again, I didn't consider it a huge deal. However she got more upset, called me a bad person, asked me if I normally tried to ruin relationships. I apologized over and over and asked her if there was any way I could fix it, I also apologized to my friend that I'd sent it to. After I apologized to him, he said, and I quote exactly, ""You knew I wouldn't care, you knew I'd never actually view you in a sexual way, you did it for a joke. It's fine man."" And he's correct. I'd like to note that I do NOT like this guy, if I'd thought for a second that he would find the lewd even remotely sexual i never would have sent it to him. I also told his girlfriend that I'd never send him anything like that again, by this point I'd realised just how badly I'd fucked up. Nothing helped though, his girlfriend stayed extremely angry with me and she told me that she never wanted me to talk to her boyfriend again. Then she got him to block me. She also lied to a few mutual friends, telling them that I had sent the guy ""full nudes"" even though I'd shown her exactly what I'd sent, which was certainly not full nudes. One of those friends blocked me because of this. Overall, I understand that I fucked up, but I also feel like she's overreacting. I made a mistake and tried to fix it, but she ruined multiple friendships for me. I don't know whether I had it coming or whether I just got myself into an unusually bad situation because of that mistake, and I don't know how I can fix things between my me and my friends or even if I deserve to be able to.",07Jun2020,1
650,So ima get right to the point I’m a straight guy I only like women and only want relationships or sad with them but I wonder what it would feel like to be fucked by a man or what it would feel like to fuck a man I have no intention to try to find out it’s just a random thought that keeps circling my mind but does that make me gay even tho I don’t find men attractive it could still arouse me at the thought of what it feels like,07Jun2020,1

653,"I just need some to be heard and given some advice, more or less.

I (17F) am desperately wanting to move out.

TW for Abuse, Suicide attempts, and Sexual assault to whom it may concern, I don’t want to hurt anyone else in the process of me airing my life out. 

This is going to be a long one, I’m sorry.

For context:

I have been living in an abusive household since I was about 11. I don’t know what happened to make it turn exclusively abusive around that point, but there had always been issues prior to then (my dad was in a rodeo band and we’d have random strangers at my house all week during the summer and late fall, my brother tried to drown me at 7, and my step-dad’s side of the family had always treated my mother and I very poorly), but maybe it had always been this way, and had finally noticed. 

I think it was around the time my dad had been finally been clearly deemed as an alcoholic in my head things started to barrel downhill. 

In the middle of 6th grade, I had finally began to understand the implications of my buried childhood trauma: I had been molested for about a year by another child when I was in third grade. I didn’t really think to tell anyone but my best friend at the time in 7th grade, but she quickly dismissed me and told me I was searching for attention, thus encouraging me not to tell anyone again (until recent year). The understanding of this lead me into a quick mental spiral I which I became extremely depressed and riddled with anxiety.

I told my mom in around 7th grade that I thought that I needed therapy, but she quickly shut it down by saying it was that I was simply just angsts. It was about a year later that my mom found my diary filled with suicide notes in it. She simply laughed at me and told me not to curse. I had written myself a Eulogy and she laughed. 

It was a year later that I tried to kill myself rather haphazardly. I was 14, I took whatever was in the medicine cabinet, albeit rather useless stuff. It sounds stupid , and I knew even at the time it was stupid, but I took the remaining contents of a bottle of ibuprofen and a bottle of Benadryl, I figured that if it wouldn’t kill me immediately I would eventually die of liver damage. Sadly (to my younger self), I woke up the next morning, sick as hell. I told my mom what I had done and she laughed and told me I was lying, that I was just looking for attention, that she wouldn’t take me to the emergency room.

To top off the entirety of middle school, I was living in a disgusting home and was being bullied relentlessly.

My home was infested with cockroaches. We owned upwards of 8-10 dogs at a time because my mom was a bulldog breeder, all of which neither my mother nor father cleaned up after. They didn’t clean up much after themselves either, leaving large steel pots to fester with mold and maggots, and I would always be the one cleaning up after them. Flushing maggots and mold down the toilet and washing the pots in a half-bathroom wasn’t exactly the highlight of my day by any means. The kitchen sink didn’t work due to clogging, so it was my only place to work. Aside from the dishes, I can account all the times I sat on my knees on the floor, scraping off dog shit with a spatula, and all the times I got chemical burns from the cleaning agents. 

And to anyone who wants to comment about how I should have just taken care of this as it went, I was 12-14. I was terrified. I was hiding from a drunkard with violent tendencies and a mother who guilt tripped me after every mistake I made. Notably, her cute little catch phrase was and apparently always will be, “one of these days you’re going to see me hanging from that banister there.”

Around this time is when I came out as bisexual. Have whatever feelings you have about that, but if you’re going to comment something negative about it please just leave. She had her typical reaction of “no you’re not, and here’s an 8 page essay about how stupid and wrong you are”, all the courage I had mustered up had come crashing down, and further deteriorated my mental health. 

For about a year or so, my mom worked 4 jobs, one at a landscaping business as a secretary, one as a home caretaker for the elderly, one as a substitute teacher, and one directing karaoke at a local bar. That basically meant she was never home, and I was stuck at home alone with my dad. I never left my room, except to eat and use the restroom on rare occasions, usually electing to do both at school for sanitary and safety reasons.

At the end of 8th grade, my grandma, who lives in North Carolina, took a fall in the middle of the summer on a day my grandpa had to be out of town. She was letting out the horses, and tripped and fell. It was July, and she suffered heat stroke and was on the edge of death. We packed up and left our house in Texas to come and “help”. 

About a year prior, I had been sent to visit them, the biggest and most notable event was finding out that the person I had been calling dad my entire life was really my step dad. My real dad had abandoned me at birth. My entire family had hid it from me my entire life. My grandma mistakenly told me about my mom and dads wedding and I was confused because,who I knew to be, my dad was wed to my mom because of common-law. 

Although things aren’t as bad as they used to be, things are still in shambles since we’ve moved.

When moving, I packed everything up neatly into boxes, and left what I wanted to be donated in trash bags.

The plan was to take what we needed, donate what we didn’t, and to begin renting a place by my grandparents. 

That was really funny.

My mom, sister, and I took a road trip to my grands, I could only bring one box of my summer clothes and some knick knacks because of the space in our car. They spent about a week here and then left back to Texas to get the rest of our stuff (and my sister would return and stay in her house as she wasn’t moving with us.). It took my mom and dad until October to return, mind you it was a week before school started in late august but that my mom left. 

When they returned they only brought one of my shirts. 

I had my entire life packed into boxes and they only brought a shirt that had been mixed into their laundry on ACCIDENT. 

My stuff is still at the house as we speak, all of my expensive jewelry that I didn’t dare bring on the road trip, all my collectibles (including snowglobes I’d been given about each year since birth), and all of the art, art supplies, and sheet music that I’d been keeping for years due to its sentimental value. 

Aside from my one t shirt, they managed to bring my school awards from fifth grade. I suppose that set the tone for now.

We didn’t move into a house. She bought a camper across the road and I have been living in my grandparents spare bedroom. 

Since then, the trend of verbal abuse has continued. And everything since my last aforementioned point has just been another straw on the camels back, each one feeling back breaking. 

Her qualms with me wanting to date a girl freshman year, how she “always knew I was a lesbian, but I need to be straight”

Her refusing to buy me basic necessities, but buying my father a new PlayStation.

Her screaming at me for wanting to be in theater because it was “extremely selfish”, but never had a problem with it when she was bragging about it on FaceBook. 

Her constant belittling of me.

Her screaming at any mistake I make. 

Her making me do everything for her short of wiping her ass (cooking, cleaning, running baths for her, delivering food, shopping for her, etc etc) while simultaneously telling me that I’m worthless and that I make everyone feel like shit and do nothing for others.

I’m going to be honest, I’m tired. 

I’ve missed major things that have been neglected my entire life. I’ve never been to the dentist, I’ve never been to the doctor outside of physicals for school (and even then I went to the local health department), I’m severely unhealthy. 

I’ve tried everything, talking to counselors and social workers at the school, trying to get things together to emancipate, trying to call dss, going to therapy secretly through the school, but none have helped me get any closer to leaving.

BUT

My best friend Lauren asked her mother if I could move in. They have 3 spare bedrooms. 

I could get a job.

I could start saving up for things.

I turn 18 the second week of school. 

I don’t know if I can take this anymore, but I’m terrified that if I leave I can’t or won’t come back. 

I dont want to leave my sister and grandparents behind, but for my mental stability and general well being I know I need to leave. I need to take care of myself, but I don’t know whether or not I should just wait until college. 


Please, if any of you can give me advice, I’m in dire need of it. I have 3 months to decide. Please help.",07Jun2020,1
654,"This is gonna be long, but please bare with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ending my junior year in high school rn, and I'm looking back on the year during lockdown and starting to realize that a lot of my ""friends"" could've secretly been jerks to me behind my back. You see, there are 2 groups of kids at my school, which I'll call A and B. A and B know each other pretty well.

A couple of months ago, one of the kids from A took this pic of me looking at a girl's Insta (who was a crush at the time). It was badly timed, with my eyes closed and mouth open. He sent it to some ppl, and those ppl sent it to others, and ppl kept sending that pic to each other. But it started with him. The girl found out and blocked me. I was teased about it for a day before forgetting about it. But a kid told me that ppl were secretly making fun of me behind my back and showed the pic to random ppl.

One of the kids from A (not the one who originally took the pic, a diff kid) told me that a kid from B called me 'boscar' behind my back, and even made a disstrack about me on his Youtube channel. It was a Roxanne parody that was mocking me. That kid from A told me that the kid who took that pic of me takes pics of him and everyone else from A too, and that if those pics spread they wouldn't care, so I shouldn't care either.

And so I confronted the creator of that Roxanne parody, and he told me that the Roxanne parody was actually for someone else. Another kid from B, who knew about this, told me that A was just making up that rumor to make up for spreading that pic, and was like ""It really hurts that you would accuse us for something like that. I thought we were bros man. We planned on inviting you to to go to the mall with us but then lockdown happened."" They said that the whole 'boscar' thing was for someone else, but those lyrics from the Roxanne parody sounded strangely accurate, because each line was something I did or a characteristic of mine. I listened to my gut feeling, and told the creator to take down that damn video. I told him I was gonna be nice, and give him until the fall of senior year (3-4 months from now, assuming COVID-19 clears up by then and everything goes back to normal), to take down the video. If I still see that video up there when school starts up back again, I was gonna inform a dean about this. He kept arguing that it was for someone else, and that I have a serious complex going on if I think that everyone is secretly planning something behind my back. I kept telling him I was gonna tell a dean about it, and kept telling him I didn't appreciate it. That creator of the Roxanne parody told me that he only jokes with me, and never jokes behind my back, but eventually after enough arguing, he took down the video.

And so it kept going back and forth. Each group would tell me that they're my bros, before pointing fingers at the other and say that the other group is being the real dick. To sort things out, one of the kids from A (same one who informed me about that Roxanne parody), made this one huge gc, and included everyone from both A and B. A and B fired accusations at each other and argued with each other for about 5 min, while I was sitting directly in the crossfire, trying to figure everything out. After those 5 min, A and B dropped the whole matter completely and proceeded to talk about other things, like school work (again, some of the kids from A are friends with some the kids from B). From there, I just left since I got nothing out of the gc. I was hoping that the huge gc would clear everything up, but instead it just made everything even more muddy and even more confusing.

This went down about a month ago, and I haven't heard anything since. I have weekly therapy sessions, and I'm gonna bring this up with him to see what he has to say about this. 

I don't see myself as a shy person. I have no problem standing up for myself and speaking up when I have to. But the problem is that I don't know WHO to stand up to. Like I have a tough time deciding who is really my friend, and who is just being a snake; who is being honest and helpful to me, and who is just toying with my emotions. What do I do?",07Jun2020,1
655,"My girlfriend and I are having this dilemma. We have been together for 6 months now. We really like each other and almost spend each and every day together. We will be going to different grad schools in the fall so we will be away from each other but we will constantly visit. We know it’s hard but we might as well try. We know it’s only 6 months, but we are like best friends, we barely fight, we love being romantic with each other, but we fear our harsh relationship pasts sort of dented our ability to really love (if that makes sense). Guys have taken advantage of her feelings and she really felt depressed over it. I had my own fair share of mental and physical abuse from partners. I dealt with codependency and stuck with an abusive girlfriend trying to make her happy all the time. Now I feel the most independent I’ve ever felt. My current girlfriend and I spoke about it and we said we are each other’s favorite person we’ve ever been with so far. We treat each other amazingly and we communicate. Our dilemma is that we don’t know what Love really feels like (we know it’s only been 6 months). We know that we’ve passed the honeymoon/infatuation stage. We are super comfortable with each other. We talk about everything. She’s my best friend and deep down I think I do love her. I definitely love her as a friend. We are still strong. We still really like each other. We’ve shared things we’ve never told anyone. We don’t really feel the butterflies in the stomach or anything. We don’t know what to feel? Are we in love but we don’t know it? Is it too early to call? No matter what, we will be in each other’s lives.

I'm trying to be better but she never encourages me. She just finds something new to complain about. Even with my grades, if I get all As and 1 B she will ask me about the B as if the As didn't exist. 

She talks behind my back all the time and I know I'm terrible and childish and get into arguments but it just hurts to here it every day of my fucking life. I don't have any friends and I'm stuck here 24/7 of course I'm in a shitty mood. I have nothing. I hate myself as much as she does (probably more) but she doesn't have to rub it in that I suck.

How am I supposed to get better? She makes me not want to try anymore, there's no point if shell always see me as a stupid useless child. I'm sorry I wasted 16 years of your life just to turn out like this.

659,"First off, I (14M) would like to say that I am a very paranoid person with a serious case of anxiety. 

Long story short, my uncle (60+M) was a wealthy man who got scammed of his money. His wife divorced him and took custody of his children and property.

My uncle lived overseas so I almost never got to see him, except once when he came to my father's funeral. 

Due to the fact that he is homeless and broke, he plans on coming back to our home country. Nobody welcomes him except for my mother (54M) who has supposedly good relationship with him.

My mother thinks it will be a good idea for him to sleep at our house for an unknown period of time, atleast a few months she said.

I rarely see my uncle and I never even talked with him. My paranoia is getting worse as the time passed. I feel like he is going to do some weird shit or invade my piracy. I just don't trust him.

660,"I am a 24F with a full time job in customer support. I work for a good company. They are very large but I do not feel there is a high probability for growth. 

I was in college for a few years but did not complete any degree. My parents pushed me into college when I had no area of study that interested me, so they picked one for me. I quit college because my mental health was deteriorating from the stress. I struggle with school and I have never had the option to complete school without also having a 30-40hr a week job. I was having panic attacks multiple times per week and I became horribly depressed because school made me feel like an incompetent failure. Not to mention, after ~3 years of school I still never figured out a career path that interested me. I often consider going back to college to finish a degree but I truly do not know if it is worth it. I am already 13k in debt from the schooling I did not finish. I have so many friends who completed degrees and then did nothing in that area of study so it feels like it could be pretty pointless to go back. But at the same time, I dont want to be a quitter and I know ive already put money into it so it feels like I SHOULD go back. 

My boyfriend is super encouraging and supportive and helps push me to try to better myself rather than just settling for my lame customer service job. He also knows I have always dreamt of being my own boss. Working for a corperation does not interest me. I would love to open a plant nursery or a cafe/restaurant. He has so much confidence in me and thinks I should just go for it. However, my boyfriend is also pursuing a career as an army pilot. That being said, if he does get accepted into that program, we could be shipped off to just about anywhere and move around who knows how many times. So.. I can't really focus on opening a business when I could be leaving here within the next 1-2 years. And starting a business in a brand new state where I have no friends or family to help me network and spread the word seems SO much harder. 

What the heck am I supposed to do??

665," 

So I when I was 10 I changed schools and like literally the second I entered my new classroom I immediately developed a crush on this guy..it was literally crush at first sight .I was completely obsessed with him but I never spoke to him because I'm an introvert and it sucked even more because I didn't even get to know him before I liked him, thankfully he was really smart and would usually top almost every class.I told a few friends about him and almost openly admitted that I liked him but as soon as I realized that he wasn't receptive I immediately shut down all the ""rumours"".

We would usually get compared a lot by the teachers in class because we were really smart and were also used as friend examples in class while explaining stuff in sums and other stuff but we never spoke because he was kind of arrogant , something I realized later on. Well time flew by and I was in 10th grade before I knew it and I had barely said a few sentences to him over the years and I thought that,that was it and told myself to forget about him cause he's never notice or think about you now .(The school that I was in was only till 10th grade and we would have to join some other school to attend 11th grade.)

Well we graduated 10th grade and 4 months later there was an event in my area that everyone would usually attend..it was kind of like a gathering that people would go to for like 7 days in a row. So I was kind of late and my friends were already sitting (on like these huge steps of an open ground auditorium)and well there was like this one space next my crush and I had no other option but to sit next to him.He was showing everyone my friend a picture of his grandmom's 250 year tree that got uprooted in a storm and coincidentally I was born where his grandmom's from so I told him that and he just got interested in where I was from and we had our first conversation ..turns out we have a lot of common interests and he really shared a lot about himself .He then said that he never related to someone as much before and looked forward to meeting me tomorrow .I almost fainted lol. So we talked to each other for like 2 more days till the end of the functions .2 months later there was another function where most of my classmates were present and he completely ignored me like he didn't even say hi..he literally said hi to the girl standing next to me and not me.

Thankfully, my brothers dog is a very big boy and is extremely passive. He just threw her off of him and ran. I honestly believe she was trying to kill him and would have if he was a small dog. She then attacked him again when he was playing with another ball. My brothers dog is completely fine. He didn't even acknowledge the little wound on his ear. 

I'm torn about her being my dog. She came from a poor situation and has had a rough life. I don't want her to go back there but I think she may have been happier there. She doesn't seem to like my boyfriend or I. We're just kind of present for her. She is house trained, doesnt chew anything we dont give her, and is great during car rides. She's also very good with kids. She doesn't jump on them or show any sign of aggression.

We really wanted a dog that was cuddly, playful, and would be fine with play dates with other dogs. She just isn't that. She is just here. I feel like a jerk for even talking about it and my boyfriend has never had a dog so he's very much for keeping her. Even though, my boyfriend is very disappointed every time he tries to play or cuddle her. What would you do in this situation?",07Jun2020,1
670,"I live on a a one street subdivision that's The lots are a little more than a quarter acre.

The kids next door have a go kart who's sound is equivalent to that of a chainsaw. They ride this go kart for hours, every day, in the same circle on the back of their qtr acre. 

I am always working in the yard and this is very unsettling to me to listen to this noise for hours every single day. It's loud enough that with the doors closed and the AC running I can still hear it very loud from inside my house.

My question is, am I being overly sensitive here? Would this bother anyone else?",07Jun2020,1
672,"I heard from my girlfriend, who said on the phone to a mutual friend that she showed signs of antibodies to covid19, I feal a bit betrayed because wouldn't this be good for me to know when she found out and not hear it secondhand. We have both been sick a few times and complying to our workplaces covid-19 policies stayed home extra long, just this past few days I've had sore throat and felt warm but I can't really handle warm weather, and I'm not so good at staying hydrated, so I did not consider I might have been sick, had a lingering coff since January. I'm scared I might have exposed coworkers, scared there might be consequences if I tell my boss, but feel they need to know. My girlfriend don't take covid-19 seriously even though she works as an assistant nurse taking care of elderly. So she'd give me shit if I want to self-quarantine as we can't afford staying home too much. There's also the aspect of our 2year old son, about  everyone at his daycare. What the hell should I do? Any sign or runny nose or coffing and he would be sent home and stayed home, but if he might have been infected w out symptoms?",07Jun2020,1
673,"hi everyone! I need some advice. a few months ago, my classmate made some racist comments outside of the school. he said that all terrorists are muslim and that the Quran says it's okay to kill people who are non-muslim and gays and that all women are going to hell. he said that when he meets a muslim, he assumes that's what they believe. I was raised muslim and although I haven't practiced in 10 years, I grew up going to Sunday school and Quran camp so I have a pretty good idea of the religion (also my family is muslim) and what he said was incorrect and I made it very clear which he reduced to a ""political opinion"". additionally, he said that because African Americans commit more crimes, police officers should have their guards up more around them. he has expressed these ideologies in another class (I wasn't in that class but another student in our class was). the worst part of all this is that he is a clinical psychology major and wants to be a therapist. I am a psych major going into research and I promise you 100% that he does not belong in this field. I worry for the racism and discrimination he will express towards muslim &amp; African American patients.i don't know if he plans on refusing to serve muslims and AA's or what. we were in community college together and we have both transferred to a university. I have no audio evidence of him saying these statements but there were 2 other people who were there. I want to reach out to the head of the psychology program at my university but when I reached out to the community college, they said there wasn't much they could do. what do I do?",07Jun2020,1
674,"Like...how I literally talk. This person said I didn’t sound feminine enough and needed to speak in a higher pitch and sound more...girly. 

I am a female with a bit of a huskier, deeper voice. People on the phone or people in public often misgender me because they hear an unfamiliar sounding voice from a face and body that does not “match” it. 

I honestly don’t know what to feel or do about it. I’ve always been very insecure about my voice from a young age. People would think that I was a mute child cause I never spoke. I think I truly had been ashamed of my voice even as a child, and unfortunately it has passed on into my adulthood. When people bring up how my voice sounds different or a tad bit masculine, I get overwhelmingly uncomfortable and I just want to never speak to anyone again. 

Should I try speaking higher and more “feminine” (whatever that even means)? I’ve even been told to smile and laugh more because it’ll give me a better chance at making people like me?",07Jun2020,1
675,"Like I said, I'm 18, 19 in four months. In the fall I will be moving out to attend a university for computer science over an hour away. My dad told me today that vacation this year will once again be to the beach. I do not like the beach. We go every year. I always try to go in with the mindset of at least trying to enjoy myself, but I never do.

 For the first time he gave me the option to not go, but he told me if I didn't go I'd have to live with my mom while they are gone because my stepgrandma who usually comes over to ""watch"" me will be on vacation with them. She usually comes over to watch me and my siblings while my dad and stepmom are away, even for a weekend, but this time it would just be me alone here anyway. There's usually a lot of arguing from my stepmom and my dad and I don't want to listen to it for another year. I also have online classes that I have to do during this time and I won't be able to do them on vacation.

I don't know why my dad doesn't trust me. I have to tell him where I'm going every time I leave the house. He has a tracker on my phone even. I don't drink, I don't do any drugs. I got decent grades in school (3.8 gpa) and graduated with honors. I don't really hang out with my friends. My girlfriend and I are long distance so it's not like I'll be sneaking her over. I love my mom but she can be toxic and there's a reason I have distanced myself from her and don't live at her house anymore.


I've boiled it down to a few points 

* In only about three months I will be moving out and living in a new city with no family around to be there for me 24/7. This could be a good practice for that. When I move out I'll be responsible for my own shopping, food, most, if not all, of my rent, car insurance, etc.

* My dad should be able to trust me. I don't drink, smoke, even leave the house. He has a tracker on my phone so he'll be able to see where I am 100% of the time.

* I will be taking online classes and I can't do them at my mom's as I don't have a computer over there and I don't own a laptop.

* They won't have to pay the neighbor's kid to come over and take care of the dogs while they're gone. I usually take care of them anyway, and I take care of my mom's dogs when she's out of town (though my dad doesn't like me doing this and won't let me spend the night over there)

* I'm 18, a legal adult. I know just because I'm a legal adult doesn't mean I'm really seen as one, but I need some independence. I'm tired of being babied.

* When I still lived with my mom there were multiple times she left me home alone for a few days and I did just fine.",07Jun2020,1

680,"Okay so, I (16f) broke up with my (ex) boyfriend (15m) of 7th months on wensday. Since then, hes messaged me every single day begging to take him back, acussed me of the real reason I broke up with him was because i ""found someone else"" (but apparently he wasnt accusing me of cheating?) I asked him twice to stop messaging me asking to work it out, get back together etc. before I had to resort to threatening to block him. And then he still continued to do so and then when I confronted him he said ""I'm sorry I couldnt help it, please dont block me"" 

I broke up with him for a list of reasons, and it's getting obnoxious, I'm trying to follow the advice of my friends, they say I'm being too harsh, but it feels like I'm on repeat. On top of that he keeps saying he'll change and that hes sorry for why I broke up with him (he wouldnt take no for an answer, and would beg when I said no, and other various reasons) and it's like hes finally realized that what's hes been doing is wrong after I'm finally gone, which tells me that he knew it was wrong. 

I get that hes been blindsided by this, and the whole time line of events is probably messing with him because I first started thinking about breaking up with him 6 weeks ago, but my friends talked me out of it, and I wasnt 100% sure that what i had wanted to do. After talking to a friend K, who isnt friends with him, She pointed out some of his behaviors are manipulative (""I'm a terrible boyfriend"" etc.), and now I'm just questioning the entire relationship, Like I just dont know what to do, I mean, even my friend A (shes who talked me out of breaking up with him) and my friend G said that from the screen shots I've sent them, hes like a different person from the one they know, and that hes a dick to me sometimes. 

(but also when he just give me a deadpan stare or says I'm not funny and my jokes are bad hes just messing with me? I mean later he said he does like my jokes, he did the same with the witcher when I got really into it, said that it was dumb and stupid. He also said it was my fault when he bought the witcher 3 because he saw it, thought of me and then bought it? [I think he called me an asshole or something along those lines, but also hes called me ret*rded, sl*t, wh*re, b*tch, etc. (though he did stop calling me the middle two when I got angry at him) 

I'm just not sure what to do, I just feel frayed at the edges and it feels like hes slowing battering away my patience, I feel bad for him, because he says he loves me and that he wants to work things out, and that he'll change, and I know that I havent been the best either, I'd threaten to block him or not do stuff when we were fighting, I'm just not sure what to do, my friends told me not to block him, because its petty and not to be mean, and that I might be too harsh on him, since hes having a hard time. but also they're friends with him so they're view of him might be a bit skewed?

I feel bad for hurting him (though he says I dont, and that i dont care), I really do, but I dont have the emotional capacity to deal with it anymore, I just dont know what to do?",07Jun2020,1

689,"My birthday is past the school grade deadline so My best friend is in the grade above me (as are most of my friends). I’m going to be a Sophomore this year but I’m looking at being a Junior so I can graduate with her. 

There are so many pros and cons to both options and I just have no idea. 

Why graduate early: I could have a senior year with my best friend
- I want to be a psychiatrist which involves medical school which means it would take longer and if I graduate early I can start sooner 
- I might meet people/have opportunities/experiences that I probably wouldn’t if I don’t do it
- Self discovery and college life
- I’ve always been an over achiever and my schools grades are combined so it doesn’t really matter academics wise

Why not: I’m on my schools drama team and am super involved in extra curriculars and I would miss a year of them
- I would miss a year of the Shakespeare competition, the region state one, or the high school Musical theatre awards 
- I would miss a year of prom and other social activities
- but I could make friends/have opportunities I wouldn’t have if I leave early...

My school is k-12 (and I’ll be there till I graduate) and 9-12 grades are combined in all classes except math (and if I don’t leave early then I’d be in calculus senior year) so it’s not like I’m missing out on any classes since all four grades are basically the same. 

If I don’t graduate early, I will be 18 and turn 19 about 2 months into college. I feel sooooo much older than everyone in my current grade, it feels like I was held back and that I’m dumb. 

I’m mostly thinking about doing this for emotional and social reasons. I really wish I had just skipped 8th and said “sign me up for 9th” instead because then I wouldn’t have had to think about it at all. But I didn’t and now if I want to graduate early I actually have to put in the work and get the credits myself. 

 Really the only reason I would want to stay is because I want to participate in drama competitions, but I don’t want to just be like “oh well I have to stay for drama” I don’t think that’s enough. I’m so torn between both. Have any of you graduated early? Did you regret it or was it the best decision? It’s only one year so it’s not even very much. I don’t know what to do :(",07Jun2020,1
690,"TLDR; Everyone has a shitty manager, this is about her and something she said. She’s a type of person who probably shouldn’t be a manager I realize as I type this out and I’m hoping a second opinion can help me. 

I’ll call her D. 

D is the type of person who mirrors Kanye’s mental breakdown, she’s insensitive as fuck. For example:

In my family we have certain mannerisms that I think nothing of, we sometimes respond with just a two tone sound instead saying yes or okay or you’re welcome cause people usually tend to get what I mean and if they don’t I just say the word. 

Simple right? 

One day working with her last month I did this as usual and she proceeded to make fun of it and mock me saying “I’m making dory whale noises! Can you understand me?*whale noise*” for a good chunk of time. I’m the type of person to laugh at it cause that’s my defense against ridiculousness. But I’m my head in like are you a fucking child? 

Now we have to back pedal to before the pandemic.  (I’d ended up being on temp termination for the month of February due to corona so I didn’t really think much about it till I came back last month)

A new guy came in we’ll call him G, and tbh he’s one of my fav people cause he’s chill and silly. We get along well and even have somethings in common with one of those things being both of us are Bi, moved from the south to our big city by himself I fucking admire that cause I want to do the same after I get my degree. 

D doesn’t like G, but will act fake to him but talk shit behind his back. One night working with D she was talking to a bus driver and she didn’t notice me behind her (or didn’t care) and was talking about G, I’m like whatever vent to the customers but then said:

“He better take his faggoty ass back to the south.” 

And I stopped and looked at her like what in the entire fuck? The bus driver Im pretty sure saw my face and didn’t say any in response to her cause I mean what do you say to that? It doesn’t help our store manager is a gay man AND G’s old friend.  I just kept on doing my job and left it alone. 

I know I’m a coward to not speak up so you don’t gotta remind me. During that time I had a lot going on in my life so I did the put my head down and work thing. 

But now? I don’t wanna do that anymore. 

Especially I since she’s been showing even more ridiculous acts lately: shes a black female but laughs and doesn’t care about the current movement for injustice of our people due to police, to me that’s really dumb. (She also makes her boyfriend cry like bro that’s not cool but he stays with her idk) At first I didn’t wanna just be a snitch but now I’m coming to terms with the fact that she not only sucks at her job but also at her humanity.

The gist of the situation: I have fallen hard for someone, it is in the middle of the exam period, a bunch of other things asked for/needed my attention this week. The fact that both the woman I've fallen for and I have exams upcoming means that we are both busy and it's hard to find time together. The fact that I am not the best at reading people means that my analytical brain goes out on a tangent by itself even if I can see myself that I am going too far with it. Even though I have also been told by multiple people, who have seen us together, that they think we both really like each other. 

The other responsibilities are different boards/committees, which I am a part of, who normally doesn't require much attention. They all needed my attention this past week.

I have already said taken a distance to some of the responsibilities to calm myself down a bit. It has helped, but not completely. I have been advised to take walks, write stuff down, do something creative to get it out. Most of it is either quite short term, if it works at all.

Friend-
“I mean you’d be calling me out on something that I only use with certain people who are okay with it. That’s why I’m saying, you may be calling somebody out without knowing the story behind it. It’s just like if an African American walked up to another African American, they used the term “my nigga”. My African American friends were and will always be “my niggas” because the four years I spent with them and the memories and the bond will always keep that alive. Just because I’m “white” doesn’t mean I can’t call my African American friends “my nigga” if that’s what they wanted/want me to say. I’m not going to go up to some random African American and say it but to my friends, I can. It’s a hard topic not knowing the background. Idk if there were other African Americans in the fray he was in. Maybe he picked up on their slang and it was okay at the time. I do not know.”

My response “Tbh, we will have to disagree. I’m not going to justify it.”

She then continued to try and warrant her ignorance more:

“I’m not saying anything to change your mindset or anything. Everyone has different viewpoints on certain things. Just like how some people say “ALL cops are bad”. I’m going to be a cop or hope to be so does that already make me bad? Not in my eyes but some will automatically put me in that category.

708,"I'm not sure if this is the right place, but fuck it.

I just started these Antidepressants and the affect they've had on my mood is amazing. I get excited for things again, I don't have urges anymore. I've become an overall happy person again. That's more than I could ever ask for in an antidepressant.

But the issue is the side affects, one being increased anxiety.  I didn't think the anxiety I already have was that bad but now that I'm on this medication it's gotten bad. There isn't anything to be anxious about but I'm constantly so filled with anxiety it makes me sick. But because I'm just at home and in a comfortable environment, I can live with it.

711,"Hi so this is kind of a bizarre situation because I have lived at my address for over a year and a half. As of late the mailman, whom I have seen on an almost daily basis since living here, is now being selective about delivering my mail. 

It all started recently by going to the mailbox daily to look for my tax return check. It did not come by the expected date and I was really worried about it. Randomly, my housemate tells me that the mailman told him he sent my check from the IRS back to sender.

So he sent my tax return back but still delivers some of my mail after that. Then he also returns a package I ordered on Amazon back to sender. This was not a package that needed to be signed for either.

This mailman has created so much anxiety for me and I am going to go full Karen; does anyone have advice on how to deal with this?",07Jun2020,1

I am (16m)living in a family with my mother(46f),my father (62m)and my brother(14m).Throughout my life my family was happy, or so I thought. In my teenage years(14-16) I began seeing things from a different point of view. My parents always argued a lot but I thought that this is what normal families do, boy was I wrong. After some time I realised that my parents were not close at all,they never agreed on anything, they didn't like each other and so on. They were pretty much two people who lived together only cause of one thing, me and my Brother. My father likes to drink a lot which caused a few problems he was never a bad father and he wasn't such a horrible husband but he didn't know how to act. He said stuff to my mother what he later forgot etc. As I got older I tried talking to them about our problem, at first it went well since both of them wanted to fix this relationship, but no matter how hard I tried it always resulted in an argument. My father was planning to retire next year but due to the corona pandemic he lost his job so now he is retired. My mom told me that her life goal is to raise me and my brother properly and she told me that she would need to work 2 jobs to raise us and I was devastated. Shortly after I realised that I was the one who was holding this messed up family together. My father doesn't want to change, my mom gave up and my Brother doesn't care. In a few years I will be leaving my home to move to Montana and I am afraid that they will fall a part even more.

I always suck at everything I do. At both  jobs I’ve ever had since the age of 18, I’ve been one of the worst employees. I’m so slow to grasp and learn anything. I would be given the easiest tasks because I’d either mess up the register and be too under, or at my current job where I’m one of the slowest. I think at the end of the day, I still get payed the same as everyone. But it sucks having to come into work and feel this way every time. I do have a high amount of anxiety, which makes me question whether I’m doing something right or wrong. I overthink and it strains my brain. I’m in nursing school and it makes me terribly afraid of messing up a lot if I do end up graduating. I feel like I’m just this dumb, incompetent person. I need advice, I feel so worthless. I also don’t have the best personality.. I’m very avoidant. I don’t trust people easily.

732,"Hello

I need some advice for fall. So basically, res has sent out a form and asked us to choose whether we want to continue our fall application, defer to winter, or cancel. They also warn that they will be limiting the number of people in res so they can't guarantee a spot either for fall or if you defer to winter. Which prompted me to think about what I want to do.

I'm undecided on what to say because I'm not sure what to choose. Basically, I'm an international student but my country is currently not opened yet. I don't know with any certainty if I will be able to safely go back home for September since classes are online. Originally, I wanted to go back home and study from there but I'm realizing that I'd rather be in my university city where even if I don't attend fall classes I can go out/meet my friends and study together. I would also ideally be able to access more supports on campus (like mental health since online classes take a huge toll on me) and possibly learning center/library. Back home no chance my parents take me to a therapist if I'm struggling and due to the time difference and not having anyone else from my university (or friends since they will be staying abroad) I feel like the isolation would make online classes even more unbearable. So I'm leaning towards asking for residence in fall.

However, it would be economically better for me to go home and not stay in res for fall because I'd be able to save more money from my summer job than if I used up all of it to pay for my 3rd year at university. Also, my parents miss me and I miss my traditional food and other things from my country.

I'm not sure what to choose and I have to take a decision on res for Monday. I had originally thought of continuing my application and if I decide not to attend cancel for fall but I'm scared that that would mean I don't even get considered for winter and finding an apartment then would be a mess with everybody coming back to town.  

Any advice or a new perspective is appreciated. Thank you.",07Jun2020,1

734,"My 90yo grandma lives in a village in rural US. She has quite a bit of property and maintains it primarily by herself (her husband passed 8 years ago). She’s had various neighbors over the years and they’ve all been mostly pleasant. A few years ago, a woman moved into a house next to hers (I think she had 1 or 2 kids). She started out nice, but then she got married to (in my opinion) a scummy guy and now they both antagonize my grandma.

The first incident was when the neighbor woman asked to borrow my grandma's drill. My grandma is the nicest person ever so she lent it to her. When the neighbor returned the drill, it wasn't my grandma's drill. It was a different drill that was broken. My grandma knew this because she keeps everything and compared the serial numbers on the returned drill to the box her drill came in. She confronted her neighbor about it, but she cussed my grandma out. My grandma just dropped the issue (she's 90, she has to pick her battles).

Since that issue, my grandma has claimed that things have gone missing from her property. This is hard to prove because my grandma has a large house and quite a bit of possessions, and she's been known to misplace things. She has, what I would consider, the appropriate amount of forgetfulness for a 90yo (as in she has no dementia/alzheimers. Her husband had dementia, we know what it looks like). My uncle says that he thinks that the neighbors are waiting for her to die so they can break in and steal her stuff. He would not be surprised if they tried to get in after she passed.

Side note: Our encounters with the neighbors have been equally unpleasant. There's a ""road"" (more like a long driveway) that goes through my grandma's property and connects to her and the neighbor's driveway. It used to be her private property, but she gave it to the village because she was having to pay to maintain it. Now, much to our dismay, the neighbors go out of their way to use this road. I have watched them drive all the way around the block just to pull down that road. And they don't just leisurely drive down it, they speed down it (it's not a long road, maybe 100 ft). I was walking out into the “road” from my grandma's drive and one of their kid's almost ran me over in his Jeep. I have a toddler niece and I was thankful it was me at that moment, because he could have hit and killed my niece. This may just be us being petty because of the other situations, but we wish they would not use the road. The neighbors have also tried to chop down my grandma’s trees that are on her property.

But this most recent incident takes the cake. My grandma was working in her side yard when a dog she had never seen before ran up to her, she greeted the dog and stood up to walk toward her garage, only to see the neighbor woman WAS IN HER GARAGE! The dog ran back to the neighbor and she just walked away. My grandma was so shocked, she didn't know what to say. I guess because she was down gardening, the neighbor didn't know my grandma was there, but was alerted to her presence when she spoke to the dog, then saw her when she approached the garage.

I have 4 siblings and I alerted them all to this information. We're pretty pissed about it but we don't know what to do. We all live at least 14 hours away. We all visit for 2 weeks in the summer and my mom visits for a week in the winter/spring. We're afraid that if we say something when we’re there, they will antagonize her more and we're not around to watch over her. The neighbors are good friends with the leadership of the village, so I think they think they can do whatever they want. They know she’s old so they just walk all over her. She has some family members close by, but they're also older and/or dealing with serious health issues. My uncle lives about 3 hours away, but he works in the medical field and can only occasionally visit. My mom said that she doesn’t think the cops would do anything. They don’t really have a police station in the area, only state patrol. I guess they only respond to more serious stuff.

We installed fake cameras on her house two years ago to see if that would deter them. Obviously they're not working. We had to install fake ones because, on top of my grandma not understanding technology beyond normal household appliances, she has no internet (and she's out in the middle of nowhere, there's barely a cell signal unless you have AT&amp;T). So we're trying to find a solution on cameras/a system that we know would work for the whole year (because no one will be able to troubleshoot it, my family out there is also terrible with electronics). We are playing with the fact of just getting her internet for the sole purpose of the security system as well, but we’ve thought about doing something that writes the footage to a hard drive that my uncle could upload to us periodically. We wouldn't be able to monitor her in real time with that tho.

Do the great residents of reddit have ideas of what could be done (and maybe petty ways to get back at her neighbors)?

tl;dr: my technologically inept 90yo grandma lives out in the middle of nowhere and her neighbors, who were previously suspected of stealing, were discovered inside her garage. We want to install some sort of camera system that she won’t have to maintain throughout the year (if at all possible) but she doesn’t have internet. We’re afraid to confront the neighbors lest they harass her more (since we don’t live in the area).",07Jun2020,1
735,"i was recently hired (3 weeks ago) by a national grocery chain (not walmart, it’s one that’s very highly praised for their working environment and customer service). i work in the bakery, the most disastrous and understaffed area of the store. 

i was hired to decorate cakes, but not informed by anyone that i would be working as a bakery clerk for an indefinite amount of time. nobody really seems to know what “bakery clerk” means. my job mostly appears to be “pick up everyone else’s mistakes”. 

now to preface this, i am a 19 year old living at home. so, technically, i can quit at any time, but i would rather not deal with the backlash from my parents about me going against what they said. 

my parent’s argument against me quitting is 
1. you made a commitment to work at this job
2. the grass isn’t greener on the other side (basically, all jobs suck this bad)  


i have a friend who worked in the same position as me, and he has stated several times that he was trained properly, and that he hasn’t done many of the things i’ve been asked to do. 

i feel like it’s also important to mention that, outside of gas stations and fast food, we are the only place still open in my city, because of protests (including bomb threats. military is currently moving into the area as i type). they haven’t taken precautions at all for what would happen if there was a riot. 

i have already basically secured another job (the pay is a little less, but i’m just working for spending money at the moment). i hate my current job and it’s making me miserable. i’m employed about 7 hours off of full time, despite being a part time worker. i haven’t received proper training, or really any training, our management is awful, my coworkers are mostly miserable as well. i am consistently called in on off days, as i’m the only person in this position (supposed to have 3-4). we aren’t hiring new people. 

so, reddit, what can i do? are all jobs genuinely management nightmares resulting in my miser, or is it possible that the grass is greener on the other side? should i listen to my parents? is there anything i can say to convince them that this job is exploitative and poorly run as a whole? i need advice on either how to deal with this level of stress, or how to convince my parents i’m being treated unfairly. help me out, please.",07Jun2020,1
736,"(If this is in the wrong thread, please move it mods. I'm not sure where to post this)

(Contains Musical Jargon, but I've tried to phrase it such that anyone might understand it)

A short history about myself: 

I've arranged and composed music for at least 13 years now, but never took any forms of music lessons. I've dabbled in pop and EDM mostly in the past, but now can even write for choirs and small ensembles.

So one day, I transferred into a Music Program from Math because I realised I wanted to do what I wanted to do and not what my parents wanted me to do. Somehow, I successfully auditioned with an a video of an capella arrangement of Sia's Titanium (which I arranged, led and performed with other non-Music Major students as part of a non-music course assignment).

With that said, I struggled and climbed my way, but I will be graduating soon. I realised I didn't like performing and really enjoyed teaching, so I spent a lot of my free time volunteering to teach and tutor (in Math and Music). But it soon dawned onto me that the only things I can teach are Music Composition (which in my own words, is a blend of Marketing, Psychology, Music, Pedagogy, and Music Cognition). And because I carved my own journey and didn't learn from the RCM (Royal Conservatory of Music), but from personal experience and online sources, I don't think I'm qualified to teach in Music Schools, or even in any school.

Most of my peers end up going to Teacher's College or as freelance musicians, but I want a career where I teach Music Arranging and Composition, something I think is niche (and underrated and undervalued) in the Gr 1-  12 school system. I am fine with teaching Fundamental Music Theory like 'Major Scales' and 'Circle of Fifths', but also want to explain more theoretical concepts (For example, explaining 'The Movement of Energy in Music', especially to younger kids, hoping that they will understand music as a physical entity and not by music theory.)

My family isn't supportive of my choices at the moment and they're all non-musicians. As such, I find it difficult to be sure of any actions I do, because they've convinced me that 1) I don't know what I'm doing 2) That I can't survive in this field.

My friend have suggested I start a community program at my local community center.  If anyone knows anything else in this regard, now is the time I will take the advice.

tl;dr Specialised in something really niche, don't know what career I can do.

744,"So we just moved to a new neighborhood in a different state. Our 6 year-old neighbor rode him bike to our house one day while we were taking the dogs for a walk and asked if he could join us. Before we could answer, he told us to wait for him (he lives 2 houses down on the opposite side of the street) so he could ask his mom for permission.

I hadn’t met his parents, and my husband had a brief encounter with the father introducing himself. They told him yes, and we said ok.... After the walk we took him home. Parents had company (other neighbors) and we just introduced ourselves. Our dogs are both elderly, and their 3 year-old son who was playing in the driveway kept trying to pick up our little Yorkie, which she was clearly not enjoying. So after talking long enough not to appear rude, we excused ourselves back to our house.

His mother had made a comment before we left that he basically roams the neighborhood during the day, and that unfortunately for us (her words, not mine) our house was in his boundaries. She said she tries to keep him from going out too early, but after a while he gets to be too much and she sets him free, so we’d probably be seeing him a lot.

We have 4 children. 3 that are older than he is and one much younger. One day while my daughter was home with my husband, the little boy came over to ask if he could play. My husband said of course, and called my daughter down. He is currently wfh and has an office that has to be secured at all times, so he was in his office with his door shut. She took him upstairs to play with toys, but he started getting into her more expensive items, like her school chrome book and her iPad both of which are password protected. When she refused to give him the passwords (we don’t allow them screen time during the day), he started pulling her very long hair, threw her iPad and her Polaroid camera down the stairs and became destructive in our home.

My daughter tried to diffuse by offering to go to his house instead to play. So she asked my husband for permission, and she went to his house for a little bit. She did not have a good time. He was cruel to her the entire time. She also said he was very aggressive with his little brother and instead of his parents correcting the behavior, they gave him ice cream to calm him down. It wasn’t until later that our daughter confided the things he’d been doing.

We’ve taught our kids to be kind and respectful. So my daughter avoided conflict and came home after awhile. Now this 6 year-old keeps coming over and my children have no desire to interact with him. My husband has asked him several times to not just show up unannounced, as this is not how we were raised or raising our kids, but he continually comes to our house, peeks through windows, opens the door if it’s unlocked and keeps doing things that damage our home.

Neither of us are good with confrontation. We try to keep to ourselves, but this is getting out of control. My husband was very upset this last time when he caught him hitting the outside of the house with a stick. He scratched the vinyl siding and peeled paint chips off the wooden posts to our stairs. He asked the kid to leave.

We want to have a sit down with the kids’ parents about how we don’t mind him there if he can be respectful in our home, but not sure how to tactfully spell it out that he is a nuisance and my kids just prefer him not to be there. The father is also the President of the HOA and being that we are new to the area, we aren’t trying to make any enemies with our neighbors either.  Any advice?",07Jun2020,1
745,"My best friends are involved in extremely toxic relationships. They were different before the toxic relationship, hence why we are best friends, but after 5 years of being involved in their toxic relationships, things have changed. 

Our conversations went from talking about the world, to me basically being their therapist. It’s emotionally draining because I spend so much time trying to help them get away from this toxic relationship. Not even a week passes and they are back with that person. When they get back to their toxic relationship, my messages are ignored, I am ignored, I am invisible, and most importantly, my time is wasted. 

I am ignored until their relationship is on the rocks and I get frantic emotional phone calls and messages needing immediate emotional support. If I don’t respond, I get abusive messages say, “No one cares about me. I just want to die. I thought you were my friend.” 

This is the repeating cycle. This has been a thing for 5 years and I can’t take it anymore. 

By all means, if that person is right for them, then please be with them, but the people that they are dating are literally beating my friends, children are involved in the violence, and the controlling is insane! 

I literally don’t want to be friends with these people anymore but I can’t walk away because I do care about these people and their children. 

What should I do?",07Jun2020,1
746,"Background: 
Recently my best friend went away for basic training and AIT. His choice to join the army was out of nowhere, but nonetheless I supported him. During the time away (7 months due to covid) I grew as a person. We have been close for 3 years and hes always been a brother to me. In the time he was away he met a girl and soon began dating her. I have no problem with her and am very happy for him. They are going to continue with long distance. (I included this because he seems to know more about her than me in the few months he has known her) 

With him coming back I've noticed a few things, that I hadn't before. I've noticed that a lot of my confidence issues have gotten worse. Ive been working extremely hard on losing weight about 30 pounds now. Yet when he came back he made a comment on my face fat. He has commented on my body a few times as well. It seems that our friendship is one sided and im always thinking of him. For his birthday I have always made sure to get him something he needs/wants. Now for me, he has forgotten about my birthday once before and hasnt acknowledged at all. (Its tomorrow) I don't expect a gift but I doubt I'll even get a happy birthday. He only talks about himself and rarely acknowledges my problems. Almost as if he never truly listens but waits for me to finish and says something else. 

Sorry for the length, I'm trying to give a detailed description. Ive been noticing a lot of red flags. We have never fought before and its weird to me. Im extremely shy and anxious whereas he is the opposite. He is pretty much my only friend and I don't want to lose him. He is hard to talk to because he can be offended easily and claims I make a big deal out of nothing. 

Is there anything I should do? Is it too drastic too cut ties? 
I feel like he is only my friend so he can vent about his problems and do what he wants.",07Jun2020,1

Whenever I try talking to her she always finds ways to not talk back.

She was 13 years old, but she was in good health according to the vet, and her passing came very unexpectedly and in a fairly traumatic form. She was my best friend, and I loved her more than I loved myself, and it’s been very hard on me. Over the past year I’ve started to come to terms with it, but it’s still hard to think about. Lately I’ve been feeling very lonely and down on myself, and I keep thinking that I need a reliable companion like another dog. The thought of having one makes me happy, but I’m really conflicted about it. I didn’t think I’d ever want another dog, but the companionship is so wonderful and it’s a great thing to have. I’m just not sure if I can bear to bring a new one into my life. Not to mention, I now work full time, and don’t want to neglect a dog if I get one. I’m not sure what to do.",07Jun2020,1
752,"A little about why I'm working at a horse barn: My goal is to own animals for therapy. All kinds of animals, especially horses. I have a degree in psychology and I plan to go back to school next year. Till then, I need to learn some more about the animals I want to work with.

I started working at a horse barn in February, but it was a slow process because I was going in to replace someone who was leaving. She wasn't leaving until May. Then COVID happened and I didn't go to work at all because they lived by the barn and they were taking care of it. They asked me back early (mid April) because the girl decided to leave sooner than expected, but I was hesitant and I worked two days a week. After 2 weeks, I was more comfortable and I was able to add an extra day because my bosses wife had a birthday and I took all 3 days each week. Time goes on and things start opening back up. He hires a guy to help him work around the barn (fix fences, gates, hoses, etc.) and I asked for more hours. He asked me what are my ideal hours and I told him Tuesday through Saturday. Well, he's already given this guy those hours because he can work anytime and stay as long as he wants. The new guy even offered to take my hours.... and my boss asked me if I wanted to. The new guy races horses and he knows a lot about them. More than my boss knows too. So, my boss has even told me that this guy is perfect and that I'm not filling his needs for the barn because I don't work evenings or stay around all day. I just do the morning shifts (feeding, turn out the horses, stalls, hay, and water). My boss said he would have let me go weeks ago, but he hasn't because he likes me and cares for me as a daughter. He's a really nice guy and we have been through a lot this year already because I found out I'm severly allergic to bees and he had to take care of me and call an ambulance.... plus, I accidentally burned my legs with boiling water for tea (I'm having a lot of bad luck this year, this isn't normal for me to be hurt like this).

Anyways, I know this is long but I'm very conflicted. This new guy is best for the barn, but I want this job. I work my ass off trying to figure things out on my own because no one taught me how to even do this job properly and I'm learning more about horses and how to care for them, which is why I'm doing this!!! I feel like my boss really wants me to quit so he doesn't have to fire me, but that only makes me want to stay longer so I can file for unemployment and find a new job. Barns are not easy because it's difficult to get to know 20 horses! This is not easy on my body either, but I am finally gaining fine muscles. Most of all, I feel like I can't give up but I'm so confused about what I'm doing. I don't want to stay in a place where I'm not wanted. Or seen as a lesser individual because I don't know more about horses. This is really hurting my self esteem, but building my ability to stand up for myself. I'm going in circles. If you've read this far, thank you and please give me some input because this is..well.... a mess for me....",07Jun2020,1
753,"Ive always been somebody who is really quite, I never confront people i dont know , especially family, when I have something to say I dont, but with the blm movement, all I want to do us shout and scream, its pushed me to respond to people (on social media) when i see they say things I think is offensive. now I am white, and those who i have responded to are too, but I'm not sure whether I have crossed a boundary, usually they would have said something like ""white lives matter too"" ""they shouldn't destroy buildings, it doesn't help their stereotype"" or ""why protest when one man dies, when this happened too"" etc, I gave fairly different responses  but lengthy, mentioning being innocently imprisoned because people have already judged them from their skin, that people shouldn't have to live in fear that they could be murdered from doing anything, that their life shouldn't  be played like a game of poker, already set up to lose, that we wont truly understand what and how they have to suffer, that they are being murdered and not given justice, I even said one person that they only seem to fight when it building being destroyed and not a persons life.

But as I get older and I look back at my 'career' I just see shitty under-practiced performances and ego/clouty sessions, bad or stolen ideas, cringe-worthy networking/social climbing attempts. I'm older now and I know that I really loved the process and learning about new music and collaborating but now I just feel so shameful and exhausted when I go in my studio. It's a proper burnout. I wanna take lessons and and keep learning and try out some new ideas I have but I get frustrated when I make now and the fact of that is even more frustrating. I don't feel like I deserve to identify as a musician anymore. So much is telling me to move on from music, but all I want is to love it again.

757,"I’ve been stuck in my head for a few days now. Just repeating the phrase he said. (Hubby) 

You see, I by nature am someone to automatically help when I sense help is needed. I’m a nurturer, I always have been. I’m just that type of person. My husband and I have been married a little over a year, together for a little over 4 years. We don’t have many issues but one big one that controls everything. I’m trying to change myself since I noticed I have toxic traits but there’s this one part of me I can’t seem to change because it’s who I am. 

My husband thinks I help to much. Or try to help when help isn’t needed. It makes him feel less of a man I guess. So, here’s what happened. 

Hubby was getting ready to go set up sound at a local bar for the weekend. We had just gone to the hardware store to get some screws to secure this new crossover he purchased. Well the guy at the hardware store gave him the wrong screws (wrong thread), he ended up stripping the screw. I was already having a rough day, I deal with anxiety and recently gave into medication so I could feel stable (I don’t like it so far since I haven’t had an orgasm in 3 weeks but I’ll live), so by habit I just start to walk around the house getting what I’d need to get the screw out. Ya know, that way he could take them back and get the ones he needs.

Well he absolutely lost it. He told me that he hated that I try to fix everything right away instead of letting him figure it out by himself. That, “maybe you should marry someone you can communicate with” because I obviously can’t grasp that he hates that. So, I just set down the tools I had and sat on the couch. Numb. He left the room and I broke down. Full breakdown. Just in my head repeating the phrase, bringing up different things, different scenarios. Just wishing I wouldn’t have helped. 

Like, I get it. Maybe I should let him figure it out but I was honestly going to fix everything so it would be nice. Instead he ended up stripping the screw fully and I’m not sure if he had others that he did that same thing too but I literally could have helped and he rejected it. It made me feel like he thought I was dumb. 

We talked it out of course because we don’t stay upset at each other long but it just hurt me. I can usually just bounce back but I haven’t been able too. 

He will be going to a psychologist soon because he’s voiced that he needs help, I am not like planing on jumping ship or anything but am I in the wrong for helping? Should I have to change or mute who I am because he absolutely hates it? I just don’t know what to think. Thanks in advance.",07Jun2020,1

I then proceeded to email Youtubers and offered them a fake deal of paying them money for views they got on their channel if they added me to the channel as an owner. They believed me because they were under the impression that I was the sports brand that I was impersonating. I also gave them a fake contract to sign to make it look more legit. After they signed the contract they would give me ownership of their channel and then I would remove them from having access to their channel (basically transfer the channel to me) leaving them with not having access to the channel anymore.

I'm in my final year of university and faced a lot of adversity. My grades weren't always the best but I've picked it up. I've had death threats, had my job on the line, trouble with my relationships, my father was heavily drinking and i was watching him slowly deteriate and almost died in a car crash adding all this and taking a bunch of science courses. Luckily my did got better and he's a lot better now. My chemistry department proudly stated that 50% of classes fail minimum. I was one of 15 students out of 45 that passed the course. With all this stress it was easy to fall quit and fall into drugs. I'm surrounding my drugs everywhere all my neighbors are pill poppers, weed smokers, and straight tweakers. My brother growing up was an addict and stole from my father for his addictions. Ruined his dream of opening a shop. My other brother was heavily gang related and when I was younger my home was raided and I had guns pointed at me at 5 years old. My house was shot up because of his actions. I've never had a place to call home. Just apartments that we constantly moved from. I have little interest in drinking but thats something that is also heavily surrounded me growing up.

767,"**hey-o, I'm sixteen and I'm from Italy so if my grammar is shit don't come for me lol**

So, it all began when I was like 4; one day when I went to school and my kindergarten teacher brought me to an eye examination, I did not even know why but I knew that she was not gonna like steal me or something like that. My family did not know bout this.

Then like a week after, when I went to school that teacher brought a pair of glasses and she gave it to me. I was ok because they made me see a little bit better. My parents came to pick me up and they were like TF and they thanked that teacher for paying the glasses 'cause they weren't that cheap.

A pair of years after, one day my family came back to home with load of eye bandages 'cause the pediatrician told them to buy them. I did not understand why, like... at all. So when no adults were watching, I took it off. I wish I didn't tho lol.

It came the time that I had to change my glasses so my parents took advantage of the kindness of that teacher and she bought me another pair, I don't blame them 'cause at that time we weren't that wealthy.

I changed my glasses like three times since then and my old kindergarten teacher, Carla, bought ALL of them lmao

**Between the changes I had to live without glasses, It was not difficult, at all. BUT when I was like 8-9-10 I realized one big fat thing, I realized that I had esotropia (basically one pupil tend to go near to the other in order to see better). Yeah, It's really shitty. Mostly because it is only an aesthetic thing and that thing ruins my appearance so much. I can appreciate my pics only when I photoshop that eye that doesn't work even for a few millimeters.**

One time I had to change my glasses again (Carla wasn't paying them that time 'cause we did not know where she was, maybe she died, god bless her soul &lt;3 ahah) 'cause I was growing and my sight was getting better HOWEVER I went to the oculist and guess what? The oculist said I need NO glasses anymore...I WAS LIKE BITCH, ARE YOU BLIND? I know that the low-key cross-eyed one here am I but ARE YOU FUCKING BLIND? Like... I need that shit more than I need to breath

That ""He does NOT need glasses"" hit me hard but It was the best thing that my parents could hear for them. They were so happy that they did not have to pay... The funny thing is that when they need something they quickly go to get it but when I need something it's not like that, at all.

I kept telling them that I need those glasses and my father kept answering like ""you don't need them, the oculist said it, now shut up you cross-eyed"". What a shit of a parent but I have to say that I was kinda expecting that, they never really cared about me, and that's ok UNTIL you deprive me of my fucking sight and self-esteem.

Sometimes I bring up the argument and It's the same shit of before on repeat.

Still to this day, I DO NOT FUCKING KNOW WHY THAT OCULIST SAID THAT. I was concerned and started to doubting about my esotropia so I opened a tellonym (a social when people ask you thing on on anonymous) from instagram to check what people tought about my eye because I did not want to ask my friend 'cause I don't wanna put them in an uncomfortable situation and I did not want them to lie to me only because I am their friend. I know, the grammar's bad but as I said: do not come for me lol.

So the day arrived, finally I got a lot of questions about my eye like ""Do you have a problem with your eye?"" ""Do you have a problem with your eye? I see you often and sometimes it's crooked"". So yeah, I got the final confirmation that I HAVE FUCKING THAT FUCKING ESOTROPIA.

To balance that thing a year ago I started working out and all these things but that esotropia really make these things worthless because the eyes are like one of the first things that people see when they meet you.

770,"I (20F) want to move out from my home as soon as I can. I grew up with, and still am living with parents who are incredibly emotionally abusive and manipulative. They used to be physically abusive when I was younger. They use religion and culture (South Asian) as a way to control me. A couple months ago we got into a really bad fight where my dad cursed me out in english, said I was worthless as a daughter, etc. I was about to leave home with only 3k saved up. We live in NYC (I was born and raised in Queens)- I wouldn't have made it. My mom's only argument against me leaving, to my dad, was that she wouldn't be able to get my sisters married if I left and that the neighbors would think badly of them. 

For context, we were arguing because I did not want to travel abroad with them to our home country during the summer. I had an internship lined up (now canceled due to the pandemic), but my dad basically told me he didn't gaf. I also knew that going meant I would not stop hearing about marriage from relatives, and I did not want to deal with all that because it's exhausting. They basically expect me to put my life on hold to marry some rich brown dude (arranged by them), have babies, and then continue with my career. Fuck that. 

I haven't spoken to my dad since we fought, which was around mid-February. It's been hard because we live in the same house. I have also been avoiding speaking with my mom, because she goes and tells my dad everything I have been up to. My dad also knows all my finance information (except savings) because he does my taxes- I have no idea how to prevent him from receiving this information. He knows how much I get from unemployment, scholarships, grants, etc. I fucking hate this. The other day he shouted ""You're getting paid X amount? Where's my money?'

Keep in mind that I'm the one who basically kept his business afloat because he did not know how to use a goddamn computer, so I spent most of HS editing and creating documents he needed. A lot of this was NOT legal but he forced me. When I told him I was uncomfortable doing it, he would yell and threaten me. I was never paid for this work, the assumption was that because they were raising me, feeding me, providing a roof over my head, I owed them this. 

I have been saving up money slowly, I have about 6k so far. I'm worried because I started a dental treatment back in January, and it'll cost me about 4k ($200 for the next 20 months), that my parents won't cover.

I also want to attend law school and plan on taking the LSAT next year. I want to save up 10k before then, and then move out. I don't know how to go about doing all this. I have about 2 years left of undergrad. I get around 6k a semester through scholarships, and my tuition is fully covered. 

Does this sound like a good plan? Any tips from those who have been in a similar situation? Any help is appreciated. I feel like this is more of a venting post than an advice post, lol.",07Jun2020,1
771,"I almost died yesterday, and it made me remember how much I love her 



Yesterday I was in a rollover accident with my best friend, and if we hadn’t been wearing seatbelts, we might’ve died. 

I asked her out back in January, and she said she’d think about it, but since she never really said yes or no, I assumed it was a no, so I moved on, and started talking to someone else. But then, in March, she confessed her feelings, and said she DOES like me, but since I was talking to this other girl, it felt wrong to just abandon her and all of a sudden date my best friend. Had she told me a couple weeks earlier, I would’ve been ready to be with her in a heartbeat. 

I just haven’t been able to push her out of my mind, she’s everything I could ever ask for and more. Almost dying with her yesterday solidified that in my mind. Now I don’t know what to do, I care about her so much, but don’t want to up and abandon this other girl, because I care about her a lot too. Any help would be appreciated, thank you so much guys, and God bless!",07Jun2020,1
772,"I've been trying to find movies that I saw when I was younger, based on memories I have of them - characters, situations, actors etc. One that keeps eluding me is one I've asked twice on TipOfMyTongue and elsewhere, without finding mine. I've seen it in the early 2000s. This is one example https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/7os76n/tomt90s_movie_about_detective_stalked_by_crazy/ and here is the movie summary again:

1. There is a detective who has a brunette partner called Diane or Diana

2. He is being stalked by a blonde ex who will turn out psycho later. She follows him one day in her car, behind his. Then, at a stoplight, she comes out and shows him her boobs by unraveling her coat. He sees this in the rear-view mirror and smiles. There were only these 2 cars, it looked like a small town. He tells this to his partner later during lunch and they have a laugh together.

3. At one point, the ex sneaks into his shower saying something like ""I promise to be good"" and they have some sexy time

4. It has a happy ending, his partner arrives just in time to shoot the ex who was trying to kill him

It's basically like Fatal Attraction, but with a detective whose partner is a brunette named Diane/Diana and he is stalked by a blonde ex who wasn't old like Glenn Close. I've found similar episodes of Dempsey and Makepeace, Sledge Hammer, Silk Stalkings and NYPD Blue and none of them is not mine. It could be a TV movie. That's why I need some help, those are more obscure.

Are there sites with synopsis for such movies? Stuff like TvTropes (Sexy Coat Flashing, Psycho Ex Girlfriend) is no good, not many TV movies there.

How would you go about searching a movie that people don't seem to know, i.e. like in my case. Also tried Subzin / QuoDB searches for possible lines and nothing.

Finally if you know it, the above are irrelevant. Thanks for any help!",07Jun2020,1
773,"A job I worked for 5 days has not payed me. I didn’t give them direct deposit info, so bad on me. I texted the manager twice. It’s been over a week past initial pay period and I’m not sure how much longer I should wait before reaching out again. I would have to go out of my way to see him physically. I have the actual owners number but he came onto me for a date so I don’t want to call him about money considering I “rejected” him. I’m not sure how to go about this. It’s not a whole lot of money but I earned it. The pay with tips probably rounds nicely though I’m sure they’d cut the tips out of my pay since I left after saying I’d stay - which I had every intention on staying in the moment. But I changed after that initial moment. The initial moment refers to an overly heated discussion I had with the manager which left me emotionally disable for hours after.

I argued that it is harmful we just don’t know the long term consequences yet.  Since when have we ever used something that penetrates deep into our tissue and skin? Our bodies have never experienced deep penetrating heat before and I just don’t think that’s a good thing. We’ve always experienced heat from the outside from hot humid weather and such.

775,"i don't know how people cope, and i really need advice because as much as i see death as something rather beautiful it comes to a fact that failing a suicide attempt might leave me in even worse shape than i am now.

im in highschool at the moment, female if it's for anything.
i lost all my friends when i moved school since middle school and highschool are different entierly and you get to chose your own school depending on the amount of points you collected through out middle school.

i'm in one of the better schools, but i realized im really dumb and so i will try to change schools and possibly fuck my future up, cous if i do i probably won't be able to go to collage.
(yes, our school system is very fucked up)

i live in a third world country, so really i do not see myself living here longer than i have to.

when i was younger, in middle school, i used to have so much fun. i was a kid then, we would go out drinking, making graffiti and just having fun really.

i look at myself now and my life is full of internet friends, who i will probably never meet, online relationships which never work out and just staying home, although there are no cases of the virus in my country (take that with a grain of salt, our country doesn't tell us shit).

im stuck with my parents and my father is absolutely shit. but i guess i got used to it.

i gained weight despite working really hard on my body before highschool. i got fat on the beginning of the 1st year of hs and now im just gaining more and more.

i constantly get asked for nudes and such from older men online, but i guess that happened before too.

online school will last till the end of this month because our teachers protested mid school year as well as the virus hit afterwards.
i am so fed up with it and teachers are extremely disrespectful. we have about 7 apps each necessary for our school, and everyone send homework whenever they feel like it.

i always liked porn but at this point it's severe. i masturbate up to 4 times a day until my clit hurts so much that i can't move.

i always had problems with sleeping and it is the only time i feel fine so i can't even find escape in that.
as i said, i gained weight because of stress by the beginning of school year so i often fast and eat less which makes me feel in control but i can't lose any weight because i am not moving a lot.

i just don't see a point now.
my last attempt was my birthday which i as well, posted on reddit as my first post asking for help. 
i went through it but ended up throwing up. i dont like that my attempt was so poorly planned. 

i have scars on my wrists and they're shiwing6more than ever because it's tshirt season and i am extremely pale since i don't go out and i have anemia which makes my skin almost see trough. 

i just don't know what to do and perhaps i want attention since not much happens in my life but i really can't tell. 

i don't vent often but it's just a mess, this is not at all everything i feel but it's a lot for people to take in.

776,"I'm a 22 year old guy, and I know––yada yada––young people don't know a damn thing, but also dunning Krueger if you think you're dumb it's because you know how much you don't know so you're not actually dumb. But here's my problem, I *shouldn't* be as dumb as I seem.

In high school I was required to take an IQ test for an academic summer program I applied for and had to get above the 90th percentile to be admitted, and I was admitted, so by that test my IQ should be 120+ but I know people who *weren't* admitted that I know are just ""smarter"" than me, and yet I feel dumb––but not in every one of the ways that matter.

I have an incredibly horrible memory and *can't retain information* *at all*. I'm a huge cringe-fest at social events where long-term relationships are involved because I forget people's names and lose track of the conversation, but generally don't care much about the people there. I have also never been good at any sports, video games, or probability games where intelligent people usually have an upper-hand. 

But I'm really good at essentially acting like I'm smart, so I can fake the confidence needed to absolutely kill a job interview and manipulate my way through the superficial things to get a great job, use that in school to get a good grade, a few god grades, a degree. I'm *very* good at creating a persona, but very bad at maintaining one, so I hate keeping up friendships because it requires me to work harder than I'm able. I know that I'm not a sociopath because I feel horrendously guilty about the positions I get myself into, I'm just doing my best to get by and I know that if I *can* get away with something, why wouldn't I? 

I feel like I've faked my way to a Computer Science degree and into a really good job that's uprooted me and moved me across the country to restart everything. But restarting and having to learn a new job and a new city where I know nobody (especially during a pandemic, I've had lots of time to think) has highlighted all of the areas for me where normal people function, and I see all of the ways that normal people build healthy relationships and how I don't. This isn't a new problem, but it's an insecurity that I've had inklings about that I might have to confront if this new persona falls apart considering I gave up everything on this latest endeavor.

I just have this feeling that I look at the world in a simpler way than other people, and I'm frustrated because I feel like the more I move up the more I realize I'm unequipped to exist in the world and It's making me miserable. When I go to therapists to talk about it, the conversation leads toward handling insecurities, but I don't want confidence, I know confidence, I lean on it, it's literally *my only crutch*. I don't know what's wrong with me that I supposedly have this above-average IQ but can only seem to apply it in manipulating people even when it hurts them and me and I *know* that it's harmful.",07Jun2020,1

780,"So I was friends with these two young women (K and B) in the past and the friendship ended when they blocked me on social media without warning. At the time things were toxic between them and I. I didn't ""fit"" into their friendship and constantly felt excluded. I have Aspergers Syndrome so it is hard for me to socialize and voice out my concerns in a way that isn't turn-offish. I constantly told them how I felt about it and the responses I would get just seemed robotic, like no genuineness behind the answers. I was not the bestest friend and know I could have been a better friend, but they equally treated me the way I treated them. K  (before the friendship ended and they blocked me) needed help when she and her fiance moved into an apartment and asked if I would help her, saying she would buy me dinner afterward. It bothered me because it didn't seem like she wanted to see me unless I helped her. She could make the effort to ask me for help, but can't make the effort to contact me or make individual plans? I leaped at the opportunity to see my two friends again, but it never happened. She never mentioned it again after that conversation.  Long story short, I guess the thing that bothers me now that they're doing is they have a habit of blocking and unblocking me on Facebook (maybe even times I'm not aware of). I don't know what either one want from me? You can't even see anything on my Facebook page because its private. B recently unblocked me I think just to see comments I made on someone's post and then blocked me again. But that isn't the first time she has unblocked me and she does it more frequently than the other. 

Maybe B is also trying to see if my boyfriend and I are still together. So my boyfriend (months before we got together) was talking to her and hanging out with her.. they were more fwb than anything else. Well she was hurt because he didn't want a relationship with her and told her this in the end. I don't know if she has some anger towards me over this. I didn't do anything wrong, didn't ""take"" him from her. I remembered her Snapchat username (because I made a new account to use in general, so I'm not blocked by her on this one) and apart of me wants to ask what her issue is, why does she keep trying to ""stalk"" my profile. I'm also reluctant to contact her because it may just cause drama. 

**I was NOT friends with either one of them when I started seeing my boyfriend. B fooled around with my boyfriend (months before him and I started talking) has no right to me mad at me. I did nothing wrong. I didn't even know about him knowing her till we started talking.** She apparently wanted to be friends with my boyfriend after he was done fooling around with her and he didn't want to be friends. 

They know very well that he is my boyfriend. K contacted him right after Christmas 2018 (month after we started dating) and asked how his Christmas was. He didn't respond so she said to him ""so and so used to my friend too, so you better treat her right"". He ended up blocking her, saying he didn't want the drama.

Towards the end of the relationship, she treated me pretty badly, somewhat disrespectfully and was quite manipulative when I pulled out all the stops to see her. We were going to be friends but I still had strong feelings for her after a couple months, so I texted her I was going NC with a brief explanation of why and that I thought she treated me so badly, thanked her for the great memories and blocked her. I unblocked her after a week because if anything bad happened to her and I didn’t know I couldn’t forgive myself.

It’s been over 2 months and she hasn’t reached out, nor have I. I don’t know if she’s seeing someone else, as if so it might be more inappropriate. I don’t want to rekindle a friendship or relationship with her, but part of me doesn’t want to leave it finished on a text.

So here they are:

Shower in the morning before my exam or the night before?

-Morning (would make me feel better and will wake me up, but might stress me out a lot and I might not arrange my time correctly, which means I'll either skip it or I'll be late to the exam?)
-Night (will wasts study time, might keep me awake when I need to sleep and might also be dissatisfying in the morning when I wake up sweaty and looking like a mess.)

How should I do my hair?

-Plain ponytail (front hair will be in my face but i dont mind too much except being self concious at my appearance, I don't like ponytails)
-Do sth to keep my hair out of my face (it sometimes ends up being kinda uncomfortable though, i dont wanna be fixing my hair in the exam if it does)
-Leave it down (I'm used to it after all, it just might end up being in my face a lot)

What do I eat for breakfasr?

-Nutella bread (yum)
-Eggs
-Literally anything else?

Do I study in the morning if exams/before bed?

-I have literature, so its stuff I can just look at?
-Might stress me out

We considered ourselves best friends, we told each other everything, had a lot of fun together and really cared about each other. However, after about a year of being friends she developed some mental health issues. She never got help but I ended up becoming her ”therapist.” She would complain/rant/vent to me and I would always listen and give advice and provide as much energy as I could into making her feel better.

Slowly, I started feeling really emotionally drained and tired of listening to her issues and never getting the same energy/ care back. I’m pretty sure she has depression or anxiety. I tried several times to try to convince her to get professional help but she refused. She also became really unmotivated and lazy. She would plagiarize at school, not do her work on time. She ended up always asking me to help to the point where I would basically be doing half of her work for her.

Her energy was very negative. Always complaining or talking about how much she hates herself/ life. I really tried my best to help but I could not take it anymore. I started feeling so drained and tired around her so I decided to distance myself. She’s also very very sensitive so it’s hard to confront her without her getting mad or offended. I ended up not replying to her messages, not talking to her in class unless she talked first, giving her short dry responses. Slowly we stopped talking. About a month ago she texted and asked me why left her like that. She told me how now she has trust issues and how she thought we would be friends forever but I decided to leave her. She said how everyone she gets attached to ends up leaving her. I didn’t really know how to confront her and tell her why I ghosted her so I ended up apologizing and saying that there were some things bothering me that I didn’t feel comfortable talking about.

Last week, she texted me a day after my birthday to tell me she misses me. I responded that I miss her as well but she read the message and didnt respond.

Going through my late teens early 20s I was what every kid strides to be. I had everything going for myself regards to popularity, more friends than I could count and more women than necessary. In a sick turn of events, over time seeing that all my friends weren’t really my friends and the feeling of having so many sexual partners left me strangely empty. That along with numerous hardships and setbacks I couldn’t mentally handle… I fell into a depression when I was in my prime from an outside perspective. FF to now after the years of battling depression and anxiety and climbing out of that insidious hole mentally, I’m doing okay with God by me. I was able to pull myself up and do well for myself years later to the shock of family and friends, who probably assumed I would kill myself at some point (which I did have suicidal thoughts for years when I was at my lowest) I was able to buck up and rise and turn things around drastically. (Took years of absolute hell, trust me)

Now some of my closest friends say their proud of what I’ve done for myself, but I can see and sense the envy because I’m doing better than them in life. 98% of people I just cut off because it’s not worth their negative energy and they weren’t really my friends of love’s to begin with. I have a small circle now. Literally 2 friends. Even with them I’m starting to get bad vibes from. As the years go on I keep progressing and they’re still living at home 33 y/o with 19 y/o GFs and such. It’s clear I’m moving up in life while they are stagnant, and I think it’s time I move on. They constantly make passive aggressive remarks at me and try to bring me down every time I’m with them or talk to them. Literally every single time. My style is direct banter which we sometimes do but the way they insult is passive aggressive so they like to keep me guessing most of the time.

Most of the time I let it slide because that is the man I have become. It’s not worth it but one time on a drunk night one of the two tried to get under my skin a little too much and I beat him up. Our relationship hasn’t been the same since, but he still contacts me sometimes. The jealousy they have for me is blatant and clear at times and I’m tired of their slick comments and fakeness. I don’t even like them at this point but we’re all social beings and I do need guy friends. I have a SO, she’s solid but things are rocky surely stemming from the lockdown. Not too worried about that.

I feel it’s time for me to move on. I need new friends I can look at as peers. To the men who have been at this crossroads already how did you go about it. Even with these two fake friends and my SO I still feel lonely. Getting older should I just focus on SO and career and leave my guy friends behind? During my self help and recovery from years of anxiety and depression. It's extremely hard for me to trust and make new friends at this time and age. I'm a cynic. Did any of you ever create any genuine guy friends after your late 20s, early 30s or beyond?

TLDR: Feeling lonely but should I dump my only 2 (not really genuine) friends and focus on my career and or SO?",07Jun2020,1

805,"Hi, I'm new to reddit, looking for advice to help with my family's new cat(Leo). My cat of 14 years (Oscar) recently passed so one of my mom's friends convinced her of getting a new cat, he is very shy and loving. He is a little over a year and we have had him less than a week, he spent his first day hiding in our basement until we could find him, he will cuddle if you sit with him but he mostly wants to hide under furniture. My mother thinks the best way to help him adjust is by shutting him in a room with necessities so we can make sure he is eating and going to the bathroom but I worry this could make it harder for him. Also we have a small dog and they have met and got along fine. Does anyone have any advice that could help?",07Jun2020,1

808," So, a bit of context. I have been with this friend since 3rd grade (were in 8th grade now) and we always hung out together. Through the years we both got other friends, which is to be excpected. What I didn't expect was how she started treating me. I started to feel more and more like an outcast in out friendship, like she only hung out with me to satisfy her wants and needs. I liked my other friends more than her, because they actually seemed to care about my feelings and such. This friend though, she's manipulative. I confronted her about it not to long ago, and she basically made me break down crying right in front of her. Any time I try to leave the friendship she suddenly acts like I'm her only friend and she would die without me. Now I feel as if I'm stuck with her forever, but there is nothing I want more than to not be. The worst part is that we are family friends. That means our parents are such great friends that it would be impossible for us not to be as well. I really don't know what to do, if you want I can send screenshots of our conversation to show how bad it was. Just ask. Please help me though, I don't know what to do.",07Jun2020,1

811,"I have had this thing with someone my entire adult life.  When I’m single we get together, but as soon as I put in any effort he gives me the busy signal.

If I’m in a relationship, he always comes back and tells me he should have taken me seriously. He always expresses remorse. That he sees us together, that he sees us making it work. He checks in over the years of me being with someone else. 


Then when I’m single we hang out. And after a few dates he gives me the busy signal when I start expressing interest again.

I’m really confused. If I talk to him about it he reassures me he wants to see where things go. But then he still gets too busy.

He’s someone who just can’t be beat in terms of how much I like him. Even when I’m in love with someone else, he can’t reach out to me without it affecting my head.

I don’t want to cut the chances of it one day working because I don’t think I’ll ever like someone as much as I do him. And when I try to look elsewhere, he still lingers in my mind.

I some days feel like I’m going to be alone forever. I’m 30 now. And I’ve had serious relationships that almost landed me marriage and the things I’ve wanted. But I fear heavily that I’m going to have to settle for someone who makes me content; not someone who I’m crazy for.

Or I can just keep pursuing someone I truly want. But who I might have to approach as though he’s a wild animal...I find it hard to believe he just doesn’t want me at all. I think he’s scared it might actually work.

814,"I was caught speeding at 85 on a 60, I'm being dead honest when I say that I wasn't even trying to speed. I was just chilling listening to music and maintaining the same speed as the car in front of me (left lane). 

As I looked at my rear mirror I noticed the cop lights flashing, so I press on the brakes and quickly look at my dashboard that showed me decreasing to 69.

Cop pulled me over and told me that I was facing 2 fines. One for speeding and another one for unsafe speeding (going 20 MPH above the posted speed). He gave me a ticket for speeding and a warning for unsafe speeding. He said that I was speeding at 85 on a 60.

My fine is $279....  crazy! It sucks even more, because I actually wasn't trying to speed in that situation. 

It doesn't make sense to me though. When I saw the cop lights I pressed on the brakes and quickly saw my dashboard and noticed that I was decreasing at 69 MPH

That's a 16 MPH decrease from 85..... that's a hard brake if you ask me..... the cop would have mentioned it too! 

I don't believe I was speeding at 85, but I do believe I was speeding around 75 or less, no doubt.

Yeah, im guilty for speeding either way, but hear me out.... i disagree for speeding at 85.... i mean you'd notice if you were speeding that fast. 

Should i argue the speeding number? I don't believe that I was speeding that fast and if I was accused of speeding at 75 that would have been a warning at least, since I'm not being charged with a unsafe speeding fine (20 MPH above the posted speed).

I've never had any issues with the police... this is the 1st time. I'm a first time offender. What should I argue in court if arguing the speeding number isn't a good idea? Should I go up there asking for a plea deal for being a 1st time offender?

A wave of sad nostalgia overcomes me but I know it’s best this way so I never reach out. 

I had to pick up some mail a week or two ago from his parents house, were he is currently staying. although I talked to his mom much more I did say hello and very briefly catch up with him.

She told me he was happy and anxious to see me, and i informed her we haven’t spoken in months, she said it was a shame.

Well fast forward to now and we text a lot but I noticed a lot of subtly flirting. I let it slide because I didn’t want to make a big about it but last night he straight up told me he wanted to have sex with me. I didn’t really know how to respond so I just let that slide as well.

823,"So I (19F) have been struggeling with several mental illnesses over the past years which were quite hard for my family and caused a lot of conflicts, especially also because I had to move back in after half a year of living on my own and my antisocial behaviour (which I am really trying to work on because I really love my family but obviously I am a burden for them with my mental illnesses, especially for my sister (16F). We can talk normally, but sometimes she gets really angry about me and the situation which I can kind of understand, but I would never say these rude things to her as she says to me.
Well, and recently I have asked her to maybe take care of our birds as she used a strongly smelling paste in the bathroom which could maybe harm the lungs of our two little birds that are flying there.
Then she said, all out of context, ""I hope it will harm your lungs so you die!""
I was shocked because sure, I had to deal with suicidal thoughts but I would never ever wish one of my family members death or even an illness.
Then she said (I am going inpatient soon because of my depression) ""I can't wait for your finally pissing off to your stupid mental hospital""

I'm now living in an apartment with a friend that I want to be more than friends with but actively don't feel good enough for and work at Walmart where customers tell me how useless I am because I don't know every product we have in the store as a greeter, I barely scrape by with rent and can barely afford to feed myself once every other day.

I’ll start at the beginning. My dad and I quite often go on trips to hotels. I live in the Netherlands and I’m 13 years old. We usually go to fairly small cities like Delft, but this time we went to Amsterdam, mainly to visit museums. It’s the first big city I’ve ever been in.

We booked 2 nights in a hotel in the city centre. We arrived yesterday and we’re leaving tomorrow. Him and I went to 2 museums today and then headed to a restaurant. My phone had died and I wanted to call my mom to check up on her and my little brother. I didn’t immediately see her name so I went to search for it and saw ‘Naughty Ella’ as a recent search. I didn’t see a phone number.

My dad told me to hurry or something like that and then he just grabbed the phone (in a nice way, to help me find her) and I don’t think he knows I saw it. 

This all happened in the restaurant. I googled the name and it seems like she’s a girl with an onlyfans account but I don’t know if that’s it because it’s a basic username and my dad is not English or anything. But that’s still weird.

I was so stressed the rest of the eating and I almost threw up because of it. We then went home and now we’re in the hotel room while he’s watching TV and I’m typing this.

This insecurity/overthinking is killing me, I can't seem to stop no matter what I do, it's either at the back of my head with me constantly thinking about it or right up at the front, with me daydreaming about what she could be doing with this other guy or 'friend' I always imagine the worst possible stuff, and it's really annoying me becasue I don't want to be like this, I think it's stupid af and controlling and whatnot.  


I haven't been sure if I did like this girl or not, I've been told in old reddit post I do, becasue It hurts so damn much everytime she goes out with another guy, and I guess I do actually dream about her a lot..I'm going off topic innit okok nvm.   


I don't know what to do, I don't want to feel shit everytime she says she's as a frineds house or doing what I fantasize doing with her with another guy... like she did (It's lying in a field watching the sunset and travelling, stop it lmao ye dirty minds :)))   


I don't know if she likes me, but ugh I really don't know someone told me she did, because she got annoyed at me for never messaging her first and how I'd only talk to her when she talked to me, I think I'm coming across as more as a friend to her, I think I'm trying to because I think she probs only see's me as a friend so I don't want to seem like I'm trying even know ye holy fuck ok ye I do like her jheez that's a solid  realization, which sucks even more cause she probs only sees me as a friend, because. y'know cause she hangs out with other guys idfk I have bad expectaions and stuff. Again REALLY advise looking at my old posts will help a lot.  




Thanks, :)",07Jun2020,1
846,"So I used to be friends with this guy at my university who I was previously romantically interested in. Our friendship was complicated since he once told me that the feelings were mutual, but he could not be in a relationship due to trauma and being stalked by his ex. I decided the friendship was worth saving, because there was so much personal chemistry. I had rarely ever just vibed with someone as much as I vibed with him. We shared many deep conversations about just about everything. I was extremely grateful to have him in my life. He would ditch his other friends just to spend time with me. But then, one summer I had to go home for a few months, so we couldn't hang out. When I came back, things seemed normal at first... but then I asked him if he wanted to hang out since its been a while, and he said no. When I asked if we were still cool, he said there was nothing wrong between us. How could that be? I felt heartbroken.

Over the next few months, he began to block me on various social media platforms, one by one. He removed a bunch of other people as well. I didn't want to say anything to him because I didn't want to be intrusive. I figured it was all over. 

After that, things started to get weird. I would find multiple Snapchat accounts in my contacts under his number, but with a different name. They would be faceless and have scores of zero. I just figured he got a new phone and someone else must have got his old number.

Then, one night I was at a party that happened to be at his house. Lo and behold, he saw me, was all like ""omg hi"" and hugged me for a long ass time, multiple times, and we had a brief conversation. He said in the most sincere tone that he hoped I was doing well. It was a bit relieving that he didn't act like he hated me, but also incredibly confused. A couple weeks later, I passed him on campus and he gave me a friendly wave. What does this mean??

Then the pandemic hit, and I had to go home. I discovered that there was one social media that he didn't block me on, so out of curiosity I checked that. It showed his first name, but a totally different last name... About a month later, I looked again and he had this time a new totally different first and last name!

And that's where I'm at today. He did mention while we were friends that he was being stalked. But part of me thinks he's going to all these lengths, maybe making aliases, just to avoid me specifically. I'm still extremely broken up over this, because this was such a huge loss. I just wish we could be friends again. More importantly, I wish I could apologize to him for making things complicated between us, or behaving intrusively, or whatever I may have done. They say time heals all wounds, but the longer this has gone on, the more it hurts. I have been tempted to ask some of our mutuals if they have a clue as to what went on, but I don't want to behave even worse than I already have... Is there something obvious that I'm not seeing here? How can I move forward knowing that eventually I'll run into him again on campus? I want nothing more than to try and make things right, I don't want to hurt him anymore.",07Jun2020,1

852,"We moved into our apartment two months ago. We hate it. The upstairs neighbors are obnoxious and loud every night, no matter how often we complain. Shit just doesn’t work and we need a maintenance guy out every other week for something. We hate the parking and didn’t realize we would have to walk a quarter mile to our apartment because the parking was so badly planned. 

We just don’t like it. We want to move, but we have to pay  two months’ rent ($2,400) in order to buy out the lease. 

I was cleaning the kitchen the other day and actually saw mushrooms growing from under the sink and took a picture of it. Maintenance came out immediately and sprayed some mold killer and told us it was probably a leak from the dishwasher causing it. They told me if it doesn’t dry in several days, to call them again to have them fix the dishwasher. 

At this point, we just want to move. What should I do? Should I get a lawyer involved, or should I just ask the apartment staff to move cost-free before I decide to escalate things? How should I handle this?",07Jun2020,1

854,"Over the years, I've gotten used to him being distant from me. My understanding is that I come off as arrogant to him. And while I can see why he might think so, I don't normally actively make an effort to be snide to him. In my opinion, it seems to be the other way around.

The few times we've interacted, he's been angry at me, calling me a ""bitch"" if I don't do something he wants me to do. I recall a particular memory of him pressuring me to do something sketchy (to the point where I wondered if it was legal), and he called me a ""bitch"" because of it. Additionally, I was wearing a short skirt that day and I guess it was a little too short because he came up to me and pulled it down. Immediately afterwards, he told me (not asked me) to drive him to the DMV.

I have other memories too, which him using my car and damaging it, leading him to pay for sketchy solutions that caused issues in the car later. It wasn't too bad, but I thought that it was still disrespectful of my property, nonetheless.

Now that he has a family (a wife and a daughter), he wants to turn over a new leaf. He's apologized since for the incidents, but I still see his anger, bossy attitude, and disrespect for other's stuff in how he treats my younger siblings. More recently, for example, his daughter broke my sister's video game console and instead of apologizing, my older brother took offense and got mad at my siblings because he thought that that they were criticizing his parenting skills. He still paid for the repairs, but still, that indicated to me that things, to some level, haven't changed. I can see that he's trying, and i appriciate that, but I can't shake it off. I really do try to give him the benefit of the doubt, and if I was rude to him, I apologize.

He now wants to talk, as a result of a recent event. He had interpreted my words a certain way, and got mad at me. Usually I'll look at a situation and see what, on my end, I could've done better, but I really can't see it. I had literally explained what I had meant, to help clarify, but it made it worse. What took the cake was he decided to exclaim the words, ""this generation"", in disgust, which pissed me off. I don't like how he decided to blame the actions of what happened based on this generalization about a group in society. That's not okay.

He wants to talk now. I'm not emotionally or mentally prepared. I'm scared to talk to him, and additionally, I'm constantly stressed and upset because I've been trying to get my life together (I had just graduated and struggling to find a job). I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but what had happened scared me so much that I don't want to face him. Is it bad that I want to postpone talking to him for now? I really don't think it would be beneficial if I'm in such a fragile state that I can't properly process or face the situation.",07Jun2020,1

I will tell you this, I don’t really post anything about my life or feelings. I want to reach out to people that aren’t related and have some good experience in what I am going to tell you.

My father and I are really close. He doesn’t have many friends and is age discriminated by companies because of his age.

Apart from that, he wants to go everywhere I go and sometimes it feels awkward because I want to hang with the bros. Although I don’t mind sometimes, it’s just I want some free time.

Anyway that isn’t the main idea, I play a sport and he like that dad from the movies that goes to every practice and game. I love him for showing the support. 

He teaches me on how to become a better player with the right techniques to improve and I’m a good listener and follow what he says. Everytime I’m on that field, he repeats himself every damn time each time I do good and somedays I have an bad day (I mean who doesn’t). It irritates me so much sometimes and I know some of you might say it’s an excuse, but I start messing up and that is when the negativity starts with my father.

It’s like a sort of tantrum and he says like “fuck this I’m done coming here”, “ I don’t care what you do now go ahead and quit”, “All I’m trying to do is help you”, “You can go to college and just study”. Those are some things he says. He just starts being immature, but cools off 5 minutes later like nothing happened.

I try my best to heart on the field, I say to him that I understand what he says about and having the same muscle memory to do it every time. I’m not trying to be a smart ass and telling him I know everything, but I listened to what he said and I don’t need a lesson every time I practice.

I mean I developed a sort of behavior that I don’t care what you think of me or and that’s because him. I thought the whole time no mater your parents have a positive mindset, I guess that’s a dream and not reality.

From my bachelor study I felt the same way too, writing is the thing that I'm most incapable of. And also.. The pressure of the need of having a job is kind of high right now. 
Now here comes the question. If I drop my thesis and try to find a job, will the companies question me why I drop it and so on? I mean, is the chance of me to get an interview will be too small?
Maybe also additional question, do people feel this really hard pressure while writing the thesis? Do we need to be able to write something? What if I only can do the project without writing? Thanks everyone!",07Jun2020,1

Turns out, my sister changed her mind and wanted a refund since she sought out a better table. She’s too shy to message the girl, so I had to do it for her.

I am a 29 year old single man, living &amp; working in a different country away from family.

I am in good shape and health and has a good relationship with my family. Lately, i had this thought which i never had before and i would like to get some advice on that.

I make decent money and recently i started putting my money to good use like I mortgaged a house, started investing in stocks, bitcoin, bank accounts, my pension fund etc.

My family (mom &amp; dad specifically) never really interferes in my finances and never asks me things about what i earn, what i own and stuff like that but lately i was wondering that what if God forbid something happens to me. I come from a third world country so my parents are old school and not tech savvy. They would never be able to figure out or even know about much of my valuable possessions like stocks, crypto etc.

I would ideally like to keep it discreet but at the same time wouldn’t want all this to go to waste if God forbid something happens. They are simple people so they wouldn’t even know anything about how to take over my house/recoup the money and all.

I guess you guys get the idea what i mean.

Bad internet connections in my dorm, teachers being oblivious on how to use technology and so on. Some teachers took it so easy that they just recorded themselves and put it online, no powerpoint or whatsoever. Then they refused to answer on your emails. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mid May my uni decided to announce it exam schedule, they wanted us to physically come into uni on the first of June to start making exams. The Government decided that schools etc had to remain closed until further notice but they wanted us to come into the building. I live with my family, my mom is chronically ill and bringing COVID-19 near my mom would mean she would most likely die. Our entire academy protested, resulting in them refraining on requiring us to physically come.

They said they would alter the schedule, which they didn't. We ended up with 3 weeks to prepare for 21+ exams, of which a lot of information has been lost due to the entire situation. Quality of classes have drastically decreased. We also have a tremendous big project we had to finish, all in all it is highly unrealistic to ask us to prepare for 21+ exams whilst we have classes, projects going on.

866,"Hi, my case is something that changed me, and after a lot of time my interest in other cases rose.

I once weighted 100 and something kg (220.5 lbs).
Now I'm here at 68 kg (150 lbs).
I received a lot of hate and negative comments about my weight, and the resulting body odor didn't help, so I, at one day, thought it needed to change. 

But how I achieved it wasn't entirely clean, if one could say so.

At first I changed my drinking habits, no sweet stuff, only water and tea. My portions got lesser, and I did some training at home.

That went very well to 85 kg ( 187 lbs).
Then, my old habits and demons came, and I began to eat like the old days.

Soon my weight rose, and my frustration and sadness made me do something drastic.

I began to develop a eating disorder. Meaning, not only could I eat I sane amou ts if food fitting for 5, but also cleared my stomach from its contents several times a day.

This went on for several years, and now my daily meals are so one-sided and repeated that I lack necessary vitamins and minerals.

I look extremely on calories and sugar, but still my eating addiction hits often.

But what changed other than that?
For once I got a whole lot more confident in myself, am more happy and like to wear finally all kinds of clothes I could never wear before.

People react nicer and my conversations with woman are also not as biased. (not that I with my experience ever had a girlfriend)

But the downside from starving myself to this weight is a loss in muscle mass and some psychological problems. This here is maybe my try to reduce my stress and self doubt.

I had a change of heart tho, registering myself at the local gym, and reducing my eating attacks by spending time online, talking to strangers in vr-chat for example (I saw stuff...), anyway:

Now that this story is told, I want to give advice:

Don't starve yourself, the consequences are more serious and lasting than you think, and not easy to handle.

Eating right should come first before eating nothing. 

Don't let the calories fool you, there are some kinds of fat that you need, and stuff like vegetables and fruits have more significance than one may think. 

Stop drinking so much sweet stuff. It reduces a lot of you weight when switching to water. You can change the taste by putting fruits and other fresh stuff in it. 

Train a bit. Not excessively, but you should use you muscles. 

And don't hate yourselve.

I worked with this one girl who seemed really nice at first, and then our supervisor walked by and said hi. As soon as she left, the girl turns to me and says ""she is a real bitch."" And then continues to tell me how she thinks she's a bitch. Here's the really big kicker; ""I think it's because she's from Africa. All the ones from Trinidad are like that here"". 

I was speechless. I genuinely did not know what to fucking say. I was like ""well I don't think so maybe she was just having a bad day?? I think that's assuming a little too much-"" and she cuts me off. She continues to defend her point on cultural differences, but eventually changes the subject.

Her friend shows up a bit later and we're introduced. She then leaves me alone with him and we start talking about how we wished people would just wash their hands and practice hygiene. He then asks me why women make men wash their penises. He complains that it doesn't make sense, it's just going to get dirty again.

871,"I've had an issue for awhile and in the past few years of my post-grad life, it's becoming harder to ignore. It has also become even more noticeably worse since quarantine has started with being on my social media more and everyone staying in contact via zoom parties etc. From the time I can remember, I have always had friends but have also always been shy. Or at least that's what people label me as. I like to more so categorize it into social anxiety and having low self esteem. If I feel comfortable and safe with you, I don't think I'm as shy. As I have gotten older and no longer have structures in my life such as school, socializing is very difficult. I have friends but I find myself resistant to staying in touch with some of them and reaching out on my own. I always rely on others to reach out to me and start conversation. I have my best friend who is a natural at staying in touch with people so I have heavily depended on her consistent contact (which sometimes becomes bothersome when I get into depressive episodes and have an urge to isolate) but I know I cannot always rely on her. Most of my friends and acquaintances I know because of her. I hear news about other friends typically from her. and it bothers me that I don't have my own solid foundation with people on my own. Even a lot of group activities I go to are put together by her, I am never really the initiator of plans. I put a lot of blame on me for this. I always tell myself I should have been more proactive in getting to know certain people and that now it's too late to start. I also get upset when I notice I am not as close to some people as my friends are when we all met at the same time. It makes me realize how little I do to make an effort. Of course it's on the other end too for not staying in contact with me either, but someone has to make the move. I am always so nervous to do this and it has negatively affected me. I always question if people like me, I'm always concerned with how I come off, and that my quietness is taken for disinterest. It's a vicious cycle.

Yet I got sick of it all. I don't have anyone to meet up with (no friends, no family), so I'm bound to single-person activities. It's probably worth mentioning that my options are limited, as I'm still a student with little to no money. In my country, most clubs or associations (e.g. Volleyball clubs) cost money, which I cannot afford. Otherwise, I would have picked up playing the piano a long time ago.

Due to the pandemy, I'm stuck at home. I was able to keep myself distracted with a story-based video game for a month (April, already beat the game so I won't play it again), but it's gone downhill afterwards. Nothing is as stimulating / fun as this game. I cannot get myself to do anything at all at this point. I was able to pick up a book, but I finished it already and don't know what to read next. Honestly, I'm not sure if I even WANT to read. It's too exhausting and requires concentration, so why bother? My drawings suck and I'm the least creative person I know, so how could I possibly start drawing again? I bought another game, but it's not as fun as the previous one.
Nothing is fun, really, and I cannot even find the motivation to force myslf out of this situation. 

How can I get out of this slump? Has anyone else experienced this? If so, what did you do to get back on track?

(I know, I am privileged while others are struggling with illnesses / protests / etc. I'm sorry for my tiny worries, but I'd really appreciate some advice.)",07Jun2020,1
874,"Please don't say anything about me being a simp. That was old behavior.

I'm gonna put the tl;dr up here.
Screwed up a friendship, drama happened, friends changed dramatically and that lead to many arguments and friends being lost.

Now what I want advice on is on how to cope with these feelings, which I will explain later.

First, some context. (I don't want to hear stuff about meeting people online. You can meet some very genuine and nice people online.) I'll keep try this as short as I can, but basically I met a girl on discord, who I simped for. (Don't attack me please.) I'm also friends with a few of her friends. There are about 3 of our mutual friends involved and 1 of their friends (I am not friends with this last one.) My simping continued after the girl I met got into a relationship. (Stupid, I know. I had a disorder called Obsessive Love Disorder. You can search it up.) 

Eventually, I was confronted by 2 of our friends and I stopped some of my behavior. It lingered slightly, and I was confronted again, by everyone mentioned previously this time. It was a lot of telling me what not to do and stuff. So, I stop contact with said friend because that's what I was told to do. In the discord server, I was previously a staff member but was booted and replaced by their friend who I was not friends with. (I don't do posts like this often so sorry if it gets confusing. You can ask for clarification.) In the server, we had previously changed our nicknames to Sailor Moon stuff. For example, mine was ""Sailor Sol."" This time, they added something afterwards, such as ""Sailor Sol: The Speed."" 

Apparently the friend I was previously simping for had done this again, however I saw some of my other friends doing it and joined in. I was accused of doing this to get her attention and was admin-abused by the person who replaced me in staff, who was constantly changing my nickname to ""Stop copying,"" even though he himself copied the nickname and despite me having stopped my behavior and cutting off contact. (He does this again afterwards, when the owners put ""issa"" in the beginning of their nicknames and he does the same. I don't know what the joke was but he was copying them.) He also has broken the rules several times when I searched his messages (racial slurs, disrespect, etc). An argument ensues because of his abuse and eventually, the friends who were against me start turning against this person.

Fast forward a few days. The people who confronted me were my friends now, but the girl I simped for and her friend were getting into arguments with them. The guy told one of them to kill themselves and the girl was acting overall toxic, calling them insults and even banning them from her servers. The point is that now, they're gone from our servers and we all (besides her ex-girlfriend) hate her. 

I'm conflicted between hating her and wanting her to come back. I believe that her new behavior is due to her friend's bad influence. Part of me wants to give her a second chance, hoping she'll realize her mistake and come back. Yet there's still a lingering part of me that's wants her to suffer. I want to yell at her and attack her (not physically) but I need to hold myself back for the sake of not causing drama and for my friend who is still on good terms with her. I'm very confused on what I should do and how I should feel.",07Jun2020,1

876,"(24 M, for context) 

I've been single 5 years now - I briefly dated a girl a year or so ago and it went down the pan because I can't bring myself to be enthusiastic uninterested enough whilst dating or getting to know someone. I feel like talking online is a factor - I hate the formulaic nature of chatting online on things like tinder and it feels like the people I'm talking to have just as little enthusiasm as I do when it comes down to it. I can't help but give people 1 reply a day because, I think because I went head over heels for someone years ago and am afraid of being to pushy but at push same time, I haven't found anyone that I want to be pushy with.

Not only this but maybe 80% of the time, I'm convinced that I'm fine on my own and that, for someone like me, it is pointless to be in a relationship for the sake of a relationship.

But I'm lonely deep down and don't feel like I'm doing enough to solve that. I'm tired of working on myself. How can I work towards finding the motivation to get me past my anxieties?",07Jun2020,1
877,"So I migrated to the United States from east Africa with my immediate family just about 7 years ago and I’m in my early 20’s. I’ve spent the last few years learning the culture, being able to communicate with others and overall learning about what life is about; I was depressed for most of it and I still fall back in it at times. I currently have no friends that I consider close and my family dynamics isn’t great so I spend most of my time away from them. The fundamental years to my growth (up until I was 15) were spent in my native culture where a lot of it clashes with the general culture of the United States but most of my teen years were spent here in the US developing my interests, morals and values. 

I’ve spent a lot of time asking who am I, what am I and what should I do (both right now and for the rest of my life), this mentality has lead me to learning some of what Buddhism is about and that has been a great help. I have no relatives or friends here so its a bit hard going through the days. Any advice for me? I am open to questions.",07Jun2020,1
878,"Super long post here! If you don’t have time to read there’s a quick summary at the bottom! :)

So a friend of mine and I (both 21F) are super close (we text all the time and Facetime all the time too) however, the recent events of the George Floyd, Black Lives Matter movements, police brutality, riots etc. has caused a strain or our friendship. (For reference she is black and I am white).

Essentially, she posts on her Instagram story a ton every day and she had been posting about being upset about everything that’s going on. I swiped up and sent her hearts and said if she wanted to talk I’m here. Then a day later I see on her story that she’s calling out her “close white friends” for being “silent” and how it was harmful/hurtful and she is watching. She also posted more stories about this and how “you know who you are” “I won’t reach out to you in the future” and you are oppresors and I think you get the point. I messaged her and she said she was surprised I didn’t bring the incidents up and was it was harmful that I didn’t ask her if she was okay etc. (A super long message mind you). She was also upset that the group she called out wasn’t posting on social media/being public and that means we essentially don’t care about her.

I was really hurt by this. I am an EXTREMELY loyal friend and always show that I am there in support of my friends no matter what. Here’s the thing, I do support black lives matter and obviously think that what happened to george floyd was horrific, however I am a pretty far right person politically and a lot of what I believe (such as blue lives matter etc.) she doesn’t and makes her beliefs VERY clear on her story so I don’t like to talk about it with her because I don’t see the point in stirring up unnecessarily quarrelling.

In the past when horrific incidents similar to this have happened I’ve had other friends tell me to either shut up because I’m “white and don’t understand and to not contact them”. Each person is different I guess but I thought she would have seen my initial reaching out as showing support as well as her knowing my good character extremely well. I hadn’t posted on social media up to that point but I felt so pressured to post to defend my character that I did because I didn’t want to be labeled as, well you can guess all the names.. she liked the post but said nothing not that she had to.

Here’s my dilema: I don’t want to lose a close friend over this, but I also felt really hurt by her automatic assumptions of me and her other “close white friends” and the hurtful way she messaged me and has been posting. I didn’t want to stir up political drama or have another instance of “you’re white leave me alone,” but I’m just torn. I don’t want to abandon my political beliefs to appease her and I don’t feel that I did anything hurtful to her (I guess I could have been more explicit in my support but you guys know why I didn’t). I’ve spoken to a few others and they’ve said she owes me an apology and to wait for her to come to me, but I’m just a person who doesn’t like conflict like this and wants to resolve things and would rather be the bigger person and put our friendship above my ego. What should I do? Do I wait for her to come to me (if she does) or do I ask to talk? This is really weighing on me so any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you! :)

tldr: A very close friend of mine was upset that I didn’t bring up the current events with George Floyd/BLM/etc. and didn’t explicitly reach out and ask her how she was doing about it nor post on social media/public all of my own volition. She posted all over her Instagram how it was harmful that her “close white friends” were being silent. I don’t want to lose our friendship which was very meaningful to me. I know her political beliefs are very different than mine and I didn’t want to stir up unnecessary quarrels but I had sent her a message that I was here for her but I guess it wasn’t enough. She hasn’t said a word to me when we used to talk every day. What should I do? I don’t want to abandon my political beliefs to match hers but our friendship is worth more than ego and I don’t want to just never contact her again. Do I wait for her to come to me (if she does), wait for the dust to settle or reach out and ask to talk?",07Jun2020,1

882,"I am getting married to a wonderful man, and I would love to have my brother and sister at my wedding. I last saw them in October 2014, and since then, any attempts of contact have been impossible. I only have my ex-stepmother’s phone number and email address, and every time I have tried to talk to them, she has told me that they are “unavailable.” I emailed her last week to invite them to the wedding, and I asked for email addresses and/or phone numbers for them, and she finally emailed back claiming to have spoken to them and that they will not be attending, and did not acknowledge my request for contact info.

I have a strong suspicion that they do not know I had tried to get in contact. Their mother has kept them away from most of our family for years. Our dad has no way of contacting them directly, and our aunt and uncle and cousins have no way of contacting them directly, so it’s not just me.

892,"
I am sure that what I’m about to say will offend many people and I’m not sure where exactly I’m going with this, but I need to let this out.

I as a white person have never sought of myself as a racist, I have always genuinely loved people of colour and all the talent they bring into our society. I’ve always considered myself an ally to anti-racism, and I have been doing as much as I can to support the current black lives matter movement and the one prior in 2016. My family has always brought me up this way.

However, in my childhood (age 12-13) I’ve made some disturbing racist mistakes. I am now an adult, and I look back at it in disgust. I think about it all the time, especially now during this time. It hurts my heart. I grew up in a small town that was predominantly white. I did blackface, without even knowing what it was or why it’s racist. In my ignorant little head back then, I thought it would be funny to put on a much darker foundation and take pictures and videos in it. I would even say the n-word because for some reason I thought it made me cool, and so would my other white friends. I did this blackface more then once.

However, I was never fuelled with genuine hatred, I never once hated black people, nor have I ever or would say anything of that matter. Like I said, I never considered myself a racist but rather an ally. I’ve always admired black people and some of my favourite celebrities growing up are black. So I don’t understand why I did this and thought it was okay? I assume it was a lack of knowledge (which is no excuse) because like I said, I only found out what blackface was a year or two after I did it. Which is quite sad, because African American history is not really taught enough in school. Apart of me also thinks that I may have just thought saying the n-word made me cool? Because all of the popular kids said it, and I always heard it in songs. Its really quite sad that I thought like that.

I understand that regardless of my age, lack of education, or how long ago this was, nothing excuses it or makes it ever okay. But I guess what I’m asking here is, do you believe that someone can grow into a better person? Do you think this could be forgiven? Do you this this is a reflection of who I truly am?

Keep in mind, nobody really knows of this I have never told anyone this because its even hard for me to say it out loud without disgust. I have considered writing an apology on my social media, but nobody would even know what I’m talking about and idk how people would react to me coming out saying “I did black face” it may seem a little too forward? Its also been almost 8 years since I did this (I am in my 20s now) but should an apology still be made? Should I apologize publicly or just to my black friends? I don’t want to offend anyone or seem way out of my head for even saying anything in a time like this. I also don’t want people to think any less of me because I don’t see myself as that person I was then. I am much more educated and aware of whats going on now in the world. Could I get some opinions?

Also if you are white, I would prefer if you didn't give your opinion. Only because this doesn't effect you, it effects the black community. You are not in the place to forgive on this.

Thanks.",07Jun2020,1
893,"So I (22F) may have to move back home due to finances. I've been on my own since 2016 so it's going to be a hard adjustment for me, but my moms excited and she said she could really use the help. 


My sister (20F) still lives at home. Not that out of the ordinary in today's society, except she has no job and when she does get a job she'll only keep it for a month or so because it's hard work (her words). She expects my mom to pay for everything (utilities, food, gas money, phone bill, car insurance, etc.) And my mom does to avoid the throwdown that happens when my sister gets mad. 


As if that wasn't bad enough, my sister also brings home strays. So currently, there are 2 momma cats and 9 babies in her bedroom along with a pet snake and a dog. She isn't currently staying at home (she's with her boyfriend), she only visits at night when everyone is getting ready for bed so she can feed and water the animals. The dog has to be taken out by my mom, which she has her hands full raising my niece (3F) and taking care of 3 other large dogs, and my disabled brother. 


From my POV, my sister isn't taking care of these animals. My mom says her room smells so bad you can smell it when you walk by it. My sister is irresponsible and blames my mom for everything bad that's ever happened to her. My mom isn't perfect, no mom is. But she hasn't been a bad mom.

We weren’t expecting anyone so it scared both of us. I looked over at the door and it was unlocked so I ran to lock the door.

908,"For example, I don't think I'm going to even be around in 2 years. I just try to get through a day, week, month and oh look, end of another year. I don't plan because I dont expect to go anywhere. Yes, I'm in therapy have been for 3 years going on 4. Ultimately I still feel like I'm nothing but a festering, weeping wound that never heals.

Reality constantly fluctuates in feeling real or not real. 

I'm doing everything I'm supposed to, eating good food, going to the gym, trying to make mentally good judgments. And yet, here I am. Still broken. I told my therapist one more year, nothing changes and I'm out. 

Life is meaningless so why must I keep forcing myself to fit in with the rest of the world? I don't belong here and I just hurt, filled with anxiety and depression, disassociating left and right. 

There's no place for me here, I just don't belong. I can't even just take a break, I have to work to pay rent, car, food and what's the point? If I didn't have my cat I'd just leave and hope someone runs me over. I can't leave him because no one else can be good enough for him, but I'm aware that I'm not good enough for him either.

909,"My mom has been extremely paranoid about coronavirus ever since it started. For reference, i’m from NJ and many things are beginning to open up as the days go by. I’ve been quarantined since March 15th, and quite literally haven’t left my neighborhood since then. 

I’ve asked her about things like hanging out with friends, and more specifically, going out on my friends boat. It’s our favorite activity and we love fishing. Every answer is an “No” or an “I don’t know.” I ride my longboard frequently, and every time I come back from a skate it’s a barrage of questions like “How many people were there? Were they wearing masks? Gloves?” 

It’s really worrying how her attitude about it hasn’t changed at all since the beginning. I understand the concern, it is a deadly and infectious disease. However, she is living her life in constant fear and stress over it. It can’t be healthy for her, and she’s been making herself sick over it.

912,"DAE have physical and mental pain caused by boredom?

So I’m an 18 year old guy and I have a job which I work 5 out of 7 days. These days are pretty normal and what I’m about to describe doesn’t ever happen on work days. 

I like to just relax alone on my days off since there’s nothing to do and nowhere to go because of the Coronavirus. I wake up with a minor headache which stays with me till I go to sleep that night. Note that I’m prone to migraines and get them pretty often. I get in a couple of hours of relaxation before I suddenly get extremely bored to the point of being angry about it. It’s as if a switch has been flipped. I then get a little hungry and decide to eat a small snack which doesn’t quell my hunger. The hunger turns to nausea which comes in the form of a weird stomach ache that doesn’t feel painful but at the same time makes me uneasy and as if I’m about to throw up. 

This annoys me even more and at this point I’m in a bad mood asking myself why my body can’t just be fucking normal. I’ll probably be pacing around the room trying to get rid of the nausea and occasionally showing flashes of anger. Nothing I do or watch will take the boredom away (especially with everywhere closed and not being able to meet friends). I have to ride this out till I go to sleep because the only way for me to “cure” it is by calling it a night and waking up fresh the next morning.

This is becoming a massive problem and I have no clue how to deal with it.

913,"Hi, everyone! this is my first post and this subject in particular has been on my mind a lot lately.

So, first, I should probably adress that we don't know each other face-to-face. He lives a few states away and my father isn't very fond of his family, particularly this uncle (for unrelated reasons) and they haven't seen one another ever since my father moved to my home state. So, me and this uncle have never met or gotten close, AT ALL.
The issue started when he, through a family member, got my phone number last year. I have no idea why he would want to talk to me now, since he never reached out before and the only thing that ties us together is my elderly grandmother, that was with an aunt at the time. He started trying to make conversation (note: we message through whatsapp) and I was polite, but didn't engage into making conversation. 
The first Red Flag appeared when, on my birthday, me and my older sisters (who I coincidently share the bday with) were videocalling my grandma and he was around. At one point, he took the phone and started talking to someone else (I wasn't in the call anymore, but was still in the room) and he randomly shouted something along the lines of ""AND TELL [my name] THAT I LOVE HER *SO MUCH*, GIVE HER A KISS FOR ME AND THANK YOU FOR WATCHING MY STATUSES"" (status is a tool on WhatsApp similar to stories on Instagram, but on status you can see who viewed your post, and I wasn't even watching his. I jumped through it just so my feed would be clear because he posts so much) and I was..... taken aback, to say the least? it could be considered ""normal"", so much that the family that was in the room laughed while I nervously smiled, but 1) it was really odd that he only said that towards *me*, I have three sisters, he never directed a word to them and 2) we.are.not.close.at.all. and for him to throw that in the air? hm. (safe to say i don't click on his stuff anymore, lmao)
The second Red Flag came when the same grandma came to stay with us (she came before the pandemic reached my country). Me, her and my mom were in the room talking and she made a comment on how my uncle would tell everyone in the house *that I was his*. My, married, 63 year old uncle was telling everyone that I was HIS, ONLY HIS...... How the hell do you explain that?? my grandma laughed, not realizing what just came out of her mouth, my mom and I just shared a look and I left the room shortly after.
The third Red Flag came when he decided that he wanted to renew his house and kept sending videos for me to show my grandma/parents. But one day, he messaged me and asked about when I was coming to see him and added something about ""how I would not want to leave his house when I visited"". That struck me as really odd, especially considering the the context. I gave him a lame excuse, saying ""that since covid was pretty bad I can't go anywhere and if I went, I would be under the watch of other family and blablabla"" (my mom has family in the same state, thankfully they're amazing and I would be with them if I went).

Now, me and my older sister were planning on going on a trip there as a ""HS graduation trip"" present for me, at the end of the year and we would be staying with my mom's family, but because of covid, that's obviously postponed. But I'm really scared. When we go, he will probably try and come see """"us"""" and I'm dreading being in the same room with him. I talked to my mom about this and she, while obviously worried, gave some lame excuse, saying ""he acts that way because he didn't have a daughter"" but i don't buy into that crap.

I’ve put up with all of it and allowed them to take advantage of me and never once complained. However I fear that when I hand in a 2 week notice things will become UGLY.

Asking my parents to do things is like a chess game sometimes, where I’d have to predict any of the things they could possibly say and somehow have a response ready for it. I’ve been dying to see my friends again, and seeing them be allowed to be out again and me not able to is causing something inside me to boil. I was recently invited over to come over to a friend’s house to celebrate her birthday. When I asked my mom, I brought up the fact that we would just be at her house  and that many of my other friends were allowed out. I got hit with a somewhat promising “maybe” and that she needed to talk to my dad about it. I asked again today and got hit with a no, and that we should probably give it a few more weeks for everything to settle.

I’ll wait the few weeks if I really can’t come up with anything else I could say, I’m not gonna go against my parents wishes and sneak out.

922,"Since quarantine started I had been gaming with my 2 close friends daily, up until 2-3 weeks ago.

2-3 weeks ago while we were playing, Friend A says that me and Friend B aren't his ""real friends"". This was a shocking and kinda hurtful thing to say because I've known Friend A the longest, nearly 6 years, and Friend B has also known Friend A for 3 years. I was the one responsible for inviting him into my friend group (with Friend B in it, although Friend B and Friend A were friends before I introduced him to my friend group). Me and Friend B were shocked by him saying this and we asked him throughout the rest of the night to explain himself in saying that, which culminated in him leaving prematurely in the middle of a game.

Friend A started off by distracting by trying to change the topic and ignore us. He then gave some bullshit excuses such as ""you're not the only people I game with"" when we said we thought we were his friends because we game with him every day in quarantine (which wasn't true, he said so himself later in that whole gaming session). Another bullshit excuse he gave us is ""I don't have any social skills"" (not true) and ""We go to rival schools"" to justify why we aren't his real friends and why he would say that. Eventually he started acting like we were misinterpreting what he said, while offering no actual explanation, and just tried to deny he ever said it. 

After he left the game, he also left all the group chats me and friend B were in. He also apparently posted on instagram that he was taking a break from social media. And also hid his xbox status to say he was always offline. We tried to text or call him but he wouldn't accept or reply. 

It's been 3 weeks almost, and since then I've been gaming with Friend B daily. Once or twice a week we get another close friend to play with us, but he's in a different time zone and across the world so its mainly only on the weekends. Otherwise we can't find anyone that has an Xbox or has the games we play so it's just me and him. 

But now Friend B wants to pretend like nothing happened and get Friend A back. I want Friend A back too but I want an actual explanation of why he would say that we aren't his ""real friends"" because it kinda hurt and he should be accountable for stuff he says like that. Friend B disagrees and says it doesn't matter anymore and that he doesn't care about that anymore, he just wants him back so we can play xbox together again. I don't agree with Friend B because I feel like he's treating Friend A with kid gloves on, if any other close friend had said something like that then Friend B would have acted differently. Friend A does have a history of mental health issues but so do other close friends of ours and I don't think that means we should just pretend like he didn't say anything and appease him.  

If I'm really honest, thinking about it, it's actually been really fun and maybe even more fun to play with our friend overseas instead of with Friend A because Friend A is a downer, and given some recent events I'm not sure if Friend A is someone I would want to associate with, because I think he may be affiliated with some kids at his school who were exposed to be literal neo-nazis, saying wildly racist things.

But I'm not sure how to explain to Friend B that I don't feel comfortable about trying to ""get Friend A back"" without Friend A explaining why he said we aren't his real friends, and knowing if Friend A is affiliated with the racist kids at his school. Friend B also wants to know if he's affiliated with the racist kids at his school but thinks I should drop the whole ""real friends"" thing so we can get a third player back.",07Jun2020,1

928,"So I was friends with these two young women (K and B) in the past and the friendship ended when they blocked me on social media without warning. At the time things were toxic between them and I. I didn't ""fit"" into their friendship and constantly felt excluded. I have Aspergers Syndrome so it is hard for me to socialize and voice out my concerns in a way that isn't turn-offish. I constantly told them how I felt about it and the responses I would get just seemed robotic, like no genuineness behind the answers. I was not the bestest friend and know I could have been a better friend, but they equally treated me the way I treated them. K  (before the friendship ended and they blocked me) needed help when she and her fiance moved into an apartment and asked if I would help her, saying she would buy me dinner afterward. It bothered me because it didn't seem like she wanted to see me unless I helped her. She could make the effort to ask me for help, but can't make the effort to contact me or make individual plans? I leaped at the opportunity to see my two friends again, but it never happened. She never mentioned it again after that conversation.  Long story short, I guess the thing that bothers me now that they're doing is they have a habit of blocking and unblocking me on Facebook (maybe even times I'm not aware of). I don't know what either one want from me? You can't even see anything on my Facebook page because its private. B recently unblocked me I think just to see comments I made on someone's post and then blocked me again. But that isn't the first time she has unblocked me and she does it more frequently than the other. 

Maybe B is also trying to see if my boyfriend and I are still together. So my boyfriend (months before we got together) was talking to her and hanging out with her.. they were more fwb than anything else. Well she was hurt because he didn't want a relationship with her and told her this in the end. I don't know if she has some anger towards me over this. I didn't do anything wrong, didn't ""take"" him from her. I remembered her Snapchat username (because I made a new account to use in general, so I'm not blocked by her on this one) and apart of me wants to ask what her issue is, why does she keep trying to ""stalk"" my profile. I'm also reluctant to contact her because it may just cause drama. 

**I was NOT friends with either one of them when I started seeing my boyfriend. B fooled around with my boyfriend (months before him and I started talking) has no right to me mad at me. I did nothing wrong. I didn't even know about him knowing her till we started talking.** She apparently wanted to be friends with my boyfriend after he was done fooling around with her and he didn't want to be friends. 

They know very well that he is my boyfriend. K contacted him right after Christmas 2018 (month after we started dating) and asked how his Christmas was. He didn't respond so she said to him ""so and so used to my friend too, so you better treat her right"". He ended up blocking her, saying he didn't want the drama.

940,"So, for context, I accidentally got a decent cut on my hand from a box cutter when I was shredding foam, trying to help my dad clean the garage. My parents are refusing to take me to the hospital because “it doesn’t need stitches”. (I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, so I have really poor wound healing and am super prone to infection) As we were having a row, like we usually do, she said “It’ll be nice to have a regular scar from an accident like everyone else, then.” This hurt me. Deeply. She knows how much I struggled with self harm and suicidal issues/severe clinical depression. (I’m almost 9 months clean and on the mend) Yet, she takes shots at my mental fuck-ups, and makes me want to relapse. I so wanna call CPS on her ass, but I love my dad and don’t want to hurt him like that. I’m just waiting until I’m 18, can buy a cheap van, and live in my car. I seriously want to buy a tent and camp random places for free and live either with my boyfriend (technically my fiancé, we want to get married once we’re old enough) or on my own and say fuck it, I’m a homeless kid who sets up her tent in random woods.

942,"So basically a guy randomly followed me on Instagram  a few days ago, I only accepted his request and followed him back to see who he is, he then straight away sent me a dm saying he followed me by accident and mistook me for someone else and apologised which was fair enough, he started talking to me about general stuff like Tv shows and asked my age, I’m 19 and he’s 28. I kept the convo going because he seemed nice (BIG MISTAKE) After wards I thought that would be it and he would leave me alone but now he’s been messaging me everyday just asking me how my day was and stuff and today he started asking me if I have a boyfriend and if I would look twice at him. See the problem is he has a wife and kid, I know this because he told me he had a 1 year old baby but no mention of a wife but I can clearly see pictures of him and his wife on his account and she is also tagged in the pictures. They are clearly happily married and not separated or anything from what I can see. I feel really bad for his wife and I’m thinking about messaging her to tell her what her husbands been doing but at the same time I don’t want to be a trouble maker and break up a family but I feel like his wife should know because if I reject him, he might just try it on with another girl who won’t reject him.

I am white and have another white friend I offended a few years ago by saying some not so great things about BPOC (which also kind of put a strain on our relationship), but I have grown and learned since then and am deeply resentful of my words.

947,"So, normally I am pretty animal savvy but this case has several factors that make me wary and I do not want this to get messed up. I'm about to do a trial sleepover with one of the dogs who stay at my parent's house at my house. If it goes well, she will be staying most likely after some more sleepovers. I need to put a fence up before I will let her stay because I would feel more comfortable with that. They're outside in a pen with no interaction except when they have their feeder filled up and this particular dog I have tried to buy since she had a traumatic experience when she was less than a year old. I've offered 2x what she was bought for (she isn't a special breed or anything, I was just trying to get my siblings to be okay with me taking her but they declined). Well, now one sibling is gone and the other doesn't play with them ever. This dog has been through a lot. My parents were talking about rehoming the dogs since there is no interaction with them, and that is what has sparked the sleepovers at my house. 

Dog coming to sleepover: a small, submissive, very timid 2 year old spayed female beagle about 20 lbs, super friendly with people but not much socialization with dogs besides her kennel mate (he bites, is unfixed, and is horribly mannered and I do not want him) 

Dog she will be meeting: my neutered 121 lb lab who is a bit pushy but friendly, he's gentle with cats and rabbits but he has had incidents where dogs rush him on walks and tried to attack him so he is unpredictable in some cases. He has never attacked another dog, he's usually pretty laid back, but he does get pushy and bothersome with the cats and he will probably intimidate her. They have met before, a long time ago, and were fine but things have possibly changed in the year since she had her traumatic incident. 

I do plan on buying some calming treats and spray (she's a picky eater) for the car ride and having then meet at a neutral place (the park). She's very, very nervous about a lot of stuff. She had a bad experience in a car and now she shakes when she's in them. Honestly gonna probably get her a thunder jacket eventually.",07Jun2020,1

She(37f) is the kindest person that I know. Would do anything for anyone and not expect anything or even consider taking anything in return. 

She never talks about herself. Her career is in child care but has never had the confidence to move up out take on more challenges. She moved home over a year ago, ands hasn’t broadened or begun her social circles. She walks about 5km per day but is still over weight- I think she secretly eats in her room. She gets so upset if she thinks she has done anything wrong, during lock down she’s been cooking and will apologise for days off something is over/under cooked. 

I can see how sad she is but she won’t talk to me. 
This evening, something broke in the house- no big deal in the long run. Tempers ran high and our mother  had a go at both of us- she went to her room, she’s been crying and upset all evening. I tried to talk to her, Coax her out to solve the problem, she won’t budge.

This and similar has happened before, I know we have a week of sullen looks, hiding in her room and generally not talking to us. She can’t seem to cope. My mother has tried over the years, paying for trainers, private courses, travel. She too is really worried about her in the long term.

They've recently made a decision that I think is a huge mistake but I don't want to project my thoughts/feelings, that could very well be wrong, into her decision.

I think about watching it constantly and whenever I think of it and I'm not there my heart feels literally heavy - you know the feeling of weight you can get? Well, it's that. My actual life fades into the background and I just wait for an opportunity to watch the next episode. These feelings only go away after the series is completely over - and even then it can take a while for the obsession to fade. 

The thing is, I LIKE watching series. And every time I start one I forget that this always happens, and if I do remember I think ""Well, it won't happen this time"". But it does (of course).

962,"

Sorry I feel like I have to give little background and it might be kinda long :  last summer my father sold his company and decided to retire.  My parents decided they would relocate from Indiana to North Carolina to spend their golden years.  They extended me (M34) an offer if I wanted to go, they would allow me to stay with them and finally finish my degree without really any strings attached.  I was living in a small Midwest town, working a dead end job, and to be honest was extremely miserable.  It was not where I wanted my life to be and was feeling like I had wasted my 20s because I served in the army instead of going to college.  Not something I feel like I regret but to be honest it didn’t really prepare me for anything productive in the civilian workplace other than low paying factory jobs, which is fine and all but not something that fulfilled me personally.  I spoke to my brother (36) who was living in Nevada,  kind of in the same boat as I, and we both decided that a change of scenery would be a good thing.  So there it was the 4 of us all moved.  After the move right away I started working part time while also attending classes at the local university and everything was going great.  My brother by random chance met someone (now his fiancé) and moved in with her fairly quick which is great and I’m happy for him but that stopped our plans of being roommates as I couldn’t afford a place on my own without taking students loans and it’s something I really want to avoid.  Because of covid I lost my job, on site classes have been canceled although I’m still attending online but that means I have been spending a lot of time around the house.  I try to get out and leave as much as possible but there isn’t really anywhere to go as most things are still closed/ just reopening.  My father understands the situation, I mean who could’ve predicted what would happen in 2020 it’s crazy right?  But this has led my mother to just snap at me with every chance for really no other reason that I can think of other than the fact that I’m a 34 year old man who lives with his parents.  And to be honest it feels like shit having to post about this, I mean I served in god damn Iraq and I feel like my respect level is back to when I was a teenager or something.  This passive aggressive behavior makes me not want to interact at all,  and I really feel like I have to say something but she has never been the type of parent who takes criticism well from their kids, it’s part of the reason why my brother moved so far away and why I joined the army to get away right after high school.  What can I do? I’m losing my mind here and I feel like I’m 13 all over again.",07Jun2020,1

So she has been seeing this piece of garbage for almost 6 years. At some point me and my brother lived in his house, at first he seemed to be a normal guy who was just minding his business but as soon as he got used to us staying with him he started being very verbally abusive. With everyone. He called us names everyday when things didn't go as he wanted. He would burst out any second for no reason and if something bad happened to him he would blame us saying we were praying for it. I might sound like I'm overreacting but I'm not. Every night I would hear the entrance door opening and starting to tremble hoping he would just go to bed. I have never in my life hated someone so much, trust me if he died tomorrow I wouldn't even blink. He treated my brother who was only 8 years old as his punching bag and if I stood up for him I was next in line. My mom didn't give a shit, or if she did, she was too scared to say anything. He didn't hit her until then but he would smash everything in the house whenever he felt like it. 8 months ago they had a bigger fight because my mom didn't park the car the way he wanted and you can imagine that this psychopath went crazy to the point of breaking her ribs, I tried helping her but he knocked me out before I could even get him off her. After that we left and went to our old house, I started having nightmares almost everynight and every sound had me panicked that he would come. He sent a lot of texts saying he would burn the house down and he ended up being taken by the police in the middle of the night. A few weeks passed and I was still living in fear, my mom started seeing him again but promised that we would never go back to that house again and that he won't come here as well. I didn't say anything much because she wouldn't listen to me anyway and just went with it. To be honest I've never met someone as stupid as her, she's my mother but if she ever suggests going back there I'd rather end up with my brother in an orphanage. At the actual moment everything is fine, he didn't come here, at least inside the house, and we didn't go there. I'm turning 18 next year and I'm supposed to leave for uni but I'm scared that if I go my mom will bring back that man and make my brother's life miserable. He is the only thing stopping me from killing myself, the fear that he'll have to go through that again. I'm still having nightmares to the point where I'm afraid of falling asleep, don't mention a therapist or something like that because my mom won't allow it anyway. How can I convince her to leave him for good?

972,"So my (19F) friend (20F), Anna, is a girl I've considered to be my best friend since we were 13. Even though we've had our rough patches, especially when she went to high-school in a different city, we still managed to see each other pretty regularly. We had our dynamic, she was from an abusive household, and I was the ""therapeutic friend"" and I tried to listen and help her. She was always there for me as well, and even though she had a lot of problems of her own, she still listened to my problems, even though they appeared silly to me when compared to hers. However, things did change when we were seperated and a lot of traumtic things happened to her during those four years. She was kind of a trouble-maker, she got in some bad company and met a boy. (They sent her to that high-school to seperate her from all of that influence, especially him). Over the years they were on and off and in summer 2018, he was murdered, in a street fight. She was absolutely devastated, and she never really learned how to cope with it, even until now. It also seemed to have triggered her other bad memories from her life as a child, and just got her in a bad emotional state. I try as much as I can to be there when she needs me, however sometimes she can be really irrational and impulsive, and when she irritates me, I don't really know how to act. Naturally, I was always a non-confrontational person, however, over the years I learned to stand up for myself, and have actually changed to be more assertive and thick-skinned. So, the 4 years of high-school go by, and we are both attending college in the same city. Not the same college, but we are able to see each other much more often than before. So our dynamic kind of changes, and as we have more opportunities to see each other we try to get used to it. I noticed that she can change her mood quickly, go from euphoric excitement, to nervous and anxious, overthinking kind of energy. She can get super sensitive, and after we had a talk, I realised how much she was actually hurt and just emotionally drained and damaged. I was sad, and angry that it happened to her, because she didn't deserve it. But on the other hand, she can be reallyyyy impulsive and insensitive and kind of emotionally manipulative, so that it hurts other people. So why am I writing this? I don't know. The latest thing that's been bothering me, is actually very trivial, but has repeated itself in all shapes and sizes, is this: We are, right now, in the middle of our final exams in college (idk if that's the right expression I'm not american/english). Few days ago, we went out and talked how we're not gonna go out, how we have to study etc. And then, the next day, she calls me because she needed me (and she did and I was fine with that, I was glad she called me). The next day, I was heading home from my final exam and wanted to kind of chill a bit, so I called her and we hanged out. Then she calls me the next day, which I honestly didn't expect her to, since she was supposed to go somewhere for the weekend, and also because we hung out three days in a row and I thought she'd know that I can't go because I've told her that I need to stay home many times. She says she's home alone and like come over and all, and I'm really fucking tired and honestly, had other priorities that needed to be done. I told her maybe later, i have to see blah blah, and then we text later and I find out that around 8 she's going out with another friend. And I'm like cool, I tell her I'm not gonna come since it's gonna be late and I don't feel like hanging out with other people. I was just kind of tired, and I felt bad for not going out with her but, I thought it didn't matter since we saw each other yesterday and the day before and before, right? And she was gonna hang with someone else. Well, she posts a story how this is the one time she stayed in her dad's house and noone would hang with her. (over the day, bc she did go out at 8pm). And I feel kind of stupid, since she knows I have to study (so does she) yet she's acting like I did something so wrong to her. That was yesterday and we hadn't talked since then. I have mixed feelings, since I know she can get in these kinds of manic states and all, but sometimes, I wonder If she is the same girl I once knew and was really close to. I don't think it's just because of the things that happened, she was also in a different environment for 4 years, and she had to adapt. I went in a different direction, and I try to better myself and become the best version of myself that I can be, and I fear that both of us changing is going to end up separating us once and for all. Obviously this isn't the biggest problem that ever happened, there are a lot of issues that happened (mostly in the last 3 years), basically because she was insensitive and self absorbed at times. These types of little things happen from time to time, and this one was just the latest. I know this is really long, but honestly if anyone can tell me anything remotely helpful, I'd be very grateful. (how I should act, If I should be more empathetic, if im doing something wrong or whatever you think) if you read the whole thing type an emoji so I know ure a real one",07Jun2020,1
973,"I want to start a youtube channel where I play piano, but I can't think of any ideas. Almost all the piano channels I see involve people just playing popular pop-culture/classical songs on piano. I also want to play piano pieces, but I want to do it in a way that is different

I play at a very advanced level, but I don't think that is enough to make me stand out. I can't compose pieces. I can't do anything that involves me leaving my house. 

I know this is a strange request, but I'd love it if someone could help me out. 

I was thinking that maybe there is an online program that could create sheet music for non-piano music. Maybe it could make music that requires 2-3 pianos -&gt; I could learn each of the parts separately and combine them together to make something interesting. But, I don't know if that is possible and I also want to have fun playing -&gt; I don't think that learning 3 parts that don't sound good alone for one piece would be a pleasant experience.

What are some ideas that you have?

Hey guys,

So I’ve been chatting to a friend over Facebook last week exchanging messages about how were both doing during this vi rus. Unfortunately, I’ve had quite a difficult (and busy week) - I’ve needed to travel quite a bit and then from Thurs I slipped up and have been in hospital :/

All better now, and discharged today - I’m back at home. I really want to keep up the convo with them, but worry it’s a bit awkward after an 8 day gap. Note, I am an aspie so may be worrying more than I need to about this...

Tl;dr - please could you advise me on an opening sentence for my reply to their message to pick up the convo again? One that sort of explains my absence in a casual way. Thanks! :)

I've attached the last message they sent me (8 days ago) below. Please help me with ideas as to how to respond to this message to keep the conversation going. I struggle a lot with written messages! COULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME THINK OF A QUESTION TO ASK IN MY RESPONSE TO KEEP THE CHAT GOING?

""Yeah there's a really nice park only about 10 mins walk away from me, though it is getting quite busy at the moment and getting quite hard to social distance there just because of the number of people walking around. The park you go to sounds nice - is there a lake that people swim in? The dancing is going well, it's not so much that the pace is slow, but I just can't really learn a lot more as really the best thing I can do to improve my dancing is to 'listen' to my lead through the movement which is obviously impossible since I don't have a dance partner. Haha how long is your hair at the moment? Have you thought about getting someone to cut it for you? I cut my boyfriend's hair a little while ago and it took about 2 hours but he was actually really pleased with how it went (and I was relieved haha). I have never done pilates but it does sound similar to the flexibility - I paid for a 4-week long flexibility yoga class that I do every sunday on zoom and then stretching by myself every day, the goal is that hopefully by the end i should be able to do the splits! Although I think it will likely take me a bit longer than that as I'm not very flexible.""",07Jun2020,1
975,"I have a friend on discord and we haven't talked in a while, she's usually the one starting the convo and I want to talk to her more but don't know how to do it naturally. If anyone can pm me so I can describe more in-depth about our relationship. Thank You in advance!",07Jun2020,1
976,"So my elder sister thinks she has the right to use or take whatever she likes from my bedroom, use my bedroom however she feels, takes my clothes, shoes, makeup, products whatever she feels like. I’ve repeated told her not to but whenever I do it ends up in a fight and she just gets mad and heads over to her own house (she lives with her husband). I really don’t like people using my stuff without my permission or misusing my stuff. I’m beyond frustrated because I’ve done everything I’ve spoken to my mom about it which just caused a fight. It’s come to the point that I now have to hide my clothes, shoes, makeup and skin care products but whenever she finds my hiding place it’s the same thing all over again, being unemployed I’m basically living off whatever my parents give me so I’m extra protective. I don’t know what to do I’m beyond annoyed and pissed.",07Jun2020,1
977,"I haven’t had friends in about a year now. I used to have the most amazing two friends but I isolated myself and pushed them away due to depression. I felt like I didn’t deserve them, and that they would be better off without my negativity and sadness. 

I’m hesitant on reconnecting with those friends because I know they don’t care about me anymore. They’ve made new friends that are much better than I am. And even if I did reconnect with them we would all be going to different colleges in just two years, so what’s the point? 

If I make new friends they would probably get tired of me of dealing with me, and if they didn’t, that friendship would still end once we are done with high school. 

I just don’t see any point in having friends. Friendships always end and I end up alone. At the same time, it’s hard. It’s hard to be alone.",07Jun2020,1
978,"I finished my first year of a 2 year master program this may. was suppose to go to LA for a summer internship and that and everything got canceled with COVID. I have always wanted to move to the West Coast. I have been living with my parents since March in a town outside of Washington, DC.

My program is in UX design- something kinda avant garde and most people dont have a degree in it. I was very unhappy in my program- didnt really vibe with the students, felt like I was doing mostly self teaching, and HATED the town it was in ( I small town in rural virginia). I was very lonely and kinda happy classes got moved to remote.

The more the fall is approaching- the more I dread going back. I was so unhappy and still feel very stuck in life. Im 25 and feel very behind in life- never had a serious boyfriend and havent lived in a vig city yet. I havent told my parent I dont want to go back- im scared. But after covid- all I wanna do is pack and move to LA and finally do something I want to do. I dont know if Im being irrational or what. I think loneliness is starting to really bother me and feel like I cant keep wasting time living in places I dont want to be in.",07Jun2020,1
979,"A lot of time in lock-down inside my own head has given me a lot of time to self reflect and think about who I am as a person. I've always worried about past mistakes and felt guilty for both trivial and large things, but recently it's gotten to the point I'm crying and hating myself over who I used to be and the things I've done in the past

Obviously I'm not talking about murder, but I've done some shitty things and hurt peoples' feelings in the past, and I'm really starting to doubt as to how much of a good person I actually am. Every time I have ever hurt or upset someone is coming back to flood me and I'm regretting and hurting over every single instance. 

I've grown a lot in the past 6 months, and had a lot of revelations in terms of experiences and relationships, of which I'm extremely grateful for, but for some reason I just CANNOT move past these past mistakes and the person I used to be. The feelings of guilt, regret and just pure sadness haunt me every day and it's making it very hard to grow further as a person

So I've come here to ask for any advice on how I can move past this and just allow myself to grow. 

Thank you x",07Jun2020,1
980,"So I’m 19 year old introverted guy and during all of these 19 years I couldn’t get a single true friend. I thought I had a best friend in middle school, but first year of high school he just started ignoring me. Then two years passed and I believed that I have found another “Best friend”, just to get “backstabbed” by him. Many people I met outside my country told me that I’m very good at approaching people and improving mood for those that are sad. But I’m just desperately bad and creating a lasting friendship with anyone. I’m athletic, 6’2 (188cm) teen that can speak 3 languages and know many things from all kinds of areas, so I can keep a conversation about anything (or at least try to) and I believe I’m not ugly. My sister and mom told me that all of this will change in university... But sometimes I think the problem is me...I don’t have a SINGLE friend... Only people who I occasionally played video games or ones who want to get something from me (my family is comfortable, but we are very low key). Dear redditors, how can I improve my self?

P.S I’m not sarcastic and I try to compliment people so they would feel comfortable around me.",07Jun2020,1
981,"When I was in elementary school, I suddenly started becoming painfully aware of how toxic my house was and how much my parents argued and tried getting me to choose sides.

So I soon developed an imaginary friend whom I first only thought of as I struggled to fall asleep at night over the sounds of destruction taking place just outside my room.

However, as time passed, I gradually started creating more vivid description of said imaginary friend, we went on adventures together, we talked and played, etc... and without even realising, this imaginary friend became a very real and secret part of my life.

Now, I'm sixteen and my parents issues are resolved, they're more mature now and all that stuff... But I still can't stop having my imaginary friend and involving him in all my activities (for example, any event that happens to me in my life, I imagine later all the same except with him being there this time around and how it would've changed it)

I believe that this is really affecting various aspects of my life, such as my ability to accept real people and their flaws since I have that perfect person with me always.

But no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to be capable of removing him from my thoughts, I feel like all the memories that took place in my mind are just as real as memories that actually happened and it frustrates me at times that he can't just be real.

So if anyone had an imaginary friend or has one as a grown up, how do you deal with it or how did you get rid of it or how did you come to love living your life with it?",07Jun2020,1
982,"So my husband and I were having a lazy Sunday. He wouldn’t let me have an afternoon nap and was blowing air in my face/ear. After I stayed awake, he was doing it our dog who was annoyed (presuming because the pup kept whining). At one point I asked him to stop and told it is annoying, he wouldn’t agree so I started blowing air on his face and right through him laughing and mockingly directing me to different regions on his face suddenly spit on my face because apparently “I spit on him while I excitedly was blowing air on him” which he knows was accidental even if it did happen. 
I couldn’t control my tears. I started sobbing uncontrollably. Our dog was shivering because of the tension in the room (he is an adopted shelter dog so gets anxious during such times). 
I stood up to go have a shower and our pup followed and he was scared, visibly but my husband wouldn’t let him into the bathroom with me, so I return to the bedroom. 
I sit and I’m crying with one leg cradling our pup. 
He “loudly” explains why he spit and not apologize and tells me if I have such problem we should go back home (we are away from our home country). Loudly asks me to book the flight tickets to which I respond “I won’t, if you want to, you can.”, he yells again, “we do this equally, my money, your phone, do it”, to which I reply, “what will you do if I don’t?” (Only meant what are the repercussions if I don’t do what he said) and he called me a bitch and went on and on about how I’m trying to make him look abusive and how me crying will not make this an abusive situation and I can save this for the court and how we are different where him explaining and fighting for a situation is making me cry and this cannot be fixed which is why we should go back home where he can go back to his people and me to mine. I didn’t utter a word, just kept crying because I couldn’t stop hurting. 
He doesn’t think his reaction was wrong, wouldn’t apologize. What do I do? 

PS: He has anger issues, he’s agreed to it too. I had a boundary set that even if we fight he cannot talk about separation, instead find solutions/truce and make it work but this is the 3rd or 4th time he is crossing it.

983,"So this is an account I use to lurk and I’m also on mobile so please stay with me here.
I’ve been sleeping with my best friend (we’ll call him Maxwell) for quite a few months after I had gotten out of a relationship with my ex, who’s also my son’s father. We’ll call this ex Cam for anonymity obviously.
Maxwell is also good friends with Cam, because we all just joined friend groups. After Cam and I split, Maxwell and I started having sex together and I was sleeping with him in his room every night. All of our friends who come over never questioned it because Maxwell and I have always been really close except Cam who HATED it, and wanted me to come back and sleep in our old room because we had a child together. I didn’t, and he eventually started going through Maxwell’s room when we were absent (our friends just walk in Maxwell’s house to chill at this point, they all have keys) and stealing our sex toys and HIDING them in the basement and closets of the house. He later went to say I was an “unfit parent” (I’m the one with a job, I also still pay his rent and phone bill) due to this I’d assume and took our son and ran off to his mother’s with all proof that he was mine and said I couldn’t have him back. Eventually I get my son back but it made Maxwell and I stop trusting him entirely. Telling Cam or anyone about our current situation and feelings toward each other were off the table now.
Fast forward some and my period is late even while I was using birth control. I took a pregnancy test and it was positive. I told Maxwell this later that night and he panicked. Him and I both want the child but due to our situation with my scary ex and him being afraid he can’t care for a child he urged me to get an abortion. I said okay, and I’ve been saving up for it best I can because it’s $550 at the clinic and my insurance doesn’t cover any so it’s all out of pocket. He’s been bugging me about when I’m gonna have the money to get it for a bit but he has $7,000 in his account just for the hell of it and hasn’t offered to help pay any. It’s really hard on me. I’ve been so nauseous and sick that my boss has been sending me home from work and it’s difficult. Maxwell doesn’t want me telling anyone so only him and my sister know what’s going on.
I’m stressed, I’m scared, I don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to find comfort and I’m running mad. Does anyone have any advice at all?",07Jun2020,1

Anyhow I just found out she is racist now due to being traumatized by Black men who robbed her home and shot her stepdad. She is also married to a cop. She lives in the south too

She said today that

 “Blacks are aggressive. I will always be afraid of Black men. And look at where they live. And they live how they do because they’re like that.”  

When I tried to explain 4 Black men do not represent a whole race and that it’s racist to look at them like this she said 

 “Yeah but they always give cops issues. And I have Black friends who i love. But I just still keep my gaurd up. But I have moved past my trauma. So I’m always nice to Blacks” 

She made no sense.
I just told her that her traumatic experience has made her this way but that her fears aren’t based in reality. She just thumbed up my message and didn’t reply.

988,"I had an ipod nano with a broken screen that still worked and gave it to my exgirl while we were still together. After a while she stopped using it and put it away. While we would exercise together she never seemed to use it anymore.

I told her of she was sure, she said yeah take it. 
So after a while i checked to see how much it was to fix it and it was almost the same to buy a new used one. I decided to fix it myself and buy the replacement screen.

So fastforward after my exgirl and I broke up we started only hanging out as friends and would go running once in a while.

I told her i bought a new screen and did it myself; but after I told her how much it was to replace it ""$12USD"" she then told me afterwards that i gave it to her and it was supposed to be hers. I told her she gave it back to me and i fixed it for myself. She was upset and said it was a gift to her but now she wanted it because of the new screen.

989,"I'm incredibly anxious so there may be some grammar errors I try and proof read it. It's quite long heh but I really need help, hope I posted this on the right subreddit. 

So I noticed I got a tooth ache that I can feel to my jaw (not my whole jaw just right where the tooth is) I got a temporary fix for it but haven't been able to go back to my dentist for the permanent fix cause of Covid, now I have the tooth ache, i'm terrified of the dentist I know I have to go there and get it fixed sooner or later which gives me alot of anxiety. I already know I had a cavity that went down to the tip of the nerve (the dentist put medication there with a temporary seal or something) I haven't been perfect with brushing everyday and suspect it have gotten worse now which just makes me 10× more anxious. The toothache comes when I eat certain stuff and disappear completely after a while. 

How do I handle the situation and relieve my anxiety I tried to just tell myself I need to do it there's no point in being anxious but that just made me more anxious. 
I want to get some kind of sedative and pain meds so I won't be too aware of it when I go to the dentist but I don't know if that's possible I wanna ask my mom (I'm 15f so mom handles my appointments still) but can't bring myself to talk to her because then it's gets real I guess but I know I have to tell her sooner rather than later. 

What should I do? I know i'm overreacting a lot but can't help it my anxiety is just overwhelming. 

I know this is extremely bad but can I self medicate with Naproxen (I have Miranax 500mg prescription (I take one half so really 250mg) for period cramps but don't need it anymore as I started with birth control) can I take the whole dose of 500 mg at once without causing harm before I go to the dentist if I can't get sedatives and pain meds at the dentist? 
I accidentally took 500 mg before (didn't know you had to wait 12 hours before taking the other half I only waited 6 hours) and didn't feel any side effects.

Asking medical advice online is not the smartest but can't exactly ask a doctor. 

If I'm completely irrational right now please feel free to tell me nicely but straight up, again writing this while being in the middle of severe anxiety so not exactly thinking straight. 

How should I handle this? Is my tooth problem as severe as my anxiety seem to think or am i overreacting with that too? It hurt when the dentist did that temporary thing I'm scared it's going to hurt even worse now (severe needle phobia as well do I don't that numbing stuff they give you) and I just can't bring myself to go. I feel on the verge of tears and have like 7/10 anxiety just thinking about it. My mom do not know the extent of my anxiety so probably have to open up to her about that when I ask if I can get sedatives, i trust her but I just think it's really hard to tell people I'm close to about my problems it's easier with strangers for some reason🤷‍♀️.  I'm sorry if this is hard to read I just wrote down what's on my mind and I honestly can't make sense of it my self any advice and help is greatly appreciated.

990,"One of my weaknesses has been feeling a little intimidated and frustrated by colleagues that seem very resistant to change and set in their ways, as I am very passionate about creativity and thinking outside of the box. I overcame that by making a special effort to get to know these people, to put myself into situations where I’d be working closely with those people and have the opportunity to learn about their communication styles, their strengths and also to better understand what motivates them and makes them feel passionate about their work. This has made it easier to form working relationships with these colleagues as I have more insight into their perspective and what skills they are able to bring to the team. It even makes it easier to get them on board with new ideas, as I’m able to frame them in ways that appeal to their personal communication styles and motivations.",07Jun2020,1

I do not have real world experience but from I’ve been doing so far in college, I hate it. Is it boring and annoying in the real world just as much as it is in college? I am already too far in the degree to change my major and there is nothing out there that seems interesting enough for me to make that jump. The only thing I would genuinely enjoy is working with students, especially in schools that have students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. I would love to help those students because they usually are stuck in schools that have bad funding which creates large achievement gaps.

993,"Idk how to write this but I'll just roll with it... Most examples or whatever are written from pre-lockdown viewpoint. Please read all, sorry if i ramble. It's not written in the most eloquent English ever, but it's a hastily written post.

I'm 14, and have recently (over the past four or five months) considered that I may have ADD/ADHD. I don't want to self diagnose but I'd like some advice on whether I should get myself checked out or whatever.

Okay so basics, trying to be concise(ish) here:

--some people say im quite bright. I used to perform very well and was a year above my age group, and was barred from going a year above due to me essentially being crap at socialising. Got bullied a ton, but was passionate about learning. Naive and a bit weird for my younger years

--i used to (and I guess I still do but maybe less so? I dunno, I'm more aware of other people than what I'm doing) talk a lot when I'm at school or somewhere. I'm always doing something, whether it be in my mind or fidgeting or whatever. I'm a distraction in class and struggle to complete work and hand it in on time even though I am more than capable of completing it(more so online school and homework,in lessons I don't have to write my own routine). I distract other people but this does not affect my personal progress(in proper school, I get good grades with attainment but not with effort). I don't do it for attention, I try to stop myself but I do very much struggle with keeping my mouth shut and not coming up with some stupid comment or off topic question or theory

--i hate boredom and repetition, so I get stuck into new projects often. By this, I mean im literally doing loads of side projects and courses right now but am only really doing well in one, this hacking thing I'm doing, which is fun because I can problem solve, which I think I'm decent at, dunno, I'm quite logical but not that good at programming, I prefer the getting-into-system penetration-testing kinda thing. Anyhow, i get really stuck into that and really focused, to the point where I neglect doing more important stuff like schoolwork. This frustrates me because I know I'm smart, but I don't get the grades I could get (straight 100%s) and instead score 20 or 10 percent lower in tests than I should. I sometimes miss questions, but the ones I do, I do well. On the topic of struggling with homework, I'll write an example from not too long ago:

I'll start work on a history poster. It should take an hour or so, but I'll spend ages flitting between jumbling with my Rubik's cube and doodling in a sketchpad, then making a paper aeroplane out of card and then realising that in fact, card is bad for paper aeroplanes because it's too weighty so I then end up down a path of Wikipedia pages about piloting and aviation and aircraft design. Then I take about 3 hours of this and end up with a very good piece of work that grades well. Only problem is I have like four other pieces of work I want to do this well on, so I get bogged own and stressed out.

--i tend to pick up a lot of details but I never really feel like I'm listening. I work well under pressure. When I'm focused, I'm focused. But I'm often not. I'm quite indecisive and go off task very easily.

--i struggle with sleeping, my brain feels like it doesn't stop going.

--i can't relax well, so I play shooter video games and mess around on my laptop a lot exploring old exploitable software on virtual machines. Fiddling basically, but with added entertainment.

--idk what else to really say. I'm not withdrawn and am very outgoing, talk a lot of random crap at school but one on one I appreciate silence and thoughtfulness. I'm impulsive, but not to the extent that I've screwed up too badly, the odd detention or telling off may be in place but I'm not a 'problem child' in the impulsiveness department. I guess i don't outwardly fit the stereotype toooo much (but certainly do in some respects) and was put off considering this idea by the fact that this hasn't been touched on too much in childhood. I've never been a constant mover, but I was a constant talker and as I said before, brain always churning out ideas and scenarios and wacky stories.

--i did a few online tests and scored very highly, but they're probably stupid and have a big element of bias based on the test takers mood or surroundings. I think they're bs, but thought I should include in this post

--i get unexplainably emotional sometimes, especially when I'm bored. I can sometimes get very anxious to the point of not wanting to turn up to a(n online) lesson.

That's about it, I've probably missed something important but yeah, it is what it is. I would really appreciate any advice or thoughts you have on whether I should take action on my suspicions. I've done a bit of research and especially ADD makes me think: oh, that's sounds like me. I mean, some of this could be unrelated because I experienced a very harsh time at my old school and likely have trust issues and I certainly try to hide myself by dumbing myself down a lot of the time. Basically no self confidence, but I cover it up well. I've written too much, thanks for reading :)",07Jun2020,1
994,"I've had a rough last few months to a year... My(27M) wife cheated on me and we're going through a divorce, so I had to sell my house, I gave up the dog we had together because I'm not in a position to be able to have him. I moved in with my parents because I'm in tons of debt. I don't have any friends because I either pushed them away with my marriage/divorce or they're just moving on to bigger and better things: starting families, getting married, moved away, etc. I've been stuck at home for the past about 2 months working from home due to covid, and I don't know how to deal with all this shit. I'm working on paying down my debt to be about to afford to move out again, but I struggle every day with just getting up and doing anything. I used to love gaming, but it just bored me anymore, I had a group of online friends I used to chat with daily on voice chat on discord, but I just don't feel like it anymore. I'm growing tired of my job, but can't move to a new company because I took out a loan on my retirement plan and can't afford to pay it back. And I can't move within my company until November because I got a new position then. I'm also extremely overweight and have quit caring about my health. I tried going to a psychiatrist a few months ago, but she said what I was going through was normal for someone going to a divorce and so I got a ~200 bill from her for fucking nothing and haven't gone back. How do I care about life again? Why do you all get up every day? I'm not suicidal, I just don't feel like I have anything to live for and don't really care about anything anymore because I have no one in my life except my parents, who truly are great, but I need more.",07Jun2020,1
995,"I am a 50-ish year old transwoman, up until this point in my life I have been playing the role of a manly husband and father, keeping the trans part of me firmly in the closet. Lately, however, some things  have changed in major ways. I came out to my wife, and after a lot of therapy and talking and arguing and compromising, we agreed that we will stay best friends and co-habitate, but otherwise our marriage would be over. I didn't like the idea, but it was a way to keep the woman that I love in my life, and it seems like it could work.

She and I have three children, a son who is about to turn 16, and two daughters, 14 and 13. Each child and I have great relationships, my son loves that I play football and go to MLB and NCAA games, and that he has another man in the house to look up to. My daughters love me dearly, especially our youngest one, who still wants to hug me in public and fights to sit next to me anywhere we go. All three have great hearts and sharp minds, and have heard my wife and I say over and over again that everyone should have an open mind, that everyone deserves to be respected, that it is perfectly okay for someone to love a person of the same or opposite sex, and everyone's gender identity should be respected.

My plan had been to stay in the closet the rest of my life - we all know people who stay in the closet and have good lives. Every couple of months I'd go off to a trans conference and spend a weekend as my female self, and I figured that would be enough to tide me over. It was a little harder to fight those feelings day after day, but I thought I was doing a good job.

Until this past week. I realized that I can no longer live a half-life, but that I can never actually live my authentic life, and the only choice I had was suicide. I attempted to kill myself twice in the course of a week and had plans to try a third time. I realized I was a danger to myself and checked myself in to a behavioral health inpatient facility for a week, and am back home now. I'm no longer suicidal, but I have those same conflicting thoughts going through my head.

My wife and therapists at the inpatient facility all feel like I need to come out to our children, and then allow myself to start transitioning - they have said my life depends on it. But I can't see how I can do that to my kids - how can I take their father away from them, ruin the image that they have of me, all for selfishly wanting to be my ""authentic self.""

My question, Reddit, is a simple one: am I being horribly selfish by even considering coming out to the kids and transitioning?",07Jun2020,1

I enjoy few things and I've tried new things but I'm just not really that interested, yes I'm aware there is still more to try but honestly is there even a point anymore. I can stay dedicated to things like reading and writing which I do enjoy, but when it comes to other things I just can't get into them, everything just seems so boring and unappealing. I've got some educational books sitting at my desk; Psychology, writing, fear is fuel and even one on alchemy (for the philosophy) but I really don't know. I want to become smarter in life and I somehow actually have a passion for learning new things (also tried an instrument) but again it all seems so boring. It wasn't because I wasn't succeeding in any of them, I did pretty well with music and I did quite well with my art for a period, tried picking it up again and decided it wasn't for me. I've even tried doing a dopamine detox and that didn't really help. So it isn't fear of failing, I'm actually pretty optimistic when it comes to learning usually but the passion for things just doesn't seem to exist anymore. I've tried doing so many things and tried to pick up new skills. I'm apparently ""the smart one"" in the family and I assume being raised that way puts a lot of pressure on me to actually be smart, but it's overwhelming when nothing in the world is interesting to me. I don't really know, It probably sounds like I've contradicted myself a lot in here huh?

998,"I will exclude names and towns for sake of anonymity.

Where to start?

My grandparents separately are millionaires, have 80+ acres of forested land, and a nice 3 story house he built himself. They've told me many times, so long as I'm a good, contributing member of society(basically keeping them happy, fitting a cookie cutter mold), then all of that would be inherited by me.

I(21m) am currently living with my grandparents who are fully supporting me financially. Last summer they told me if I moved in with them(2 states and 4.5 hours away from home), then they would pay for my college and support me while I'm here. 

They are hardcore conservatives and I'm hardcore not. They disowned and excommunicated my mother for being lesbian. They had only started talking to her again because I came into the picture. When she passed two years ago to COPD, they became against smoking. They also disowned my uncle(mother side) because he was kicked out of college due to partying and drinking, so they're also been very against drugs.

So I'm living here as a closeted gay man, who smokes cigarettes, vape, and cannabis(all undetected by them for a year so far) though I usually leave the house when I can to do so.

It feels like I'm still a 14 year old kid who has to ask permission or cant do anything. Everytime either of them say anything, I start getting angry (though I never show it) and offended. They often remind me, though probably unintentionally, how much of a hold they have on me financially. They constantly berate my passed mother. He always talks to me like I'm 5 and over explains everything, no matter how simple it is, and is always repeating himself, even multiple times in the same conversation. He has gotten where hell start yelling and gets pissed at the smallest things, and then completely does a 180° 2 minutes later, acting like nothing just happened.

It's a nightmare living here, but it's getting me free college and potentially a good inheritance later.

Back home, I had moved in with my half sister and her step mom about 3 years ago. When my sister had her child, I moved into the garage, giving my his own room for his parents sake. At was fine until I moved here; I had more privacy, about the same room size, and I could come and go from the house as I pleased without disturbing any of the rest of the house. This was nice working a job where I would be called to work at any time, literally. 

When I moved here, my sister and company let some friends move into my old room/garage for a bit to get back on their feet. In the 4-5 months they were there, they completely trashed the room, broke a lot of things, left burn holes and scratches all over the dresser my great grandfather built for my mother when she was a child 45 years ago, and ruined a lot of my clothing and electronics I left there as safe keeping.

Now when I go back home to visit, I hate the feeling of being there, like I'm not wanted, even though everyone always wants me to come back and constantly wish I was there. 

I'm seeking advice on whether I should 'stay here to finish college and still have the chance of the inheritance' or 'leave and go back home'.

Staying means dealing with the enormous levels of stress and discomfort. Leaving means burning the bridges here to a guaranteed degree and inheritance.

TL:DR

Should I
Stay here and deal with loads of stress now and years of playing a long game to get a free college degree and a multi million dollar inheritance 
OR
Leave, burn those bridges, have a better life now but have to work for everything myself?

More stress now for an easier life way down the road
Or
Little to no stress now for a life I'll have to build myself",07Jun2020,1
999,"I'll try and keep this short. 

There is this girl who took quite a strong liking to me about a year a go. We have many mutual friends, and I would frequently see her at parties or in night clubs. This girl frequently gets paralytic, and on multiple occassions in this state she has sexually harassed me. 

The first time it happened she approached me and began grinding/dancing on me. I wasn't really into it and I told her but she was so drunk she wasn't really paying attention. She then grabbed my face and began kissing me in front of everyone. I was embarrassed and I felt so uncomfortable as I was not attracted to her in that way. She would not leave me alone all night even though I continuously refused her advances. This then resulted in me being teased by my friends, with them calling me a pussy etc. as they were saying this girl was 'hot', which further added to the embarassment and discomfort.

Since then, it got worse. I don't want to go into much detail but on one occassion, she waited for me to leave the room to go to the toilet and she cornered me, forcing her hands down my trousers and grabbing my junk. I told her to get off and that I wasn't interested.  After this event I told my friends, and who told hers, and now she has stopped harassing me out of embarassment I think.

I'm finding it very difficult to cope with. Being in those situations where she was harassing me infront of loads of people, especially my friends, made me feel helpless and are some of the most uncomfortable situations I've been in in my life. I feel like no one is going to understand how I feel. I've also noticed a huge drop off in my libido which was otherwise healthy before this began, struggling to get attracted to women.

Has anyone got any advice on this.",07Jun2020,1

1001,"Since I was around 4 and he 11, my brother (I don't know want to call him that but for context and because I don't know what to call him) has been sexually abusing me. I knew, the first time it happened, that I felt bad, I felt wrong about it. The very next day I told my mother in what vocabulary and understanding I had, I told her that he removed my clothes and touched me and I don't feel good. She just shrugged and laughed it off as I don't know what. It continued throughout years, when he was 15, when he was 16 or 24 or 27, when he was home or when he went to college, found his own place and came to visit, It did not change. He used to beat me up a lot too and made me take blame for so many things he was responsible for, in front of our parents. I simply did not feel safe.
It wasn't a very stable household to begin with, my father used to beat my mother and us on anything and everything. I has changed now significantly. But I never felt safe or comfortable about voicing it throughout years. There are many more things about this family that I won't get into, I don't want to remember that much trauma.
This march, while having a conversation with my mother and him, he just started getting on my nerve about when I'll be getting a job. And that he's disappointed in me for attempting suicide again and not thinking of the family. (I had quit my masters in last semester with just one class left, just a month ago because of repeated bullying over the last 5 years and a case of physical assault because of me being gay/queer, which authorities refused to address and did not even give me any time to heal, I developed PTSD, panic attacks and I have bipolar disorder. I attempted suicide several times and after this time I felt like I had to quit to get back some sense of safety) Something just snapped in me then while being told I should be responsible about it, I blurted out in front of my mother that it was because of him that I was feeling this way, that he took my sense of safety and joy, that he made me feel like I had to shed all personality or emotions when I was around anyone from the age of 4 when he started sexually abusing me. I was visibly angry so I did the responsible thing and left the room. After a while I heard my mother ask him if he was okay, that he shouldn't be bothered because I was angry.
He left that day. It's been lockdown since then, he's not been home since. My parents have been much more cruel with me emotionally and verbally. Among many other things they make a point to say every few days I'm making them choose between their children. I don't think I'm the one they are choosing to choose, I'm not the one who they talk to every other day on phone laughing, I'm not the one who's well being they are worried about.

This was the context.
Just about an hour ago he sent me an email (I blocked him everywhere else) -

""I'm sorry kiddo. I really had no idea what had been going on and why I did what I did. I can't ever make up for it if you will not lemme try. I have missed you a lot. Everyday. But I couldn't message or call cause I wanted to make sure and realise that I can change and I can. Please! Allow me to come back. This life doesn't seem like a life without you. I am sorry!""

A part of me wants to reply with - No, I do mot want to talk to you, I don't want you in my life. I can never know what I lost, what or who I could have been, what I could have achieved, you robbed me of my life. Never contact me again.

So should I?

P.S.- I know I should get away from this household and family ASAP. But I'm not currently capable of financially or emotionally, especially when I've lost access to my meds. It's difficult even living rn, I will get to surviving, then maybe to thriving some day. But I can't loose a roof over my head currently, my mental state isn't proper.",07Jun2020,1

1003,"last October, my mom (52f) had an online affair and the person ended up saying shitty stuff to her, she’s fallen in a state of depression. Growing up, she was really manipulative, controlling, constantly yelling for no reason and saying hurtful things, amongst other stuff. I went to college 2 hrs away just to get away from her, but ended up transferring to a college in my hometown bc I missed my sisters and dad. 

Fast forward to now, I got a place of my own and have just graduated college. My mom is still struggling with depression and my dad came to me saying he doesn’t know how to help her anymore. He works 6/7 days a week from 6am-7pm and is constantly tired coming home from work. He has taken her to see a psychiatrist but the medication she’s been on has negatively affected her instead of helping her. My grandma (mom’s mom) moved into their house to make sure my mom is taken care of as well as my younger sisters. It’s gotten to a point where my sisters are also trying to help my mom by asking her to get out of bed, go outside with them, etc but she never does. 

The reason why I haven’t gotten involved with helping her get better is because I still have so much resentment towards her for the way she’s treated me and my siblings, and how much she’s hurt my dad. But I feel as though now I HAVE to intervene since nothing is working and my family doesn’t know what else to do. 

With me in the picture, I would help schedule appoints with her therapist and psychiatrist since my parents are Spanish speaking and have a hard time doing so in English. I would also come to their house once or twice a week to check in on her and everyone else. 

I worry that I’m risking my mental health putting my mom’s needs above my own, so I want to set boundaries with her to let her know I’m not doing this because I love or care for her, but so that she simply gets better. What do you think I should say?",07Jun2020,1

1019,"After buying a car where I live in Pennsylvania, I’ll save up around 15K in my bank account and drive to cali.

For over a year I’ve lived alone or with roommates while going to college, and it was great. However, I’m making a lot of money right now so college can wait a year or so while I enjoy the world. I have little to no relationship with my parents and I plan on barely keeping contact with them. I will be completely self reliant. For my entire life they’ve dealt with my Phone bill, Health Insurance, Car insurance, Dental, Taxes. For the past year I’ve easily covered rent while splurging on food and other fun things. I can figure out phone bill and car insurance, but what does a 19 year old know about health insurance, taxes, and dental. Please let me know if i’m missing something.

1. How do I find a good place to rent? How do I find good roommates? How do I find the right area in cali for me?

2. I’ll keep in contact with a few folks who returned the love I showed them. How do I meet people in cali and make friends? I won’t be going to college for the near future because I have a good income and I just want to enjoy the world for now. I’m open to anything. I love being active or just chilling. I love meeting people and good friends are all I need to be happy. I can be a social butterfly given a reasonable scenario.

3. Health insurance- where do I even start? I’ll tell my father who’s the one paying for it right now: i’m moving about 2500 miles away. Maybe i’ll tell him i’m going to cali, or maybe i’ll just say i’m traveling and I don’t know exactly where. Do I need a separate health insurance? Can i get my own for a reasonable cost? Do i need it? I don’t want to rely on my parents for anything.

4. Dental- is this separate from health insurance? My dad also covers this, what’s my next step.

5. I make a decent amount of money so I want to be able to live in a cool area. I’ll probably stay at an Airbnb at first to be able to quickly try out multiple areas easily. I’ll probably eventually pick a place where I’ll have roommates. This way I can maybe make some friends and save a couple bucks. It’s really important for me to be in a popular place with lots of things happening so I can always go out, enjoy life, and meet people.

The most important thing to me is people. I need friends to be happy, as any social animal. How can I meet people when I come there? I’m 19 and I have a scannable fake ID so I can go to bars and whatever.

I barely know anything about california or moving to a new state alone. Any input will be so appreciated.

1020,"I've known him for about 7 years and in that time we've spent a lot of time talking sometimes we'd talk on the phone for 3 hours sometimes and I'd always hang out with him in person when I could. We went through a lot of the same sort of issues with our home lives and we did generally talk about politics. To give it some better context, he's actually a really talented artist/musician who hasn't really had a lot of success since he has to look after his father in late stage Dementia, the relationship with his other family is practically non-existent and his mother has her own mental issues and is/has been rather spiteful to the guy in the past. Not to mention he has had nothing but bad relationships with women and can be quite misogynistic - I wonder if he himself actually has a personality disorder.

He was always somewhat conspiratorial but it was never that harmful but since Lockdown this guy has been going absolutely mad, posting 20/30 links in a really short time frame and then posting more when he saw that I had seen the messages. I would wake up every morning to a large wall of text-ranting that he's sent me and if I didn't respond because I was doing other things he'd somewhat get angry about it. 

I've made an honest attempt to sit and go through the information and there's some interesting topics, like for example media manipulation and oligarchs hoarding resources since they've been making money and exploiting people through this pandemic. But a lot of it has some really nasty/antisemitic overtones and other racist connotations (we're both black to give it some better context). So I'm at a bit of a crossroads, on the one hand this guy's views on a lot of things are frustrating and at times I really feel bad for how his life turned out. 

I think I have three options:

A) Block him straight away and just move on since he can be aggressive

B) Try to find a way of challenging him in a way that is not too confrontational, if so how?

C) Just gradually phase him out like I kind of done already, I had to switch my notifications for him off and restrict his account so that he can't see that I've read his messages. 

Any advice?",07Jun2020,1
1022,"Over the last few days I've had to pay 3k in hospital fees for one of my cats which has really been taking a toll on me mentally and financially. And it breaks my heart being told that I'm dumb for spending so much money on a cat when I can always just get another one or just have this one put down... :(

I love my cats and would hate to have any of them put down due to finances. Luckily due to having money saved up for my tuition this year and some money I planned on using on building a beast computer but I've been hesitating. I was able to afford this, yet it's not over since I was told he might have to get surgery which will add more to the money I've spent.

And I totally understand that money comes and goes and that I should be fine due to the money that I've saved up while going to school and work both full-time. Not to mention that I have benefits and financial aid which brings relieve and I'm hoping to land myself a software engineering position before the year ends. Which brings me relieve to the situation.

A little backstory 
Long story short my cat had pee in his blood so I took him to the hospital after spending about an hour going from place to place finding out that the wait time had changed a minute before I had gotten there to eventually calling another place and being told that I was good to come in. To waiting an hour before they came to take in my cat. Then waiting an additional three hours with calls in-between every hour being told he was close to being checked. Now I totally understand that they get busy and I respect that. 

Just adding this since it was a really crappy day for me and the last thing I wanna do is go spend 5-6 hours trying to get my cat get help. I had a long shift the night before getting off at midnight and not getting much sleep. 

Later had to leave due to work. Eventually my cat was sent home with medication and a special diet which he has to be on for the rest of his life due to the UTI. He was doing well the next morning until he started straining to pee in the afternoon which had me really worried so I had to take him back. Got told that he was blocked and would have to spend some time there and got charged a bit over 2k. 

Now my cat has a brother and it would break my heart to have my other cat lose his brother due to money. Especially when they're both about a year old. Also, I had to put down my older cat in March due to her being in a traffic incident which was disheartening. So I wouldn't want this to happen again and now because of silly money. Especially when I would've spent it on dumb stuff or tuition. 

I don't think I've made any wrong decisions here knowing that I'll be fine financially. But being told I have really hurts and makes me sad when I obviously don't like the idea of spending so much on something unavoidable or that I wouldn't like spending my money on. I feel really dumb for writing this and questioning my decisions.

1029,"Hi all, 

I'll make it short. When I was 18 I started dating this girl (25) who had 2 kids from a different man who was a deadbeat. We dated on ans off for a year, until finally at 19 the kids wanted a father and I agreed. Between this time and mw turning 20 and shipping off to boot camp, she cheated on me several times, then cheated on me again while I was in bootcamp, and we stayed together until to better part of the next year, were I know she was involved sexually with at least one other person while I was deployed. At this point she doesnt want to talk or have anything to do with me, she just wants money every month foe the kids (who I obviously cant see because I'm deployed). 

I can't help but to feel I got reeled in by a cougar just wanting some financial and emotional support, because she always cheated and the entire relationship was abusive (she would try to kill herself if we argued, she threw hot coffee at me, hit me, tried to steal my social security card, etc). 

I feel like I've been completely cucked into parenting these kids and she holds them over my head financially to support. What's your thoughts?",07Jun2020,1

1032,"Tldr at the end

This girl who was my ex roommate at a different house, who ended up selling my stuff and owes me roughly $1500 and talks shit about me constantly, keeps coming over to my new house uninvited. Her husband is my husbands friend and we have told him repeatedly that she can't come at this point. I've tried to be reasonable and say they need to ask if she can come over each time and they would still come over anyways without asking. So it has escalated into her being banned from our house, except she *still keeps coming over.* Every time, I feel that nobody wants to tell her to leave so instead I leave.

Well, my house mates and husband do not want her around either because she is unpleasant to be around, has made it an issue to interrupt their boys night since she doesn't trust her husband, and also has started asking *my housemates* for money because she thinks we are rich for owning a house (even though it's a normal house, nothing extravagant and we *rent* to our friends for a reason). We explicitly told her husband that she can't come over and he said he wouldn't be able to come if she can't either. We said okay. He came anyways and said he would leave before she would come. He did not leave and she came *again* and I told her in private that she should leave and she started crying. She was crying because nobody wanted her here and even tried to get me to let her stay by listing off people she knew (who don't pick sides and respect our house rules and understand where we are coming from). Like I feel bad, I get it, it *sucks* that people don't want you around and I dont want to hurt her feelings and always be made out to be the bad guy but now it's everybody who lives here that doesn't want her here. I also didn't want to expose my house mates reasons for not wanting her around because I feel that it's not my responsibility to tell her how *they* feel. I felt guilty for her crying so I let her stay but it made everyone upset/uncomfortable. I also knew that she cried on purpose because she stopped crying as soon as I said she could stay. I plan on meeting up with her but I don't want to be friends with her and I have to tell her she can't come and her husband can't manipulate us like that or else he won't be able to come around either. 

How do I tell her that these are the rules of our house and they both need to respect them? We know her husband is also to blame but my husband and roommates are going to deal with him since he is their friend. I feel like she is blindsided by her husband and should hear it from me that it's not okay no matter what her husband says. Also, we don't care if she is around at other parties or events or whatever, just not at our house. 

Tldr; girl wants to come over to our house when we told her husband that she can't. She shows up anyways repeatedly and in a manipulative way gets to stay. How do we tell her nicely that she isn't welcome and if her husband keeps sneaking her in, they will both be banned?",07Jun2020,1
1033,"I have a job that requires to do office work and field work. For the field work, the place I work for hires people to take care of some of the tasks that my colleagues and me are not qualified to do. We were all (the workers, my colleagues and myself) staying at a hotel for about 3 weeks since the field work was away from the city we live in. I had never met any of the workers before. One of them was about my age and I noticed that he was trying to seduce me. After a couple days of working and hanging around all together, I decided to accept the offer of the guy in question to go get food and eat in his room with a glass wine. I accepted since I had a pretty good opinion of him after seeing him being very polite, decent, calm and composed, hardworking and not jugmental. He is not quite my type physically although I would not call him ugly at all, but his personnality is what really got me.   


Now, I am not stupid, I knew things would probably get physical going to his room to drink wine, but I never though that we would end up having sex. He seemed a bit nerdy and shy, so I though we would probably kiss and get handsy but stop there. I should say that I was telling myself that it was probably not a good idea to have sex with a worker hired by my workplace during our time away to work (even though the sex part happened on our time off of course). I don't think I can get fired for that, but I fear it would give me a bad reputation that I don't need. I work with people of all ages and from different backgrounds, and even though I believe a woman should be able to have the sexlife she desires without judgement, I now this point of view is not shared by everybody. And I really wonder if having sex with this guy, considering the circonstances, is not ethically correct and just not professionnal and would make me look bad in front of my bosses.... 

I asked the guy to keep this a secret and he found it very funny that I want to hide it. To him, it's not a problem at all and I am cray-cray to fear any sort of consequences for my job. I tried to explain to him that we are not from the same working field at all and that he has to consider that I am a woman and these kind of situations are always worst for the women. I regret having sex with him now, because I cannot stop stressing about my workplace to find out, specially after the guy confessed to me that he told 3 of his friends. The guy and his 3 friends are from a very small city where one my colleague is from. You know, the kind of place where everyone knows everyone... We kept in touch and over time I discovered that he can lie here and there or select which parts of a story to hide if he feels like it's better for him to not tell.... So, I don't even know if I can trust that he told only 3 people what happened...

I am very disapointed by him telling his friends, since I asked him to keep it secret. I also explained to him how much I have worked my ass off the past 10+ years to get the job I have today. I never thought he would be so eager to brag about having sex with a girl to his buddies that he wouldn't consider my situation. I would never have had sex with a douche who I knew couldn't be trusted so yeah I made the mistake to think a guy who clearly wanted to fuck me would be such a gentleman afterwards... I'm gonna die naive. I will never ever again do anything, sexual or not, that makes me question wether or not it can be a liability for my job.....

So now, what do you think? Did I shit where I eat? Do you think I would have to deal with the consequences of my actions if my workplace ever happen to know? Would I look unprofessionnal since he was someone hired to work for us? Or would that just be some gossip and that's all? What would you think if you were my boss?",07Jun2020,1

1041,"Hello Reddit! This will be kind of long- but I am in need of advice desperately so please bear with me. I (24F) graduated from a good college 2 years ago at this time. For one year I worked a basic sales job in my college town and did not make much money but I did it for fun because my brother moved to my college town for grad school so I decided to stay there again for one year. I was broke- I didn’t make much money, and about half of my paycheck went to rent (I know, I know). But I did create AMAZING memories and made tons of new friends so in my mind it was worth it. At that job, I met someone who introduced me to her mom, who got me a job working at a biotech company in SF. I moved to SF in September of last year. I made significantly more than my previous job, but rent in SF is so much higher. I did start to build up my savings more than usual though so that was nice. I also made a ton of new friends and had a lot of fun. I remember thinking to myself at one point I finally felt happy and satisfied with life. At the beginning of march I essentially moved back in with my parents due to COVID and I began to work from home because I could not work from home from my apartment in SF because I had no privacy. I don’t have a great relationship with my parents, so the past 3 months have been rough. On the weekends I am extremely unhappy and bored, usually I end up in tears because I realize that although I love my family, I do not enjoy living with them and it makes me feel guilty. BUT- the reason why I am writing this post is... I have saved up a significant amount of money while I have lived with my parents for the past 3 months. I would save so much more if I got rid of my apartment in SF and moved in with them full time. I am 24 years old and I feel like my savings is not much compared to other people my age and I constantly wonder if I should be in SF for the experiences and memories, or live with my parents for a while and although I will be unhappy, I will save a significant amount of money. At 24 did you just come to terms with being a broke 20-something and sucking it up and paying rent? My friends are also in the same position as I am but they are ok with most of their money going towards rent. I also don’t see myself in SF long term anyways, so I will probably move regardless in the next 3 years.",07Jun2020,1

1043,"I want to learn how to properly do this because of the amount of disinformation being spread around these days.

Specific example: My mom and I are on completely opposite sides of the political spectrum. I'm left wing and she's right wing. She sent me an article from the Houston Courant written by Michael P. Tremoglie on 5/31/2020 stating that: ""Officer Chauvin was not committing an act of murder but implementing a restraining technique. Indeed, he may have been trying to prevent Floyd from hurting himself.""

The article provides a link to the criminal complaint. I checked it out and everything brought over from it to the article seems to check out but there's an entire sentence completely devoid of proper spacing. I would expect an official government document to be proofread for mistakes such as this.

The article also provided the author's twitter. I checked it out and found that he retweeted something from an account with ""groyper"" in the name and Sen. Tom Cotton (who advocated for sending in active duty military to stop the riots) so this immediately makes me very suspicious of this article in the first place.

1047,"My gf told me that she was raped 7 months ago by the family she was living in on another country. She was not only raped but the rapist touched her 3 times during the next months. 

Me(18M) and my girlfriend(17F) has been in a relationship for almost 5 years and the last 2 years were spent LDR because she studies in another country. A lot of problems occured and she was forced to live alone with another family that the mother was a teacher in that school and all 2 daughters and 1 son also studied in that school.

She was raped by the son (M17) of the family and the worst part about this is that she thought of him as a friend other than her classmate. She wasn't able to resist because she was scared. I know this feeling of helplessness and shock when being raped because I also have experienced it and please don't tell me that she should have resisted.

The guy came inside her. She told her friend about it and then she took contraceptives and pregnancy tests. Thankfully, it was negative. They were the only ones who knew about it at this time

She also told me that the guy touched her 3 times in the duration of 4 months, but she won't let me talk to him because he doesn't want any more trouble. She still treats him as a friend because if people notice something's not right about them, they'll ask questions.

I kind of understand the reason why she hasn't told me about this. I think she doesn't want me to worry about her during her stay with the family and to think that she's safe. 

What should I do? It really pains and angers me to hear when she tells the details of the rape. She mostly doesn't want to tall about it and I respect that. The problem that I have is that she asked me not to talk or confront with her rapist. I want to respect her request, but I feel like I won""t be at peace not talking to her rapist. I have already calmed down and I just really want him to apologize for what he did and never do that again. I just want him to realize the pain she gave to my girlfriend. 

What should I do? She doesn't want to report it to the police because she wants out of the country ASAP after she graduated. Wouldn't it be wrong not to confront the rapist?",07Jun2020,1

1054,"I'm 14 years old. When I was 13, and for some time I was 14, I was dating a 15 year old boy. The relationship started off well, but quickly went downhill. I do NOT say this lightly, and I would never throw around terms like this loosely, but 1) I was very much in love with him, 2) He was very mentally and emotionally abusive, as stated by my friends for months before I broke up with him, and 3) He gave me PTSD, which I was diagnosed with when I went to a mental hospital. For about 10 months, we dated. At first he was normal, but he quickly displayed more and more red flags. Unfortunately, by this point I already cared about him very very much and once that became love, I just couldn't leave him no matter how much he hurt me. I told myself that he was trying to get better, that it wouldn't stay like this, that I had a duty to help him, that once we started seeing each other more it would get better, etc. He did many things to me, he made me think that he tried to 0D on pills, he would frequently lie to me or threaten me and when or if I called him out on doing shitty things to me, he'd flip out and tell me horrible things, that I was an awful girlfriend, that I made him want to kiII himself, etc. He'd also treaten me for nudes, saying he'd 0D if I didn't send, or that he'd kiII himself, or that he'd start sh-ing. He conditioned me not to argue with him, basically I knew that if I did it would only make it worse and I'd end up hurting from something else that I'd force myself to repress so I could make him happy. He also made me cut off multiple friends because he didn't like them. He'd lie to me about very tiny things and lose his shit if I pointed it out. I finally broke up with him because people, including adult friends I have, continued to tell me that he was abusive and that it would only get worse, and he told me, to quote him directly, that ""I could go die in a poorly dog hole where the stray dogs could find me and eat my rotting corpse."" It's been about a year and those words are still burned into my memory. After we broke up, he slandered me, made me out to be overemotional and dramatic. He also convinced me to stay in contact with him, convinced me to stay friends with him. Even after I broke up with him, I still was very much in love with him and was really vulnerable. I got sad and drunk almost every night, and he tried to get nudes from me while I was drunk. Then I cut him off. A month or so later, he texted me and told me he had cancer. I was so angry with him, because by this point I'd distanced myself from him and I was less emotionally involved, I could see just how manipulative and horrible he was. I told him that I hoped he died. He screenshotted it and sent it to all my friends, luckily all of them hated him and believed he deserved it. I know it's a terrible thing to wish upon someone but shit... for months after we broke up I flinched getting notifications, I'd get flashbacks to situations I was in with him, I'd randomly remember him and start crying, I was a wreck. I wish I had been smarter before I got involved with him, but I was young and naive. Also, something else important- he was lying about having cancer. He never admitted to it, but his friend told me that he didn't really have cancer, and he never spoke to me about it again. I'm not sure what his goal was in telling me that, probably to upset me and judge just how much I still cared about him. I know I said a horrible thing, no matter what he did to me, but honestly I don't regret it. In fact I wish he actually had cancer, then he'd hopefully die and never be able to hurt anyone again the same way he hurt me. I know he's an asshole but am I also one?

2. Going back to school in my early 30's sacrifices my chance of getting married or having a child. 
3. If I graduate at 33 it will take me until I'm 40 to have enough money for a down payment on a house or provide for a spouse (I'm a gay male). 
4. The window of opportunity to have a child has now closed because of this. 
5. Most of my friends/peers are earning between 180k - 250k per year. 

Does anyone know of or have a REAL life example of someone that became successful after 35? 

1. Please, I am not looking for a JK Rowling of Jeff Besos example - those are extremes/ outliers and arent true markers for everyday individuals. 
2. I am also not looking for individuals that became successful in fields like acting, writing, entertainment, etc because those fields offer the opportunity for people to become successful with one-hit wonders, etc (JK Rowling had never published a book before). 
3. I'm looking for real-life examples of people's mothers, fathers, friends, brothers etc. (250k a year plus). 

I have yet to find one real-life example of such a person and I am considering leaving school. 

Please do not respond with affirmations of ""you can do anything"" or ""redefine what success is"" etc. That is NOT what this post is in reference to. Please, I'm asking for real-life examples of what seems impossible: financial and career success for a washed-up 34-year-old.",07Jun2020,1

Is there anything to keep in mind? I’m going to be staying anonymous and using a pseudonym so I’m good on the privacy front.",07Jun2020,1
1058,"I'm 17, and going through my first year of what's basically our version of high school in Sweden.

So I've been performing badly in school ever since august due to anxiety fueled by acne (I've gotten something prescribed for that recently however and I think it's helping) and now that this school year is ending, I know I'll fail at least 3 classes. I've saved my grades in Swedish class and I will have an acceptable grade in History calss too if I perform well at a presentation about world war 2 that I have exactly 8 hours from now.  

*(I'll be able to redo at least one of those and graduate later, as long as I don't fail any other classes in the next school year which I'm making sure won't happen)*

**Problem is**: I'm not finished with it yet. It will take me at least another hour to finish it, and then do a source critique. I'll go to bed at around 3AM and have to somehow manage to wake up at 9 AM, with only 6 hours of sleep.

If I go to sleep, I will only have a somewhat ready presentation and nothing memorized apart from the words written on the powerpoint, and chances are I might not even wake up on time at all. So instead, since I've been going to bed at 2-3 AM every night for the past four or so days, I've decided that it's better to just stay up the entire night, drink some coffee when the rest of my family wake up and do the presentation with about 8 hours of preparation. Then I'll have to somehow stay awake until like 10 pm to reset my sleep schedule but whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Didn't prepare my presentation due in 8 hours, won't be able to wake up on time so I'm not going to go to sleep at all.

So is this a good idea? Does anyone have advice for staying up late? And how I can keep myself calm during the presentation and not turn into a nervous stammering wreck? Thanks in advance :)",07Jun2020,1

Me: So what are you interested in?
Him: You
Me: I meant your hobbies. What hobbies do you enjoy doing?

He ended up not wanting to have a normal conversation and just quit replying. Is he mad cause i ignored him or maybe he just thinks im stupid? This isnt the only case where this happened. What am I supposed to say in situations like that?",07Jun2020,1
