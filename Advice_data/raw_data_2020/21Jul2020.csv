1,"hey, i don’t have the addiction but a friend of mine does. he’s addicted to lean and drinks 2-3 cups per day. he’s depressed and has anxiety as well. he says he doesn’t have the motivation to get better, but he does want to get better and he wants his constant mental pain to end. he asked me to help him. 

i have never personally been addicted to something (that i know of). at least i’ve never been addicted to anything serious like drugs or alcohol — i’ve done them in the past but only for fun/experience. i don’t do them often because i don’t want to get addicted. 

back to my friend, i need advice from anyone who has been through an addiction and overcame it/is getting better or has been there for someone who had an addiction.

any and all advice is welcomed. i don’t want to give him the wrong information or anything especially since i’m not as experienced with the situation. please help!!",21Jul2020,1
2,"Let’s say you dated this person for a few years. You suspected your partner of cheating and you saw evidence of cheating but they would continuously tell you that nothing was going on. 

Then you two break up but remain great friends. And it turns out that they were cheating the entire time. Would you want to know? Why or why not? And what would you do afterwards? 


Idk if this is the right subgroup to post this lol.



Edit: i’ll rephrase. If someone knew they were cheating on you, even tho you guys broke up but are friends now, should they tell you?",21Jul2020,1
3,"This has been an ongoing problem where my mom will say things that hurt my feelings or make me feel bad about myself and then she makes fun of me when I get upset. For example, earlier today we were sitting outside, it's like 80 degrees out so I was wearing shorts, and she made a comment about how I should shave my legs. I personally don't really care wether or not they're shaved, but it's been a while and I'm pretty lazy about it, and she said something along the lines of ""it's pretty gross, I have to look at them and I'm about to throw up."" I kind of brushed it off because comments like these are so common, but it was the buildup of what she was saying to me that got me all worked up. She called me retarded for being scared of a bee that was flying around my head, and after I went up to my room and locked the door, she said I was ""making a huge mistake"" and that if I didn't open the door she would walk away from me and never come back. I talked to my dad about it earlier but he said I was being overdramatic.",21Jul2020,1

5,"My family wants to take me to Germany the next year and they're making me take german classes at home but if you want me to be honest, I don't really have interest in learning German or in living there ;-;

But I must learn because I need the basic language to work at least as delivery and save up to move to the country of my preference, how do you learn and pay attention to something you have little interest in? ;-;

I wish I could just work in my home country but Perú is messed up, 70% of our economy is informal, unemployement is high, we've got 1.5 millions of refugees ready to work for less money and more hours than a local and most jobs are 70 hours a week for about US$270 a month.

So I really need to learn german right now or my family will stop supporting me.

If you asked me, I wish I could stay here with my grandmom, and get a part time job while I study online but I seriously can't find a job ;-;

How do I start learning? This is going to sound horrible but I find easier learning pokemon names than a new language of a country where I don't plan to live in for a long time.",21Jul2020,1

7,"I’m extremely depressed and I just hate myself so much that I can’t put it in to words. Like I don’t really get mad at anyone and I think that all around I’m a pretty chill guy but I just hate myself more than anyone else on this planet.

I’ve thought about cutting, but I don’t want people to know.

9,I feel like this is the best place for me to come ask for this advise. I’m young 22 and got married young to my wife at 21 recently I had a moment of mental weakness and cheated not physically but mentally for sure by entertaining other women. My wife is obviously very hurt by this and we are currently separated I’ve read so many articles and watched so many “help” videos on what my next steps should be and a lot of them were very helpful like don’t make excuses own up to my mistake and to not ask her to forgive me it’s not my place to ask for that which I all agree with. I was just honestly wondering if there is anyone out there that’s been through a similar situation and how did you handle it.

11,"I am 15f, I don't have respitory problems, although I do have iron deficiency and vitamine D deficiency.
So, ever since quarantine started, I go outside once a month, wearing gloves and a mask and respecting all the rules. I haven't been outside in more than a month now.

However, my brother who doesn't live at home, never washes his hands, goes everywhere and he regularly visited our home. Well, he got diagnosed with corona and he was here less than 14 days ago. Ironically, he told me on the last day of school before quarantine not to go, and if I did I would be the cause of my mom's death. My mom is 56 and she has diabetes and my dad is older but he doesn't have diabetes nor any other disease. 

Now I feel like my throat is super dry and that my chest is tight. Im a very anxious person and I do get panic attacks once in a while.

When I connected the dots I started being really worried. My parents are old and I'm scared about them. Also, I heard covid can permanently damage your lungs and even cause insomnia and memory problems. I don't want the rest of my life ruined because of this. What if I never fully recover? What if I loose my parents? I also never felt this. Not even during a panic attack. It's past 2am and I can't go to sleep. I'm scared.",21Jul2020,2
12,"I’ll give a bit of back story here as brief as I can sorry I’m a bit of a chaotic writer haha . So I’m 25(F) have been separated from my ex fiancé for 4 almost 5 years now. I’ve been online dating on and off but mostly I have just lots of little flings organically. Let’s be honest I barely get a first date in let alone a second, we’ll meet somewhere then plan to hang super casually so it’s always hard to tell what’s friends or dates. I get softboied constantly. At the beginning of the year a guy was actually talking to me everyday online as he was at the time in London for a wedding about “what would our wedding look like?” And “I can’t wait to come back and see you and cuddle and go on a date and talk about everything properly” we ended up doing nothing then one like friend date and was super weird cause we’d slept together in a Lil fling for ages that nothing at all happened on the date, a few weeks later he hit me up to hang out at night (we both work in music and together often so it wasn’t rare to not be night owls and home bodies for hangs as it was a much calmer way to chill and get to know someone better than a screaming metal gig haha. You guessed it we secured each others nuts then he bounced. So I’ve been hurt from that for a while and also just a build up of rejection it feels like. 
I feel like I get this super cool chick casual girl with a super exciting fun job that’s opinionated on moralistic views but also that’s been hyper sexualised vibe which I actually advocate for body positivity and own my sexuality which draws people to me easily but also no ones actually interested in me. I’m pretty quirky and dorky but I’m still aware that I come across as super confident which every guy always like to bring upto me is “hot” but I’m not confident all day every day. I’ve gone through some heavy shit in my upbringing along with chronic illnesses, bullying, domestic violence and sexual abuse from a young age. But I’m also super into therapy and live outside of my dating life a good life. I’ve over come many struggles and am now finally proud of that rather than ashamed but it’s all a process. It effects my confidence in other ways. 
I’ve gotten back into the dating scene when restrictions in my area eased up and it’s been really hard for me. I get softboied so easily and I just HATE when people ghost or even worse just don’t communicate what they’re thinking. I don’t feel comfortable to always be setting the communication standard but I try. 

Anyway to the T! 

So I met this guy omg hinge maybe 4 weeks ago 
Let call him Mike (28M) 
We both work in media and in pretty hectic jobs where our spare time is very up and down. He does like reality tv so his works still been stable over covid. Mine hasn’t as I’m in music so I’ve not worked for a long time. Basically what I’m saying is I’m weirdly more available than normal and his position is still effected but not much. Busy boi. So when we talked or chatted I always understood the long time between messages but I also just wanted to get myself out there again and date so I unashamedly just asked him if he wanted to meet. We booked in a date. On that week I had a date booked every night but canceled all but his cause I was dealing with my anxiety pretty on and off I guess. 
I thought fuck it I’m going. 
We met up at a local pub around 2pm in the afternoon. We drank. The chemistry was there, we love the same music had the best time even so much that I had a bands little gathering that night to celebrate an ep release and it was super intimate but I invited him to come. We had the most fun with my friends, he’s so kind and sweet and didn’t have to baby sit him then we ended up back at mine. We fooled around but didn’t have sex technically. We stayed up the rest of the night talking about deep emotional big things in life and views on the world then slept in till mid day cuddling. THIS IS A RARE UNICORN I thought. I’m actually having a good dating experience for once. I was so keen on it. But I also am realistic I’m meant to be moving soon which is a 1 hour flight away but nothings offical with the current state of covid. I still wanted to date him and see. Yes love is a powerful motivator for the place I live too. Half the reason I’m moving is a new dating scene. 
So anyway I knew he had a busy week after we briefly chatted here and there and made plans to hang on the weekend. As it got closer he said Sunday we’d catch up. Then the vibe changed a little. I just didn’t feel like he was all that interested in doing anything datey but I was okay with trying to take control of it. But like my housemate said that day “ even her ex boyfriend is taking her on dates just to bang “ so even if it was just to bang least he could do is romance a little but just communicate that cause I’m moving away we should just keep it light... anyway I would’ve understood if the communication was just there. so why can’t this guy make a little more effort. I thought maybe he was a little insecure cause I did have to like tell him I wanted him there with me multiple times at the gathering and it took a while for us to even touch physically. 
Anyway on the Sunday a week after our first date we went to the local park laid on a blanket for a few hours chatted and laughed heaps. Felt like it was going really well. I wanted to take him back to mine and hang more but before I could offer he said “ I’ll need to jet in halfa for a family zoom date” I’m not going to challenge your plans so I accepted that and said let’s jet then totally fair. Walked back to mine 
Then nothing... he said “thanks for hanging out” then went for a hug and said bye 
I was like yep byeeee 😐 
All I felt was my worst fear ... rejection. 
I messaged him after saying it was really good seeing him again x and he said It was good to get out in the sun. 
I’m Ofcorse at this point beating myself up thinking I can’t date. It’s my fault. I am hard to read maybe. Why didn’t he kiss me ?! He’s clearly attracted and we get along well it’s not like we hadn’t joked around about dating plenty and how we like each other and it’s not like his face wasn’t buried into my crotch for a few hours the weekend before haha but then nothing ... so I messaged sorry if I got a bit awkward there at the end and he didn’t reply so I promptly deleted out of embarrassment. 
Now I’m struggling 
Where’s the communication 
What am I meant to think 
Do I try and chat to him again soon? Like mid week and just check in ? 
Or should I just cut my losses and move on? 

Update; I just unmatched with him on hinge cause I deleted the app but before I did saw he’s updated his profile. That hurt. 

Okay 👌 hopefully I’m not loosing my jelly beans here. 
Help advise pls
I am also trying to be self aware that I’m hypersensitive to rejection Rn.",21Jul2020,1

16,"Hey reddit, I made a new account specifically for posting rather than just lurking like I’m used to. I honestly don’t know where to go for this issue, especially because I know for a fact it’s illegal.

A friend of mine, let’s call her Marie, is dating a 20 year old guy who we’ll call David. David and Marie met under some strange (personal) circumstances about 3 years back, when Marie and I were 12 and he was 17. I’ve known Marie for about 8 years, so I remember the day she met him and began speaking about him. I myself was being groomed online at the time so I saw no problem with their friendship. In the last 3 years, she’s told me all about him.

 It became apparent to me that she liked David early 2018. She was crying to me because her mother found out about him and (understandably) banned her from speaking with him until she was 18. She told me how much she liked him and wanted to be with him (yknow, teenage girl shit). She even took my phone while we were at the beach together and facetimed him. They spoke to each other very affectionately to a point where I felt very uncomfortable. After getting out of my own situation with an older man that really hurt me, I was VERY against any person over 18 being romantic with anyone below 18. Despite this, I stayed quiet. 

Now Marie was not the best friend, and she manipulated myself and a few other people for several years, so I cut myself off from her for awhile. Recently, however, she seemed to have changed a lot, so we started talking. To make a long story short, she told me she was NOT going to talk to David ever again, but then a few weeks later, she told me they were dating. 

When she told me this, I was disappointed but not surprised. I pretended to be happy for her, since I had just started dating my current partner and I know how shitty it is when people don’t approve of your relationship. She said that me she was afraid to tell me because she knows how against it I am, but I just pretended it was okay so she wouldn’t feel bad. After all, David is the one I should be upset with, not her. I told her she should not do anything sexual with him, and she agreed.

This next part is all over the place and weird but stay with me. About a week later, they “broke up.” 3 days after they broke up, she was sneaking out to see a movie with him. 2 days after the movie, she told me something that really pushed me towards the edge and made this situation a lot worse. They exchanged oral sex. I of course will not be detailing a sexual encounter a minor experienced, but that’s all you need to know. I believe they are currently sexually active as a couple but I can’t confirm or deny this.

This made me feel ill. I expressed to her that I was worried for her safety and I was not going to support their relationship, and she simply said “yeah I get that.” 

I’ve met David once or twice. I hate to admit it, but I like him as a person. He’s very funny and agreeable. He doesn’t at all make me uncomfortable to be around and he seems like to average teenage boy. That’s why this concerns me. I feel like I should hate him but I don’t. I want Marie to stop speaking with him for obvious reasons, but a part of me almost feels like David is a friend of mine. 

What should I do? If I tell anyone, I know for a fact that Marie’s life will not be the same and David will probably go to prison. Marie JUST got back her right to a phone after 2 years of not being trusted, so I know that phone will be gone for another 2 years if David is exposed. Any sort of advice would help. I consider myself fairly mature, but some things are above my pay grade and I must turn to the wise people of reddit. Thank you.",21Jul2020,3
17,"(POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING: RACISM)

I am staying at my grandparents for the week and I'm struggling with myself. As a white woman from a completely white family, I feel as if I am overly complicit towards casual racism. Let me explain.

I have a habit of getting into ""political"" discussions about race and BLM with my older relatives. Usually my parents, but sometimes my grandparents and others. I am now known within my family as a ""hardcore liberal"" or someone who can ""never admit that their wrong"" and ""doesnt let other people have opinions"". When my mom says something about how ""immigrants are taking over our country"" or my dad tells me ""white men have the lower hand in society"" I try and pull out the facts to convince them otherwise. I believe they should accept everyone, and know this isnt correct behavior.

Last night, my grandma expressed to me that she is tired of hearing about the struggles canada put indigenous populations through. She claims ""She didnt do it, so why should she have to hear about it"". I claim that it's part of history, that it's something that many indigenous people still deal with today. She claims that ""not all, but most"" of them sit on their arse and drink all day, since they get money from the government. I say that that a stereotype, etc.

Then, today at dinner, my grandma says ""hey, you know what Sam will be interested in hearing..."" she's grinning, and continues to quote something that was written in my great grandmother's high school yearbook. A poem about how ""god forgot to paint the N-Word's white."" When she sees the look of utter shock on my face, she begins to laugh,  and the older ones at the table laugh with her. I say nothing. She continues to make comments about how I dont let anyone have opinions. I'd also like to point out that we were having chinese food, which prompted my uncle to say that the c-words were cooking for us. They even told a story about what happened one time when he called a chinese woman that word. I say nothing, again.

It was easier to say something to my parents, but now I'm starting to be afraid. The more I speak up, the more I'm ridiculed, and the more I get insulted, and openly complained about. I even heard my mom say the n word for the first time. And said nothing. I am often cut short, and was even once called racist towards white people by my own father. They even used my speaking up to ridicule me on other things, like my schooling, and how sensitive I am

I know this is just them being defensive, but I am genuinely afraid to say anything anymore, and most of all, discouraged. I feel as if I will never change them, and am constantly told by them that they will never change... and i dont know if i can live with that.

All advice is welcome. Thanks :)

TLDR: My family is racist, and ridicules and insults me for correcting and attempting to educate them. I've become complicit, and it's seriously taking a role on me mentally. How do I change their minds? I dont know if I can live with them being so hateful.",21Jul2020,0
18,"I really need help leaving my partner. We were engaged but I can't do this anymore. 

We've kind of had problems come up with him almostbutnotreally cheating with other women for our whole relationship. We got engaged last summer. I just found out about this hard drive of nudes of other women that he's had for our entire relationship and has been adding to the whole time. The last timestamp on one of them was this month, while my mother and sister were visiting from out of state. He's exchanged nudes and almost had sexual relations with about six other women during our relationship and each time I forgive him and move on but I'm not anymore.

20,"I am a grad student &amp; transitioning in housing in a few weeks to save money so that I can graduate on time. My current job is through my school and is part time. I do not know how long they plan on keeping me but but the pay is good for where I’m at and what my living costs are. But it’s remote, and between working and doing classes remotely in an apt by myself (was on campus &amp; roommates left) for the last 3 months I’ve been feeling kind of insane. I did briefly work at FedEx since my current job started almost a month late, but I had to quit due to scheduling conflicts w/my current position. 

I want to know if it would be problematic to look at jobs, yes to make some extra change but also just to get out of the house. I ask if it’s problematic bc every day there are more and more people who *need* work, any type of work, I could be taking a job from someone who really needs it to get by. I know my situation is a little annoying but there are definitely others whose circumstances are even more dire, and I would never want to make things even harder for them.

21,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

As the title says, I am constantly afraid of being a pedophile. I am attracted to people my age and older, and the thought of having sex with a child disturbs me. I understand how painful it is to be sexually abused as a child, I know that children cannot consent, and even if they were agree to sexual activity, it is still abuse. 

Yet, I still worry about being attracted to them.  I have a history of OCD throughout my life, so I hope this is all there is to it. Sometimes when I see a kid, I wonder ""am I attracted to him?"", and then I try to analyze my reaction. I sometimes even get a faint erection, despite the fact I don't want to have sex with a child. I chalk the erection up to my brain playing tricks on me. After all, if you tell yourself to not think of a pink elephant, you're going to think of a pink elephant. Or, maybe it's simply influenced by my emotions. Or maybe it's just classic denial.

I hate feeling like this. I love children in a non sexual way, I want the very best for them and don't ever want to hurt them. I'm afraid to reach out to psychologists about this, because I want to become a parent through adoption, and I don't want these feelings to be a warning sign to agencies. I even question if it's right for me to be a parent because of these fears.",21Jul2020,2

27,"Hello! TLDR: Mom going through divorce, was completely dependent on dad, will need technology to survive alone

So, my mom is moving towards a divorce and needs to get some independence, but my dad has taken care of everything for her her entire life. She stopped working when she was in her early 20's and has barely ever used a computer. She doesn't understand the internet conceptually and doing the most basic things is super difficult. She can barely type, she has a smartphone but doesn't understand how it works beyond calling and texting

My goal is to get her at least a little bit tech-savvy so she can start to begin to live more independently from my dad ahead of the divorce. The problem is that I'm states away from her and doing everything over the phone is so hard, and I honestly don't know where to begin.

I have found a place to live for $575 a month come August (incredible bargain),but I will need to fly back home to the East coast in August to get surgery. I will also need to pay this rent MYSELF, as I am now a college graduate and cannot keep relying on my father. I am out of work (thanks Corona), however am avidly looking for a job, but no luck yet. It’s been incredibly stressful. I am a Finance major, and hope to get a position in the field ASAP. I am hopeful, but it is not looking good. Overqualified individuals seem to be out of work, and thus the entry level positions are all being taken up by said workers. I’m, simply put, shit out of luck for the time being. The quality of life on the East coast pales in comparison to Colorado, so i’d like to stay here longer, but i’m just not sure what to do. Should I move back home with my family indefinitely, rent free, and look for work with a major decrease in life quality, or should I take this place in Colorado for $575 a month while I look for work?",21Jul2020,2
31,"First, a few key facts for context:

I live in the US.

I work for a very large international retailer who shall remain nameless for obvious reasons.

I am paid hourly.

I (26M), along with one other person (34F), was hired at the same time for the same role a few months ago, right before the pandemic escalated and all US stores shut down for two months. I know that the person that was hired at the same with me makes one dollar more than I do, but I don't mind this at all as she has much more experience than I do and was actually a salaried manager at her previous job and took a pay cut to get this new job. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**TL;DR: I Found out my-coworkers, who are on the same team and in the same role as I am, are making a substantial amount less than myself and one of our other co-workers who was hired at the same time as me. Each of my co-workers' individual experience ranges from equivalent to much higher than mine, and each of them has been with the company for at least 5 years. We are trying to figure out how we can approach our management/the company to demand that my co-workers' pay is raised to match the other new-hire and I earn. How should we proceed?**

The details:

Today while at work, the subject of pay came up while speaking with some of my co-workers in my team. I was under the impression that the starting pay for our role was around $22/hr, so when I casually mentioned that I am paid $23/hr and (34F) is paid $24 (she was part of the conversation and volunteered this information) our co-workers were shocked, because each of them had been at the company for at *least* 5 years and were only making $20/hr, and that itself was a recent change after the company re-organized and brought them up from $18/hr. Of course they felt angry, upset and even betrayed by management/the company. This was very distressing because I've seen how hard each of them work, and on top of it, our team is under-staffed (the company requires a minimum of 6 people for our team, but I've been told most locations have more) *and* the location altogether was under-staffed *before* the pandemic. Since re-opening it has been worse because a good number of folks left or chose to remain on furlough. So needless to say, our team ends up taking on quite a bit more than what is normal in terms of responsibility and doing things outside the scope of our normal job duties. I spent a lot of days thinking and even saying out loud ""man if it weren't for the pay and benefits, this shit wouldn't be worth it"" only to find out my co-workers have to deal with the same shit for less! 

Anyway, I truly believe they deserve to be paid more for their experience and time with the company and paid in the same range as myself and 34F. We found out later today that there has been a trend where the company has been hiring people at a much higher starting rate for the same roles that existing employees have years of experience in. It would be one thing if we were hired at the **same** pay that existing employees got after years of working there, but for us to come in at a *significantly higher* rate feels wrong, and I can't in good conscience continue to do the same job as them with the knowledge that they are being paid a substantial amount less for no reason other than the company probably thinks it can get away with it. 

With all that being said, I rallied them together and told them I will do whatever I can to support their efforts to get a raise, even if it means quitting in protest with them, because I really don't want to work at a company or location that would do something like this. I care about my co-workers as human beings and equals and the injustice of the pay disparity truly bothers me. We agreed to meet up outside of work in the next few days to discuss our plan/strategy, understand our options and what leverage we have and how to use it, and for now to keep things between us until we have a solid plan and can present a united front. So, Reddit, how should we approach this situation? Should we act as a group or as individuals with a cohesive plan? What should we do (independently and/or collectively) and what should *I* do?

34,"I got contact lenses yesterday. I was able to take my right one out fine last night and the left one gave me some trouble, but I got it after 30+ frustrating attempts. Now today I get the right one out after 2 tries, but the left will not come out. I've tried many different methods including cussing the doctor out. I can feel myself getting the pinch, but when I go to remove there is pain in my eye. After at least 75 attempts today I just can't take it anymore.

I've put lens drops in my eye to try to loosen it up. I've tried looking to the side, looking down, up then pinching and slowly moving my eyeball, but this fucking thing is suctioned on there.

35,"I'm 22 and I shouldn't be so affected by my parents divorce but I am. It is honestly horrible. My mom (65) is the one wanting to initiate the divorce but she is so helpless without my dad. My dad is an asshole and I suspect heavy abuse has been going on since I moved away for college (never moved back). But, he is and has always been the sole provider for the household

I really don't know how to handle this... I am really kind of having a break down moment

My mom is a strong and intelligent woman but she's basically entirely unaware of the modern world - imagine your 80 year old grandma in an apple store, that's how she is all the time.

I got her set up with a therapist, but I need to find divorce lawyers, financial advisors (apparently my dad, despite making a decent living for decades, ate up almost all their money in credit card debt due to a spending addiction) and more. I am barely an adult and I feel like I now have to step up to be the head of the ""household"" and ensure my mom's safety and protection and I have no idea how to fucking do that.

I found about the abuse, the lack of money, the divorce, and the credit card debt all in the last 72 hours

36,"Idk where to begin, it’s about my marriage,,,, 
we’ve been together 14 years, married 11 years, he’s active duty military, we both have tempers, we’ve both cheated, I did 1 thing, whereas he did many things for many years, yes I know cheating is cheating, I first found out about some of his stuff in 2009 then the rest of his crap in 2011 and I feel (at this moment) I should have left back then. I’m feeling so lost and defeated. I feel getting a divorce is the only option at this point due to everything that has gone on. No kids together, he has 2 that are 18 or older. Nothing is together, not even bank accounts. 

Today I went to leave for work in SCRUBS and he accused me of being sneaky and shady when I left cuz I didn’t say bye. We’ve been arguing for weeks; neither of us are used to him being home this much.

I was supposed to go on a retreat for survivors of childhood sexual abuse and now he’s telling me he don’t know if he will be home to take care of the dogs. So yet again for the 2 time I’m cancelling cuz it doesn’t align with what he wants. He could have reached out to his unit and asked about these dates but he didn’t.

I’m at a loss and i don’t know what to do. Any advice? NO NEGATIVITY! Thanks.",21Jul2020,2
37,"This happened last month and I've lost all my friends over this. My dog passed away in my arms 10 days later. I spiraled down into not wanting to live. I need to know if I'm a victim, or playing the victim. These incidents spurred a deep depression and ruined my 21 plans; I slept from noon to 9.

Me and A (not the abuser) reconnected after HS. Went to B (abuser)'s house. She is drunk. I'm sitting on the couch, I hear yelling and turn, she's completely topless and charges at me, jumps on me and lays on me. Everyone laughs. After 10-15 minutes no one talks to me or says anything about what happened. B gets angry drunk and I want to lighten the mood by playfighting her. 

I didn't know at the time, but she was blackout drunk. My intentions were to have a drunken rolling/BJJ match I do at my other friend's house all the time.

The entirety of the ""playfight"" is on camera. I expect her to just playfully hit me and wrestle with me, I'm trying to have just a little bit of fun, I was in a bad headspace. She's hitting me full force. Mind you she's 210ish pounds and I'm 170. Once I realized she was punching me for real and wouldn't stop, I say ""leg kicks!"" and she kicks me so hard I buckle. She doesn't quit hitting me so I roll around on the ground with her. Next ""round"" starts and she continues hitting me as hard as she could (the sound was like punching your palm), and off camera I say 3 times ""no headhunting!"" a.k.a stop trying to punch me in the face. At one point in the video I realize she's not going to stop hitting me for real, so I took it to the ground again and had to put her in a triangle choke for real because I don't wanna do this anymore. Everyone is laughing and recording and I'm getting actually hurt, and I have to laugh as well, but I felt alone and hurt, and I got blackout drunk for the first time ever, after 6 years of illegal alcohol consumption.

I know that trying to playfight with a volatile drunk individual is a dumb decision. I trusted this person because we've known each other for 8ish years. In my mind, regardless of if it was a bad idea in hindsight, it is completely inappropriate to hit someone as hard as you possibly can. I have a lot of pictures of the bruises, one of them was orange-sized and deep purple, and that arm was sprained.

Anyway. I decide to speak up about feeling violated, so I tell A, who tells B within 5 minutes. A tells me that B didn't 5exually assault me. She says ""it's the same as a guy taking his shirt off and jumping on me, why didn't you do anything, you need to drop your victim mentality."" Today I learned she changed her tune by saying that B was only wearing a sports bra. She also says it was my fault because ""you said you wanted to fight"" (her actual reasoning). I don't get why the fuck you would want to fight a drunk girl in her own apartment. I just wanted to have fun, she wanted to hurt someone. C is a close friend who at first saw the video, and he said ""you can tell when you're not having fun."" Today he texts me calling me selfish and arrogant (for speaking up about the situation, most likely) and says the ordeal was ""your fault by provoking a blackout drunk woman.""

I really, really hate to put it this way, but if the genders were reversed, I can't help but feel this would be different.

I have no friends anymore because of my decision to speak up about this, and for being overbearing with the 5uicidal thoughts this kind of 5exual and physical trauma brought upon me (I have PTSD from both kinds of abuse) - I've effectively drained everyone because it's put me under such emotional duress.

Everyone is telling me it's not a big deal and that it was my fault I got physically injured. A even said ""you're 6 foot, why didn't you do anything?"". I have no idea what's up or down and my mind is running in circles. I feel like a bad person.

I just don't know if I'm in the wrong here and playing the victim. I hate myself and all my friends are gone.

tl;dr: female friend gets blackout drunk, takes off shirt and bra and jumps and lays on me as people laugh. no one says anything or brings up what happened, continuing to laugh. same female friend gets angry and I attempt to engage in drunken playfighting with her. She hits me as hard as she can, leaves bruises on my torso, arms (including an orange sized dark purple bruise that sprained my arm &amp; took a month to heal). Was in distress and attempted to speak up; got told I wasn't 5exually assaulted and the physical injuries were my fault. I am not sure whether I am overreacting, or if this is real trauma. Because of this, I lost all my friends in that circle, and lost my 2 best friends for burdening them with my emotions and 5uicidal thoughts related to the incident. I need to know if I'm the bad guy.",21Jul2020,1

40,"I’m still thinking about what I want to do as a job, I’m going to highschool this summer. I know there’s gonna be someone saying “oh don’t worry about it ur just a kid still” but it’s kinda important since I have to do a project on it right now and I need to take the correct highschool courses. 

My original plan was to be an architect, and I would like to. But then I heard about being a game devoloper. I’m a really creative person and I get my best marks in literacy, art and music. If I could become a game devoloper, I would want to start my own small game company, maybe with some friends I’ll meet in uni, and then we can make an awesome specific type of game that I don’t want to say but you get the idea. 

So my question is, do you think I should try being a game devoloper? Do you think I’ll be able to start a little company or something with some friends or people? Or should I just be an architect. Frankly, if I was an architect I would want to design super interesting and cool buildings, but I know it’s hard to get a job like that for awhile. I’ll probably never get the chance to actually design something I like.",21Jul2020,5
41,"I currently live in an apartment building in a big city. The neighbors that this post is about don't even live in my building, they live in the next house over. These people have two large outdoor speakers that they use to blast their music and host large parties every single day. 

&amp;#x200B;

The speakers are something kind of like this:  [https://www.amazon.com/Alphasonik-Amplified-Speakers-Bluetooth-Microphone/dp/B074JLRJFD/ref=pd\_ybh\_a\_55?\_encoding=UTF8&amp;refRID=PE2REG9VPPWMG450GM8R&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Alphasonik-Amplified-Speakers-Bluetooth-Microphone/dp/B074JLRJFD/ref=pd_ybh_a_55?_encoding=UTF8&amp;refRID=PE2REG9VPPWMG450GM8R&amp;th=1) 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not exaggerating when I say any of this, they play music so loudly that when I speak on the phone or online with friends, everyone I am talking to can hear the music clearly. It's pretty bad considering I have all the windows shut and soundproof curtains and it still sounds this way. It is also so loud that you can hear their music on the entire square block. This is a recurring situation, they do this every single day all day during the months of good weather in the year from about noon to midnight and sometimes later. This year it started in early May and they usually continue until at least September and this is also the 3rd consecutive year of them blasting music. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should not be forced to listen to music that I dislike just so I can open a window and get some fresh air. I can't even hear myself think sometimes. I can't stand it anymore and am coming here to ask for help before I decide on any action. I already looked into the noise disturbance codes for my city, my current situation falls under the category of calling the police. I have done so 3 times and they do nothing but redirect me to 311 which also has done nothing. The 311 operator just files the complaint online which is something I already do myself and have done every day the issue has persisted. None of this has worked or resulted in any changes to the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not spoken with or brought up my concerns to the neighbors because they seem like the type of people that wouldn't care and then I'd just be making myself a target in the event that I might want to take any other action. I also wouldn't be surprised if they were dangerous because I see they get suspicious looking visitors rather frequently that could be drug dealers. The family that lives there is large, consisting of at least 10 people. Most of them are men who look like thugs with a few women and children. Their daily parties usually consist of over 20 people, at least that's how many I could count from my window these days. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it really seems like my only course of action at this point is to destroy the speakers somehow. I was looking up ways to do this online and figured I would ask on reddit too. Currently, I am considering getting a powerful slingshot and shooting the speakers from my window or something similar. I can see most of their backyard from my window and their speakers are in plain view from this angle. They usually leave them out but sometimes store them in a shed a few feet away that I can also plainly see. Besides that, I was thinking about sneaking onto the property when everyone was asleep and damaging them by cutting the cables or something. They set up an above ground pool in the backyard too so submerging the speakers might be a good idea. A cut cable is easily repairable though and I'm not sure how effective the water would be, even though it is probably the best way to do it without getting caught since I could put the speakers back after being submerged and they would dry by morning. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any suggestions I would greatly appreciate it. I would prefer a solution that doesn't involve me having to go on the property but I'm open to anything and would like to weigh all options. I've just had enough of these selfish, ignorant people.",21Jul2020,1

45,"so the title literally sums it up to the tee but i will give you some back story. so i met him from tinder actually about 4 years ago, he was the first guy i ever decided to actually meet up with and it wasn’t that we became friends instantly, but overtime grew a bond. really i don’t know how it happened but we just have grown so close 

initially when we met he had feelings for me but i was in a shitty place and things didn’t work out. we didn’t talk for a while after (almost a year) when he hit me up one night after drinking and said he still thinks of hooking up with me. i have no idea why but i was ready for it and told him f it let’s hook up again. and so the fwb portion began and we hooked up on and off for about a year.

i broke things off around april? this year when he told me suddenly he had unprotected sex with someone else and it probably wouldn’t be the last time they hook up. he wasn’t trying to end what we had he still wanted to be f buddies but i let him know i wasn’t comfortable with that and we stopped. he initiated one night few weeks after and we hooked up but this made me really upset and i made it known that i will not be here for that anymore. the main problem in the hooking up was that he says he had no feelings for me so the sex made him feel empty

throughout all of this at some point in the last year i think i really have fallen for him. like hard. our friendship just felt so pure, i would bring him food all the time, massage his back, help him with moving and so on, really i did a lot for him and there wasn’t a thing i would want back as compensation. he has always been there with me and tries to support me emotionally and with daily life struggles and so on. throughout all of it he had many chances to walk away after many arguments, much of which my insecurity would be what triggered me really just stupid fights but each time he decides to be the bigger person and hold on and will not let me go. it confuses me a little, i know i am not easy to be around but he told me last week he thinks i’m worth the trouble. 

i don’t think i can tell him but it eats me up inside knowing he has a replacement fwb he’s entertaining and he probably hits her up as much as he used to hit me up and AHHH blah what can i do guys what good would come from telling him how i feel? i miss our old situation :( but i know it won’t be good for me at this point. i’ve spent so long denying how i feel but i think i’m just coming to terms with it finally. also i know i’m an idiot ok😭",21Jul2020,1

So the past couple months my cousin has been staying with me and my family because her parents are apparently abusing her. For the past few weeks my cousin (We'll call her Ashley) has been acting strange, what follows is a list of things she has done. Offering for me to take her to my schools prom, though it was cancelled due to COVID. wearing my clothes, slapping my ass, cuddling up next to me when i'm playing games and leaning her head on me, one time even fell asleep while laying her head on my lap. She will sometimes but not very often start talking about sex and orgasms with the previous conversation having nothing to do with it.  Constantly asking for hugs, even at inappropriate times. Once while we we're in my room, she was sitting on my bed and asked for a hug, I walk over to give her a hug and she leans back, wraps her legs around me (At this point, if anyone walked in my room it would look like we were in wrapped missionary position but clothed), my cousin then says, ""I'm not letting go until you say you love me"". I say ""I love you"", she lets go, and she makes me swap rooms with her for 2 days. Another weird thing that happened is that we were at a baseball game with my friends (they know me and Ashley are cousins), throughout the football game Ashley is holding my hand, hugging me, and at one point leaning in for a kiss as a joke.

Then told me about stories of people finding “help me” notes in their orders. 

I looked up those stories and they seemed largely forged, but I do know that Shein and stores of the like *do* practice child labor and use sweatshops.

54,"\*\*Just some context below, no need to read the whole post unless you're curious or have questions.\*\*

We've been on two dates and are absolutely enamored with each other. She may be older than me, but she's physically way out of my league. Personality-wise, we're a match made in heaven. Her job is on pause during this pandemic -- she's a dancer (think Hamilton, not a strip club you sodomites). I am partially telecommuting for my office job. We both desire a long-term relationship and to have biological children. It should be noted her boys suffer from what seems to be pretty significant separation anxiety. They are also super protective of their mommy from the stories she's told me -- it's like blockbuster comedy status. To be completely honest, I am not as nervous to enter this ""ready-made"" family as you might think, but maybe I'm just naive or unaware of what to expect. I have plenty of experience as an eldest sibling and cousin, but that's probably nothing by comparison.

I think I have already come to realize on my own that I must be ready in my heart to adopt these kids as if she weren't part of the equation to be ready to move forward with this particular relationship. Am I ready in my heart for this? I want to say yes, but the God's honest truth is that I am just not sure. Is it messed up to feel like maybe I need to meet and get to know them first?

I recently got offered a job in a city around 2 hours from my town, I know it pretty well because I went to college there. The city's covid 19 contagion rate is growing with each day, and with suspiciously low numbers (our government is shit so I'm positive the real number is way higher). The pay is not really good (just the rent would be almost half my pay) there are commissions, but since it's a starting business, I don't know if I can count with that income. 

Now, this job might not be my dream job, but it's one of the few jobs that I have found that are specific to my career, and it could be a good start for a career road that I want to take in the future, so I know the experience would be very valuable. Besides receiving a job offer during the pandemic, knowing that millions of people are being fired, is something I do not take lightly. 

Now, my main worry is my family. I don't have any preexisting condition, so I believe I would survive it if I ever got it. But since I'm very close to my family and we just lost my grandmother (not from covid) and it was really hard and we're still recovering from it.

I just can't imagine having to call my mom and tell her that I got covid. It would destroy her and my grandpa not being able to be near me. And knowing them, I believe they just wouldn't care getting infected and would just come anyway.

I passed the job interview, but haven't signed anything yet. And I don't know what to do now.

Should I take this opportunity? Even knowing the risk might be too high. Would the experience I'd get and the opportunity to have a job in this time be worth that risk? Because certainly I believe the money really isn't.",21Jul2020,1
56,"I sometimes feel no matter how tough/ stoic I may seem on the outside (mask I put on), i'm actually a snowflake. And i'm in my early 30s. I've had some major back-to-back disappointments in recent times, and I mostly have been all on my own. I wish I had the wisdom to cope with it better. Whenever I'm going through a rough patch, I expect at-least 1 person to show support and genuinely take interest in my well being. If that doesn't happen, I take it at heart, become bitter for a while for how no one loves me, rant and  sometimes even get into verbal arguments with people who I expected better from. I am very well aware that it's practically impossible to have such a person at every point of life! This is an area where I lack maturity and I really want to overcome this!

I have 1 sincere question from people who have been here and conquered it!

1. How do you personally work your way through with any disappointment (no matter the magnitude) without bothering anyone?",21Jul2020,2

My mom supplied me the text message from her end and I also took a screenshot from mine.

69,"My daughter was a senior this past year. With Covid all the great senior traditions were canceled. Prom, canceled. Senior trip, canceled. Senior night, canceled. Graduation was thankfully postponed. It’s going to be next week, outdoors and only 4 guests per student. Not ideal but it’s at least something. Now normally our family celebrates graduations with a cookout party. Guests bring gifts and money for the graduate to add to their college experience. I remember getting $100 in quarters for the laundry machines from an aunt. My brother, ever the loving older sibling, got me a giant pack of condoms to embarrass me in front of the entire family. So it’s a lot of fun. Having a big party/cookout is out of the question. We’ll do something small with us (her immediate family) and a set of grandparents (they’re local the other set is not).

Like, I want to do something for me and live my life and reward and treat myself but I never do because he always wants things and I feel/he makes me feel like I need to get his stuff first.

Before anyone says it, I know, he’s a manipulator and a use and a conman (he is, I know it) yet he always guilts me or sucks me in whenever I think of getting away from him.

75,"It is my dream to make the next, “Avatar: The Last Airbender“. .What I mean by that is that I want to make a remarkable action/fantasy cartoon that can touch people’s hearts and be adored decades after its’ release.

One thing I that I always admired about Avatar was that it dealt with dark themes in a way that was accessible to people of all ages. And I to believe that authors shouldn’t be afraid to explore dark themes in a family friendly project as long as you do it in a way that is educational but doesn’t intimidate them or talk down them. And of course don’t get overly graphic either.

However, I know that there are a lot of overprotective parents out there that do not agree. Therefore, I don’t think that there will be a lot of parents who will not like the idea of me portraying a 45 year old man indulging in a romantic affair with a 20 year old girl. Even if the girl is consenting to the relationship and I don’t show them doing anything more than kissing, cuddling, and holding hands. Hell, this might even gross out the younger audience.

I'm also pansexual, and in the past I've been polyamorous, though my current bf (26m) and I are doing the monogamy thing right now. Now, I LOVE my boyfriend, he accepts my gender identity, he is fully supportive of my transition, and he and I communicate really well. I think our relationship is, quite possibly, the best relationship I've ever had, but I know he has feelings of not being enough sometimes. He worries that if he fails me or falls short at all, that I'll leave him. That would never happen, but those anxieties are why I'm a little afraid to talk to him about this, because I don't want to hurt him.

So. The problem is that, because he is a cis male &amp; I present femme, we look like a straight couple. And because we're monogamous right now, I'm obviously not dating any women/trans people.

103,"So over the course of a year I developed a crush with a girl I used to go to college with. We have a lot in common. But the main issue is is that we’ve been “talking” for a year but it has barely gone anywhere.

We have confirmed multiple times that we like each other but every time I’ve tried to do an actual date she says how she’s busy or doesn’t respond. Hey when she gets drunk, she will text me how she wants to see me and misses me. To add to that she is an awful texter. I have gone a week without a text for her to reply once and then I wait another week. Before we talked all the time but since summer it has sizzled out.

We had a church gathering together, I gave her birthday presents cause I wanted to give them in person. She was kinda stand offish when I tried to talk to her she would get distracted or talk with someone else. After that night I didn’t hear from her. She went to Alaska on a family trip but I had no idea cause she never told me and she had to take a Covid test which I would’ve like to have known but oh well.

Anyway so about 2 weeks go by and no text at all. My mom has been trying to set me up with a girl from her work that I used to go to high school with so I tell her yes give me her number because I accepted that my old crush had ghosted me again (which she has done before). Over the course of the next weeks, my grandma passed away. My grandma was my best friend and I was hurting so much. This new girl knew my grandma and has been with me through this whole process. I’ve even gotten the chance to take her on a date and another one Wednesday.

Once my grandma passed I posted a post on Facebook to honor her. Well my old crush saw it was texting me saying how sorry she was and praying for me, how she’s here for me. I thanked her but didn’t say anything else cause I have lost those feelings for her. The 3 weeks she didn’t text me were the hardest of my life and this new girl was there through the whole thing. I’m not afraid that this new girl is going to ghost, how we were able to go out on an actual date and going on another one soon.

So I guess my question is, how do I let my old crush down nicely so she isn’t surprised if I change my relationship status on Facebook? Or is it even worth telling her I moved on?

TLDR: how can I tell my old crush I don’t think of her romantically anymore?

Edit: forgot to add my old crush has been texting me a lot and I’ve barely been responding. So I think she knows something might be up.",21Jul2020,1
104,"First post here, and on mobile, so sorry for format.

I (19m) am currently back at my childhood home with my parents and brother due to the pandemic as well as it being summer break. I had just finished my first year of university this past year. 

A little bit of a background (though it may be unnecessary) of my family dynamic may help set the scene. My family is Asian, parents are quite conservative, brother is neutral. I am part of the lgbtq+ community and mostly liberal. Most of my life I had hidden the fact that I was not straight due to my parents’ vocal disapproval of the lgbtq+ community. I wouldn’t say they’re super conservative, given that I was given quite a bit of freedom as compared to the stereotypical “strict Asian parents” trope, but I digress. Anyways, I loved my freshman year of college in New York which is hundreds of miles away from my family, and I have developed a sense of independence and happiness that I did not have around my family. When I first had to move back, I had a small depressive episode, if that tells you how little I enjoy being around my parents. 

Now that that’s out of the way, we move to the present. I got into my university’s theatre program, which I have always loved and have been striving for as a career path. However, being that the pandemic happened and the fact that the university is in NYC, the problem of paying tuition exists. I’m lucky enough to get a huge chunk of my tuition paid for by scholarships and whatnot, but the amount of money I have to pay out of pocket a year is still around 30k. I’ve also been trying to apply to scholarships and scholarship programs which may end up giving me financial aid in the future. 

On the other hand, the university my parents want me to go to is only around 30 minutes away, meaning that I would be living at home and driving to class. This option significantly reduces the amount of tuition I have to pay, and is something my parents are even willing to pay for. 

Here is the dilemma: I won’t be able to major in theatre, one of the few things I’m passionate about, and would be forced to take a more “financially stable” major like business or CS. In addition, I’d most likely be working for my parents on days I don’t have class. This means that I’d have to go back to being around my family constantly, which has made me unhappy since before college. 

This is where I’m asking for advice: Should I take out student loans to go to college in NYC, or should I transfer to the university near my house? If I were to go to college in NY, I would end up graduating with a theatre design major and a minor or two, and also with a fair amount of debt (although I would be working part time while there to start paying off the debt early). However, I’d be happy living away from my family. If I were to stay with my family and attend the university nearby, I wouldn’t have debt (at least, not directly, I think my parents would still have to take out small loans for tuition... probably 15-20k or less over the next 3 years), and I’d be stuck with a degree I don’t care for (CS, Global Business, etc.), and I would be unhappy until I get a job and move out on my own. So... what should I do?",21Jul2020,1
105,"I dropped out in 7th grade. I’m now 16 and really want to get my life back together. In 7th grade i was taking 8th grade classes and I was really on top of it. Currently I am doing florida virtual flex, i’m signed up through a private umbrella school and i’ve only been enrolled for a few months. I said i was signing up for 9th grade so technically I am in ninth grade, however i’ve only taken one class, algebra 1. I’ve only completed one semester and i truly can’t keep up with online. I originally dropped out due to severe depression and lack of parenting, obviously. I know this is all over the place and i’m sorry but, I was wondering if anyone had any clue how i could enroll in public school since i don’t have transcripts or anything. I’m currently homeless with my mother and siblings so maybe they’ll give me sympathy if I explain the situation to them lol.

The actual issue I need help with is separating these two parts which are now fused by super glue. In the process of undoing the first mistake with the glue gun some air drying super glue air dried.....on parts it wasn't supposed to and now these two parts which are supposed to move are now permanently adhered to each other. I tried using a pocket knife to try and saw out the super glue, but that has primarily lead nowhere as the glue is that hard, my blade is that dull, and three after the fourth time the pocket knife slipped from my grasp and nicked my hand I gave up and knew I was defeated.  


Here's an imgur album with the pieces that are SUPPOSED to move, but have since been rendered immobile and are stuck in a position where a hot glue stick CANNOT pass through the opening, as well as the kind of super glue I used. I know it's not that visible or at all in the pictures but the little lever/tab looking thing is supposed to go up and down, but it can't because it's super glued to the side of the thing that holds it because of course it is.

109,"Hi! I am an extrovert and with covid and all the restrictions thatve come along with it, I’ve been really struggling. My boyfriend actually got covid about 5 weeks ago now (he works in health care and got it there). I never experienced symptoms, so I had to quarantine for 28 days, and it sucked so bad. I cried every day, and I’m starting to question what the point of life is. Like, if COVID lasts until 2021 or 2022, I don’t know if I’m going to manage. What’s the point of life if I’m not doing the things that make me happy, bring me joy, or give me purpose. Living a sad life that I hate? My favorite things to do are, go to bars, visit my friends (they live all over the state), go to bonfires, host dinner parties, visit my family etc. Pretty much all things that aren’t allowed right now, unfortunately. I do work around people that I genuinely enjoy so that helps, but even then we’ve been giving strict social distancing rules and can’t have fun like we used to. I’ve been smart and safe (mask, distancing, canceling trips) hence the emotional drainage. What can I do to stop feeling so crappy and stop the fear of missing out on my whole life?",21Jul2020,2
110,"So, last night my brother in law (he's 30) gave me (31) a ride to my apartment and we were talking regularly as usual about work stuff and funny memes. He came in to help me fix a door and after that I thought he would leave, but he sat down and told me he wanted to talked to me about something. 

I got scared thinking maybe my sister was sick (she has been going a lot to the doctor lately) or that maybe he would ask for some money (they are often struggling with that). 

He told me not to get scared, that it wasn't anything bad. He took his time trying to come up with the right words and he looked kind of nervous. Then he proceeds to tell me how he has been having feelings for another girl lately. I was shocked. We have a good relationship but not the kind in which we talk about this kind of stuff. And then all I could think about was my sister and nephew and what if he has cheated on her... Then I just asked him why was he telling ME this and he says because the girl it's me. 

I have never been more at a lost for words than last night. I thought he was joking, and I laughed (in all honesty my sister is like an 8 and I'm a 5 in a very good day 😂 I'm not been modest. I'm disheveled, overweight, loud, funny but with a weird sense of humor. 

Anyway, he asked me if he was making me uncomfortable and I said yes. He said that he had been thinking about many things and he dreamed about me a couple of times (I didn't know how and I don't want to know) and cannot sleep well because of this. 

He says he usually talks about all sorts of things with my sister but this he cannot tell her so he talked with a friend from work and that guy told him that he should talk to me about it so he can get it out of his system.

He says he knows that I don't like this sort of things (deep, love related, gooey stuff) and he does not like all the drama that comes with cheating, and that he understands that I have not been doing anything to mislead him in any way (I really haven't)

I am not in any way interested in that man. I have made it very clear from many years ago that I am not interested in relationships, marriage or kids with anyone. Truthfully I'm not really interested in anyone right now nor thinking about any love relationship in any way.  I hate drama and I hate cheaters. And I love my sister so I just wanted to erase those 5 minutes.

I just didn't know what to say so I did an awful thing: I   explained him his own feelings 😅 

I do believe all this quarantine stuff it's affecting him, he has mostly men coworkers and the 'stay-at-home' new way of life has made it hard for him to go out in any social way. 

The only women he sees in a regular basis are my sister, my mom, his mom and me. He barely has time to see any TV and apparently my sister does not like him watching movies or shows with nudity in them (they sometimes laugh about this) so I believe he does not have an outlet for his feelings, frustrations or physical release other than my sister and maybe he is bored with that routine going for almost 4 months (?)


Finally, I do care about him because he's family to me, I have seen he is good with my sister and my nephew, and I always thought that we have a similar sense of humor and he's very outgoing, so it's easy to be around him, but honestly if he wasn't my brother in law we would not be friends. 

I really don't want him to have those feelings and I don't want to do anything to make him perpetuate them. 

So I have two questions:

1)  what should I do in order to try to make him forget about those feelings? 

I already decided that I am going to stay out of his way as much as possible, I'm not going to interact with him is social media anymore and try to avoid been alone with him as much as possible. I don't know if there is something else I can do.

2) He asked me not to tell my sister, should I keep it a secret?

I don't think he's dangerous and I don't think he will try to do anything to cheat on my sister (at least not with me). I think he understands that I will never do anything to hurt her, and in that regard I guess I shouldn't tell her. Also I am scared she will end up resenting me when I didn't do anything wrong ☹️ And since she believes more in the bonds you make by choosing people, between believing him or me, I think she would choose him always. We love each other but we do have different personalities 🤷🏻‍♀️

117,"So i have autism (16 M) (don't know why i felt the need to repeat that). I do pretty well however because I'm able to blend into a society which wasn't really built for people like me. I can talk, behave normally as such.

 My mum hasn't really paid much attention to me and we don't have that close of a relationship but she tends to tell me I've come a long way since I was a child (yes I know irrelevant info currently but I'll get there) 

I'm able to publicly speak, make friends and mask the pain I feel from sensory attacks really well. Sure, I've been called weird and the r slur but that's primarily because the people who called me that were just rude and i have a quirky personality. That's it.

So let me get to the point. Since lockdown begun, I've been attempting to mask my autism a lot less. It's a lot less stressful but at the same time it means when I get a sensory attack, I don't really hide it. 

I show it a bit more rather than gulping it down my throat and smiling instead. When my mum asked if I wanted to go shopping with her i said no and that I'd rather stay home. She kept trying to push me, i said no again. She said i could relax while going shopping and i told her i can't because it's a lot of effort to put on a mask (not the actual mask, i mean metaphorical one although the physical one is only hard to take off) and pretend I'm happy with going out while people watch me. This is where she snapped and started telling me I was ""regressing"" and my autism was getting ""worse"" because I was acting ""weak"".

 I didn't believe her, i knew that she was just being mean but I guess sub consciously over time, it has been in my head.

I was on the phone to one of my close close friends who know i have autism and all of a sudden while they were telling me a story. I couldn't speak. The words wouldn't come out. I tried really really hard but nothing. I texted her and told her what was going on and she understood and until I could speak again, she kept talking and I responded via texts. 

Once I could speak, I told her i was sorry that I wasted her time and shit but she didn't really care and she was just happy I could talk again. 

Now going mute/non verbal hasn't happened to me in over a year. And when it has happened, I've been alone, talking to myself or something. Not talking to anyone. I got scared and soon I started hyperventilating incase I was regressing.

 I don't know why this is happening. I'm a little scared because I thought I was getting better at talking to people more fluently. But now I feel scared that I'm actually getting worse. I don't know what to do. I told my dad what happened and even he was a little bit surprised because I've never talked to him about it either.

I've never really talked about going mute temporarily because it's a rare thing which has only happened sometimes and mostly when it doesn't matter one bit because I'm alone, not socialising.

I'm scared in case it is getting worse because I'm not making it anymore.

127,"I work as a traveling accountant. I go to various offices and help small business with their accounting. I can do almost all of my work remotely. There are only 3 clients that really prefer me to come in person but we’ve been making it work remotely during the pandemic. 

Once our state allowed us to return to offices, I went back to the 3 client offices. One of the offices had an employee (that I don’t interact with) test positive. Once I was informed, I self quarantined for 2 weeks. During that time, I called my doctor and asked if I should be tested. Given that I wasn’t showing signs and that I’m not in any at-risk category, she decided I didn’t need a test as long as I stayed asymptomatic.

Thursday will mark 4 weeks since I was exposed. I have not been going to client offices (or really anywhere) since. I’m a home body so it really hasn’t impacted my life too much.

A few days ago, my employer asked me to get a negative test before returning to client offices. They suggested I call my doctor. I called my doctor and, again, the nurses said they would not write me a prescription for a test because I was asymptomatic but I could try to take a test at CVS. I attempted to get a test at CVS but I was told I did not qualify after I filled out the questionnaire. I tried another local chain and was told the same thing. I explained this to my employer and they said they would get back to me.

Today, they emailed me a link to a website where I can buy a test. They gave me a list of instructions of what to click then asked me to buy the test and submit it on my expense report. The problem is, if I answer the questions honestly, I’m still being told I don’t qualify. 

In order to qualify to get the test, I would need to lie. 

This makes me wildly uncomfortable for a variety of reasons. Mainly, I don’t like that my employer is pressuring me to lie given that our profession is centered around being ethical. Unfortunately, our HR person left the company in early July so I have no where else to turn.

What should I do?

Should I just lie and order the test to appease my employer or stand by what healthcare providers are telling me?

129,"So whenever I'm reading a good book-mostly nonfiction- or watching a very realistic TV show, I tend to get very deep into it. I start to relate to it, tie it to things in my personal life and start to relate characters in those books or shows to people I know in real life and draw comparisons. Even nonfiction books that don't involve multiple characters or academic pieces tend to consume me and I become buried in it. 

Right now I'm reading a book about a big sociopolitical issue in my country that has existed for centuries. And I keep trying to understand the problems around me through the lenses of this book.  It's making me feel really depressed because I feel like history really is repeating itself and things will only keep getting worse. Because that's what happened back then and that's what I'm reading in the book. I keep tying together the past with the present and it's driving me insane.

Whenever I get too deep into anything, somehow it fuels my mental illness and makes me feel really weird. It makes me question reality, makes me angry and bitter, and I feel like I fall into depression everytime I do this. I can't take things at face value and try to understand them without in some way embodying them, if that makes sense. If I want to understand a book or a show, I'll have to tie it to my real life and try to understand it through my own experiences and the way my life is. It's weird.

I went home for a month last christmas and it was hell, i was anxious bored sad etc... and the only thing that helped was having the excuse that i had to go to my room to work on homework but they are planning for me to come home right when my classes end.

along with going home they want me to drive with them in the rv from florida to colorado and make it a whole long fun family road trip. Not only is there a world wide pandemic happening ( that they believe is all a huge conspiracy and isn’t real) but i’m already so frustrated with them that sitting in an rv with them for weeks might make me drive the rv off a cliff.

i love my family but at the moment i just need a moment to myself to get settled and have some free time before starting classes the middle of august. ik i probably sound super spoiled and like an annoying little college girl but i’m hoping someone else has gone through this before or if there are any parents who have kids in college and know how my parents are feeling. sorry this was super long:/",21Jul2020,3
135,"So a little background for you guys, I moved in with a friend from high school (m28) and his mother (50s I think) about 6 months ago after they practically begged me. My former roommates were absolute slobs and they used their knowledge of this as leverage to coax me into the move. So my friend from high school doesn't work, and hasn't even looked for a job since I've been living here. He likes to spend his days playing video games and generally being a glutton. His mother is a sociopath (possible schizophrenic based on a comment my friend made one day) that's on disability, and has gotten so out of touch with the 'real world' that she doesn't realize how easy it is for any modern intelligent person to see through her facade.

Well, today they got back home right after I got home from work. I was talking to them and asking how their day was when I noticed a new garden hose sitting on the table. I had just broken one of theirs last week while using it to clean my car. So I went out and replaced it with an even better one, but it was missing a part (the open box should have tipped me off, but I just wrote it off as a casualty of logistics) when I got home and took it out of the box. I said I'd exchange it the following day (today) once I got home. 

Naturally, I was puzzled so I asked her why she'd buy one when I just bought one and she responded ""I don't have time to wait for you to feel like doing it."" In a condescending tone.

To which, I responded ""I just walked in the door literally five minutes ago and haven't had the chance to yet. That's fine, I'll just return mine instead of exchanging it. Whatever.""

As she was walking back out to the car she began to tell her son, who was standing maybe two feet away from me, ""tell him to buy the propane for the grill instead and-""

I turned around, walked back to my room while saying ""nope, I'm good."" Because her tone had started this ball of anxiety curling up in the pit of my stomach. I changed out of my work clothes and left to return the hose, &lt;locking my bedroom door on the way out.&gt;

While at the store, once the ball in my stomach dissipated, it formed into a hunch. I used some of the money I spent on the hose to buy a security camera for my room. I set it up as I got home and went into my friends room to play video games for a while. He mentioned how he just got yelled at because of me and how she didn't like my tone. I said ""I didn't like hers either. Like who the f*ck does she think she is?""

""The homeowner? Also she said if you don't get the propane you will not be allowed to use the grill."" His response.

""Yeah, but shes trying to tell me what to do like she owns me, too. And I'm not okay with that. But I am totally cool with not using the grill"" and that was that.. or so I thought.

We went back to gaming and after a while he was just texting on his phone and not playing anymore. I decided I was done too and went back to my room. I had barely sat down when i hear her screaming. I couldn't hear everything through the door, but I did hear most of it. ""I'm not gonna walk around on egg shells in my own house. F*ck you and f*ck him! You can both get your shit and get out! This is my f*cking house! Lock the door all you want, I have the key and I'll get in there if I want to!""

I was shocked. Up until today I thought maybe my gut was wrong and maybe she did actually care about me. I now know that she doesn't, hasn't, and will never respect my boundaries or privacy. I'm glad I bought that camera, it let's me schedule when the motion detection sensor is on. This is great because I work a lot and would have no knowledge if they did break in and do anything. I'm going to start looking for new places to live when I have some downtime at work tomorrow, but can anyone give me some advice on how to cover all of my bases fully in the interim? 

I have a small safe and a lock box she can't access but I can't fit much of anything in them. I fully believe she could potentially steal/destroy my stuff.",21Jul2020,1

137,I met this girl in February and she lives far away but Since the day we met we have texted constantly and everything was amazing she said she really liked me more than anyone and everything was so perfect ! Then around May I noticed she stopped and avoided flirting or talking in a sexual manner like we always did messing ! I noticed there was was gaps in the conversations and I sent her paragraphs and asked does she still like me and to tell me if she ever felt different cause we always promised honesty! She still insists she likes me and nothing has changed and she was “busy with school ” and that everything will be how it used to after school but school has been over 2 weeks and she’s no different ! I can see her posting instagram stories all day ! But my snapchats remain delivered ! so Shes avoiding opening them but when she does open them she says she was busy all day and she’s so sorry and everything ?? I know something is 100% changed but she insists absolutely nothing has but she would constantly send Xx’s and we always flirted but that’s completely gone ?

138," Hi, quarentineing has really hit me (16M) hard, and it has also given me a lot of time to think. There is one girl (16 or 17F) that is down to earth, kind, funny, beautiful, ect. who I've had a crush on for a while who I want to ask out when the world gets a bit less crazy than it is right now. I have a few problems: first off I have been pretty socially awkward in the past when it comes to talking to girls that I like, I have a friend/aquantence (we aren't very close) who asked her to homecoming last year but she refused (not out of dislike for him, but a different reason), and if she says yes I'm not even sure what to do from there. Right now I am planning on firstly asking her best friend (who happens to be one of my friends also) if she has a bf, if the answer is no and I don't get to nervous I will probably tell her how I feel. I don't know where or how to tell her how I feel. Also how can I ask her out in a way that won't burn the bridge between me and my friend?",21Jul2020,1
139,"Edit: I'm a twenty year old male. I forgot to mention that before.

I could use some advice about a situation I currently find myself in. discretion is advised since there might be topics which some might see as disturbing in some sort of way. I know that I am not really the most compassionate person out here (partly because I have a mild form of autism). I have recently encountered something I am not sure what to do anymore. I might personally not see the bigger picture here but I would at least like to know how I can help this person out despite my own flaws.

Okay, so I recently got into an argument with a user from a discord server which I am an admin on. I noticed some hostility when talking to said user and decided to ask what was wrong. I got told that it was because of my (and the owner's) lack of action regarding something that went on in DMs between that user and a different user some time back. She was contacted by some kid who made a rather desperate attempt at getting nudes. One fellow admin was willing to ban the guy as requested by the user. Me and the owner of the server however both agreed that it wasn't something we could ban the user for since it was just a kid who attempted it only once and he kept it out of the server itself. I personally believed this could be fixed by simply blocking the guy. This is my explanation of my decision I sent to the user today and the response I got back.

(Me):

I believe (OWNER) had a similar view of the situation to mine.

But since (ADMIN) was the only one you spoke to (as far as I know), that might have influenced the outcome a little bit.

From what I had seen from the situation, he was just being desperate and pervy, as you can see from what I said in the conversation between me and (ADMIN)

And since he kept it out of the server, it really wasn't too big of a deal for the server itself.

I assumed you would have no problem with just blocking him on there so you didn't have to deal with him.

But apparently I assumed wrong, and nobody told me just how big of an impact it really had on you either. So I assumed things were alright again

So I apologize for not seeing that. But I do not regret the decision I made regarding my limited information on the subject, not a bit.  
 So I apologize for not seeing that. But I do not regret the decision I made regarding my limited information on the subject, not a bit.

I hope that clears some things up for you.  
And if not, well. I tried anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

The fact your so non-shelont about it just goes to show you are not bothered by a pervert asking a female for nudes when she was simply talking to him is gross. And the fact that knowing that OWNER fucks a girl and lives with her I figured he would’ve given more of a shit about since I had a SIMILAR issue with another guy and OWNER kicked him out with no questions. Guess times have really changed on you guys which is rather disappointing. I considered you guys my friends but I guess I am just a number.  Yes I have a huge problem with it since I was almost sexually assaulted in my life, almost kidnapped, and had a stalker for a time. A guy asking for nudes? Can become something bigger. But I guess you guys are like the cops and just throw it to the side until someone is actually IN DANGER or HURT before y’all care. Hm, guess I put too much of a hope into you guys.  And you saying you tried? That’s a lousy effort of trying.   


I know that I am obviously in the wrong here, but I can't really tell how by myself. I really appreciate any input you guys have.

141,"So I’m a girl and I’m 22 now. However when I was in high school I started getting like these longer hairs on my chin. It was maybe like 3 hairs. It got a little more and I went to the dermatologist. They did tests (like checking my hormones) and I was told not to worry about it and everything looked fine.  I also went to my PA a couple of years later and she didn’t seem concerned about it either and suggested laser hair removal if it bothered me. You can’t see them unless you’re up close. 

Now I’m 22 and the hairs aren’t a lot at all. But I pull out like 15 hairs. Most in my chin area and then 4-5 in like my jaw area/ the area below my contour.

143,"Ok, everything just sucks right now for me,

First off, 

Last week  my sister was really stupid and snuck out and got brought home by a cop at 4 am. She left a big burden on my family, just because she could have been kidnapped and we would have never seen her again. Shes been in a weird mood for the past few days, i mean who wouldn't be. My heart hurts for her very much. 

Secondly, 

My friends have changed, I'm so worried about being lonely this year, ill admit, I've done some stupid stuff to hurt people and I hate myself for it. I think i was depressed and i think i took it out on people and now I've realized what I've done, Here's some examples, 

A- I ruined it with a guy, I made fun of him and i never met to hurt him, i aplogized but he was being passive agressive, and i feel so horrible. 

B-I called my friend a sl\*t, and its gotten around and I know people have hated me for hurting her and I just know they hate me for what I've done. I'm known as the mean girl, and i dont even know, if im overthinking or if this true and i hate that i overthink so much. 

C-My friend told me i didnt treat her right, I never understood what I did and she never talks to me anymore.

I just dont want to tell my parents or anyone because I dont want to look like an attention seeker, so thats why i come to here lol. 

I might be moving to the public school in my area if we go to online, and at this point, I dont mind, 

What are your thoughts? 

P.S. sorry for any typos, this computer is wack.",21Jul2020,2
145,"So as the title says, I believe I have one hell of a situation going on in my life right now(at least in my own mind/world)...

Some background info is that I am a 22 year old male. Currently living with my mother and step father. I was diagnosed with multiple chronic illnesses when I was about 14. Stemming from the chronic illnesses is depression/anxiety. I am in debt(about $10-15k) - my credit is terrible. I have a newer Honda Civic sport car(2017) that I need to pay for and maintain.
But tied for number one on my list with my health, is achieving my dream of becoming a pro gamer before it’s too late.

Sorry for the crazy amount of random info there, but it is just a crazy scenario to me. Meaning that when I was 12 years old, which I believed to be the best year of my life; I never expected to be where I am right now - I didn’t expect to have had severe debilitating health issues/symptoms for 8+ years now; or suffering from depression/anxiety; or many other things. 
But I guess I have to accept where I am right now and that it could always be worse as I’ve always tried to keep somewhat of a positive mindset overall even when I was at my lowest points(in example - in a wheelchair having panic attack everyday not knowing what’s going on with me, asking myself when this will end; I mean I still ask myself that last one but still). 

So having many of the same symptoms as I did when I was diagnosed almost a decade ago and knowing there is no cure currently and that I might live with it forever seriously depresses me. I feel like I want to live, and somewhat normally, but I can’t. So that’s #1 problem in my life.

Then, underneath all of this pain, suffering, and trying to figure it all out by going to doctor and doctor again, there’s still part of me that wants to achieve my dream - becoming a professional gamer. I know most of you might tell me “I’m too old now, I’m 22” or “take the safe route in life by finding a career I’m interested in with health benefits and retirement plan, etc.”... 
It is just not how I am. I ultimately don’t want to live a normal life. Meaning I want to be financially set and free, be able to do what I want when I want(not in a rude way either), have a family, and at least leave a legacy that I tried my best and I did all I could possibly have done. 

Even though I’m thinking somewhat “grand” maybe, I’m willing to shoot for the stars because i know I can do it before it’s too late, but how?! -

When I also am in debt pretty bad from messing up right out of high school and damaging my credit and applying for credit cards and loans. And I was a screwed with medical bills that weren’t covered(that’s another long story). And I also have a brand new car in 2017 that I need to pay an arm and leg for each month with insurance. - and I think of positing/listing it and transferring the title through a third party website, but I’m not sure if I want to, however I am willing to for my dream.

The last thing is that my mother doesn’t support my dream at all. Hates it actually. It hurts. But I am unemployed as of a week ago. I quit as a certified pharmacy technician because I couldn’t handle the physical pain being upright all day, as it relates to one of my chronic illnesses, but it’s not an excuse. I just feel trapped when I want to take a risk and fulfill my dream, and there are soo many barriers in the way.

I don’t know if any of this is possible... 

In summary:(and in my opinion)

1. I need to prioritize my health - because not only is it base of living, but it will help me be a better person in anything I do. 
2. I need to get out of debt - but should I find a new career path? I am certified as a pharmacy technician, which is alright money, but I hate it honestly. And I’m not sure what else I would tolerate(not very physical jobs/outside jobs).
3. Even though it’s my passion and I believe I can do it, is pro gaming even worth my time or should I just move on?..
4. Maybe I need to work on finding a new mental therapist(not mentioned before), but I’ve been seeing the same one for 6+ years and maybe I need someone to help me better as you guys can see I’m stressed in this post. 
5. How can I stay disciplined with anything and hold myself accountable to never digress? - as i have multiple times in the past to only put me into a more of a negative hole.

146,"there’s a girl in my friend group it’s mostly made up of boys, we used to all get along with no fighting no drama none of that. Then just one day we had a problem and we all started having some issues with eachother. that one girl is being targeted, all the boys (I’m a male btw) have said stuff about her and said that she’s annoying, and some of the stuff she has done to us has been annoying and just made us get mad at her, it isn’t a big deal to be honest, I think I honestly messed up where me and my other friend in the group started warning my 2 other friends who were currently having an issue with her, about the kind of person she can be when you have a problem with her, and I got too carried away and this entire situation escalated we as a whole group started beefing with eachother for awhile until 2 of our other friends calmed us down and convinced us to drop this drama and move on and we all eventually forgave eachother and they forgave me for lying cause I technically was without even realizing it, I realize now I was in the wrong too and I shouldn’t have overreacted and brought up what others have said in the past and what I thought people were saying, which made me look bad ofc but now where all cool now but My friend isn’t the girl I’m talking about she’s convinced herself that people hate her and think she’s annoying because of what the guys have said about her and because of me, I regret saying all those things about her and making those bad decisions under so much pressure from this drama I just wanna reverse it and fix everything with this girl cause she’s special to me and I don’t want her thinking I’m always gonna be a toxic and going to do the same things over again when I’ve tried my best to change (and I have). I don’t want her feeling worried and feeling stressed out from all this stuff she doesn’t deserve this she just wants to be happy with no drama and just to be civil like I want to with her. I wanna make sure I resolve everything with her and make her feel safe knowing nothing will happen but I don’t know how to convince her, we’re in the same friend group and I don’t wanna feel awkward around her. she feels like everyone hates her when in reality hate is a strong word I try to tell her everything will be ok and they don’t hate you it’s just a misunderstanding. the drama that happened currently just now is pointless I’m pretty sure one of the friends are over it and apologized and  the other was just being disrespectful and asking for oral sex. 

I’m confused, I don’t want this drama it’s taking a toll on me and probably a bigger one on my female friend, I’m just looking out for her and making sure she’s ok but it’s hard to do that when I’m being called a simp, I know what she thinks of me the way she thinks of me now isn’t what I like but I just have to accept it and hopefully she can give me another chance, she doesn’t deserve what shes feeling in my opinion despite the fact that some people don’t like her. I’ve apologized already and she seems cool with me ig but I wanna prove to her I won’t mess up anymore I loved what we used to have together and I dreamed of hanging out with her and talking on ft late at night making her laugh.",21Jul2020,2

a little backstory, m and d got married in 2000s but had a lot of miscarriages and eventually had me in 2006.

m has always been very overprotective of me when i was a child i wasn’t even allowed to have my phone in the same room as me while i sleep up until 1 week ago. d doesn’t really have any say in anything m does, he just follows along. i’m not allowed to go out for sleepovers, but my hair by myself, dye my hair go out with my friends that often, not allowed to spend my own money on things i want etc. i’ve been pretty much ignoring all of this until recently. m and d always find things wrong abt me whenever i’m with them saying this (i’m too skinny, too stupid, don’t use my brain enough, don’t have a good sense of style etc) so i stopped interacting with them and starting to be more quiet in a way. my friends have been really supportive of me through everything and have been constantly reminding me how much i’m worth and how much i matter. m got on my last nerve (sounds bad ik) today. i was watching tv after i gave her some lunch (just microwaved some leftovers) and she completely went off at me, calling me psychotic and saying i need therapy because i’m always on my phone and don’t do anything right, she completely forbid me from going outside and hanging out with my friends, i’ve had to cancel at least 3 plans because of this and i don’t know what to do. she’s making me feel very worthless and stupid. (i’m not on my phone all the time i go for walks w my parents and talk to them as much as possible) as much as i hate saying this i can’t wait to move and out and leave, m has done nothing for me and when i say smt she hits me with the ""i shouldn’t have taught u how to speak"" or ""i gave u this house be thankful"". my birthday was a couple of days ago and i had been talking about wanting a cat for at least 3 years and the day before my birthday she said to me that she was going to get me one but i wasn’t worth that much.i’ve learned how to cope with most of these things but i can’t help and be jealous of my friends because they have such chill parents.

Hello, as the tittle says I am not so sure if this is normal or not.
The problem at hand is that i really don’t really get that emotional or even sad in the regard when I hear that somebody died.
When I hear about the death of someone famous or even sometimes some people I know, and sometimes far family that they  died the only “emotion” if u can call it ,is the little shock when I hear it and in my mind I just say like “Wow he’s really dead ?” In a questioning manner.
Now these aren’t people that I spent that much time or even if we spent time  in my early years we then drifted apart, I just feel that it’s not healthy and even a little cold that I am just really not experiencing some kind of longer shock or some emotion like sadness or anger.
Fortunately I never had people close to me die , and I wish that the situation stays like this for a long time , but sometimes I question my self if someone close to me dies is that all that I will do the “Guess they’re dead now “ and nothing else.
I still experience emotion like anger.
But sometimes I have this kind of “depressive episodes” if u can call it since I was never checked out for any mental conditions and I don’t wanna throw the word depression loosely, and in this episodes sure I feel sad sometimes but that is toward myself since I have some insecurities and when somedays it gets really bad ,even the trust issues that I had in the past and that they still linger today from time to time get really strong.
So I am concerned in a way that I can’t feel sadness towards another person , as I said there are people that I love and am really close that I would take a bullet for them but if they died would I even feel sad or anger or just go “Nothing you can do life goes on”.

158,"I am a straight male and I have a good friend of mine who is bisexual. We’ve become really close this year and I’m very happy to be his friend. Just like any other guy would, we wanted to plan a sleepover type of thing at my house. However my parents were against that for some reason. 

I asked why it wasn’t a big deal if another one of my friends can sleepover (who is straight) but my bi friend can’t. They straight up said it’s because of his romantic preference. My mom retaliated by saying that she respects him but it’s not correct at all for us to have a sleepover. I was extremely upset obviously; more so because I felt very bad for my friend. I can’t possibly tell him that the reason he can’t sleepover is essentially because he’s bisexual.

I feel like I have good mental health (as in I don't have depression and other things like that), but I would still like to see a therapist because I feel like it would be a good way to better understand myself. My only issue is that I have never had an awkward conversation with my parents EVER, and it's hard for me to talk about this kind of stuff with them because I'm not sure how they would react. I'm sure they wouldn't get angry or anything but I think they would be more concerned if anything, like they need a reason for me to see a therapist, when I wish they would just say yes no questions asked, but that's a lot to ask.

Another issue is the money. My parents are very careful with their money as they don't make too much combined, so I feel like it would make it harder to save money for things.

We've been getting some very hot days, and being in a top floor apartment with no way to cycle air anywhere has turned my apartment into an oven. Temperatures are as high as 105 during the day inside my apartment, even with the window open. I've been staving off heat exhaustion by either being at work (11-3 every weekday) or sitting in my shower and running cold water over myself. I'm becoming more and more ill. I've got a constant fever and headaches. I can't sleep. One of my neighbors has already been hospitalized for heat stroke.

167,"**TL;DR: friend had family only wedding, but our other friends attend wedding while I was not invited because he thought I was out of town. High chance other friends think I just didn't show up, should I let them know I wasn't invited so I don't end up an asshole in everyone's eyes?**

For a bit of context, my friends and I grew up together and we're all home in our hometown for summer (separately visiting family). We had all been invited to one friends wedding, but then they postponed the wedding party because of COVID and decided to have a small ceremony this summer to still get married (allowed in our country). On the Facebook group they wrote it would be *close family only*, so I never had reason to think there would be a possibility to attend.

A week before the ceremony another friend (**note**: not the one getting married) asks me through our group chat how long I will be staying in our hometown. I was planning on leaving a few days before their ceremony so I wrote that for all to see, but ultimately I decided on staying longer which I didn't inform them of. I was staying to spend time with my parents. 

Skip to wedding day, I see on Instagram that all my other friends are attending the ceremony. One is the best man, which I knew and that's fine, but two other friends are attending. I check if I somehow  overlooked an invitation, but there was none. And they never wrote in the Facebook group or the group chat that friends could attend. So the fact is I wasn't informed or invited. 

At this point one of the friends who attended had invited me to come to his place the day after the wedding and have dinner with everyone including the married couple. (**Note**: He did not know if I was in town or not when he called.) So I went, and literally everyone except the one who invited me was surprised to see me. Everyone thought I'd left town. The married couple arrives, and it becomes apparent that they didn't ask me to the ceremony because they thought I was not in town. Now, I don't live far away anyway, so I find it really weird that they didn't just inform me that it was possible for friends to attend regardless of where I was on earth. If I wasn't in town I would have come back if I knew I could attend the wedding. This just tells me that they didn't care much if I was there or not. I understand the stress of wedding arrangements, but they obviously thought of inviting the other friends while in my case it was dependent on whether or not I was in town. If it was a spontaneous idea, they could have checked if I was available, but they didn't. The other friend was the one who asked in the group chat how long I was staying and that was over a week before the wedding. So they saw that and decided not to ask me. 

Anyway, they were obviously very uncomfortable because I was there the day after, and the groom seemed at a loss and just said ""now I feel really bad"". I didn't ask about it, I just said ""it's fine"" and then nobody talked about it anymore. We went on with the dinner and had fun though they were still visibly uncomfortable. 

I'm sort of getting over him not inviting me, but now I'm worried that my other friends think I was invited and just didn't show. 

I think this because I know for a fact that the other friends would have asked I was coming or why I was not there, and from the groom's perspective there's no other explanation than ""he said he'd be out of town"". He's not going to say I wasn't invited, because he used my ""absence from town"" as the reason for not inviting me. Which makes me out to be a bad friend who doesn't care about his friend's wedding enough to show up. Or worse, says he can't attend because he is leaving, and then stays in town. I'm an asshole either way. I even made a ""congratulations"" video at the request of the bridesmaid for a surprise compilation video, specifically *because friends could not attend*. I look like a complete idiot now. 

I really want my other friends to know that I was under the impression that it was ""family only"" and that I was never invited. Otherwise this could damage everyone's view of me even though I did nothing wrong. But I realise that would be bad mouthing the groom in a way, even though it would be the truth. 

Would it be dumb to bring this up with my other friends? I would explain that I don't begrudge the groom and that I hold no bad feelings towards him. I feel like I don't deserve to potentially take a hit with all of my friends because of this.",21Jul2020,1

172,"I have a couple reasons I'm stressed about going to college in a month, and any advice for dealing with the situation would be welcome.

-First off, I haven't really learned to drive yet. I've tried and not done so well because I have poor hand eye coordination. What should I do? Keep practicing when I have the time? Or just wait another year until I'm 19 or so? There's certainly time before I get my first real, out of college job. But how long should I really be putting off driving?

-Secondly, I am a bit worried about the Covid situation since I'll be living on campus. I am a hypochondriac of sorts, and this virus scares me. I know I'll probably recover from it if I get it, but how easily? This virus can still hit young people pretty hard. While I'm by no means obese, I'm a bit overweight and my blood pressure is high. And then of course there's the issue of possibly spreading it to family, since my college is close to home.

-Third, what do I do when it comes to friendships/dating? Particularly when I'm scared because of that 2nd thing I mentioned. And on top of that, I'm a pretty hardcore introvert. So it's hard for me to make friends, but I still feel like I need some. And then there's dating. I haven't had a girlfriend in years, and although they provide stress... it's more of a eustress. I want to find a gf, but at the same time, should I not rush things? Should I be patient? My brain says yes, but my heart just wants someone who will make me a little less lonely.

-Fourth, I'm still debating if I've picked the right major. I want to major in Secondary Education and become a History teacher. But one area with me that I'm confident in is my knowledge with social studies kinda stuff, and I was strongly considering other majors that fit that... Political science and journalism. If I'm not liking my classes, should I switch my major? Or stick with it?

TL;DR: Incoming college freshman worried about Covid, relationships, lack of driving abilities, and kinda questioning major choice. Send help...",21Jul2020,2
174,"I don't know were else to go and I don't really know if I'm looking for any specific advice (I'll take anything). I hope this is the right place, sorry if its not.

I won't give my approximate age but I'm in my late teens, though you could've gathered that latter on. So, for the past few years I've felt morally out of place in my family, though I feel like that's normal for most teens. I have the complete opposite view points on life as they do. They are all Christians, conservatives, homophobes, and Racist. Me, I just want to speak good of others and help make the most of everyone's life. Though my family is like this, it doesn't make me love them any less it just makes me have severe anxiety about the future.

My mother seems to expect perfection out of me and if not that then she's constantly finding ways that I could've been better. A few months ago she said that I was worthless and never did anything for her or the family (even though I just just helped her remodel the entire house.) Things like that really bother me and maybe they shouldn't, I guess just another one of my inadequacies. A few days ago I got my AP test scores back, I failed both of them, I didn't really want to tell her because I knew she would make me feel bad about in some way whether it was unintentional or not. A few hours ago we were talking about my failed attempt as band section leader and she asked about the AP scores, I told her, she proceeded to correct my every mistake. She told me that I shouldn't pursue my passions in leadership if I couldn't convey things through writing and that maybe its a good that I didn't get section leader so I could focus more on school. I just want to be my best and no I don't think I should be perfect or live up to other peoples standards but its hard not to try.

177,"I hope this isn't too much of a vent, I just wanted to explain my circumstances, and maybe find some perspective, or even someone with a similar experience.

I am 29 years old, and I've lost a lot of time. When I was 20 I went back to school to get a bachelors in Psychology, but I was really just confused at that time in my life. I was stubborn. When I started realizing that I hated the field, I was 2 years in, and figured I should just push through. Eventually I realized that I couldn't do it. There was no future the degree could bring me that I wanted. I grew unhappy, struggled with drinking, partying, and spent 4 years in that program by the time I had finished the programs 3rd year. I dropped out. Was 24 years old and 25K in student debt. I spent a year not doing much, helped manage a liquor depot. It was not bad actually, and I realized a few things. I was happy with a simple life of moderate income, didn't want children, but I still didn't know where I wanted to take my career.

Then things kind of went to shit. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Spent years zonked out on heavy medication. I was deeply unhappy, but I discovered something. I took up reading. I struggled to enjoy just about everything, but reading always calmed me. After I started to consume books (mostly novels) quite heavily I started writing too. For the first couple of years I had issues with psychosis, but after a while my symptoms subsided, and my diagnosis was even changed to schizoaffective disorder. As time passed I became more and more in control of myself. By the time I was 27, I understood that I wanted to go back to school and pursue a degree in English. I'm now in my second year of that degree. For quite a while now, I've been dreaming of a job in academia. I was planning, and am still planning, to go for a PhD. I've earned solid A's so far with relative ease, and I just can't imagine doing anything where I won't be stimulated in the way I want to be.

I thought I was at peace with life, but a few months ago I felt like reality really hit me. By the time I finish my bachelors I will be 31, and 60K in debt (that's about 44K if you're American). By the time I get a Doctorate, I could be 35, 36, 37, I'm not sure yet, and I've been too nervous to even calculate what my student debt will be if I'm being honest. I've been overwhelmed by this feeling that my life has been wasted. I see what I want to do, but I'm scared. My sister is an extremely high earner, and although she is one of my closest friends, I've recently felt embarrassed to even be around her family. For the past five years I haven't really worked. I've been on assured income, while only doing small side jobs on my own. Tutoring for high-schoolers, assistant editing for a small website, writing essays for high-school and first years students online (surprisingly lucrative way to make money if you're good at it). There have been these doubt's that say ""just give up, try and pay back what you owe."" I don't know. I worry too if I have any more mental health problems. I just can't lose more time.

While I was wondering about the process of a career in academia, I think what I was most hoping to find was the perspective of people who have gone back to school late. Or just gone after their passion later in life. Did you ever suffer the insecurities of your age, of starting so late, or of your financial situation? Really any advice would be welcome.",21Jul2020,2

I’ve been having problems with a friend for a while, but in March of 2020 she decided to confront all the issues she has with me 
To do this, she sent me a tik tok that she made that said “when you’ve been having the same problems with your best friend as always and you’ve outgrown her but don’t say anything because you’ll feel guilty for causing drama but she has gc’s with all the friend group except and is ready to replace you if you step away so you’ll be the one that’s alone”
The fact that she started the convo with a tik tok left a bad taste in my mouth, but I left it alone and we tried to address the issues we’ve been having. It’s all normal petty girl stuff, but the more we talked the more I realized how narcissistic she sounded. She wanted me to change who I was as a person so she would like me better.
Of course, I didn’t share most of this with any of our friends. I really didn’t want to turn them against her, and the way she talked to me had the potential to. The thing is, I assumed she made the tik tok, posted it privately, then sent me the saved copy. 
Surprise! She didn’t! She posted it publicly on her account and the wording is CLEARLY aimed at me. Anyone who reads it and knows both of us knows it’s about me. I didn’t realize this until today.
I asked a few of my friends if they remembered her saying anything about it and apperently none of them saw her post at the time, but they remembered the girl hinting at checking her page, making a tik tok and telling them to go like it, etc.

188,"This starts two years ago. I had a summer student job, and had a fellow summer student coworker who was really nice, and we really got along well. On our last day working together, she mentioned that she was part Indigenous. I literally had no idea--it had never crossed my mind that she might be indigenous. Anyway, when she told me about her ethnic heritage, I became weird, awkward, and frankly a little racist. It felt like nothing I was saying would come out right, and every time I would say something, I would only make things worse.

She mentioned having a status card. I said something about not trusting the government--I don't know why. Somehow affirmative action came up, and I basically noted that had someone who wasn't a white male applied for my job, they would've been given automatic preference over me, which I would've been ok with despite liking my job. Neither of those were necessarily bad, I don't think, just awkward. However, the worst thing I said by far was that since my family only immigrated at the turn of the last century, we weren't responsible for oppression, and I basically minimized Indigenous suffering by pointing out that Italian Americans faced discrimination too, and therefore shouldn't be considered oppressors. I'm don't really know what I meant by that, but I think I was saying that since we suffered in the past, we shouldn't be considered privileged due to being white.

Anyway, I knew almost instantly that I was in the wrong, and had it not been our last day working together, I almost certainly would've apologized the next week. I mean, I feel bad for several reasons. I feel bad that learning her ethnicity put me off guard, and caused me to express sentiments I didn't even know that I harbored. I feel bad that her ethnicity caused me to be awkward, when she was nothing but respectful of my Italian heritage. I also feel bad that it took her two months to mention her ethnicity, since reactions like mine were possibly why she wasn't more expressive of her ethnicity in the first place. (I on the other hand, had probably been telling stories of long gone relatives throughout the entire summer.)

She didn't call me out on anything I said, so I'm not actually sure what she thought of the situation. However, the few times I've run into her since, she's been slightly colder than I would've otherwise expected, so I have a feeling that she was hurt by the things I said. I never apologized, and although it's been two years, I still think about whether I should apologize. Is it too late to do so? I've been giving renewed thought to the incident, since I myself have been having weird encounters with customers with regards to my ethnicity. See, I wear a name badge at my new job, and customers are constantly asking me about my name. Almost daily it gets confused with being a Spanish name, which doesn't bother me. What does bother me is the lady who asked me ""What are you?,"" and, upon telling her, proceeded to pronounce my name with the stereotypical Italian accent and hand gestures, then proceeded to make a joke where the punchline was about the stereotypical Italian accent. What bothers me is the guy who said I don't have the complexion (his word) of a *terroni* (my word). Not bothersome but still odd was the lady who told me she was so glad that ""we Canadians accept people with foreign names."" (I should add some people are much more sensitive and respectful when making conversation about my name.)

Some of these encounters make me feel kinda sucky, and they only serve to remind me of how I almost certainly made my friend feel at least a little bit sucky. Italian Americans experienced oppression, but Indigenous people experienced genocide (starting with Columbus, who many Italian Americans regard as their icon--the first ""immigrant""--and not as a genocidal madman), and I should've been more sensitive to that. I don't know if I should apologize, or how to go about apologizing after this much time (I've read that a late apology can make things worse, as it can open up healed wounds and such), or if she even remembers the conversation (it's been two years, after all). I don't know, if there's any advice anyone has to offer, I'd really appreciate the help.",21Jul2020,1

So for background, late last month, I applied for my first part-time job, and eventually got a call back about 2-weeks later from the assistant manager. We ended up scheduling a time for me to come in, for what I assume was an ‘interview’. However, it was VERY informal, and I was only asked a few questions about availability and my preferred type of work. It was never explicitly stated at the time, but I’m pretty sure the insinuation was that I was hired.

A couple of days later, while I was driving, I ended up getting called back, so I let the calls go to voicemail since I was on the highway. When I was able to stop and listen to them, I had ended up getting three voicemails from the same assistant manager from before telling me when I was supposed to go in for on-boarding. 

I think there was some miscommunication going on with the GM, because the assistant manager kept telling me different dates and times. The last date she gave me was about a week away, but she said it wouldn’t change. 

However, when I actually went in to do it, apparently the manager had already left, and the employee I talked to called her on the phone, and told me that she had said they’d already met some sort of ‘cap’ on how many people they could hire per week. They asked me who had told me to come in at that time, and it also turned out that the assistant manager was on vacation when I came in. The same employee who called the GM ended up taking my phone number, and said I’d get a call today (which I didn’t). 

From what I can tell, they lost a lot of employees because of the pandemic, and they just never came back to work, so they are desperate for new ones. It also seemed to me like they had been in the process of hiring lots of different people at the same time, because of how they kept shuffling around the date for my on-boarding. The employee I talked to also said that things had been hectic that day (no real context though). 

I’ve never had a job before, or have even gone through the process of trying to get one, so I am VERY confused about what is going on, and what to do. I don’t know if I should call back, or if that would just make everything more confusing for the management. I’m inclined to wait, mostly because I’m worried about being pushy. However, I would appreciate any advice on what to do, because I am incredibly under-experienced for this type of scenario. I couldn’t even tell you if this seems like a typical situation.

Sorry if my explanation sucks, and if it sounds confusing, but to be honest, I am probably just as confused as anyone reading this. It’s also 10:30 PM and I’m tired, and should honestly be asleep, but my circadian rhythm hates me. So forgive me for sort of rambling. Anyways, I’d really appreciate any advice I can get for this. 

For reference, I still have all of the voicemail transcripts from the assistant manager. I can quote them if it would help this make more sense.",21Jul2020,1

we’re doing an open relationship long distance and are both incredibly committed to making it work. i dont doubt that in the long term we’ll be okay but i need help coping with the first few days/weeks.

192," 

I have a stone cold expression all the time. My eyebrows hang pretty low unless I'm intentionally raising them which makes me look pissed. My mouth is essentially in a constant frown unless I'm smiling/laughing. While it's not a physical trait, I also have a very monotone voice. Even when I *feel* as though I'm putting lots of expression into my voice, it's still totally monotone! Honestly, no matter how hard I try and focus on myself, I just look constantly fucked off. I'm beginning to feel as though I won't ever be able to fix these things, because I've been doing them my whole life (nearly 18). It must be so deeply ingrained into my muscle memory by this point.

I wouldn't care if it didn't affect my ability to make friends. People clearly don't see me as approachable, and I don't blame them! To top it off, I've always been shy. It's gotten better recently but I still struggle to initiate friendships and be the instigator of friendship. Not a problem if you at least *appear* friendly, which I don't.

My ultimate concern will be my inability to befriend people in a work environment. Working your way up the ladder is very much to do with working hard and being good at your job, sure, but it also hugely important to be personable. I'm okay when people get to know me and I feel more comfortable with them but for the uninitiated, I look like I'm constantly on the verge of straying into oncoming traffic to get it all over with. It's a nightmare. Even then, the people that know me the best still describe me as 'quiet', 'a man of few words', 'a thinker', etc.

To an extent, I should just be comfortable with myself and not worry blah blah blah but I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS PERSON. I just feel as though I physically can't do anything about it. Makes me frustrated to the point of tears sometimes :/

Can anyone relate? Did you get past it? How??? Desperate for any help.",21Jul2020,1

[21 F]
My parents have always been open with me about some of the family issues and concerns. There were times where their relationship was shaky but that is when i was not concerned. 

My mom, however, has always been acting weird, ever since i was aware of the world. I was never allowed to touch her phone, not even to check the time, not for any reason at all. She would spend time alone in her bedroom even when the household has a ‘no closed doors’ policy (which i now think was because of her actions, she would impose that rule because a closed door would mean secrecy and untrustworthiness). By the time i was 16, i found out her laptop passcode (that i was not allowed to open) and looked through her pictures. 

Unfortunately, there was a couple of pictures with a man i did not know and have never seen. There were also pictures of my dad’s phone with texts of him trying to flirt with other women. 

I was shook. I felt sick. I could not sleep or eat or think. After a couple of days i reopened those pictures just to make sure i had not dreamt the whole thing. They were real. 

A year later, we had moved countries (just me, her and my sibling). By then, i had not looked at my mother the same. I know both my parents were wrong but i have no proof of my dad ever getting into a relationship with the women. It is only my mom who had kept pictures of her kissing the other man. I basically could not believe it. 

That year (i was around 17-18), we started fighting a lot. I had all this bottled up anger at her and i could not shake the feelings away or ignore them. That woman who gave birth to me, was just a stranger, she was ugly to me. I lost all respect. One day, she sat me down and asked me why i was so against her. And then i confronted her about it. She told me, crying, that she only did it for revenge because she found my dad’s texts. She made me delete the pictures that i had took as proof for my story then. 

But i knew it was not that simple. Fast forward to this year. I accidentally gained access to her email from my own laptop. Jackpot. Chat backups. Pictures. Videos. Voice messages. Their codewords. A Word doc with a long ass letter that he has sent to her after we moved countries describing the first time they slept together (i wanted to scratch out my eyeballs). I copied everything to my hard disk and hid it. 

The relationship had been going on for 10 years. They were sleeping together regularly, she used to skip work for him. He knew where we were at all times, he would wish me happy birthday, and he knew when we would be at school and what my academic success was like. That piece of s**t would also follow us to a chalet where we would stay every summer, so he can look at my mom from afar. They were planning on divorcing their partners and getting married. But they broke up after my first confrontation to her (as per the email’s date).

I still have so much resentment from this. She is keeping her old cell phone with a different phone number and she still pays for it. I have not gained access to it yet but i feel like it is my only missing piece of the puzzle before my plan is complete. 

It has become a toxic relationship and household with her. I feel like i should blackmail her so she would stop being a narcissistic parents and treat us so badly (different story). Should i? I am lost and i feel like all i want to do is ruin my relationship with her and move away.",21Jul2020,1

204,"Hi

Male, 25 yo

So recently I have discovered that I have depression. I wasn’t diagnosed by a doctor, but some people told me so, one of them is a 6th year medicine student. Checked symptoms online, losing interest to do anything, sudden and unexplained weight loss, etc. 

I have become depressed due to COVID-19 and the lockdown it caused. Where I live we still have partial curfew. Been unemployed for half a year now, and after getting accepted to a prestigious university in I cannot travel to pursue my studies. And due to all the uncertainty in the air I became depressed as hell. I just sit all day at home doing nothing but check social media.

When I tried assessing myself, I know for a fact that 2020 isn’t the reason for my depression. It just triggered what is really bugging me all those years. It’s me being lonely. Since the day I was born I always felt lonely. Never had a best friend. Had a girlfriend only once which lasted only 3 months. I wasn’t depressed at the time, but always felt lonely, I know many friends, I hang out with many of them. But I’m never their first option to call. I have to make extra effort to hang with most of them, which really let me feel pity about myself. I always see a pattern where new people I meet, really enjoy my company at first and quickly they want to hang with me, but shortly after that, they suddenly lost interest. 

Also with women, I know little of them, and they are the one who lose interest in my even quicker than guys. It’s like I can text a girl online for a straight week, and out of no where, they ignore me or leave me on read. Or sometimes unfriend me. Which really made me feel unwanted and hated.

I mean now, I don’t want money, I don’t want a fancy career or a luxurious life. All I want is someone who loves me! Why can’t I have that ?? What is wrong with me ?! It is really driving me mad, especially with the 5th consecutive month in lockdown I don’t know whom to talk to.

I really need to a psychiatrist, but I can’t at the moment. So could anyone help me and tell me what is wrong with me ??",21Jul2020,2

Reach 1,000 subscribers relatively quickly on YouTube, stop getting motivated for the content. Doing whatever mathematics homework I have one day very efficiently and fast, then skip the next 3 days. Read 3 hours a specific day, then stop for the next days.

Turns out he met a girl on Facebook and they're hitting it off and going very well so far, and she asked him if he didn't have any male friends to introduce to her friend. He immediately thought of me.

I sent the pic and the girls response was ""You can bring him, she'll definitely like him!"", as they are planning on meeting once the restrictions go looser in our area. I asked for a picture of the girl and her name, and she's gorgeous. Definitely my type and, I confess, I went on her Facebook and she even seems to have a similar mindset.

I told my mom about it yesterday and how I was anxious and she laughed at me, light-heartedly. She said we have great tools for connecting with people nowadays and it's unnecessary to drive 1 hour to another town to meet someone. I disagree, as I've been craving for a real date for the past year or so, even before Covid.

Throw away for obvious reasons. So the title pretty much says it all. I was pretty drunk and had chugged about 7 beers and had a huge sandwich. I don’t know what happened but I really had to go. I was on a hiking trail at a park and I ducked into what I believed to be an area where no one could see me right off the path. Looking back now I think that if you really tried you’d notice me squatting there and the fact that I was wearing a white shirt did not help. So I do my business and right afterwards I have to pee so I stand up while my pants are still around my ankles and I pissed for what felt like an eternity with my bare ass out in the woods. When I finished completely I turned around and there were some people walking by but they didn’t notice me until I started walking back to the path. I’m so afraid that while I had my back turned someone might have walked by on the path and saw me there either when I was squatting or stood up. I was drunk so my memory is a little bit hazy about what exactly people could see from the path and where I was. Now here’s the part that terrifies me, I’m so deathly afraid that someone saw me or filmed me or reported me to park authorities. I remained at the park after I got cleaned up for another two or three hours with my sister and her boyfriend and nobody came up to me or asked me about defecating in public. It has been almost two days since the incident and nothing has happened. Does anyone have any experience with this? And what should I do if someone did see me?",21Jul2020,1

I’m 17, N and K are both 19
When my sister, N, was in grade 10 her and her best friend, K, stopped being friends. N and her other friend decided to just kind of cut K off. Me, K, and my sister (N) all work at the same job. A lot of people know about K and N’s drama. Some people don’t want it to stop so they say “N said this about K” or the opposite, but they never seem to be true. N gets really mad about these rumours and is very rude to K. So obviously K doesn’t like her. Sometimes K says mean things (but true things) about her. K and I were always kind of close. N is extremely rude to me. She doesn’t act like my sister and I can’t remember the last time she did something remotely nice. She tells me I’m stupid all the time. She is also the perfect child so my parents side with her on everything. I also have a really hard time making and keeping friends. I’ve put in a lot of effort with N but it is never reciprocated. At this point I’m just waiting until we’re adults, but I’m not hopeful we’ll ever have a good relationship. 

Now that I have a license K has invited me and another one of my friends to hang out at her house and just to girl stuff that you would normally do with a sister. I want a healthy relationship like that. I don’t know if it’s morally right to hang out with K. If N finds out I could get in a lot of trouble. I just want a friend and K is really nice to me. She’s more of a big sister than N could or would ever be. Is it okay to hang out with K?

I am a middle child and I’m forgotten a lot and it’s a lot of competition for attention. My youngest brother is the definition of evil. At least in my opinion 

He undermines everything I do and I think it’s a subconscious thing because deep down he feels really lost and wants a thing that me and my brother can’t do. It’s how we function 
We all have our thing, the oldest is charming, and I’m smart(er). So I argue the most with the youngest and we could go back in forth all day. My parents didn’t argue with their siblings at all and they all got along so they find it awful when we disagree 

We’re basically not allowed to do it and get in trouble but when I disagree with the youngest it’s always my fault because he’s five and I should know better. I personally find this a unhealthy thing to base a punishment off of because what if his head gets too big and he tries to get over on me by blaming everything on me and it backfired because I’m still smarter than him?

219,"I had a past relationship some years ago, I was 19 and he was 20s something, that fucked me up more than I already was due to some mental issues and insecurities with my face and body. My “ex” used to be very toxic with me due to his problems with alcohol and drugs, which made me feel very responsible for him and his actions. I really wanted him to be free from all of those shitty things since he was kinda rehabbing and I sort of became obsessed on protecting and taking care of him. It lasted for 6 months until he “break up” with me. It obviously made my ego very hurt because, even though I wasn’t in love, I really liked and enjoyed pass my time with him, and I wasn’t expecting that because he frequently said he loved me and I was really comfy being myself with him. Turns out that some months after that I realized (with the help of my therapist) he was very manipulative using his problems to justify his actions over me, used to lie constantly about things you can’t even imagine, making me feel guilty for not being able to help and made me feel more insecure about myself when he said he didn’t want to break up to be with another girl, which my friend confirmed it wasn’t true.

I know all of this sounds bullshit, but my insecurities were always a big problem in my life. I really hate my face and body most of the time. Why can’t I be pretty? Why can’t I be thin enough? Why is my face so fuck up? Why am I not an interesting person? I know myself enough to know that some of these insecurities are just creations of my own head, but sometimes they consume me more than I expect.

So, the thing is: I’ve been hanging with this guy [M21] I met on Tinder 10 months ago and I think we’re really good together. Sometimes I believe we like each other very much, but, on the other hand, I just cannot believe it’s possibly be true cause I‘m so ugly and dumb compared to him, and I’m always scared of being manipulated and “exchanged” again. I’m always questioning myself if all these things he says and do are because he really likes me and is trying to demonstrate it or he is just doing it to make me liking him and then do whatever he wants with me. He knows about this past relationship I had, so he’s always trying to be very careful with every action he takes to not hurt me. 

Plus: he cheated one of his ex like 5 years ago, which makes me feel extremely insecure if I decided to take things more serious, like dating him, than they are right now. He says he learnt the lesson but I don’t know if people can change that much.

She started to go faster (very close to my vehicle) and honked multiple times at me, and yelled out her window. I decided to just ignore her and continued on my route. That’s when I saw that she was following me, calling someone on the phone, clearly yelling. I just kept going until I got to the diner’s home. As I delivered the food, I saw her parked on that same road near my vehicle, still on the phone and giving me an ugly glare. 

I still continued on and headed back to the area I was at, and she still was following me. At some point she disappeared and I got a new order for Burger King so I headed that way, thinking she just grew tired of following me. Once I headed into the Burger King to park and pick up the order, I saw two cop vehicles turn their lights on and so I had to stay in my vehicle.
There was a good cop and a bad cop (sounds cliche I know, but it’s the truth) so let’s call bad cop “Bob”, and good cop “Greg.”

Bob comes up to my window and asks me for my license. I hand it over to him. He asks me if I know the reason why he stopped me. I say no. He says that it was because “my turn signal has to be turned on at least 100 feet away from when I’m turning and I didn’t do that.” 

I asked him “really?” And he ignored me and asked me to step out of the vehicle. He put me against the car and searched me. Then he asked me if I had anything illegal in my car. I answered honestly no. He then asks “what are you even doing out on a Monday?” So I tell him I’m working and he goes “Oh really? So who was the last person you delivered to?” I grab my phone and I show him: “Johanna” then he goes “and what’s Johanna’s address?” So I show him the address. He then tells me that another reason he pulled me over was cause “somebody” called in to report me for “reckless driving.” So he goes “Why would someone call 911 to report a reckless driver? Were you really driving that terribly?” I simply answer: No.

He then asks me to unlock my vehicle because he’s gonna search all of it for anything illegal and then snaps his fingers at me, telling me to wait by his vehicle. That’s when Greg (good cop) cuts in and tells me “Actually, lets head over to that shady area under the tree, it’s too hot for you to wait in the heat.”

Once we’re underneath the shade of the tree, a few feet away from Bob, Greg starts some small talk with me while Bob searches my car. He cracks some jokes which cause me laugh and loosen up a bit (because I was upset.) About two minutes later he tells me (in a lower voice than normal) “hey, don’t be too scared alright? If he tries to punish you in any way, I’ll talk to him. We really had no reason to stop you. The only reason we did was because his wife called and reported you for reckless driving, supposedly almost crashing her vehicle, and passing multiple red lights. She can be like that. But don’t worry, you haven’t done anything wrong unless he does find something illegal in your car, which you said he won’t.” He then continues to crack jokes and continues the small talk and even asks me questions about myself. After about 10 minutes, Bob walks towards us and he tells me “Well, seems like there’s nothing. Good job. I’ll let you off with a warning this time. I just wouldn’t want to be seeing you again.” 

He then gives me back my license and simply walks to his vehicle and leaves. Greg on the other hand, stayed behind until Bob  left and told me “You see, he couldn’t do anything. Thank you for being patient. Have a good rest of your day okay? And don’t get into anymore trouble.” He chuckled at that last sentence and waved goodbye to me as he got on his vehicle and left. 

When I got into my car I not only had lost like two orders from GrubHub, but also everything like my purse, backpack (even the things inside of those, blanket, dog car seat, etc. Everything was thrown all over the place and not even put back where it was. My car was left as a mess. 


Is this even allowed to be done? Like I don’t care about the mess, that was just rude, but the whole stopping me just cause his wife accused me of something completely false?
I’ve just been so enraged all day and I feel like that wasn’t even something fair? 
Any help would be nice. 
Thank you so much for reading all this!",21Jul2020,6
223,"Hi, so my mom and I have a pretty rocky but close relationship. We argue a fair amount, sometimes small things, sometimes big things. She struggles w her mental health but is in denial/isn’t admitting it. 

One of the many problems we have is that she keeps on interrupting me in conversations as if she has something more important to say. Sometimes she acts like she knows more than me on topics that she knows nothing about, which is annoying but what really pushes me is when she cuts me off in the middle of my sentence and when I tell her I’m not finished she says that I “take too long”. This infuriates me as she is comparing present me (19 years old) to my childhood self when I sucked at storytelling because I’d always get distracted or side tracked. I was a slow kid, very shy too, didn’t talk much. I have improved in my storytelling skills and my attention span is a lot better now so I feel as if that comment completely disregards the progress I’ve made.

We were having a conversation earlier about a topic I was very passionate about, she said her piece and I listened without interrupting and asked questions about her story and expressed my thoughts on it briefly. When it was my turn to say my piece, I was only a few sentences in when she interrupted me for the third time. I fucked up by lashing out at her and telling her to “stop fucking interrupting me” followed by a very hostile “shut up”. She got upset and said she doesn’t like it when I yell at her and left the home. 

Although my mother definitely has a listening problem, as she interrupts other people as well, I still feel bad for yelling at her as I do value and respect her and what she has to say. I tried researching why people interrupt others constantly and apparently it could be linked to mental health issues and anxiety, which makes me feel worse cause I know she struggles with that.

This is a constant argument in my household, unfortunately. I admit I have a short temper when it comes to my mom and I want to change. I’ve been trying but I would like to know if there are any other ways I can respond in a calm manner or de-escalate these situations. I tried researching some tips like saying “sorry, I’m not finished speaking” or even changing my tone of voice to sound more excited about the topic so she’s engaged, etc. but they’re all things I’ve tried before that haven’t worked so far. 

I would appreciate any tips and advice on how to calmly respond when being interrupted by my mom, as I know the responses might differ with friends/acquaintances. Thanks !",21Jul2020,1

227,"So the short version of this is that I'm in love with my best friend. We grew up together and he's my best friend. His family treats me like I'm their own. I've told him twice in the past two years that I love him. He says no and I respect that, giving him space. He continues to do things though that a boyfriend would do. He gives me spontaneous gifts saying ""thought you'd like this"" or ""Thought of you""

At first I thought I was reading into things and then came the weird moments. Everytime I come over he hugs me, has an arm around me, his head is in my lap, he basically treats me like a girlfriend. And it was cute at first but now it's pissing me off. His sisters and family have recognized the behavior, his friends even note that he acts like I'm his girlfriend and according to his sister he complains non-stop about any guy I date. He constantly has these moments with me, where it's romantic almost but the second I bring the idea of us being a couple up he says no.

He's allowed to say no, I understand this. And i have tried to reason away that ""maybe I'm reading too much into this."" But then his family, friends, fuck- my family is able to recognize that he treats me like his girlfriend. It doesn't help that he'll complain about being single later after I've already told him.

I try not to let numbers affect me but it’s really difficult. Posting my artwork ends up taking a toll on me, it takes a lot of courage for me to hit “post” and usually right after my heart starts racing super fast, I get dizzy and feel nauseous, I get hot flashes and chest pain. I try to turn my phone off for a while while im experiencing this but it’s uncontrollable. I don’t know if it’s just a lot of stress and nervousness or perhaps a panic attack.

229,"I have a massive crush on my friend and it’s getting to the point where it’s hurting me by keeping it to myself. 

So I (24F) met my friend (25M) on Tinder at the end of last of October. We went on a few dates, slept together a few times, and then he backed off a bit. I confronted him and he said he thought we would be better off as friends. 

So we did that, we ended up staying friends. All was fine and well and I didn’t really have feelings for him until covid hit. We live 2 minutes away from each other so we spent a lot of time together while we were in lockdown (we are in Australia so we were allowed to see one or two people outside our household). 

It started out as harmless hangs playing video games or hanging out with each other’s families. However as time progressed we would hang out multiple times a week and sometimes have a few drinks and then ending up sharing a bed together or end up cuddling together on the couch. Occasionally we get super close and I feel like we are going to kiss but it never transpired. Nothing more than that has happened. We have been doing that on and off for a few months now and we even spent a weekend away together this past weekend where we had to share a bed yet again. 

I realised maybe two months ago that I was starting to have feelings for him and I’ve been trying to keep that under wraps while I figure out what to do. 

I obviously need to tell him but my question is would a guy just share a best friend with a female friend and cuddle/sleep in his underwear beside her/invite her on a weekend away together if he just wanted to be friends.

Also how should I go about telling him? I don’t want to lose him from my life but I’m so scared things won’t pan out like I want. I mean if he liked me he would have done something already right?",21Jul2020,2

It's been eating away at me for a while now that I know this thing about him that he doesn't want me to know and there have been multiple times where we've hung out that I wanted to tell him i know and that I'm okay with it and still accept him, but I haven't.

I get angry at so many things I have to deal with, like needing to sit in the middle seat in the car during a road trip, and every time i get angry, he always says “it’s not that bad” but then gets angry when he has to sit in the middle seat. Another thing that gets me really angry is when my stepsister would blast music upstairs, but when I’m bouncing a ball on the ground, she gets mad at me for being to loud. Another thing, they say I drink too much tea, but all I drink is two cups a day, and their rely to that is “yeah right”. Another thing (which I can probably blame on myself) is the fact that they all think I lie about everything, I did use to lie a lot, which is why I brought this upon myself, but they think I lie about everything, which gets me really mad.

234,"So 8m so tired of having this argument with my my family so I'm going to turn to the internet for answers. 

With that out of the way here is the issue I need advice on whether I should build or buy a PC. Now before every tech geek starts spamming me with saying to build one I have this to say.

My family thinks it is a bad idea because I do not have any backround nor hobbies involving tech, I'm just a guy who likes video games, In fact I'd go so far as to say that I am extremely untech savy for someone who is 25 years old. Like idk the first thing about how computers work.

That being said if I had it my way I would love to build one anyway and have a build ready based on recommendations from a friend. 

Should I build a PC even though I have no computer knowledge what so ever. Or should I follow my family's insistence that I buy one pre-made and have to potentially spend more than my ideal budget.

If I should buy a pre-built one then the questions is is there a pre-built PC tower than can run a game like Witcher 3 smoothly that won't break my bank (since I also need to buy moniters as well). My budget reguardless of whether I build or buy the cost shouldn't be more $1600-1700 (including moniters) because thats as much as I'm willing to spend.

I got an early offer into a double degree with the bachelor of international relations and politics as well as a bachelor of law. This is my absolute proferred program however the condition of entry is that i complete a diploma of legal studies at bond uni next year before starting. All up this is going to cost 170k AUD. The problem is the government school loan program (in which you dont pay back the loan till you earn over 55k a year) inly does a maximum of 102k AUD meaning i will have to pay the excess over the 4 years it will take otherwise i will be unable to receive my degrees. my family is thoroughly lower middle class that has there own home but could never afford expensive luxuries like international holidays. I  could really do with some advise as to whether it is worth borrowing the rest from a bank at a good interest rate all to get into a field that does not pay well until tou have been in the industry for an extended amount of time?

242,"My mom has been sleeping in my room for the last few months. My dad has sleep apnea and snores a ton at night. He has a CPAP machine that he has been using which stops him from snoring.

The reason my mom has been in my room for this long is that my dad recently just got the CPAP machine two months ago and she was sleeping in my room on and off since January. My dad was also diagnosed with throat cancer a month and a half ago. He has surgery on his throat about a month and a quarter ago and he wasn’t allowed to use his CPAP for two weeks. 

My mom didn’t want to be kept up by the snoring (caused by the lack of him wearing the CPAP) so she has extended her stay in my room. My dad was given clearance to use the CPAP a few weeks ago but it was malfunctioning. He needed to call the company that made the machine.

My dad kept putting off the phone call and my mom has continued to sleep in my room. I really don’t want to be rude to her but I need some privacy. She’s sleeping in a trundle bed (pulls out from under my bed) in my tiny room.

When my girlfriend goes on the WI-FI she doesn't catch any of them on there. Mine has them both. After looking at them they usually vanish within a few seconds unless you start searching again. The owner has the hotel listed as the previous companys name,  and the whole building is under construction.  When you show up to the building you have to call and ask if you're even in the right place. The ""desk clerk"" is the owner. It looks like the people in the rooms live here because we went around front to look dor another entrance and I saw a bunch of plants and a calendar in one of the rooms.

We googled ways to find cameras and says the usual, look at weirdly placed outlets, phone jacks, things that shouldn't be there, etc. It also said if the owner turns the lights on when you go to see the room that's a sign they are trying to obscure LED's. He did that. We turned the lights off and saw nothing.

Weird things include a bolted in mirror with a chord going behind it, the bathroom light is ajar and has the chords visible, and there is a phone jack askew (could just be older, the building sure is)

The place is under construction and weird as hell. There's just a paper over the sign covering the oldest company, of the last company.

I was the told that the siblings were staying the night at FS house and i don't remember how but i managed to get them to let me stay the night too. We had a blast we played just dance, overwatch, and some card games too. As the night was dying down I wanted to stay by SFB more and more, he has a girlfriend too so i didn't make anything seem weird, i think... but as we went to bed i can stared at him as i fell asleep...

255,"Hello, everyone! So, looking for some advice on how to approach a situation going on between a friend and I.

As a backstory, last year my friend and I bought something together and had everything shipped to her house. It's been more than a year, now, since the items arrived, and she's never shipped my part to me. I do want them, but I'm not too upset with her for not shipping things yet, because I also hate shipping things! Since then we've agreed upon trading some things (we collect a type of collectible together, it's how we met) and her buying some of the things I have that I don't want/know she would like to help her finish her collections. Now, I'm giving her a really steep discount on all of this... things that would sell for $15, I'm letting her have for $5, things like that... but I'm having a hard time getting her to send me the money for these things. Not only that, but, there's something else very, very big and important that I have that I need help figuring out how to talk to her about. Getting the money and talking about this thing is what I'm looking for advice on.

So, the kinds of things we collect also have one-of-a-kind items. They are truly unique items that, while you can get another version of it, you will never have that exact item ever (authentically, some people make fakes) replicated. Recently she bought me something as a gift, and, after I'd reminded her to enter a raffle, won one. I was obviously a little jealous but just as excited for her! However... the raffle was won under my order number, so it was sent to me instead of her. It has my name on it and everything. I immediately let her know as soon as I received it that it had been sent to me, and made it clear I didn't intend to keep it-- even though it has my name on it, even though I was the one who made sure she entered to win it, she's the one who paid for it. It's hers, in my mind, even if it's so painful I can't even look at it because I want one of these things so badly it makes me cry to think I have one in my possession that isn't actually mine. I have notoriously bad luck with winning these random draws, and this isn't the first time she's won one. It's heartbreaking that the first time I actually won something, I don't get to keep it. 

Anyway, I let her know I had it, and that it was 'just visiting me for a while' while I waited for her to pay for everything else I needed to send to her.

Her response was to start saying how cruel it feels to  have to have me send it to her. Anytime I bring it up! ""No, it's too cruel, it's too cruel,"" and like... yeah, it is, this situation absolutely sucks and has brought me a lot of pain, but just saying that over and over is seriously not helping matters at all, unless you plan on alleviating the cruelty of the situation and letting me keep it, which is definitely not going to happen, LOL. It is very unfortunate and heartbreaking but her not being decisive on paying for the other things she owes me for so I can send it all out is making it harder than it has to be!

I suppose what I'm asking is... how can I ask her to please send me the things I'm owed, pay for the things she owes, so I can get this extremely rare and wonderful one of a kind item out of my possession so it stops hurting that I can't keep it forever?",21Jul2020,1

257,"I (14m) just realized I'm turning 15 in a few days which also means in my country that in a year or two I'm going to go to college and get an ID card and all that but what worries me is the college part .

I have absolutely no passion for anything the only thing I genuinely like is programming which I tried to get in to but after a few months realized that I suck so much at it and couldn't do anything so much so that I've been too afraid to touch because of how stupid it makes me feel . I also tried digital art and animation but sadly in my country there's no career for that kinda thing and I don't think I'm good enough to go international neither do commissions enough to make a living . Other things I thought of were writing/comics (I've had a story I've been writing for forever now)but I don't think that it's too profitable to turn it into anything worthwhile since it'll all be free on the internet anyways and I have no idea where to start with publishing and all that . I can also kinda play the piano but I never thought of it as a job but more as a hobby .

So right now I'm having a pre-life crisis and I feel so empty and nervous to the point that I've been dreading my birthday coming up soon .

 I'm so painfully below average at everything I do . I don't excel in anything whatsoever and on top of that I'm also so intoxicatingly shy to a point that even I am disgusted with it which is yet another hindrance to me.

I feel really afraid for my future and all I can think of is that I don't want to end up working some crappy job struggling paycheck to paycheck .

259,"
I’m having a lot of problems lately getting over a traumatic experience and I have no idea where to start, since just ignoring it hasn’t worked like I hoped it would.  So I made a throw away account on a throw away email. 
I (25f) was sexually assaulted 5 years ago by my friends dealer (26m). For context, I had known this guy for like a couple months and he had come over to my friends house for a small party. As the night goes, he kept getting more and more in my space, touching my hair and stroking my arms and generally being a creep, but I was 20 and no concept of growing a backbone and saying back-off. He was smashed and ended up crashing on the couch, despite being asked to leave, and my friend thought he was faking being asleep but left it alone. She was worried about him stealing from her but none of us had the sense to just kick him out at the time. I told her I would sleep on the adjacent couch to keep an eye on him, thinking it was fine because we had, like, six other people sleeping in the house (all in different rooms). 
Suddenly it’s two hours later and I wake up with him on top of me. I asked him to get off, he has a girlfriend, he’s drunk, I don’t want to do this, etc and he got off. Cue to 15 minutes later, he’s on me again. Same excuses, he apologizes and goes back to his couch. The third time, he didn’t get off of me, but I was freaked out and suddenly frozen and it’s like I couldn’t make myself speak or do anything, it felt like I was paralyzed throughout the whole ordeal, where he then continued to sexually assault me. 
I feel like I know logically that what happened to me wasn’t my fault, but I’m just so angry at myself. I could’ve gotten up and left right away, I could’ve spoken up or starting screaming, I could have reported it the next morning, but I was just fucking frozen. 
I ended up dropping out of college 3 weeks later because I started having panic attacks and couldn’t get through the day after seeing him on the campus. My friends boyfriend (now ex) insisted on still picking up pot from him because “getting a new dealer is hard”, for at least a couple of months until I begged them to stop and find some other shitty hippie to buy their weed from. Since that night, I’ve become so paranoid and anxious and depressed, I can’t sleep without checking locks, I sit and get stuck with really invasive thoughts that I can’t control,  and I’ll just sit on my bed or in the shower and zone out for hours like an idiot zombie. 
I know the answer is probably therapy, but I wouldn’t know where or how to start. So many others have been through trauma 800x worse than I have, but it’s like I don’t feel alive anymore. I stopped my art, I stopped reading, I actively yearn for my old passions but I just can’t muster the will to do anything to help myself. How do I get past this? How do I stop ruining my own life?",21Jul2020,1
261,"I’m a 16 year old male. As far back as I can remember in my childhood my father was an abusive alcoholic who would mentally and physically abuse me, my siblings, and my mother. As a kid, going through this meant I cried quite often as I’m sure you can imagine. But as I grew up in that household, I forced myself to “be stronger” and fortified myself mentally so that I stopped crying most nights and I felt better, for a while. 

My parents are divorced and we’ve moved away from that POS that I have to say is biologically my father. But for the past 5 years or so that they’ve been divorced, I haven’t been able to emotionally cry. I’ve been through rough times that I know would make others cry and would’ve made the old me cry up an ocean, some of which I probably need advice on later on, but none of them have brought me to tears. 

My eyes can still water when something gets in them or they get hit by something, but I haven’t felt the sensation of genuinely crying in so long that it’s driving me to the point of insanity. I used to feel strong and proud because of it, but now I feel weak and stupid. I feel like an inferior human.

Not only am I worried about my mental health and how much this bothers me, I’m worried how this could affect later relationships with friends, family, or others if I told them. I feel like they’d think I’m a serial killer or something of the sort. 

I’ve read up on melancholic depression and mental disorders like such, and I feel a lot of it fits me well but I’m also too worried about how I would tell my mom that I want to go try to get a diagnosis / medication. For one, I don’t want my mom to have to spend more money for something that could be prevented as we aren’t the most fortunate family around. Secondly, I know it’d just crush her feelings as well to know I’ve been going insane over the past few years and kept silent about it.

I also have lost a lot of the joy I used to have. I’m not the type of person that’ll sit here and say I fake my smiles and haven’t really laughed in years, because that’s not true. But games and videos/movies that used to captivate me just seem monotonous and lame now. 

I don’t know what to do with myself. I can’t stand feeling this way but I don’t think I could bare the feeling of shame that would come with asking for help. What should I do?",21Jul2020,4

263,"I recently met this girl through a friend and she is someone I want to get to know better. We hang out occasionally along with some other friends and never alone. Through the friends I find out she is very into me. We do not have each other’s numbers yet. She even went as far to have them invite me on a trip that I was not previously going to attend just so we can hang out more. However, I decided to reach out to her through a messenger and start a casual conversation. She replied but was very short and then has ghosted my next attempt for over a day. It shows she has read it though. I would have to modify my work schedule just to go on this trip. 

I have kids, she has kids, and we both have jobs so I know things are hectic but Am I wasting my time by even being interested in her since she can’t even have small talk? Did I do something wrong by reaching out when we didn’t have each other’s numbers? Should I even go on this trip to see what is going on?

266,"Hi all

I am M 15 and have always been insecure about styling my hair / changing it at all: so I would always just let it grow out to where it would look like the classic Justin Bieber haircut from 2010 or something. I always hated it but never changed it out of fear of people judging me at school.

Recently I got a haircut and seeing as I don't have school till September, I decided finally to style my hair and I really like it. I honestly am surprised I hadn't done it before. Later on in the day my brother came over (he doesn't live in our house anymore) and instantly starting shitting on my hair. It was in a jokey way but also it was a constant 30 minute insult about my hair, how it looked like Hitler and he kept making Hitler jokes, asking how my Jews are and shit which made me really uncomfortable. Now, every time I see him he goes on about my hair. We were even at a family BBQ a couple weeks ago with cousins and that and he basically embarrassed me in front of everyone. But like I said earlier, he is ""joking"" every time but it stills hurts.

I asked a friend about this and he said it's normal for brother's to tease eachother, but the fact my brother is about to turn 30 I thought he would've matured a bit by now. 

Any advice on how to handle this?? It's really fucking annoying I have to have my hair completely a mess without even being able to comb it before my brother judges me for it.",21Jul2020,1

Again, I've already worked four days at this point and now I have to work another five with no off day? I don't know if I'm being a whiny brat about this, but this doesn't seem fair to me. Especially considering NO ONE ELSE THAT I KNOW OF WORKS LIKE THIS.

What do I do about this? I feel like I sound like in just whining about having to work. But if no one else is working the way I am, I feel entitled to my own feelings about this. I hope someone can answer my question, because I don't know what to do

283,"Hey guys,

Really seeking some great advice here. Really looking to grow. Really looking to stop blaming other people, outsider forces, or “depression” for all of the downfalls I’ve had my first 2 years of college.

I’ll give a little bit of background first.

I have suffered from depression basically my entire time in college. From late 2018 to now. Much of this has stemmed from a lack of structure (can’t wait for more of a 9-5 routine like high school or a full time job), a major that is “meh”, being gay and closeted, not finding core friend group of friends at college. 

I am an accounting major who did pretty well in first two Intro accounting courses, but did poorly this past spring 2020 semester. My depression was so overwhelming that I made the horrible mistake of giving up and having to withdraw from 2 out of 4 of my classes. 

Did alright this summer by earning a B- in a hard class, so kind of starting to recover, but it still feels like no matter what I do it is never enough. I was one question short of a B which stung. 

So, moving forward, I need to whip myself into shape. I’m going into my 3rd year of college and I just need to get through it, get out, and be done. 

Any advice on how to improve myself all in all to try to get my bachelors degree December 2021?",21Jul2020,1

this is my first post, I apologize for ill thread designation. 

While a good occupational therapist and psychiatrist would benefit me most, I'm just going to anonymously unload with the hopes that someone on the internet may offer me some sort of wisdom

&amp;#x200B;

**Premise**

I'm in need of advice on what steps I should take with schooling and choosing a career path. 

I've spent 3 years in a community college with the expectation of pursuing a biochemistry degree. Now that I've (almost, -4 credits) finished my associates, I'm enrolled to continue my education at a state university, however I'm filled with dread. 

It's crushing to learn, despite consistent advising, that I'll barely be starting my BS at a sophomore level. I feel as though I've wasted 4 years (with some breaks), returning to the same spot that I started at fresh out of high school. 

I've been consistently told that, ""you have time to figure out what you want to do, don't worry"", that sentiment has given me a false sense of security over these years considering that I'm no closer to a career and money-- I'm determined to establish a game plan that will work well for me before the academic year beings in September. 

**Academic History**

Pinning down what I want to do with my life has never been easy as my interests are broad and potentially delusional. I chose CC to save money instead of pursing a 4 year school on an athletic scholarship yet ended up with a psychotic break that led to me: 

a.) losing my ability to drive 

b.) roughly 65k in restitution fees (yeah, I know, I fucked up)

I spent 1.5 years at 1 CC taking classes that fulfilled nothing for a bigger degree (lvl 100 classes, not the intro 200)

After my accident I took a year off working and was legally required to move, 

I then spent another year at a different CC taking the 200 level science classes (chem/bio). Fell in love with the two and decided on biochem and chose to pursue biochemistry as a degree. 

I took another year off because:

a.)I wanted to apply for a big state scholarship and had missed my deadline prior (denied, btw)

b.)didn't want to waste another year of my pell grant doing aimless credits

c.)had to start paying larger amounts of restitution and couldn't afford it all 

**Career Forks**

I dreamt of being a researching MD as a high schooler, as I wanted to focus on bioengineering yeast/bacteria to produce medicine while practicing neurology. I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy and wanted to cure it; I fell in love with neuroanatomy and biochemical pathways. 

My grades aren't remotely close to a med school path, so I've largely shamed myself away from that.

I know a BS in biochem will offer little job security, so I worry that my obligations will pull me from higher schooling if I take that path. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently looking into transferring into a separate school to complete an AAS of polysomnographic science (in total, w my unfinished AS, I'll take one academic year) in order to become a registered polysomnographic technician. 

I applied, got accepted, however the actual job market looks scarce. I'm worried I'll waste more time. 

  
I'm considering doing some form of a medical tech path in order to have a job soon enough that I can stay afloat and then consider future schooling, however I just don't know what to do. 

I've spent the last 6 years working as a barista and my resume looks very sad for a 22 year old. I can't get a serious job, especially with COVID. 

&amp;#x200B;

I simply feel stuck and alone and panicked.

288,"a few months ago, one of my friends was in my english class. we had been paired together to work on a group project. i noticed she kept picking at her hand for some reason. i asked her what it was, and she showed me a giant fucking gash from her wrist up to her thumb. 



my first reaction was of course, ""oh my god, what happened?"". she then explained that it was self inflicted, but she said it in a joking way...? like she was trying to play it off as a joke, but it clearly fucking wasnt since blood was dripping on her desk. i really started to worry. 



later on that night, i debated if i should contact the counselors about it. i eventually did, knowing that it would be 1) anonymous, and 2) she would hopefully get some help.



she came to school the next day and we sat in english as usual. as we worked on our project, the teacher walked up to her and handed her a pass to go to the counselors office. she, of course, was really confused. but i stayed silent and acted as confused as she was. so she went. 




she comes back later on and is REALLY pissed off. she told me that someone reported her for self harm, and she figured that it mustve been one of her teachers who noticed the giant cut on her hand. i played along with it, (obviously), and mentioned how it would probably get infected if she kept doing it. she agreed, but was still pretty pissed.




fast forward to tonight. 



im laying in my bed and on snapchat, when i notice that she updated her story. i clicked on it, and i got really fucking concerned. it was a really strange, dark photo of some weird text all over the screen. i couldnt even read what the hell it said because of how distorted it was. the video after that was her dark room, pouring a bottle of dawn dish soap into a cup. 



i decided to swipe up and ask what the dish soap thing was about. all she replied with was ""to drink"". 


at this point, i started freaking the fuck out. i blew up her phone, saying everything i could to NOT let her drink fucking soap. i think she did it anyways, and she sent me things like ""i love you"" and she posted photos of herself crying with the caption ""im sorry"" on her story



i almost started crying, thinking that she was trying to kill herself and there was almost nothing i could do about it. i dont know where she lives, nor do i have her parents phone numbers. i just kept sending texts and eventually she quit reading them.



she did however open them a few minutes later. she was like ""im sry i didnt mean to freak u out, it was my fault and ily.""

290,"(Quick summary here)Wife (35F) and I (37M) have been married 15 years and have a kid. The last year of our Marriage has been our toughest yet. That being said, it is still nothing I am not willing to work on/support her through/whatever. Due to some legal issues that she could have avoided easily btw, we were forced to go NC for 72 hrs. She then stretched the NC into over 72 days. NC to me and our child. When she finally started reaching out again. I was over the moon! But have had time to relook at what all she said and did specifically, and how she is now. This leads me to the advice/insight/experience/help.....
When she broke NC, she only did break NC with me. We met at a hotel, and spent the weekend there. My wife and I have always averaged great sex. We are older now than when we me t obviously, and body's, meds, stuff changes, but we still, even at our worst were averaging 5 times a month easily. She had never been one to with hold or subvert away from advances, and isn't shy about initiating. 
That being said, at the time I was loving the passion she was showing again at the time when NC broke, but it was very uncharacteristic of her to be that into it, that many times. The next weekend was the same thing, then 2 weeks no sex later she claimed to have had a miscarriage. I never saw anything, and she refused to go to the hospital when I asked, but said she is sure of it based on her Google research. Ever since the 2nd weekend, it has now been 2 months since we had sex and the physical touching has been slowly regressing as well. Like she is pulling away again. She also seems to have gained about 15 lbs in the 2 weeks I didn't see her. I had never thought seriously about it before  but since I got her in 5 consecutive lies today alone, I cannot help but connect dots here.....
Did my wife cheat on me while she has been staying in a different town and sometimes a different state and end up pregnant? I mean, we did have sex, and have never even tried a condom.... still only have 1 kid. Was the miscarriage story just to throw me off?",21Jul2020,1
291,I have no one to share this with. I loved a girl with all of my heart. She even loved me more. It was my first ever relationship (i'm 19y/o). But from last year i kept hurting her unknowingly. She didn’t leave my side. But i kept causing too much trouble for her. I was the most toxic person in the history of toxicity. She loved me the most and i still couldn’t respect it. I ruined her love for me with my own actions. But i didn’t know my mistakes and why she was sad. Today she left me. And now i finally understand how toxic and worthless person i am. She was the perfect human being. And she loved me with her everything. Still i ruined it for both of us. I just cant take it anymore. I dont know how to do anything now. Please if anybody has ever been into this type of of situation just help me out wih anything. Thank you,21Jul2020,1

295,"I've been friends with pretty much the same small group of guys (I'm a guy) for almost 10 years. We've been hanging out for so long that it feels like I couldnt even imagine life without them.

296,"So, I currently work about 3.5 hours a day (at $14/hr) at a shipping company. I like my current job, and my paycheck is usually just enough to cover my needs, though it typically falls short in cases of emergency. My mother is disabled, so I've lived with her my whole life. I do all the laundry, cooking, yard-work and cleaning (but am often woefully behind as I am undisciplined - and, between her and my boyfriend, it's kind of like having kids), and in return, she pays the mortgage, insurances, etc. I basically just pay for gas, our groceries, and the water bill. However, I recognize she won't be around forever, and if I don't figure out a way to build a savings, I'm going to have a very hard time after she passes. Plus, I would like to make things nicer for her now.

I've had my current job for almost 8 months, and I've worked my ass off, even though it's only a few hours a day. The company I work for is contracted by the shipping company, but we all work together and it basically feels like one company. Most of the manual labor is done by my company (drivers, package handlers, etc) while the 2 employees of the shipping company are sort of... administration, checks &amp; balances, making sure every little thing on the computer is correct (we use a lot of different scanners/data input and all of it has to be done in the right order). Anyway, we work closely with them, and apparently, for some reason, they like me.

One of them approached me today and offered me a full time job with the actual shipping company. My initial reaction was to turn her down, as I have just gotten past feeling overwhelmed balancing my current job and my life. I told her I was afraid it was too much responsibility. She said she understood, but that I should have more confidence in myself. A few minutes later, the other one came up and said I should really consider it. He implied that it would be smart at my age and that it could lead to a career and being able to retire when I'm in my 60's. He said they'd much rather hire me, who they know they can rely on, than a stranger off the street. He also mentioned job stability, and then added ""not that your job is in jeopardy"" (I guess he just meant it has more opportunities for growth, but now I'm wondering... but I can be paranoid/overthink things).   

Anyway, I'm very uncertain if I should take the job or not. I feel like I ""should""... like it's the expected, responsible thing to do. But I'm afraid I won't be happy with the workload and with the amount of free time I'll have (the housework will for sure be overwhelming). Then again, I'm not likely to get an opportunity like this again. I always kind of pictured myself making most of my money with my creativity and skills - being flexible and able to move. This is like being gut-punched by reality. It's a great opportunity, but I'm not sure ""building a career"", especially in the shipping industry, is what I want to do with my life. But, then I think, I've had all this time to build a business and haven't, yet. How likely is it that I ever will? Aren't my choices, in reality, not between an 8-hr job and future dream job, but rather an 8-hr job that pays well and - later on down the line, when I'm all alone - an 8-hr job at McDonalds? 

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; offered a job by the company that oversees the company I work for. It's a step-up and offers a career path, but I'm not sure if I'd be capable at balancing work and life when I already feel like I'm falling behind on house and yard work with my part time job. 

Pros: better pay, more hours, career path + stability, benefits

Cons: destroy my work-life balance, be probably at least twice as stressed, have less time to do things around the house/for my disabled mom, still have 30 min commute but this time in the morning w/ heavy traffic &amp; I take at least 3 hrs to be fully awake, uncertain if I can handle, might not enjoy as much as my current job.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",21Jul2020,1

I realized I started to kind of monitor the business’ reviews, and while I was on shift today someone left a 2 star review/rating. I’m a little bummed and I don’t remember what happened around that time of the day, but it wasn’t particularly busy. I know (from previous employees I sort-of keep in touch with) that the boss monitors the reviews as well and will be bound to ask about it though. My friend said it could’ve been a review or rating for a drink, but idk.

I also had a very unfortunate encounter with a Karen customer the other day, my boss did conclude that I did everything correctly but does anyone have any advice when encountering a customer like that?

303,"Hello, we bought an eclectus from a breeder for $1200... he flew away so that’s why we are thinking of getting another eclectus. However, my dad made an impulse decision to buy an amazon parrot yesterday($2000) which he regretted afterwards. 

Since the pet store has a no refund policy, we can’t get the $2000 back... but we can exchange birds. Since the pet store is popular, a lot of the birdies have been sold. 

There is two female eclectus and one unknown eclectus (he/she is super young). We don’t really want a female eclectus since they’re bright red, and they’re a little more aggressive than the male eclectus. The birds are $2600 which is so expensive!! I researched on google and I know that is on the higher end... 

I’ve fed an eclectus when they’re a month old, giving them baby formula, so I feel like I can take care of them, but the store only releases the babies when they eat seeds for 5 days straight... maybe I can negotiate that? To take the birds sooner, I can get the bird at a cheaper price... 

We’re going to the pet store tomorrow to check the birds out, and I hope that we can spend $2000 at a later time than tomorrow, since there is not a lot of options because the store is always full of people buying the birdies.

I really want to ask the owner if she can negotiate the prices to $2000, but I don’t know, maybe that is rude.. any pet store owners, please let me know what I can do to lower the price of the bird, or tell me that it’s not possible.

306,"Hey all. On a burner account. For background, I am a 21 yo college student dating a 23 college senior. We’ve known each other since I was 15 during freshman, which we first started talking. I fell in love with her and we’ve talked virtually every day since then. Although we spent the first four years in a “talking” phase, we eventually started dating in 2018. During those years before dating, she said she had commitment issues, but I understood and waited until she was ready. I knew she was worth the wait, and I really loved her. One day, I finally got lucky and she wanted to commit. We are about to hit our two year mark, and we’re stronger than ever.


Recently, though, I’ve been exploring on some apps I probably shouldn’t be on. For more context, my girlfriend goes to a different college across the state, so I only see her maybe 1 or twice every three months, besides school breaks when I can see her more often. Long distance has definitely been a challenge, but I think I’m getting the hang of it. As a result of not seeing her too often, as well as being surrounded by a lot of attractive girls on campus, I often find myself wondering what life would be like if I were single. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t plan on ending my girlfriend with my relationship soon. However, I do not know if it is out how much I love her that I won’t break up, or because I’m scared to break up after dating so long/knowing her family/etc. At this point I’m rambling but I’ll get to the point. Around December, a friend and I randomly stumbled on the new Facebook dating feature. It was weird, and we were bored from studying, so we decided to make each other profiles. It was a fun joke, but when we said bye for the night, we promised to delete our accounts. I, however, did not, and explored the app for a day. Again, a lot of pretty girls that I was attracted to, and eventually, I even tried talking to some. I never got really far, but I was enjoying meeting other girls, and even flirting. From this app, I branched out and downloaded plenty of fish and tinder, out of curiosity. I made fake accounts not showing my face so that my friends wouldn’t find out, since I did not want my girlfriend to know. I matched with girls daily, talked and flirted, and honestly, I got a rush out of it. On plenty of fish, I found profiles that were a lot more promiscuous, and had direct links to snapchats. That’s when I found out how easy it was to find sex workers real close to me, for prices I could afford. 

For more context, my girlfriend and I do not have sex. I do finger her once in a while and that’s enough for her I think, but she’s never reciprocated on me and made me orgasm. I don’t really mind, as she is not comfortable going that far and I can wait until she is, but I just feel sexually unsatisfied. When I found out about sex workers that I could feasibly meet, I started texting them, and even arranging days to meet, just to cancel last minute out of guilt. I feel really anxious thinking about having sex with another, and I can’t imagine the pain it would bring my girlfriend. However, I try to justify it by knowing that it is solely for the sexual pleasure, and would not be with the intent of leaving her. It’s hard to justify for myself because I still think it’s wrong, but even though I was talking with other women, I know I still loved her in the end. Over quarantine, I got better at not using dating apps as I was busy with school and hanging out with my girlfriend, and I even managed to delete the apps. However, as summer has started and I now have more free time, I have redownloaded apps and started talking to more women again. Even this morning, I found another sex worker I almost arranged tomorrow, but stopped out of guilt. 

I know I rambled, but this is a battle that’s been tormenting me. I know I love my girlfriend, and I think I’m really happy in a relationship with her. However, I find myself craving a single life every so often, and just wanting to screw around with other girls. I don’t really know if I’m a terrible person or not for being like this, but I just wanted to know others’ stance on this. Thank you.",21Jul2020,2
307,"I’m so confused.

Is she ignoring me or what? We’re both 22 and female. We’re cousins but also best friends.


So I recently figured out that she might not want to talk to me anymore. 

So I commented on my friends post that she made, i didn’t see it on the day she posted it as I don’t use Instagram very often. But when I did comment, she didn’t like it or comment back.

Before you think I’m overreacting, I went on her new best friends Instagram and saw that her new friend post two pictures separate two days after my comment. And my best friend liked it.

And another time was that she posted on snapchat.

I know her like she’s my sister, once’s she on a social media she goes on all of them. And with the lockdown she has nothing but free time.



For about a year and so, she had this new friend and they began inseparable. 

And I didn’t exist to her anymore. She doesn’t call, text, or even make plans even if it’s in the future.

We spoke once during lockdown, and I was the reason the call even happened. It took me messaging her for her to wanna catch up.

After we talked for a while, we had this plan to go to holiday together, me, her and her new friend. I said okay.

Before this friend came in our life’s,m she was on my back everyday. We would meet up and do things. Now I don’t exist.",21Jul2020,1

310,"Hey you all. To start off I'll explain about me. I'm an attractive women who is active on IG in the fitness community so I post pictures frequently and have had many offers in the DMs from men to date them or sugar daddy scenarios (these I normally assume as scams). I received a DM from a female asking me if i was interested in a cam girl arrangement and to message the guy on an app called Kik. She said he pays. I assumed this was a scam but this account was real where the girl has had instagram for awhile and has followers/friends/live cams/stories, etc. She also tagged another account saying this girl has also cammed with this guy and this account was real too (active since 2017, recent photos, live cams, etc). I messaged both girls for awhile asking questions and both seemed legit.

It seemed like there was no harm in messaging the guy out of curiosity so I downloaded the app and messaged him. We talked for a little about what this was. He sent me photos of his life style which looked like snap chat videos saved, videos of other girls who he has cammed with (nose down so I couldn't see eyes), and he stated that hes had numerous girls cam him over time. He pays them via Western Union wire transfer. I asked for a video of a girl saying my name showing proof that these girls were real and he had access to them. He asked for photos of me so I sent him ones I already have up on social media so nothing private. I said I was curious so he said we could skype to discuss details.

We skyped the next day and he told me that he is a 28 year old man from London, UK. We skyped at 3am his time so around 8pm where I am located. His family is extremely wealthy and he likes to cam girls (sexual in nature) and pays them very well for continuing to do so. He wouldnt show his face so it was a black screen that I was talking to and he said he does this to stay anonymous because of the nature of his life. He went to Oxford University, speaks several languaged and his family is very wealthy and invested in stocks and had business... (he was talking very fast and I couldn't keep track of it all). He mentioned he is a sheikh? so im assuming arabic background. He said he pays through western union transfer and never asked any personal information of me other than my name, DOB, and what western union location was closest to me for pick up.

I requested more proof so he showed me on another phone of him scrolling through all the girls on the app he is talking to (many) and went to a conversation where he asked the girl to send screen shots of her direct deposits and of her current bank account balance which I saw but could also be fake....

I told him I would skype once I have the money in my account and he said I would have the money in 3 days time and would pick it up from the western union of my choosing. He would send me the receipt.

See my confusion is....the money he is willing to send is A LOT. Like A LOT A LOT. 

SO....help me. Is this a scam? This seems too elaborate to be a scam but also seems surreal. I've asked for as much proof as I can get and he isn't requesting any personal info. The only thing I can think of is extortion but I dont see why if hes already talking to so many people.

311,"Maybe I'm on edge because of covid-19 but my meeting with the leadership of my company is not sitting well with me. I have weekly meetings with three of the top people in my company and this week it ended with a request that I document all of the essentials of my job. Things like cleaner more readable code (I work as a data scientist), access points and ways to access the tools and servers I use to make my additions to the company work. Basically, anything that would make my job easier for someone to walk into and do if I was unable to do so. 

Now this concerns me in large part because I know that at least when covid hit, we had a really bad month but bounced back really well. I think that they want to lay me off but just want insurance that my time for the last few months have not been wasted (reasonably IMO). 

I said in the meeting, ""I'm sure you can see that this makes it sound like you want it to be easy to replace me"". To which they just responded with how happy they are about my work and are doing this in many departments.

Other facts to help you gauge the situation:
- the company hasn't lacked transparency in difficult moments in the past
- my job is pretty critical to the future of the company but not exactly critical in the present
- they said that I would know if they weren't happy with my performance but that still doesn't answer the question of whether a layoff is likely
- I'm completely a one-person team at the company as far as what I do

Should I start looking for a new job? Should I give them the benefit of the doubt and stay with a company I'm generally pleased with?

313,"I (F22) started dating (F20) back in march, (we dated before around 4 years ago, for 2 years, but things didn’t work out at the time). She reached out though email around december last year asking to for forgiveness and to be my friend again. We were a long distance relationship so we never met in person, I acceded to start a friendship again, everything was great until february when she decided to visit my country, we met up and hungout as friends everything went great. After I said goodbye the day she was leaving she texted me that she liked me and to give her another chance, I repeatedly told her for 2 weeks that I was really scared of getting hurt again and that idk if I should date her once again. After 2 weeks of her being really sweet around me, and trying her best I told her that I liked her back; she was just getting out of a relationship in january so I wanted to take things slow and whenever she was ready to ask me out officially I would accept, she asked me out at her own rate I didn’t pressure her in anyway. 

The first month of dating was great, I got my best friend back and we were really happy, after that, in late april she started acting distant weird. I tried to talk out with her about the problem but she told me that it was just problems at home and that she just needed some time alone, that she didn’t want to lash out on me so that’s why she was putting up some distance. She stopped calling me on facetime, playing games w me, etc what long distance couples usually do. It’s been around 4 months since then and things are worse, we barely talk, she avoids me since I see her on snapchat, I confronted her and she told me that she was still going through stuff, that we shouldn’t date at the moment cause she was trying to get better and work on herself. Then she turned her location off on snapchat so I wouldn’t see when she’s online. 

However she’s been drinking everyday starting a month ago, and going to parties, thats not what working on yourself means. I’ve tried talking to her but she just doesn’t want to talk about the issue and she has stopped texting me completely. 

I’m not sure about what to do at this rate. I suffer from anxiety and as a consecutive to protect myself, I have a strong need of blocking her again in my head, but I don’t wanna loser her again. I don’t known what I should do, any advice will be appreciated

315,"I'm a 25 year old male from the USA. If I were to sum up my life in three words, they would be:

*I feel stuck*.

Instead of typing out a massive paragraph that I'm sure would bore everyone to death, I'll give you guys a list of the current problems I see in my life (in a somewhat priority based order):

1. **I have no motivation to improve**. I work a part time job and I don't really care about working for more money. I have creative ideas, but never see them to completion. All my interests wax and wane. 

2. **I struggle with porn addiction**. This has been a brutal battle for me... and I basically gave up trying to fight it since I turned 19 (I'm 25 right now). I know it affects me... but I've never found a sustainable way to quit. I've managed to somewhat remove the unhealthy parts of it, but deep down I know it still hurts me.

3. **I have a bad sleep schedule that is fueled by mild anxiety**. The best I can get to is waking up around 8:00 AM... and then I have nights where my anxious thoughts kick in and I can't fall asleep until 2:00, which breaks my sleep schedule all over again. 

4. **I used to be religious, but now I'm basically an unwilling atheist**. I want to believe there is a God that actually cares for me and wants me to change, but the more I look the less I see. Plus I feel like I can never turn back to him unless I solve my porn issue.

5. **I struggle to work long hours**. I don't know what it is, but I really have a hard time working more than 20 hrs a week. It seems like everything is fighting against me. I get distracted easily some days, other days I get dizzy spells, while other days I can't sleep well and I have a really hard time making it through the day. I'm honestly beginning to wonder if I have a mental disorder... because even without porn I have these issues. 

6. **I don't really have many close friends I can confide in anymore**. That was one of the best parts of the church family I used to have years back. I haven't spoken with genuine honestly and willingness to change for 6 years. 

7. **Every time I exercise my body can't handle it**. Exercise was pretty much the best temporary remedy I found--in the form of running. Good cardio does miracles for the mind, but my legs have an issue where I can't run more than 3 miles without getting stress fractures that grow in intensity. It feels demotivating that I try to work hard to improve myself but my body literally says *""screw you""*.

*****

Honestly I feel clueless, but not worried. I'm fine with living life at my own pace... but maybe that's the problem. Maybe I'm *too comfortable* with life. My family is honestly wonderful and they haven't judged me for taking so long to decide what to do with my life, however, it's getting to the point where I feel like I'm taking advantage of them.

Any advice on how to improve one or more of these categories? I know several of them are quite intertwined, which is why I struggle to see a viable solution. 

Some examples of steps I have tried are:

- Try to keep exercising after my legs heal (I'm currently healing after my 4th iteration of this).

- Work on some hobby projects that could turn into a real money maker. Examples include programming and 3D modeling/printing.

- Get a sleep machine for night... but sadly it doesn't work much anymore.",21Jul2020,2
317,"Hi,

I'm a recent college grad in the US South. Black female. I'm stuck in a studio apartment in a pseudo-rural area with my dad, and our violent downstairs neighbor has a grudge against us. There are also a bunch of weird sketchy people who fight in the building.  I have $150 in my bank account. I'm too depressed and anxious to work and it's been that way for 6 months. I feel like nothing will change until  I go somewhere else. With the recent events and the place I now live (I lived in a major city in college which was much different) I don't feel safe.

318,"Let's just jump right in, shall we?

Me and my SO have been dating for a little over a year (Since May 25th to be exact). I fully trust and love him and know he would never cheat. The problem 100% is not about him.

A little while ago my SO told me about how this friend of ours(We are all friends but as you can assume SO and friend are closer) expressed that him and my SO(for context we are all bi, I am female, friend and SO are male) should stop jokingly flirting because he had actually caught feelings for my SO. My SO didn't reciprocate at all. Idk exactly what was said but I know it doesn't go both ways. This particular friend is super nice and energetic but they can be a bit much at times. This friend is also Poly so I know even if my SO weren't with me, he still wouldn't want a poly relationship because he is only interested in monogamy.

Over the last two weeks me and my SO went on a trip together to go see his family in another state(we are from the US). Before this I really wasn't too worried about them just because of the previous things I mentioned, but during this trip I noticed our friend doing things really bothered me. The thing is I don't know if these are just friendly behaviors from them because like I mentioned before this person is quite energetic but at the same time if I saw that in any other person I would think they are making advances towards my so.

In particular I noticed this friend called my SO multiple times even though we were in another state and they usually only call to hangout. This friend has just blatantly said they miss my SO and can't wait for them to get back. They also promised to get my SO very high(for context my SO is very experienced you could  say, personally I hate the feeling) the second he got back and they made plans for my SO to sleep over at his place that same night me and my SO got back.(This isn't unusual, my SO doesn't like the place he lives atm and kinda couch surfs to avoid going home)

I have been known not to come to my SO with things that bother me but I am trying to improve on that and talked to my SO about how I am uncomfortable and he completely understands. He told me that I am his number one priority and that he was willing to limit contact with this friend so I could feel better about it. I told him I didn't think that was my place to limit his friendships but we didn't really come up with any other solutions after that and my SO had to go because he made plans with the friend already and he couldn't just bail now. We both agreed on that. Not to mention friend called him about 3 or 4 times in the span on 15 minutes. (Not uncommon when they hangout because this friend is flamboyant but it didn't really help me feel any better to say the least).

My SO said he would text me once he got there and we could talk for a bit since this was our first night apart in a bit and neither of us really wanted to leave the other. It is not uncommon for him to forget to do this and I reminded him of that and he said he wouldn't. He did. Our friend got him high as a kite and he just totally forgot to text me. I texted him my to confirm this and told him I was really uncomfortable, that I wasn't really up for talking anymore(I mostly only cared about the arrival text), told him to have fun and that I loved him.

TLDR?
I feel like crying. I am crying.I can't tell if this friend is trying to make a move on my SO and now I feel like he is in a vulnerable situation where he forgot about me. I feel like I have done everything right but I am still so scared.

Side notes* The friend being poly really has no effect on the situation, just a bit of click bait if you will",21Jul2020,2

321,"I really got myself into a jam with this one.

I (30) met my now Ex-GF (32) at one of my current jobs. We were together for almost two years and have been broken up for nearly three months.

We both still work at the same place in the same department, so we see each other all the time. We don't really speak that much. The breakup was bad, and I just don't want to engage sometimes, and she still texts me that because I don't speak to her, that I already moved on, and she's easy to forget and just pouring her feelings out to me. She would get upset with me that it comes off as if I don't care as much as she does that we broke up.

That leads me to my next problem. Now, I'm not really looking at anybody. However, there's this one co-worker that also works in this same department that my Ex was *always* jealous of. We got into many fights because of her, despite me repeatedly telling her that I'm not interested in her, I'm not after her, and etc.

I noticed this co-worker has been friendlier towards me lately. We've worked a bunch of times together because we're trying to get the place into shape after recently reopening, and I guess we bonded or whatever. She's always asking me to stay and work with her past my time, even sometimes when no serious work has to be done. Just to hang out and stuff. She's dropped subtle hints about going over to her place, taking a walk together, and getting ice cream.

I don't know, it seems like she's making her move. Or maybe she just wants to be really good friends, and I'm interpreting this all wrong. She's cool and all, but I'm not really looking at her like that. It's just how it'll be interpreted throughout the place we work at. There's already a rumor going around that we act a little friendly towards each other because we joke around. If something actually does happen, my Ex will think I wanted her the whole time. Plus, one of my best friends still has a thing for her, despite her turning him down months ago.

What do I do in this situation?",21Jul2020,1
322,"PLEASE READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.............Its just me whining to be honest.

Don't you like ever feel bad for the people around you just because they know you. Like do you ever feel like that maybe if you didn't exist things would be easier for them. I feel like that. My friends and my family have to put up with me, tolerate me just because they can't abandon me since they are perhaps afraid of what others would think. I screw up in anything that I do. I have no future, literally, and the worst part is I'm not even physically or mentally challenged. I'm just a disappointment that runs to cry somewhere every time she is told that she should change and I agree I should but will that change anything?? 

I have tried to change before, perhaps not a lot but I have and it didn't make a difference. Maybe I just hate the person that I am. I want to run away, far far far far away where no one knows me so that I can't disappoint anyone anymore.  I don't want to be the person I am either. I am so done with myself but I can't end this either because then people will blame themselves for not noticing. I wish people could end their lives without being judged.  I have one thing I want to live for but it seems like even that is slipping out of my hands. I read this somewhere that everybody has a purpose in life but I don't see any in mine. Maybe if I knew my death was the purpose then it would be easier. I am such an ass.

But you know what I really wish for, that people could choose their families, their parents, their children, their siblings and if one doesn't get chosen then they don't have to exist, wouldn't that be easier to not exist in the first place if your entire being is going to be a disappointment. I don't want to be the person I am, because I am just a shell of the person my parents gave birth to. I don't want to see myself anymore and I don't want anyone else to look at me either and I don't want to look at anyone either. I just want to go far far far away so far that I can't hear anyone or see anyone, very very very far away.................",21Jul2020,1
324,"Hi! If you've seen any of my other posts, you know I'm a 21 year old male with 2 younger sisters, aged 14 and 15. 


Earlier tonight, I went down to the kitchen to grab some ice. It should be noted it was around midnight and I was only down there because my girlfriend fell down the stairs and hurt her knee. It was late, so I expected the kitchen to be empty, but I found my youngest sister. Whole this isn't an uncommon sight (she likes to cook late at night. Weirdo.), she was crying. 

Of course, I asked what was wrong, but at first she wouldn't tell me, which was odd because if it were friend drama she'd be dying to tell me exactly how her friend had wronged her and how so and so was being so mean today. 

She was looking at her phone, so I figured it was some texts someone had sent her, but she wouldn't let me see them, and she was bright red. 

Eventually I got her to show them to me, and I was disgusted and pissed off and honestly in shock. 

The texts were from her friends boyfriend, and older dude who's a rising junior in high school if I remember correctly. I'm not going to repeat the texts here, because they're horrible and make me want to throw up, but they were pretty much dirty texts about her body and a certain part of his. 

I was looking threw the texts and it looks like he sent them after she declined an invitation to date one of his friends, because she had recently been broken up with by her girlfriend and was pretty upset about it. 

I called him and confronted him and he had the nerve to suggest I wasn't her brother and she had payed me, which makes no sense. 

The problem I'm facing is I want to teach the little sh*t a lesson, but I also don't want to go to jail. Honestly, all I want to do is to break his f*cking face, but that would get me arrested as he is a minor. 


So, how can I teach the creep a lesson without actually hurting him?",21Jul2020,3
325,"I haven’t really had a strong relationship before this one girl came along, sure I’ve dated a couple other girls but it never really clicked and didn’t last long. This one also didn’t last long but I was head over heels for her, like full blown this is the one. and from what I could tell at the beginning she felt the same. the problem was she had gone through a rough breakup beforehand. We started hanging out a lot (like literally everyday) for a couple weeks, clearly getting more into each other. We started sharing about our family problems and our own personal issues and it was just such a safe space for both of us. 

Then we started sleeping together, and one thing led to the next and we’re dating. It all was going great, like no serious arguments or anything of that nature for 2 weeks, and then suddenly one night it was totally different. She was acting strange and not as talkative or cuddly as she usually was, but I didn’t think too much of it, she told me she was pretty tired after working a long day. Then the next morning I go to work and she drives home, and I get hit with the “can we talk after you’re done working” and my heart sank. That’s when I knew the night before wasn’t her just being tired. 

I went over there, we talked and the relationship ended. She said she wasn’t ready, and that she was sorry that she didn’t know herself better. I wasn’t mad at her, we talked it through and it ended being a fine breakup. I was pretty damn devastated though. Cried myself to sleep many times. Not to be woe is me, I was the one who willingly entered a relationship knowing her past boyfriend issues. But for some reason, even though there was no bad blood during or after the relationship, it all felt kind of toxic and too fast in a way. Now it’s been about a month, two times the length of the relationship, and I can’t go a few hours without her popping into my mind. I feel like maybe I should start working on myself more because I’m kind of a headcase myself. I don’t really know where to go from here and everyday is exhausting.",21Jul2020,1

He doesn’t name call but he does curse and he looks so scary when he yells. He has never physically hurt our kids but I am so worried about the psychological toll his yelling will take on them.

He ended up in a Discord with her and some of her friends. Throughout the night, they were calling her a different name and teasing her about it. He said he was confused and didn't understand until her friends left and it was just him and that girl. She admitted that she wasn't who she said she was and that's she's actually 17 and in high school. This didn't put him off though. He still continues to pursue her and talks to her every night. He says he's ""waiting until her birthday in three months."" But I know what he's like. He has random flings, obviously just for the sex. And he usually starts off pursuing these women in an aggressively sexual way, it's his opener pretty much. The only reason I know these things is that he's pursued me that exact way when there was a one-off hook up between us. I can't imagine what he's said to that girl, who is clearly a minor. When he listed what he likes about her he said: she has 99% of the qualities he's looking for in a partner, she's super cool and chill, and we literally play games every night together. HE EVEN SAID HE WAS REALLY HESITANT BECAUSE OF HER AGE. And they apparently click very well..... But it doesn't sit right with me or anyone else in our friend group. She's in high school. He's almost three years OUT of high school. You would think the maturity levels would concern him but then I start to think about the innocence he looks for in women. The want to teach them things they didn't know before, for them to be submissive. This is an actual minor, a child. I can already sense the manipulation.

Positive signals: 

- she responds fast
- when she send a selfie she includes her whole face in it as opposed to the uninterested ceiling picture with her forehead in it
- when I added her she added me back almost instantly and snapped me first

349,"At the start of the new year, my entire friends group seemed to have the exact same New Years resolutions. And that was to break up with their significant others. 

Each and every single one of them broke up with their partners over a period of two months, including my now ex. I was dating her for four years and we were engaged for about a year as well so when she broke it off with me I was pretty devastated. Ever since then I've had no real want or need to go out and find someone new, I'm happy by myself and I just want to be alone for a while.

The issue is that each and every single one of my friends seems hellbent on hooking up with other people. Each and every single time I meet up with them they just talk about this new guy they met that they want to hook up with, or how badly they want to meet a new girl, or how they've been chatting with someone new. Even my ex, who I'm on friendly terms with, has found someone new that she's been seeing. I'm happy for her, but it just seems like everyone's sprinting to find the next ""Mr/Mrs right"".

This wouldn't be an issue if they didn't always bring up the fact that I don't have anyone I'm seeing or talking to, and when I explain that I just wanna be alone for a while, they look at me as if I've suddenly sprouted a second head and its started yodeling.

Every time they do this, I feel like somethings wrong with me and like I'm just not as good as them since I don't have hundreds of girls sliding into my DMs, or that I'm not as social as them since I'm not chatting up every pretty girl that I come across, or that I'm somehow still pathetically clinging to the past since I just don't feel ready for it. It's made me not want to talk to or see any of my friends at all since I know that they'll carry on telling me about the new girl they slept with or the new guy they met up with and they'll wonder why I still haven't found anyone.

350,"So my (30M) wife (29F) and I are moving from New York City where we’ve both lived since the end of college (although we met later for anyone who’s wondering). 

I have two job offers that pay pretty much the same, one in Downtown Charlotte (called uptown by natives) and another in Los Angeles near Century City. I make a lot more than my wife, so her plan is to just find something wherever we move. 

If we move to Charlotte, we’d probably live in the southern part of the city, near the South Carolina border. In Los Angeles, we’d live in the San Fernando Valley (Northridge area maybe). 

Pros LA: Cool place to live, better private schools for kids in the future, better opportunities if I lose my job. My wife is from LA. 

Cons LA: San Fernando valley is hot, longer commute, smog, more expensive 

Pros Charlotte: Cheaper than LA, more temperate weather, on the East Coast (most our friends are along the NE corridor and Mid Atlantic), very easy for kids to get into UNC in state compared to Berkeley/UCLA. I am from North Carolina. 

Cons: Private schools aren’t as great as in LA, less to do, less diversity (although this isn’t a huge deal), less opportunities if I lose my job (worst case would have to move back to New York).

I remember the night before school started. I’d be jittery thinking about what I’d wear, seeing all my friends, wondering how fun or hard my classes and teachers would be that year.

I think about nights before a big performance. How nervous I’d be. Wondering who would see me. Hoping that I’d practiced enough and had everything perfected. Butterfly’s fluttering in my stomach so intensely I could barely contain my energy. 

There hasn’t been anything like that lately. It’s a variety of things. No work, no school, a drug problem and a global pandemic will kinda stick a wrench in your zen and well being. 

I just want to get back to how I used to be. Back when I wasn’t just trying to get through the day through any means necessary. When I actually had some self worth and compassion for myself and saw things in my future to be excited about. 

There’s no easy fix to this I’m just kind of rambling, but any advice from someone who’s been in a similar place before is appreciated.",21Jul2020,2
352,"My girl best friend cheated on her significant other with myself. I have been “in love” with this girl since the 7th grade (well over 7 years ago), I feel as though she took advantage of my feelings for her. After the act of cheating had been committed, she told her partner and shifted the blame more towards me, keep in mind that she initiated the whole process by kissing me first, and moving my hands all over her body. She’s still in the relationship and things have certainly been weird since. She wonders why I have been distant and hateful on the rare occasions that we do talk, but it seems quite obvious to me.

358,"Hey all. I’m at lost. My parents keep pressuring me to go back to university or transfer to another one but I really don’t want to go back. I thought I liked law but I don’t. Thought I’d like sciences but I didn’t. I am 24. And I’m lost.

I applied to accounting for university (still pending) but got accepted in college.

I also applied to a dental college and got accepted.

I really don’t know what I’m good at and it’s really frustrating to me I can’t figure out what’s my passion.

When I graduated highschool I didn’t have the best guidance counsellor nor did I had a great one in university either.

My parent’s don’t really guide me. My mom graduated in agriculture for university and recieved several college diplomas that were culinary, food control, and nursing. While my dad graduated in mechanical engineering.

They keep telling me what they accomplished and shoving it up my face. Saying how I am 24 and have not yet finished. I hate how their in my ass all day to pick what I’m good at but I really don’t know what. I dropped out of school for 2 years and worked. Chased my dreams but my parents forced me to come back to Canada. Went back last sem and now I’m just a mess.

361,"Hey guys hear me out ,

I'm a 22 years old I.T major student from a third world country in Asia which graudated last year, currently working as a Network Engineer in one of the leading Internet Service Providing Company in my country . I have start my carrer as an internship since the end of my 2nd year at college , during my 3 years here I have climbed the ladder very quickly i would say. Actually, the network engineer postion is one of the highest rank technical jobs in an ISP company, which everyone is dream of. I just got promoted to this position just around a years ago and there still a lot to learn to be able to catch up with the senior.  Day by day, I  feel bored of this job  due to many reasons For example:

\-Learning Curves: There are so much to learn every days . Believe me I am willing to learn anything that's why I'm in a place I am today  but sometime it is just too much. And you have to take an exam in order to get a network certificate from a vendor (Cisco, Juniper, Huawei....) To prove that you are capable of being good enough for this position.

\-Work hours:  The every days work schedule is 8:30 hours a day , but there are some time you have to work on a maintenance plan which often occured during midnight after the daily work schedule. Overall, the experience is not rewarding at all,if the maintenance is a success than it is okay, but it if is not going well  you will face a high risk of customer's complain and the pressure from the company. And you will have to continue working the next days.

\-Pay: The montly salary is really rough in my country. For my jobs it is only offer around 400$ per month, plus the overtime pay it can reach to 500$-600$ if you are willing to sacrifice your sleep and personal time. 

Recently , I have got a new idea, because there is a new game which is nearly got released for everyone to play and I know that it will going to be very popular in my country, I beleived i can create a unique contents based on that and it will get popular due to there aren't many contents similair to mine yet in my country. If this project is a success it would help me much better financially compare to my current jobs. And Gaming is always been a hobby and dream of mine since I was little and I have started a career in I.T because I love the new technology and it easier to convince my family to be on my computer all days without them asking me.

I have tried taking my left over time from work to create the content I had in mind, but it is hard , it required alot of time and equipment.The point is , the only time I had left is at night time afterwork to do what I loved but by doing so I don't have time to keep up with my Daily job. I'm not in a position which i can just quit a jobs to pursue my dream because it is not financially possible and I won't be successful on day one that my content was released .   


I do believed that I could be successful by making what I love, however it will take a lot of time to do so, and during the process I will have to leave my stable job behind. 

Will It be worth it should I follow my dream or follow the current path that i have took?",21Jul2020,1
362,"Hi everyone,

I hope this is not the typical ""help I'm in love post"".

Long story short, I met a girl 3 years ago on Tinder, we hit it pretty good and we were together for a summer, during which I fell hard for her but she didn't. I haven't seen her in the last 2 years because she lives in a different country now (I live in her home country), although we talk once every couple of months. I have been with some girls during this time but I have never fell in love again since I cannot find anyone that seems to me as good as her.

Cut to last Sunday, where I learned that her boyfriend of 1-1.5 years proposed to her and she said yes. I have been really trying to forget her for the last 3 months (when I first learned she had a boyfriend), but no luck so far.

I need your best advice to forget about this girl, please, one of my biggest worries is still being like this in another 2, 3, 4 years. Or that when I'm older this one will still be in my head as ""the girl that got away"".

370,"I’m 19M. I’ve been bringing up the topic of moving for quite some time now (the first mentions of it being a few years ago) around my family. In February I traveled to Dallas to scope out the area with my friend, and we loved it. 

After things were initially settling with COVID back in May, my best friend and I agreed to move there (from California) in the tale end of October. This has been in the works for a few months now. (For the record we try to be as safe as possible - masks, face shields, very limited contact. I know this doesn’t mean we won’t catch it, but we are being careful.)

I broke the news to my parents last week, and my dad thinks I should delay the move until January-ish so we can know more about the virus. On one hand I completely understand. On the other hand, I’m very ready to try something new after all the time we’ve spent huddled together quarantine. On top of that, since we’ve confirmed it, I set up a very specific schedule for college courses, saved up a good safety net, and planned everything out. It’d be a huge disappointment to my friend to delay it now and to myself to put aside all the plans. 

If we get sick, we’ve opted to take care of each other and quarantine for allotted time, plus his moms a nurse and is already in Dallas. We still want to try and make this work.

372,"I don‘t know where else I should post this. I read this sub‘s rules and it seems to fit at least.

Anyway, I [21F] train in Muay Thai. I practice fighting and technique two times a week, strength once a week and I go jogging once or twice a week (by myself). The trainer I train under normally does a warm up for about 15 minutes (mainly jogging) and then stretches with us for another 10 minutes. My problem is that I can feel that I‘m not warm after the warm up. I don‘t know what I‘m doing wrong. I normally run faster than the others because I normally run like 4 to 5 minutes per km when I jog on my own. When I‘m warming I‘m guessing it‘d be like 6 or 7 minutes if not less. Problem is that we run in circles and I have to run in a very small circle if I want to run faster than the others. 

Once we‘re stretching I can feel that I‘m not warm. I sometimes stretch after jogging and I get way further than I do during training. Once we train with partners, I often end up pulling a muscle on my inner thigh during a middle or a high kick.

So does anyone have tips for me what I can do to warm up more efficiently because I don‘t want to keep hurting myself. Any advice would be appreciated.

2. When I open up or cry to her, I am constantly invalidated. She tells me I’m being dramatic/over thinking things/ making things up. One example was her begging for me to open up when I was crying only for her to come in and say “are you done crying yet? You need to talk to me.”
3. She’s said multiple times she’d get me into therapy for the last year, as well as promised to stop using my deadname (birth name, very uncomfortable) as blackmail/insult. Neither of which she’s fulfilled her promise.
4. My mother continues to speak with my rapist virtually. She previously told me she’d stop, yet still does even though I’ve openly expressed my trauma and discontent.

20, Female

I have a peculiar phobia. For some unknown reason, I’ve had recurring nightmares about cannibalism ever since I was a very young child, always with a different plot line featuring cannibalism. They’re absolutely horrific and graphic. Others feel sick just hearing about them. I can’t hear about instances of cannibalism or watch films that even allude to the practice without becoming emotionally devastated and terrified. It is difficult for me just to write this. Recently, I accidentally saw photographs of cannibalism victims on the internet, and now the images are burned in to my memory, too. Every time I eat meat (except for certain types of seafood), I think about all of the horrible dreams and photos and begin to feel sick. I lose my appetite / desire to eat, even if I am literally starving. 

I’ve recently started trying to eat very healthily to safe guard myself against heart disease, but, in order to get enough calories, I have to rely on the consumption of eggs and meat. It makes me dread eating at all. I get nauseous just cooking. My parents say that, even as a baby, before I could speak, I would gag and get sick if fed baby food featuring meat. I distinctly remember being six or seven years old and sobbing and vomiting as my mother force fed me chicken I couldn’t bring myself to eat. I’m only allergic to beef, but I can experience this reaction to any meat or eggs. 

What can I do to stop the weird phobia I have of cannibalism so that I can eat a balanced diet of ham and chicken (please: no exposure therapy recommendations)? Why do you think that I have this phobia / what might potentially cause these recurring dreams? Is there a good caloric alternative for meat in a diet? I’m trying to eat healthier, but, in order to get enough calories everyday, I’m having to eat a lot of eggs and meat, and it’s really difficult for me.",21Jul2020,1

Everything about it is great, but I'm suuuuper conflicted personally. The issue is my roommates and I actually get along really well and rarely have disagreements.

385,"We’ve known eachother for almost a year and a half. We had a really intense fwb relationship back in 2019. However things got too serious too quickly which led to issues and eventually a stop to the relationship. But I swear he was the best guy to ever come into my life. I just got shitbags after that. However after that was past us, we remained good friends. We’ve always had a great, close friendly bond despite our past issue. He’s always given me advice and has respected me. 
 
He did end up getting into a relationship, as did I, I dated an abusive drug dealer in the last months with him on my mind even tho I was with the drug dealer, It’s like I got into a relationship to distract myself from him but it just made me constantly compare him to the guy...but as I was In my stuff he dated another much older woman then him and it failed. We ended up breaking up with our partners the same day!  Started talking again in a friendly manner. Coincidence? 

Well So now he’s fucked over..wants nothing to do with a relationship. Which I know. But I did ask if he wanted to see eachother again sexually after we broke up with our partners. at first he told me “Kai, I would do it, but it’d be so emotional, and emotions lead to relationships. and the fact I don’t want a relationship right now because of how many times I’ve been fucked over” and then was like “Kai I just don’t wanna be an asshole who just wants sex from you, I respect you”

But, fast forward a few weeks we did talk about meeting up and starting our fwb again. I dumbly said “I want sex”, he started getting comfortable I guess and asked if I wanted to meet up for it. But He stated that he had “one rule” he doesn’t want to kiss me in sex because he doesn’t want it to be emotional and that kissing is more meaningful? Which upset me because back then we always kissed. But only because he knows I or him or we will start catching feelings for eachother and he doesn’t wanna make it toxic or ruin our friendship and he doesn’t wanna have to hurt me...he said he doesn’t wanna put messages out...so he told me that if we start a fwb, and I start getting feels I have to tell him if I’m catching feelings, and he’ll do the same to me if he catches them, so we can have a “cut back” on the sex...And he kept saying how his relationships were just always fwb that’d always turn into ridiculous, toxic relationships. 

Which is true. But I feel offended in a way. It’s like...is he doing this to be careful? And to not ruin our friendship? And the whole catching feelings thing? Well I already have feelings for him. I’ve been holding onto them for months. I thought he would know. Since the day we met. I wanna tell him I don’t want to do a fwb anymore and that I wanna wait. I don’t wanna be a fwb to him because then he won’t see me as an investment for a relationship. He’s been hurt so bad and fucked over he won’t ever wanna make a fwb a relationship. At least that’s what I feel like. Just a fwb. But I highly doubt it because literally ALL his fwb relationships always turn into them..ours..idk we stopped stuff before it got to that point. but idk... And if we do become a fwb again and I catch them (like he thinks I Will since he doesn’t know I like him) then he’ll cut the sex out if I catch feelings or if he catches them. But that he’ll remain my friend and talk to me still if I told him. He just won’t want a relationship for a while. He even said, all my relationships were fwb and it goes toxic. I don’t wanna be toxic with him. I don’t wanna have him second guessing me and I don’t wanna get hurt. I know I will. I love him. I wanna wait. I will wait until he’s ready.

She still pays her share of the rent but we agreed i’d pay for the wifi &amp; the pg&amp;e bill since i’m the only one using those services. However, recently she came back to our apartment with her whole family. They live 3hrs away so instead of booking a hotel they have all been staying here which i really dont mind since i have my own room and get along with them well. So far, they came last week for 3 or so days &amp; this week for 3 days and counting since i dont know when they’re going to leave. The thing that’s bothering me &amp; I dont know how to address is the fact that since she’s been here she’s been leaving the AC on all day and night. Literally. I work in the mornings &amp; when I come back I find the apartment to be empty and the AC is still running. Because she’s here, we agreed to split the pg&amp;e for the duration that she’s here. So for example, if she stays 1 week, she will pay 1/4 of the bill. I just dont think it’s fair that she’s literally racking up the bill &amp; since i’m paying for most of it, most of that payment will fall on me. Especially during peak hours. I also want to note that while i was here alone I literally never turned on the AC. Also, for some reason during her whole visit, I feel like she’s been giving me the cold shoulder. Her mom and cousin always talk to me while i’m around, but she barely even acknowledges me when i’m around her. I think that’s why i’m having such a hard time bringing this up.

My birthday recently passed and I did not get a single text.. I hate how I feel bitter but also envious of how they are still such great friends, seeing that I don’t really have that anymore. It feels as if I’ve been left behind, and Idk it sucks so badly to lose that kind of friendship while not knowing if you’ll ever get that kind of friendship again. It’s made me so insecure around other people that i’m afraid if i make new friends they’ll eventually do the same thing; Get bored of me and leave me behind. How do you deal with these kind of feelings?",21Jul2020,1
396,"Mobile post/trigger warning (sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes in advance I have severe dyslexia) 

So a little back story, I have been sexually assaulted on multiple occasions by two different men. One of the things both guys did was choke me/cover my mouth, so as you can imagine wearing a mask can make me feel panicky. 

This hasn’t really been an issue since I normally just avoid going out of the house, but now that my college is going back I know I’ll have to wear a mask for long periods of time(I already have at least one confirmed in person class). Not wearing a mask isn’t an option for me either(I could technically be given special permission and get a doctors note because I have asthma as well as lung damage that makes it even harder to breathe with a mask on.) I’m on some pretty intense hormone treatments in order to manage my endometriosis, this make me have a every weak immune system. I’ve already had covid once already and it almost killed me,I can’t risk getting sick again so masking up for me is a must. 

Any advice or tips for what I can do to make wearing one easier on me, mentally and emotionally?

399,"I do some hourly work and serve on the Board of Directors for a nonprofit. I've been with this place for 5 years now. 2 years ago, I was basically a paid intern and didn't have much pull in the organization. This changed after some drama. The executive director was fired and created a huge mess for the board to clean up. I suddenly became much more valuable because I knew how most things worked in the organization. The board invited me on and I was happy to help. Then things changed. The board members became uninterested in helping out. I found myself doing a lot of the work. This came to a breaking point early this year. We brought on 3 new board members to try and increase productivity. It went ok for a while, but then people started leaving. I lost a family member to Covid in April and said that I was taking a break and that others would have to step up. 2 people quit because of that. 2 people moved out of state. Some people just disappeared and stopped communicating. At this point, the only people associated with the org are myself, 1 local person, and 1 person working from out of state.

It's just not worth it anymore. My heart's not in it. If I leave though, all my knowledge of the inner-workings of the organization leave too. I would essentially be dumping an insane amount of work on 2 people. One of them is fairly new and the other doesn't even live here. There's grant obligations, events to be held, bills to pay.

Bit of background. I'm 21, partners 27. He has a 5 y/o  daughter from a previous relationship and I have no children. He has had full custody since birth but in July last year SD's mother had another daughter and wanted to build up her relationship with SD again. SD wanted this too. 

Now, SD has come down for a trip to see family. Most of her clothes that she's come with are OLD!!!!! Age 3-4 but she's almost 6. Only 2 pairs of underwear. No socks. And everything stinks. My partner and I spent the better part of last night cleaning just her clothes. 

There's a court agreed child support agreement but he giver her £250 more than it states totalling £500 a month. But it's clearly not going on the child.

The child is not being neglected. She loves her Mum and is always happy when telling her stories. But we don't know what to do. Child is happy with Mum. My partner feels guilty for letting her go back to her Mum but knows that's what she wanted. 

We're not in a position to take the child back permanently although I would in a heart beat. As I'm not the parent, there's a line that I do not want to cross when it comes to my opinion. But what on earth should I do to support my partner, and do what's best for this child?",21Jul2020,2

408,"Context: Known each other going on 8 years now. We've played games and I've considered him one of my closest friends for a long time now. He moved 6 years ago but we've kept building a bomb friendship over League and other games.

Recently (by that I mean the last 4 years) I've been feeling the need to be better. To write my damn novel and I've been sad and frustrated constantly for a long time now about it. He hears all about it, but the last few months I've started to realize he just brushes it off and I think it's because I talk about it so much. It's always IDK as a response and rarely do I get anything else. I think we're at a point where he thinks we have a great friendship and have lots of fun over games, but not much beyond that. I think that's really sad because my view is that friends are there to lean on in the sad boy times, which I tend to have a lot of, way more than just the good times and success.

I feel like I might be forcing this ideal too much on him, and I don't know how to feel. On one hand, I keep thinking he finds my sadness tiresome at this point and he mentioned that it annoys him. On the other I can't help it, I need constant encouragement and I can see how that gets really tiring when there isn't much visible change on his end. I just need someone to care enough to push me. I don't have the greatest relationship with my family, so maybe that's why.

K on the other hand is another best friend(and is also best friends with A, we’re like a trio) who i had a relationship pretty soon after R but we broke up 2 or so months ago. 

Anyways, I’ve always caught myself thinking about her and wanting to be around her, as more than friends, but recently she told me she wanted to lose her vcard to one of our friends in a guy group i introduced her to, (just to get it out of the way as she put it) and at that moment i knew i had to tell her how i felt because I’m already protective as it is but this made me feel protective as wanting my crush to myself type, I want to tell her how I feel, but she tells me all the time im like a brother to her and that she couldnt even think of that happening.

But she already has.

She got drunk one night and in our PS4 party she said she has thought about both us romantically and s*xually, at the time i felt good about myself but now i think about it as like a ray of hope.

421,"Short intro, I have a friend who I've known since I was 10 years old (22 currently). We've been very close friends but had a few moments in life that we drifted a bit. Currently now he's one of the very few people I still talk to. I see him almost every weekend and his girlfriend and my girlfriend are best friends. He's been too large of a part to me and my girlfriends life to just 'cut off' at this point.

The issue is as of the last few years he's progressively became more narcissistic and toxic, peaking as of right now. He's extremely competitive over everything, never quits to stop bragging when he wins, when he loses he gets into the worst moods. He literally openly calls himself a 'Main character' while everyone else is a side character and that hes a 'God'. But in reality (atleast through my eyes) he's not really a spectacular specimen that stands out amongst the rest. 

One of the recent issues he causes is telling my girlfriend, his girlfriend, and our personal arts arent great or makes up some random BS statement like "" its against the rules to use 3 fonts"". or ""uhh I dont like the line work"" with no further explanation if you ask, he just dont like it. He simply doesnt like telling people they're good when they're better than him and his ego is hurting. Hes literally never made any personal art outside of school or work in his life but is OBSESSED with his title as 'art director' at work. He's just a phony.


He went to college for 2 years to study advertising and graphic design and got an entry level job at a pharma advertising company as an 'art director' getting paid minimum wage. He doesnt direct anyone, he simply makes pamphlets and advertisements for small medical companies using stock images, minor editing skills and copy pasting text from a copywriter. Meanwhile never in his past has he drawn a picture, painted a picture or ever had interest in art. 



I personal think that hes got terrible conscientiousness, a lack of control over his ego, and has every trait of narcissism (he needs constant attention on himself, says some rude shit to make himself sound better.
He's quick to criticize or critique others but if someone criticizes him he resents them and acts like a victim crybaby.

Edit: additionally something I cant get over is that he told me that he hates his dad because his dad wont wash his dishes. He expects his dad at 23 years old to wash his dishes. He was serious about it too...like WTF HOW DO I ARGUE WITH SOMEONE WITH THAT LOGIC.",21Jul2020,1
422," 

There's so much to unpack and so much I want to say but i'm going to try to keep this as short as possible. . I'm from the US, and I moved to Japan when I was 19 to enter a language school here. I had entered university in the US, and spent a year mentoring exchange students who came to the US, and mostly listening to their frustrations with the cultural differences they experienced everyday. I stayed up helping them edit their term papers until late at night, hosted events to help everyone feel more comfortable, and soon most of my focus was on being apart of this international community.

It's a long story (i'm one of the few who didn't move to Japan for anime), but because of a half-dozen or so life coincidences, I felt like I was being pushed in the direction of Japan. I started dating a Japanese girl from that international community after a few months, and while I was planning on going to Japan sometime in the future for quite some time, that was the thing that pushed me over the edge to leave that college which was in the middle of nowhere, and go to Japan to learn more about the culture and language. I was facing a fork in the road. I saw all of my friends, my girlfriend, and the thing I really wanted to do leaving with the end of that year, and I just felt like it was time for me to move on as well.

I'm explaining this because my family was understandably surprised and apprehensive about my decision, but what surprised me was just how dismissive they would come to be in the next few months. I decided to drop out, and for the 6 months it took me to get my visa to Japan, they made it their mission to humiliate me at every party, every event, every time I went to visit the dentist, etc. They didn't want me to go, and did whatever they could to stop me. I don't want to go into every story because this post is already getting too long, but the biggest things were that

1: I told them that when I was part of that community, I felt like I was expanding myself. I felt like I was becoming a better person. I want to move to another country like Japan to become somebody more unique and well-rounded. Their response to this was ""in Japan you'll just be another white-boy"".

2: While I admit looking back that it was initially a big factor in me wanting to move, they thought the only reason I was moving to Japan was to be with my girlfriend, and they made sure to make a scene to every person they could about this fact. Every waiter/waitress in the 50 mile vicinity had to know that I was moving to Japan to go live with my Japanese girlfriend. I suppose they were testing me in a way? We broke up over 5 years ago and I'm still here so that clearly wasn't my only reason for coming, although I suppose I can understand their perspective on this. They handled it really immaturely though.

(I just want to say I appreciate anyone who has read this far. I realize this is way too long).

Most first year of living in Japan, they would demand I call them and tell them everything i'm doing, and if I ever had a bad day all I heard was ""well you could just come back home then"". I had a bad date? Cue parents/Sister ""well you know we have girls here too"". If I struggled with the culture in any way : ""I thought you were supposed to know these things by now. I guess you should come home"".

This lead to a huge amount of resentment from me, because what I NEEDED was for somebody to tell me that what I was doing had value, and to keep going. That they were proud of me. Not to come home because they missed me. The longer I have lived here, the stronger I have felt this. To be fair to my parents, I should mention that they were paying for most of my school while I was living here (that being said it was MUCH cheaper than the US. We aren't talking about 30k a year or something insane like that). As a result, I feel guilt any time I feel resentment against them. They made it possible for me to do what I wanted to do quicker, and made me feel terrible about it the entire time I was doing it.

Fast forward 5 years, I went through college here, and now I am working a job doing international marketing, hunkering down during covid. While things have gotten much better over the years, and I look back at some of my own actions and cringe a bit, I still feel like they don't understand the magnitude of the life decision I have taken here, and demand that we have a stronger connection while refusing to listen to me about any of my real experiences. For example, I entered university here a second time, with the goal of taking all of my courses with other students in Japanese. Around my 3rd year I was struggling so much with my courses, papers, part-time job, and looking for internships all in my second language, that I was only sleeping for 4-5 hours a day. When I told my family about this their response was something like ""Oh yea, I remember those days"".

... You...remember those days, of living in a foreign country, as a minority, and taking college courses in a second language you started learning a few years ago...while working a part time job in that language and trying to do job hunting...all while considering cultural differences..while living alone with no safety net around...you really remember that?

This is a pretty accurate metaphor for our entire relationship at this point. I don't need them to say that what I'm doing is special or amazing, but they seem to have this attitude that they have had all of my experiences, with the small difference that I learned Japanese or something? They don't understand how the cultural, language, lifestlye, how that effects every single aspect of my life on a moment to moment basis. And I love it. I don't want to complaing, so I usually don't talk about my life. But then they complain that we don't have some deeper connection. When I open up to them they disregard my experiences by saying ""that isn't as unique as you think it is"", or ""i've done the same thing"" or something along those lines. They said the same thing when I moved. I moved from Osaka, Japan to Tokyo, which is about 6 hours away by car. I had to figure out the logistics of moving all of my furniture, finding a new apartment while in Osaka and then taking a day trip to Tokyo to sign papers, dealing with tons of discrimination because i'm not Japanese, renewing my visa and sending in those documents to the realtor, a dozen more steps like that etc... and again they said ""oh yea I remember moving it was rough"" . They're comparing moving 30 minutes away in their own country, to me moving 6 hours away in another country for a new job.

I don't know, they probably don't mean to sound so dismissive. And i'm really trying to just let them say what they want and let them be happy but...I don't know, maybe it's covid but it's been pretty lonely living like this for so many years. I had friends who supported me here but since moving to Tokyo and being stuck in a 20 square meter apartment for 6 months during all of this, it's starting to really get to me. I just work and call them and it's starting to make me lose my mind a bit.

So...at this point I just say thank you to them, try to be respectful about any advice they give me, and hunker down and accept that i'm alone in this. Until I make some new friends in this new city at least.

This was so long I know. It's unorganized and emotional, but maybe getting some different perspectives would help? Thanks for your time.",21Jul2020,1

It’s frustrating and I always end up getting annoyed with myself, because if I end up leaving a situation where I could of potentially got a phone number I end up kicking myself for being a wuss and not pushing through that barrier of approach. It’s never really the fear of rejection that gets me, i just honestly lack the experience of going up to strangers and making conversation, so that anxiety that creeps up whenever I see an opening sets in and stops me from conquering that mindset.

433,"Hello all. What I'm going to ask is something that has been on my mind for years. I hope this is the right place to ask.

Is it acceptable/appropriate for me, a non-Black WOC, to get a ""still I rise"" tattoo?

Context:
I am Asian and have been part of an international community in my own country (SEA) for 6 years and counting (3 years of university &amp; 3 years of working professionally). I work with people from all over the world and most of them are wonderful people.

However, the system itself is less than fair and treats employees differently based on their nationality (in terms of benefits and wages). You can probably guess that my Caucasian colleagues are the most benefitted by this system.

Somewhere between those years, I felt depressed and defeated because I was seen as less than the expatriate employees--even when compared to my Caucasian fresh graduate colleagues (despite me having a bachelor's degree from an American university and have more experience than them).

Going back to my initial question, I have always loved the poem because it is so badass and meaningful to me, especially because of this discrimination (which probably stemmed from colonization). This is why I really wanted to get the tattoo but had decided against it for the time being because I'm not sure if it's offensive to the Black community who has definitely faced way, way worse injustice.

Thank you in advance!

I basically don’t know how to make friends now, since almost everyone at school already have their own friends since day 1/since the first year of high school until now. Yeah i’m pretty lost lol. 

Sorry if my english is bad, or if this post is kinda confusing or something, feel free to ask additional questions or info. 

I’d really appreciate your help, thank you in advance :(",21Jul2020,3
435,"Bit of a back story, I'm 23m and have always had difficulty making friends. After finishing high school none of my friends spoke again. I use to work in a store and had a few there but they were just work friends, same as now with my current job, it's difficult here as theirs only 4 people and they're all over 60. I use to play world of Warcraft and made a few friends all other Europe, but we have since drifted apart as I stopped playing until the new expansion is released. Basically I can't keep friends with anyone more than a year.
I've tried joining local clubs etc but nothing has come from it, I have a girlfriend and she is in the same boat.
Any advice would be appreciated about how I can make friends.",21Jul2020,1

439,I (20f) bleached the front two strands of my hair in March at the beginning of lockdown. It’s cute but I’m done with it now and i’m finding it hard to match with any clothes I wear.

443,"Emphasis on had, it used to be a small brown raised circle on my nose, though big enough to be noticeable and for me to have not felt good about myself. I cut it off when i was 15 because i felt ugly and remember my parents and sister weren't happy and i walked around with a scab for a week before it healed into an almost normal pink.

After that i went through a change in personality as i felt a lot better about myself, i even got a girlfriend a few months later.

I don't think anyone remembers me with it, i never took photos because i never felt good about my appearance. Even in photos it wouldn't show up, like if i did a school picture, but if someone got me from my right hand side, it was there. New friends especially don't notice my nose and don't ask and i haven't either. I haven't told anyone what i did or why.

It's something i've felt self conscious of since then because it left a scar that isn't ""normal"" like the rest of my nose and i decided a few years ago when i had a job and the money i would find a way to make it normal. I don't know if it's plastic surgery but somewhere would do it, right? Then recently my little brother, who just had to say something, mentioned i had a bump on my nose, so i guess other people can say it, none are dumb enough to ask or care.

However, now it's gotten to the point where i just don't like my nose at all and want to change it. Like ive watched reality TV where a guy got a nose job and laughed, now i'm considering it.

I just wanted to get this off my chest and get advice? I don't know i feel more comfortable being anonymous than telling a close friend i used to be not confident and felt i was ugly because of my nose.",21Jul2020,1
444,"I just did something horrible. I had over a 4-hour phone call with someone that thought they were friends with me. I told them I was manipulating them the whole time in this phone call. I explained that it was because I was lonely in high school that I started being their “friend”. I told them they were the only person I didn’t have social anxiety around, so I could bare hanging out with them and talking with them. Also on the phone call, I told them I had no emotional connection with them the whole time and that I entered the “friendship” to not form an emotional connection and to not feel alone. I told this person that I used them to not feel alone once we would go back to school for another whole school year. Btw, I’m 18 and they are 17. We both graduated in June. 

&amp;nbsp;

This person told me to never talk to them again and that they want to be friends but they could never trust me and it wouldn’t be real. A theme in this person’s life is that they feel like they aren’t worth anything to anybody, and I added to that by being a fake friend the whole time. On this phone call not long ago since I’m writing this, I explained that I genuinely wanted a friendship that had zero emotional connection to me. I told this person that I was never their friend.

&amp;nbsp;

In the first place, this person had sent me a message stating that they wanted to call me to “vent to me”. I hadn’t talked to this person on the phone in months, I think since April of this year. Once physically attending school was stopped, I stopped trying to keep the “friendship” going. I also tried to stop keeping the “friendship” going between summers since I started talking to this person. I started talking to this person in September 2018. Just about an hour or so since I started typing this, I had that phone call where I told them that it was all fake for me the whole time.

&amp;nbsp;

The whole phone conversation was over 4 hours, close to 5 hours. In the beginning, it was more of the same discussions as usual, about how her abusive boyfriends who don’t love her just use her for sex. I told her, as I usually have told her, that these people are treating her like dirt and that she is worth much more than that. I told her so many times “I care about you” in this phone call. Later on, I became truthful. I told her I never felt an emotional connection to her. She told me that she feels like she isn’t a “real person” and that no one will ever care about. This is something she has told me for a very long time and I have felt bad and tried to help her by telling her these boyfriends are treating her horribly and abusing her. Theres so many stories about how she was abused and so many times she has vented to me by calling me and I told her that I basically cared about her and that she matters as a person.

&amp;nbsp;

Me revealing in this phone call, about an hour ago, that I never felt an emotional connection with her definitely hurt her. She told me it did. She said she wished she never met me. I told her that I was telling her it because I wanted to actually try and be her friend. I also told her it seemed like she wasn’t authentic to me or like she was ever acting herself. Then, I made the conversation about me by saying that I first started talking to her because I was not being my authentic self and I was drawn to her. I told her she seemed like someone who maybe also had social anxiety and couldn’t be authentic. 

&amp;nbsp;

The whole reason I brought up myself into the conversation and that I brought up the reason why I started talking to her was because she asked me to be “brutally honest” with her. This was because I kept telling her that going to therapy will help her and she was saying therapy would not save her. This led to her crying as I told her that I “care about her” and that she has abusive parents, abusive family, and abusive boyfriends. I also told her I knew that choosing to go to therapy would be one good choice that she could make to make a step toward happiness. Then, she asked me to be “brutally honest” and tell her what I really think of her. This is when it led to me telling her that I think she was not being her authentic self. After that, I told her that I didn’t think she was being authentic because I knew I was not being authentic. Then I revealed to her that I was not really her friend and that I used her.

&amp;nbsp;

I wanted to be honest and tell the truth to her no matter what she asked. I am personally in therapy and changing who I am, trying to be more authentic and be myself. This is why I finally brought up that the friendship was fake and telling her I used her. I told her what I did is probably one of the worst ways to misuse someone’s trust. She has told me so much, cried to me so much, and I have always given her advice. I have always felt pity. It’s just that pity is not caring for a friend. She told me herself she never wants to talk to me again and that she can’t be friends with me if I am “friends” with her out of pity.

&amp;nbsp;

Next, she brought up the fact that her boyfriends don’t even like her. I said to her that I guess I’m not different than them, except I wasn’t using her in the way they were. I was using her as a fake friend to be a companion, her boyfriends use her for sex. They abuse her. In fact, she gets abused by sooo many people at work and by her parents and siblings at home. She has always told me she could never “think for herself” and that she focuses too much on others. I would usually tell her that she is so kind to the point where she does not think enough of herself. I usually would say that she needs to get someone else, another person, to also talk with about this that she trusts. 

&amp;nbsp;

I knew all along that I was not her friend, I guess. I wanted her to get help. In the end, I used her the way that the way so many people do. And now she lost me, the only person she ever talked to about her feelings. And it was all fake because I was using her. I feel so guilty. I have been jittering like crazy. She is so sad in life and she has told me that whenever we have talked. I asked if there is a way to help her in an way I can on the phone call, and she said to never talk to her again. She hung up immediately after that. I feel like the devil. I feel like I ruined someone’s life and I feel so guilty. I can’t stop shaking. I need advice. Please help.",21Jul2020,0
445,"Apologies for my ignorance, I'm only 20 and have never dealt with something like this. Years ago I had an online friend, we'll call her J. J clearly had mental health issues at the time but refused to admit it and never got help. At first it was just a few things that were off but she increasingly got so bad her family couldn't ignore it anymore. Her sister messaged me saying that J had been admitted to a psychiatric ward and wouldn't be able to contact me anymore, but I would probably hear from her when she was out.

A few months ago I thought she must be out now and decided to check on her social media since I missed her friendship. It seems J was worse than ever. She believed she was kidnapped and held hostage in this psychiatric ward. I kept going back to her profile and checking her, I don't know why, I just felt concerned. She's gotten increasingly worse. She posts dozens of times a day on Instagram and her posts are unsettling and sickening. Some of them were so horrifying that I couldn't get them out of my head all day. She's clearly very, very mentally unstable and needs help. I know it isn't my business, but I was worried. But it's gotten worse. Her last few posts make me think she's going to hurt her pet dog and maybe herself. I feel I desperately need to do something, but I don't know how. I know she won't listen to me if I try to talk to her. I've seen a few people comment on her posts telling her she clearly needs help and she just gets angry and posts worse things and tags them. 

We were careful about privacy during our friendship. I don't know where she lives, but I think I know the state because she tagged it on Instagram once. She also has her full name displayed now but it's very common. I don't know how to contact her family. I feel like I need to report her somewhere but I don't know where to report her to. Also, after what happened last time she was admitted, I'm afraid she'll get out and be even worse. Or maybe I'll report her and she won't be admitted but she'll be so angry that she does something bad. I'm not sure if Instagram posts are enough proof that she's dangerous and unwell.

I can't stop thinking about her and I don't know what to do. I tried to ask my parents and they brushed me off and told me she isn't my problem. I know that, but someone needs to do something. We were really close at one point. And she loved her dog so much, it's so worrying that she's posting hinting that she wants to hurt her. Does anyone have any advice? Is there some place you can report mentally ill people? I can find resources for reporting minors, but not adults. I feel pretty helpless right now.",21Jul2020,1
446,so i’m in college and i thought i had completed my financial aid documents but turns out i didn’t and now i’m too late but i really need the $ for my tuition (which is only a little over 1000). what can i do?,21Jul2020,1
447,"Hey everyone,

My parents have had some stuff in the past which delayed their lives. My dads by about 20 years, my mum's by about 10, as she was raising us kids while my dad was away sorting things out. Part of those issues has meant that our family home has been under regular threat from creditors.

Recently, they've been working incredibly hard to free the house and repay any outstanding debt. I also spent 3 years helping them at their business, working 12 hour days, 7 days a week. No sick days, no weekends, no bank holidays. I had about a week off in the entire 3 years. They've been doing the same for the 20 and 10 years respectively.

That was when I was 24 - 27 years old. I then left as we felt that my skills (a degree, professional experience) would be better used in a corporate setting, rather than slaving in the family business. My life could be more ""normal"" (have friends, weekends, holidays, etc). In the midst of it, I wanted to buy my own property.

I've currently lived at our family home for the past 2 years (I'm now 29), working my way up through jobs and saving hard for a deposit on a house. Part of the help has been the fact I've not paid any rent or bills.

My parents have got to the stage where they have a financial plan:

\- The mortgage on the property can be paid off this year (and they want to add mine and my siblings names to it) if they plug all their money in, as do my siblings and me. My siblings are fine, they want to live here. I want to buy my own place.

\- They own two shops. Both are in advanced stages to sell. Once they have sold, that gives more capital for them to do what they want. I want to buy a house? They can give me a deposit (which would be what I have now).

My worries are this:

1. Shops have been in advanced stages before and the sale falls through. It's taken me 2 years now and I'm at my deposit because I'll receive a starting bonus. It'll take me longer to get that. At nearly 30, I hate not having my own space, but I can't save without staying at home. I'm feeling like staying at home is holding ME back.
2. My mum has ambitious plans to renovate the house. Money from the shop sales will go to this. What if they prioritize this over giving me deposit money? I've then given away all my money and am stuck here....although I think at this point I will give up on buying and leave and rent.

The only pro is that I will be put on the family house, which has the potential to be worth a lot in a few years....but do I care about that? Honestly, no. We are never planning on selling it and so I'll never see that money myself.

I feel as though if I don't pay, I will be outcast from my family. If I do pay, then I'll be stabbed in the back and guilt tripped to stay at home.

448,I’m 16 and story short I’m a hit to high maintenance for my parents(not trying to be quirky) but some thing happened and my last resort of running away has been starting to run up on me faster than I thought. Like within this month or the next 2 weeks. I have about 34 to 40 dollars max. I have a friend that might be able to house me but those chances are very very sl. Almost not worth it to take the chance if they turn me in.( I’m not a criminal but I don’t know how else to word it.) I have a suit case I can stuff full of clothes and a game omg system with a few stuff on it if o needed to sell it also. But that’s about all of my resources I have on hand unless I were to steal stuff but I don’t wanna resort to that. And I’d rather not commit suicide. I he sent gotten to that point yet.

449,"Okay so, I'm a 16 year old male, turning 17 in October, and I feel like my parents are really controlling.

They use this findmyiphone app to track where I am and where I go constantly. Whenever I do go out, whether it's for a bike ride or because I am going to the shops, they will track me and text me every few minutes to see where I am going and if I am okay. If I ignore these texts then I get told off badly when I get home and they tell me they won't let me outside on my own again.

I can't turn my phone off to stop them tracking me either, nor can I not go out without my phone.

They also have complete access to my phone and I have to ask their permission to download any app. This is annoying as I don't really want my parents being privy to private conversations between me and my friends. They have before looked at my messages and asked me lots of uncomfortable questions before... So I'm stuck using my laptop for anything else I do and thankfully they don't have access to it, though, they have demanded it on occasion.

I get I'm 16 and still technically a kid but my brother's 19 and he still has all of these things. I really don't want my parents to continue this into adulthood, especially if I want to go somewhere/do something that they may not like or shouldn't even know about. This has been going on ever since I got a phone.

How do I approach my parents over this and is this normal for most 16 year olds?",21Jul2020,1
451,"On friday the UK will implement a rule that all people must wear a face mask/ covering when entering any shop (unless they have a medical reason not to do so.) Me and my sisters were discussing the rule and talking about where to get masks when my stepmum overheard and quite proudly told us ""well I'm going to refuse to wear one!"" 

We were all a little baffled and asked her why and she simply said ""I don't want to, and they can't make me."" We tried to explain the health risks and she said she would be safe due to 'herd immunity.' We told her that she could be a symptomless Covid carrier and not wearing a mask could mean that she spreads the virus onto somebody else, but she still didn't want to wear one. My stepmum does all of the shopping for my elderly grandparents and our entire family of 10 people who currently live in the house. Now all I can imagine is that come Friday she will be having an argument with Sainsburys staff outside the supermarket, making their jobs more difficult, and possibly endangering people in the process. 

How can I make her see reason? Even if she doesnt believe that she is endangering anybody, wearing a mask will still be a legally enforceable rule and she has no medical reason not to wear one. Wearing a mask will not affect her in the slightest, and yet she is adamant that she won't do it! 

Yes, she is also an anti-vaxxer and against many modern medications. My mum is like this too, and my dad, but they haven't mentioned the mask situation yet.

Any advice would be appreciated as I feel like this could become a big problem. Thank you!",21Jul2020,1
453,"So my dad has this 2009 honda odyssey ex-l with dvd and nav. He bought this car about 3-4 years ago and it was a steal at $8,000. The car had 18k miles and the seller just had it sitting, collecting dust. This was my dad's first good car in about 20 years and he bought it for me and my siblings when he wanted to hang out with us. I asked him recently to sell it to me and it now has 54k on the odometer. I told him I'd give him 7k or so and he said he wants less since I'm his son. I feel really bad though because I feel he won't have a good car anymore although he said it's fine. Some background; my dad was a drug addict growing  up and could never save for a decent car. My siblings are 21 and 20 now and only the 15 yr old really hangs with him on a weekly basis unless we have some time and tag along.

There is a jetta gli 2019 (new) that I'm interested in since it's a really good deal and would be a new car with a warranty and new features. I really want this car, but I feel it is a bit irresponsible to finance about 22k knowing I have a 5k or so option waiting if I accept my father's offer. 

What should I do? I never had a nice car and I just paid all of my debts in full so my credit score looks nice now. Also, because of my dad's lifestyle growing up, I'm always left wanting nice things I couldn't have growing up. What should I do. I only have 1 child and don't plan on having more soon.

So now he seems fine and was talking about turning his life around and I saw something different in him so I wanted to help I referred him to my job and they gave him the interview yesterday.

463,"So I met this guy while doing a task in front of my store. I have to do this task everyday in front of my store or someone I’m working with. When the other person is off I have no choice but to go up there. The front of the store I’m always being harassed or stopped by customers. I’m always behind harassed, sexually harassed or whatever in the store but mostly in the front. 

There was this guy (age 19 at the time) riding a bike and he slows down and tells me how pretty I( age 21 at  the time, currently 22) am. I say thank you and he asks for my number which I give most of the guys. He also stated I was going to be his girlfriend and that he has a car but he was just using his bike today. He leaves and I continue working. He texts me for a few minutes and he tells me how I ”should be focusing on school and give him lots of attention.” It threw me off and made me lose interest, so I stopped texting him. Later that day while I’m at home, he calls me three times and texts me “you can’t answer my phone!?!?!?” I ignored him. Day later he calls again but I text him “what?” But he never said anything but attempted calling me again. 

A week later I’m in the front again and he sees me and comes up to me aggressively like why didn’t I text him back (which I did).  He begs and asks if we could hang out later and makes me promise. Just talking loud like he knows me and everyone watching me. As he’s leaving he tells me to text him right now while I’m working. Still I didn’t text him and I just continue on with my day.  One of the guys I work with,  saw how he was talking to me and approaches me. He asked me did I know the guy and I’m like no I didn’t know him. So my coworker told me if he comes by again he’ll say something to him. That coworker got moved to another department two weeks later. 

About 4 weeks after seeing him, the same coworker of mine told me he saw him and referred to him as “your guy.” He told me he was staring him down. Not only that but he told me the guy was looking all inside the stores and staring all the other guys who I work with down too.

Two weeks after that which was yesterday, I was inside near the front of the store but inside a gate. A customer stops me and as I’m talking to the customer, I hear someone yell out “fuck you bitch” multiple times. I’m looking over the gate to see who was that and the customer was too. The voice sounds familiar and I see someone riding a bike.

Recently since it's my own personal account have posted some questionable comments and comments that can attract some attention I made all my videos private and made a new gmail account for the pure purpose to post videos for entertainment purposes for my friends (and if other people see it hopefully entertaining for them to) and I recently recorded a 30 minute clip of GTA V about griefers just giving up. I was wondering what I can do to cut the clip length down and get rid of parts that aren't that useful as well to have words to explain what happened and to zoom in and perhaps circle or have an arrow pointing at something. If you can help me I will highly appreciate it but if you did take time to read this thank you",21Jul2020,1

474,"Hey Reddit.

I’ve never really been an energetic person. I move slowly and mumble a lot. Sometimes I’ll even sleep for 17 hours.

This, of course, made it very surprising for me to figure out that I had ADHD. I never really noticed any difference in my lifestyle compared to other people except for reading. I got sidetracked a lot and lost my place. If anything, I guess I was a lot less energetic and generally a lot more attentive and focused.

The problem, however, comes around when I try to fall asleep. At first I thought it was blue light or something, so I stopped using any electronics hours before I slept, but I would just lay there with the irresistible urge to move. I’m always readjusting myself to be more comfortable but it feels like I’m never in the right position.

It’s killing me to not be able to fall asleep. I’ve seen a few doctors about this problem and they’ve prescribed some medication to supposedly help me fall asleep but it doesn’t seem to work at all. Most nights I get into bed at 12 but end up sleeping around 2 or 3 am. 

Does anyone have any tips or tricks they use to ease into sleeping? I’d love to hear them.

475,"TL;DR I'm a bit of a sad chap (american though), but listening to christmas music gave me the vision of having a gf, and buying her a christmas gift, and kissing her in a beautiful scenic christmas setting.


I was feeling sad so I listened to Christmas music, and it actually totally cheered me up, but gave me the vision of having a GF this Christman, and buying her a gift and her liking it and kissing me by the Christmas Tree, it's either Christmas Day or Christmas Eve, but it is for sure night time, and the lights on the tree is absolutely beautiful. There is snow on the ground that you can see out the back window. It at her families house, because the house is much nicer than my family's house, but her folks aren't around because it wouldn't be like me to show affection around other people, especially my gf's father. I need to know if I should chase this feeling, and how I would go about doing so.




A bit about me:. I'm a sad 'sticky keyboard, pillow without pillowcase' type of guy. I'm 22, unemployed 'living at home', and have never done as much as hold hands with a girl. 


My personality isn't bad at all, I'm fairly fun(ny), and I'm quiet nice and respectful, and I have a 142+ IQ but don't act like it. I am more anxious than any woman would want in a lover though. I asire to be a writer/director, which is probably why I have such a vivid image in my mind. People around me suspect I might be slightly on the autism spectrum, and possibly have adhd and/or ocd. I secretly suspect I may have bipolar, or at least anger problems  that comes from my irish blood.


Looks wise I'm anywhere from a high 3 to high 6. I'm 6ft1 180lbs, and have been getting in better shape since quarantine started. My 'thing' is 6.5 long and 4.4 circumfrance, but the scarring from my 'late term' circumcision is jarring at first.



So, I know I'll need to get a job (which is hard with covid right now) to afford the gift, and also probably to get to a point of being dateable. I'm gonna continue working out, and I will have to work on being less anxious. There's not much I can do about having a small 'thing', but that's life. I'm probably gonna have to find a girl with low standards who hasn't realized her potential yet. I don't have any particular woman in mind, but I did run across a pretty lady while scrolling instagram today, who happened to be the woman in this image in my head.

On the 1st of september 2020 germany will change it's gun laws which will prohibit many parts of fully automatic rifles, which would be legal to own in Estonia if I had the collectors license but I have to wait 3 years to get it, but right since the parts will become illegal in germany they are being sold at incredibly low prices, which you can't find anywhere else, as I understand these parts are legal and can be owned without a license in Austria and the laws won't change there, so what I was thinking is could it somehow be possible to buy the parts without going to germany and getting them transported to Austria and stored somewhere in austria until I get my licenses and can transport them to Estonia, the reason for the whole thing is that right now I could get these parts for around 1000€ which everywhere else would be around 20000€, so after 1st september I can't buy them for such prices and have to buy for the full price which is a lot.

478,"Ok this might get complicated so please bear with me. 

My Uncle will be marrying his new partner next month. We would be happy for him barring the fact that he buried his wife not a month ago and he didn’t come to the funeral citing Corona. Now this on it own sounds bad but his wife had early onset dementia and was not herself for the last 5-6 years, In which time he has being seeing his new partner. 

His new partner is nice and helped a lot with his wife. 
But what might cause the fallout is that the longer he has been with her the less he has been involved with his grandkids. He didn’t see his granddaughter for 6 months after she was born and rarely stays at family get togethers longer than a few hours. There is always some excuse as to why he can’t come or has to leave early. Now we have been nothing but supportive throughout this but my Dad (his brother) is angry at him for missing his wife’s funeral. He knows if he blows up at him it may well destroy their relationship forever. 

We have decided to pose my uncle a question about how he feels his relationship with his family is going? He doesn’t visit his family even when in the area but is hanging about with her family even more than before. We want to continue our relationship with him but that just seems impossible if he doesn’t make the effort and does contradictory things like not going to his wife’s funeral citing Covid but getting married in a far away place just a month later. 

How would we best approach his distancing without making him defensive?

She isn't shy around anyone else, and it is sort of annoying as I think that she is all right and wouldn't mind getting to know her, but the issue is that she is simply incapable of having a face-to-face conversation with me.

487,"May be a bit long and convoluted so I'll try to make it as simple as possible, Had a really rough go of things in high school, and had to take an unplanned gap year after graduating. I started college at 19 in the fall but realized I was in the entirely wrong place (that's a long story but it was v stressful)  and I applied to transfer. I came home to do CC to get the credits I needed and then corona hit.  I got accepted to my dream school where I'll be a freshman again (lost some credits and double major)... next fall (after just turning 21). With corona and all the uncertainty I decided to defer to not waste money and risk my health. 

I feel behind, immature and lost, I feel like college will be a really good experience for me, so I can actually grow as a person and finally have a life going on, but I feel embarrassed. I'll be starting the year most people enter their last year, and I've genuinely done nothing and experienced nothing. This is largely due to being disabled, I'm legally blind (though you wouldn't know) and  therefore can't drive, so I've spent many years of my life mostly stuck at home, as I live in the suburbs with no public transportation.

This may sound incrediby immature and stupid but I do want the four year experience, with a bit of partying and being stupid thrown in, that's not why I'm at school, but I want the opportunity to be involved on campus, and learn about myself, and enjoy life and my education before starting a career and entering the ""real world"" but I feel like I'll be ""too old"" for it by the time I start, people say it's creepy for a 21 year old to be hanging out with 18 year olds??? Aren't we all in the same age range? 

Life's been sucky for a lot of years, and quaratine isn't exactly helping, I want to have some fun, I want to join clubs and take interesting classes and get internships and go to parties, and make friends and be able to go places by myself (finally!). Though I feel so much pressure to try to speed through school and start a career ASAP because 18-20 was when you were ""suposed"" to have those experiences. This pressure isn't from my parents, we're good financially and I should have some scholarships, I know they just want me to be happy.  I feel ashamed that I'll graduate right before my 25th birthday, yet I feel like trying to rush the process would really hurt me mentally.  Still I feel like a dissapointing daughter. By the time I do have a career I'll know so much less tha everyone else who has had years of experience.

489,"My (18F) girlfriend (19F) and I moved out of our houses recently. We are renting a room in a house full of men for $700 a month and are struggling a little. We’re trying to move out to someplace a little cheaper with no roommates. She’s pan, I’m bi, our relationship is open, we can see men, no women it was agreed upon, no feelings involved. We have a pretty healthy relationship and it’s been working for us. 

Recently she had sex with an autistic guy. Raw, and he didn’t pull out in time :/ First of all, her period was irregular already, happening every five days or so. About a week after she had sex with him she realized she didn’t have her period and then realized that her birth control had not been in her pill box the past two weeks so we went to the store and bought some pregnancy tests. She took one and it came back negative, but we feel like it’s too soon. 

Yesterday, (a week and a half after having sex with him) she took another test and that one came back negative as well. We still feel like it’s too soon but she’s having pregnancy symptoms. 

I’ve always been CF (child free) and we already have two pets. We’re literally teenagers. I don’t know how to be a mom. I can’t afford to be a mom. She is pro-choice but said personally if she was pregnant she would not get an abortion. It isn’t my place to tell her what to do in that situation. 

I’m just so stressed all the time about this now. I don’t know how much longer we need to wait but she still hasn’t got her period and is back on birth control. I don’t know what to think or what to do. What’s my family going to think “my girlfriend is pregnant which means she fucked someone while we were dating” sounds trashy but I knew about it but people are going to pity me. We can’t say we got a sperm donor either because it wasn’t planned. I just feel so fucked.

490,"Crazy “mother in law”

Okay so a little backstory, I moved in with my gf and her family about a year ago after a pretty bad argument with my family. Things were going fine for the longest time but when the “mother in law” in this situation lost her job her stress skyrocketed. I always knew she wasn’t the biggest fan of me because of my family but she was willing to put that aside for her daughter. 

However now she’s quite literally lost her mind. She’s begun being very passive aggressive with things she does around the house that include me in anyway. Usually talking loud enough for me to hear her through the walls saying negative things about me but never to my face. Finally the other day she blew up and began hollering about how I don’t do anything(not true) am an asshole(am polite to her) and that at the end of the day I’m just some kid with nowhere to go. So I was like wtf of course and asked her what’s wrong. 

She began arguing with me about how I was talking shit and I kept asking her exactly what. She kept saying “oh you know” over and over but wouldn’t tell me what. So I eventually chalked it up to it being some sort of bipolar anger episode but she hasn’t let up. 

She then began going on about how no one loves her here and I said wtf your daughter(my girlfriend) does (this was said right in front of my girlfriend) and she said “yeah fucking right she loves you and that’s it.” I was so taken aback I didn’t know what to say other than that I didn’t know what’s going on and she needs to take a step back and breathe. The next day she gave me a very insincere apology and I said it’s fine. 

But today she goes off on me again because I hadn’t turned on the outside lights for my girlfriend to come home since she was working late. This shouldn’t have been an issue since my girlfriend wasn’t coming home for another hour and a half. She just wanted the light on for her and her son to smoke weed outside I think. 

I asked her what I could do to alleviate the tension between us and that’s when she finally admitted to actively disliking me, saying I think I’m better than everyone, and saying I’m my father. Luckily for me I deal with psych patients a lot and so most of these things bounced off me but it really pissed me off when she called me my father since she knows our relationship is broken with him for things he has done. 

So I said fine I don’t want us to fight and left her alone. Of course she couldn’t do that though so she continues hollering about me from her room and finally yells at me that rent has gone up and goes outside where she yells at her son to not talk to me anymore and that she wants me out ASAP. 

So I told my girlfriend we’re leaving by the end of the week, she can come if she wants but I can’t stay here. So now I have an option of living in a motel or crawling back to my family after being almost no contact for a year.

Low traffic so far (\~10 reacts no comments).  I was going to comment something like ""That's a good look!"", because I think it is.

My hesitation is that I know at least some girls aren't a fan of guys complimenting their appearance on fb (as well as I understand because lots of guys are just trying to low-key flirt, and because women tend to get judged/praised on their appearance too much). Plus since it's low traffic a random compliment might stand out more.  I've got no sexual intention, and tbh don't really plan on having any other interaction in the near future.  There's no issue for me if I don't comment, but I do like to spread good vibes when they come up, and I feel like 'whether to compliment fb female friend's appearance' is something that I'm unsure about fairly often.

Basically if it spreads good vibes, I wanna leave the comment.  But if the girl wouldn't want the compliment then I'll probably just leave a heart react and scroll on.

Staying at a shady hotel and two of the Wi-Fi accounts say ""Guest Room Cam"" and ""Bathroom Cam 2"". We paid already. 

When my girlfriend goes on the WI-FI she doesn't catch any of them on there. Mine has them both. After looking at them they usually vanish within a few seconds unless you start searching again. The owner has the hotel listed as the previous companys name,  and the whole building is under construction.  When you show up to the building you have to call and ask if you're even in the right place. The ""desk clerk"" is the owner. It looks like the people in the rooms live here because we went around front to look for another entrance and I saw a bunch of plants and a calendar in one of the rooms. I also got kind of bad vibes from the way the tenants and owner were looking at my gf.

We googled ways to find cameras and it says the usual, look at weirdly placed outlets, phone jacks, things that shouldn't be there, etc. It also said if the owner turns the lights on when you go to see the room that's a sign they are trying to obscure LED's. He did that. We turned the lights off and saw nothing.

Weird things include a bolted in mirror with a chord going behind it, and coming back out for seemingly no reason - they attach to two phone lines in the wall. The bathroom light is ajar and has the chords visible, and there is a phone jack askew (could just be older, the building sure is)

The place is under construction and weird as hell. There's just a paper over the sign covering the oldest company, of the last company.


Is it possible the owner of this place is that stupid? What could I do in this situation? Don't feel comfortable leaving my gf behind at the place.

508,"So almost 2 weeks ago was my 20th birthday. I was already feeling pretty down in the days leading up to it because this time of the year reminds me of someone I cared a lot for that I kinda lost last year, and my family was putting a lot of pressure on me to ""have a big special day"" because 20 is like a special age or whatever.

Anyways, the problem

is this: The previous day I went out with two of my friends to celebrate since my mother had taken the day off work so we could go eat out, so I figured I'd seen my actual birthday with them. On the day of my birthday I was just minding my own business walking around the house trying to waste time before we had to get ready. My mum was in her room as she had just woken up after doing a night shift and coming home to sleep.

I then hear she was talking on the phone with probably one of her sisters and she said something along the lines of how she thought I had no friends because I was spending my birthday inside instead of going out with friends and that the last time I had real friends was like 2 years ago. this kinda hurt me because I was specifically staying in so I could spend my birthday with them since she had taken the day off. It made me feel really shit, and since I hadn't't been in the last mood lately (as I said in the first paragraph) I decided to leave. Got dressed and made plans with some people and decided to go out, then come back right before we had to go to dinner, go out to dinner, and then go back out for some drinks with other people.

My mother was quite upset by this but she just told me ""its not that big of a deal"" and to come back for dinner.

Anyways came back like 10-5 minutes before we had to go out, just changed my dress and we headed out. At dinner I was still quite upset so I didn't speak much. The rest of our family called us and FaceTimed us so we spoke to them for a bit of the dinner.

After we were done and we got into the car, my dad went to pay for the parking ticket, and my mum just started going off at me how I was horrible to her for the whole day, how I ruined my birthday to her, how I was a piece of shit etc.

We went home and I was gonna stay for a bit to cut the cake she made for me and have the Prosecco and then go back out for the drinks I mentioned with my friends. She was so mad and slamming doors and didn't even reply to me when I invited her to the cake.

Essentially she hasn't spoken to me since. I've just been holed up in my room the whole time because I feel really bad about this and Idk what to do. Like she always woke me up in the working so I could drive her to work and then called me to pick up, but now she's just walking or taking the bus.

I feel like if the thing she did was ""too small"" for me to be upset about, then her reaction is over exaggerated as well. And I know I probably shouldn't have reacted the way I did, but I never thought she'd straight up stop speaking to me for 2 weeks?? Our relationship has always been rocky but never like this. I just don't know what to do/how to approach her because my mental health has seriously took a turn for the worst because of this. And neither of my parents seem to care as they'll just be in the living room watching movies laughing etc, but whenever I enter the room she ignores me.

I guess I'm just asking for advice. If anyone has any, I'd appreciate it, thanks.",21Jul2020,1

510,"I (22f) was going to come on here and ask for advice about my current situation but realistically I just need to start therapy. 

Almost a year ago I left a physically and sexually abusive relationship and met someone who I now feel I’m too reliant on to provide support and comfort when I’m upset or distressed. He’s been too good to me during all this that I feel I panic if I’m upset and he’s not around which clearly isn’t healthy. 

I also experienced a case of sexual harassment in work where I was kissed by a much older male colleague while we were meant to be social distancing and this definitely triggered stuff from my past and I feel like I just can’t get myself back to normal now. Everything has just come back up and feels raw again for about 2 months now. 

I’ve been offered free therapy from my employer but I’m reluctant to start because it’s all on video call and I feel a bit embarrassed as it is I can’t imagine myself crying to someone over a computer screen while my family is in the next room but at the same time I feel as though I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown because I just can’t do it on my own anymore.",21Jul2020,1

513," So 3 weeks ago i started a new job and there's this super sweet and good looking girl which i felt instantly attracted to the moment i saw her. I'm the kinda guy who's not that outgoing with new people (i'm introvert), but i had a few girlfriends and relation ships (longest one 3 years, recently) so i have some sort of experience with girls. The thing is this girl first approached me and introduced herself and whenever she sees me she'd smile and ask me how i am, have open body language, also constantly kept asking questions when she was around me, for example what i'm studying, like to do etc (i'm 23y. old, she's 20). So i send her a friend request and decided to text her, the first time it went pretty well, we texted quite a lot. Then i texted her like 4 days later: ""Text me later if u feel like it"" keep in mind we saw each other during that time at work and had some chat, but since that text she hasn't responded to me. I was quite confused and didn't know what to do if i should text her more or no, but i just decided to not text at all anything else since she hasn't responded the last time i did. So i started ignoring her a bit at work only saying hi, but she still tries to talk to me everytime she sees me and the last day even asked me if i'm upset at her, because i didn't talk to her and i said nah it's all good. I don't really know what to do, should i wait her to text me or text her something? I'd talk directly to her at work about that but most of the time we're with other people so it's pretty hard to have more personal conversation.",21Jul2020,1

521,"Hi there. 

My partner works alongside her boss in an office in the UK situated in a city with a large portion of Chinese descended populous. Her boss owns this small business that has some interaction with shop customers.

After a customer of Asian descent left the shop her boss launched into a tirade about how dirty Asians are, in relation to COVID-19, and how they all eat ""weird shit"" (possibly referring to bats?).  

The customer was returning some items she had bought, and had doused the items in disinfectant spray. This resulted in my partner's boss saying ""it's ironic seeing as she's a chink"".

Now I know he is entitled to his own opinions, and freedom of speech etc etc... But these rants (in a very small office with just my partner present) are really upsetting her.

My partner doesn't feel comfortable calling him out on this behaviour as he is her boss, but also feels torn standing by and doing nothing.

536,"Hi redditors.

This is going to be a bit of a weird one, so allow me the time to explain properly.

Most people will find this situation silly and say I'm mostly overreacting. So a few days ago, my boyfriend spent his tome playing League of Legends, a game we usually play together, with him always being a mid laner and myself being the jungler. Jungle is the role I have settled on after months of basically being in a role identity crisis, where I had really been struggling to find a role I really enjoyed playing. But whilst playing on his own my bf ended up playing jungle and continues to do so.

No this bothers me slightly as he knows I don't do well in the other roles, but I'm not going to be the ine who dictates what he gets to play. If he enjoys jungle then he can play it, it just makes playing together more difficult. 

Well, when I brought up that it makes things difficult he reassured me that jungle ia my role and he's not taking it, he only played it as he got autofilled. And this is where my problem sits because him saying he only played it due to being autofilled is a lie. In league, autofill is a thing that happens where the game will at times place you in a role different to what you queued up for as at times there aren't enough players queuing for the various roles for everyone to play their preference. If you get autofilled, you get an autofill safety that prevents you from getting autofilled, tou will definitely have your preferred role in your next match. The reason I know him saying it's just because of autofill is a lie is because he played 10 games in a row as jungle. 

I'm very torn by the fact that he lied to me as an attempt to save my feelings. I basically dropped the conversation as I didn't want to call out the lying and escalate the situation to an argument ocer a game.

It just feels like he didn't take my feelings into consideration at all and lied to save face, thinking that I wouldn't catch on.

I have kept talking to him, but I'm actively avoiding prolonged conversations and spending time together as at the moment it genuinely upsets me and I'm still trying to process my emotions.

What can I do to deal with what happened?",21Jul2020,1

538,"So I'm doing my BDS (Bachelor in Dental Surgery) 
And I have 3 best friends since school, one of them is been my best friend all my life, starting from 3rd grade. So I know she's not going to advice me wrong and she knows me and shit. And in school, they would like tease me, joke around and all and that was fun cause I liked the attention. But, after school, everybody had their separate groups of friends.
Back story: I took a year break after school, to figure out my shit. 
So that 1 year, was also chill, like I would spend all the time by myself and everything, I had recently broken up from a 4year long toxic relationship too, so that year was chill with my friends too.
Then they started going about their goals, like started working this soon n'all. Which is amazing, I'm so proud of them and everything. 
But, my course requires alot of studying time by myself, which I do and hence I have only 1 set of friends, and that's them. 
When I started 1st year, I fell for a guy on new year's party, and slowly I made my way in his group of friends too which are really friendly and sweet and fun to hang out with. 
His friend's group is the same as my oldest best friends' another set of friends. 
Now, due to personal reasons, everybody hates her from that group of friends and stopped talking to her. 
But on the other hand, I'm getting little friendly to that same set of friends, right.
For some reason, they make me feel like I'm worthless I don't do anything productive (like attending meetings, working on a project, earning some amount) which they do.
Now like I know my course doesn't require such things but just study and gain knowledge about the subject but I still feel like I'm less productive cause I'm still financially dependent on my parents for even small things as small as snacks or buying something for myself. I have to ask my mom for money.
So I distance myself, you know like, I always made to feel that I'm not doing productive and amazing things in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

let me clear the picture, i know this person online and never meat irl, i like to play video games with other friends and draw and do things i enjoy. i know Chris for almost 4 years now but i just started noticing red flags i was ignoring way too much.

&amp;#x200B;

i told him things i never told anyone and he even told me stuff he never told anyone about, and we talk everyday almost.

&amp;#x200B;

i have about 3 different friend groups online on discord and i like playing with them often but Chris doesnt want to make any friends in these groups.. or any friends at all, i tried talking to him and asking him about it and he just says no i dont want to. and every time i play with anyone else or talk with anyone else he act like i did something horrible, like dude i have a life i cant stay with u like a babysitter. maybe im the only person who opened up to him and accepted him no matter what and always supported him but i mean i want to do things and live my life not spend every second online and offline talking with u. i feel bad for him but i cant take it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

now we come to victimizing himself over anything, for example if i get upset with something he did or said he immediately pulls himself like he is the victim and goes to his Instagram stories and writes stuff like im lonely i want to die..etc and i know he writes those things so i read them and for me to feel like the bad guy. then the next day Chris sends me messages saying whats wrong are you okay? like wtf just apologize dude thats all im asking! this happens all the time and last week i spend it all with him and no one else, played with him and talked to him but apparently that's not enough he wants me to always stay with him.. sometimes i feel like he is too clingy and wants to isolate me from anyone else and its too much for me to handle.

&amp;#x200B;

everything he does is what i do, i draw he draws, i play a new game he plays that game and that continued all the years I've known him.

&amp;#x200B;

one of the things i told him is that im gay and where i live that is forbidden, he told me he is gay too. with that said a two of days ago i told him im tired of holding the straight mask i wish i was straight, and you know what he told me? you are not really gay... and started talking about how im not gay and i can be straight if i wanted to. of all people i didnt expect this from him i thought he would understand and know how it feels... so i just didnt talk to him for two days now and he still sends me messages on discord and instagram ""is everything ok?"" and went to instagram and did the ""im alone i want to die"" thing.. ffs just apologize dont act like the victim.

&amp;#x200B;

i have a secret account on instagram just to be true to myself without my family or the people around me knowing. he is the only one who knows about, and guess what? when i told him about the account he made a secret account and started posting the same shit i post... that didnt bother me at all, he followed me with his original account and his secret account. after we last talked i went to instagram settings and hid my instagram stories from him as a start.. u know what i found out today? he was following me with a fucking third account! he replied to my stories ""not one story, all of them"" he didnt say its him, he acted like he liked the content but i fucking know his profile picture choices and his way of speaking.

&amp;#x200B;

i really dont know what to do... he is not a bad person but the way he acts is really pushing me off atm.

sorry for the long text but i really need help

543,"I made a new account just for anonymity, in no way am I telling lie for upvotes, I couldn't care less bout them when I'm going through his shit. My life depends on this, and the response I get so pls help me fellow redditors.

So, I'm a fifteen yrs old immigrant living in France for about 2 yrs. I live here with my parents, my father has a refugee case and my mother is an immigrant. Sry for my English if I do make mistakes here and there.

We're three brothers, S is older than me ""20 yrs"", y is me ""16"" and z is the smallest one ""3 yrs"". It's been three months or so since my mother filed a case against my father and apparently me too for violence against us. It all happened when he was drunk, it was not his fault but the alcohol's. He was a pain in the ass for a long time to my mother and we supported her from the moment we came to France, our father too. 

After having cased a report file for my father, she regretted it and put all of the blame on us. She started saying we're to blame for what happened to our father, his whole life is destroyed because of us. She never stopped blaming us for the whole time until now. 
Let's leave all this and jump to the recent trauma of my life.

 Yesterday we changed our network because the older one didn't work fine, and we didn't add the TV Box for channels. After having installed it, she came home at around dusk. And started ranting nonsense shit, she called us robbers for using her money ""which is not true at all"", she started blaming us again for what had happened. She said we manipulated her into filing the report against our father which she accorded to do with her own will when the interrogator asked her. It happened for an hour, and my brother was studying so I had to calm her down all the time but then she proceeded to turn off the wifi, which triggered my brother and he came to the hall and shouted: "" DON'T YOU SEE I'M STUDYING, WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING FOR A TV BOX, ALL YOU DO IS WATCH YOUTUBE, THESE PAST 2 YRS I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU WATCH A FRENCH CHANNEL"".  

And then that triggered her too, and she starting spewing bullshit like ""your brother will need them "" which he definitely doesn't, cause all he does is watch YouTube on her ""My mom"" phone even when she puts sth on the tv"". We let her be like that and went to our room ""my brother and I share the same room"". After a while, my brother went to the hall to reconnect the WIFI, and she started pushing him and slapping him, punching him and kicking him. Whereas my brother didn't do shit to her, he didn't even respond with a slap. He let her beat him.  But I couldn't just watch it like that, so I went and garb her on her torso "" chest area"" to pull her back but it slipped all the way through the neck cause she has kind of big chest. And without knowing I pulled her back when my hand was on her neck, and I know I wasn't even using much force. And then my trauma started kicking in, she threw everything she had onto me, there was a glass of water right beside her which she took and threw, it hit directly on my backbone ""which still hurts a lotttt"" that's around the neck as is was looking at the opposite direction, still, I didn't do her anything. 

We again went back to our room and my panic attack which had started 2 hours earlier still hadn't stopped so I tried to sleep ""it was 9-10 pm already"". And after 10 or so minutes, she  barges into our room and starts slapping and kicking me, and apparently, she made a mark on my face with her nails. We didn't make any videos which will have a great negative impact on us, I will elaborate on this later on. And then we pushed her all the way through the hall came back to our room and locked the door. I went on Reddit for a while so that this panic attack would stop but it didn't. And so I was awake all night, finally, the panic attack stopped after 4-5 hrs, it was a lot painful, I'm still having them.

 Fast forward to now, she left our small brother and went to the doctor in the morning, and when she came back she said that the doctor told her to file a police report against us, I definitely think she didn't tell the whole story, she only said things that would make her look the victim,  but in this case, i and my brother am according to me. She started telling me that she would destroy my whole future, I've worked my ass off and am admitted to an international high school which I applied by myself and did all the process with the help of one of my professors. The reason behind the morning panic attack is that I don't want to picture my future being destroyed because of her. She has no right to destroy what I've spent my whole two years building. And she added at last that the doctor told her that it's normal for the parents to beat their parent's "" IN FRANCE"" but the same act from a child is not tolerated. AFAIK, neither the parents nor the child has the right to touch the other. 

I've been on stress meds for the past couple of months, and none of my family members know this except one of my professors that has supported me for the high school and everything. As I write this, I am having panic attacks, this just won't stop. I might have missed out on many things cause I'm crying while writing this, all this time I thought my father was the devil but it turned out to be my mother and I regret more than anything for not supporting my father as much as I supported my mother. 

My father is restricted from seeing us and my mother will be too if she files the case, idk what to do. I would take all and any advice I can. I just can't process all that's happening. I envy people who have supporting parents, any whole childhood was filled with bad memories and i don't think it will stop anytime soon.

TL;DR, my mother is trying ""not yet"" to report us with false statements"" because she knows that France values Women more than Men, and she believes that the interrogator will believe what she told just because she's a woman and will try to act the victim"" and she's more than ready to destroy my and my brother's future.",21Jul2020,0
544,"I (31f) have a good guy friend (25m) that he and I are strictly so. He’s recently engaged and I’ve met this girl  only a couple times. She lives about an hour away so they don’t live together yet. I need advice on if I should tell this girl I’ve met only a couple of times that her fiancé cheated on her and is constantly flirting with other girls? My good girl friend and I were at his place and us three have known each other for several years and these two have slept together a couple times before while he was either “on” or “off” with his then girlfriend now fiancé. But when these two slept together after he was only engaged for a month maybe, that really irritated me and made me think so low of them both. And now I’m seeing posts from his fiancé saying what a great guy he is, he’s her rock blah blah. He said he’s done with all the cheating but I feel terrible knowing. Should I betray my good friend and tell his fiancé, who I don’t know that well about him? If I do, he’ll absolutely know it was me.

Or, should I just cut them out? They both know I’m pissed at them for this and really disappointed as it hits a sore spot. They both have been really good friends to me personally so I don’t want to be too drastic but also, I hate knowing this secret. All serious options are welcome.",21Jul2020,1
546,"So idk. Let's start.

At work I met 3 pretty girls that i need to work with. All fine, they are pretty so i'm stressed to talk to them, nothing new. That day i didnt dare to talk to them. Next day i'm more scared because i realised i find one of them really pretty, maybe i have a crush, idk, never had that feeling before.

For some reason that day I dared to start a conversation and it was a good conversation throughout the day. But after the day i still find her really pretty and atractive but the feeling I first had is gone. 

IDK this is so got damn new for me and I hate it. I don't know what to think/what to do.

Maybe it's just because she is close to 20yo and I never actually had talked/met a girl thats grown up. Im almost 17M.

I just felt of saying this but didnt want to tell people close to me. Random strangers on the internet is simpler. If you have something to say, that maybe hekps me, go ahaed.",21Jul2020,1
547,"Hi, I posted on here a while back about my relationship with my best friend and how I would like to become a better person and work towards a healthy relationship. I’ve been doing quite well, I’ve started reading self-help books and articles and have been trying to get counselling. But sometimes I slip up and I’m trying to figure out how to put myself together when I do or feel myself starting to get that way. 
(first post is https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hjnive/i_think_my_past_trauma_from_abuse_has_made_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf )

In a short summary, I am in love with my best friend, a year ago she told me she had once had feelings for our other best friend, I was jealous, and on top of a bunch of other things and past trauma and baggage that I never dealt with I made our relationship very unhealthy. We had a long talk about it and we both agreed we want to try it again this time. She is the person that I love the most in my life and am closest to, so this really means a lot to me. I want to be able to make her happy and work on myself so we can be healthy together. Since we’ve talked, our relationship has been quite good, fun, it makes me happy and I can’t believe we’re actually good friends again. I never realized how bad it was before.

But, every time she and our other friend hangout together I feel a pang of jealousy. I know that this is because previously when they hung out it used to make me panic, because I felt that she liked our friend more than me. But I know now that this is not the case. I try to calm myself down by reminding myself that our relationship is good now, I have no reason to panic and we are still friends. A lot of the time it works, but I find it circling through my head quite a bit some days. I never get like that when she hangs out with anyone else, just our friend.

I know that rationally thinking: ''Who cares if they stare once in a blue moon because out of curiosity of what im doing, plus they have other things that occupy them and their familys''

I keep telling myself that to try and bring confidence in myself, but 10 minutes later of being outside I feel SUPER uncomfortable for no good reason and immediately shelter back home outside of anyones view, I know this thinking is harmful but I dont know where it stems from, what type of mental issues I have and how to combat it...

561,"First post! I really need some advice with this so I'm actually making a post about it lol. SOrry for my english and stuff. 

So basically i had a lesson today (it was an optional lesson so there were total of 16 of us including me and lecturers) 

Due to the pandemic we had to do a check in and a check out thing. So the lecturer asks 'are you going to stay in school? And for what?' he asks everyone until its my turn. I froze cause i didnt know how to tell that i needed to take a dump (it sounded pretty embarrassing to tell in front of everyone that i needed to go and take one.) after a few seconds the lecturer stares at me and gives me a 'why are you not answering look' my brain finally comes back on and i said 'im gonna go to the toliet after school' 

lecturer says 'is it a big one?' 

immediately, without thinking, i instinctively said 'no' 

he asks 'how long are you gonna take, 5 mins?'

I said 'depends' , while laughing awkwardly

the lecturer moves on to ask others. Afterwards my friends ask me 'dude what the hell was that?' At that moment i still didnt know what was going on, but ik i did something embarrassing. so i just told one of my friend's (the other friend walked away to get something) 'i aint gonna tell everyone i need to take a dump. its embarrassing.' 

after class ends i go to the toliet and i find out how i messed up. By covering the fact that i was taking a dump, it made it sound like i was gonna do something else more wrong in the toliet. 

I now am not sure what to do or whats gonna happen next week when Im back in school again. Maybe the 12 students told their friends in this same class. Maybe they are gonna look and treat me different like im really weird and i did something really wrong, when I did not. At most my friends know the true story and just think im being weird. I worry on how im gonna do work with my classmates (most of the time we are paired up not by choice but randomly.) I really feel like disappearing from the face of the earth. Idk how im gonna even move on from this, its like a few days later ill forget about it and when next week comes ill remember everything again. 

P.S i really need some advice on what to do now and when next week comes and i need to face the classmates again. Thank You 

TL:DR I sounded like i was contradicting myself and being weird to all my classmates and lecturers and made it sound like i was doing something else in the toliet instead of what i really wanted to do.",21Jul2020,1

The last few months, however, she's taken a sudden turn of flirting with me rather forwardly and in some cases aggressively, sometimes to the point of her trying to press herself against me and once trying to follow me into my house. After the first few incidents I made it a point to tell her I wasn't interested in her due to, amoung other things, her being a minor and the large age gap between us. When that didn't work I told her uncle (which I've done several times now) but sadly he isn't the most involved caretaker and doesn't seem to think it's a real issue for me. I do lawn and yard work around the neighborhood for extra money so while I've tried my best to avoid contact with her, it's basically impossible while I'm outside.

I'm not sure what happened in her personal life to bring about this sudden change in her personality and I'm not sure what else I can do to ease her off of me. Hoping there's some obvious answer I'm not seeing here.

I'm a 19yo male living in turkey. I'm playing in a Minecraft community and we have a 13yo Kazakh female friend we all love. But this week she was depressed. She's usually cheerful and happy all the time but she wasn't this week. Today about 1 hour before I'm writing this I asked her what's wrong and we talked until now. I've talked with other people from the community about what we can do for her and as we're all young (16-20) we don't know what to do and I thought of reddit as people here helped me before.

Ok basically she's afraid of a lot of stuff and she was followed by several men a few days ago and she's afraid she was gonna be raped. I tried to convince her see a therapist and apparently she already saw multiple and all of them told her it's puberty things and she's making them all up. The convo kept going as I just try to calm her and convince maybe she can talk to her mother and then I learned the truth. My English is not enough to explain but she's not loved by her mother. She doesn't have a father I believe. Basically she thinks she's not her mother's child. She locks herself on her room and bathroom to stay away from her. Her mother keeps telling her she's ""nothing"" ""useless"" and such. I don't know what to do but I know she's telling the truth. I don't want to leak her DMs to everyone but if there's actually someone that can help her please DM me here and maybe we can find a way to help her. All we could thought that we could contact UNICEF represents in Kazakh but then we felt like her mother will say it's not true she loves her etc and when they leave she'll think she called them and be even worse.

584,"I know I am not the only one that is experiencing hardship during this Pandemic, but I am struggling to find a way forward for myself and my family. I live in San Diego CA, and for the most part, things here are still shut down and it does not seem like they will change any time soon. I graduated with a Math degree in December last year before the pandemic started to affect things too badly. I was let go from work in February due to a decline in business due to the pandemic and have been on unemployment since. I had been applying everywhere I could and finally recieved a great job offer in april before the first shut down happened. I also moved into a new place and am now renting a home for myself my wife and two kids. The rent and utilities is about double what I had been paying but would be within budget with my new job. However since the first shut down, my job has not allowed me to begin my first day of work nor is there an option for remote work as their office has been shut down as well. They do not know when I will start nor if I will even have a job to return to.

I have been applying to hundreds of jobs over the last few months but have not gotten anything back. I have tried to get a job at local businesses here that are still open (walmart, target, walgreens, ect) but they either tell me that I am overqualified or that they are struggling to even give hours to the workers they have. I do not want to be on unemployment, I want to work but there is nothing out there for me especially with my lack of experience for higher paying jobs.

My wife works as a teacher's aid and just finished her credential the same time I finished my degree but with school being the disaster it is, we are unsure she can get a job as an actual teacher this coming year. Even if we both get other jobs (or more than one) I have no idea what we will do for childcare as most are shut down or have reduced hours not to mention their price would be close to entire paycheck from working a minimum wage job.

So now I’m having to think past that, into something new and looking for any advice into career fields that sound related. I wanna do something involved hands on, thrilling, fast paced, maybe even ‘dangerous’ you could say. Not that I’m an adrenaline junkie by any means lol. What do you guys think? Not that I don’t already have a few things in mind, but just curious what reddit has to say. Any advice much appreciated. Thanks!!",21Jul2020,3

Theres this book I like, American Kingpin. I read the first half of it, but was forced to return it to the library after the library forced me to give it back. Some time during this summer, I'm planning buying the book somewhere and read it fully.

For those of you who don't know, Ross Ulbricht was the guy who basically created and ran the Silk Road black market. I'm not going to get into ethics and stuff like that, but no one can deny that Ulbricht was a really smart guy for being able to do something like that.

However, reading his biography, I've never encountered any instance of someone or a group of people being mean to him during his school years (middle school, high school, college, etc). In my life, I can remember specific instances where people were mean to me.

So my question is, do some people have experiences where people are mean to them and others don't? Or does everyone have these types of experiences? Did Ulbricht ever have these types of experiences growing up? Or was he lucky enough never to encounter such?",21Jul2020,0

-In terms of choirs she just the ones she likes to do and the other ones she commits to she won't do. As an example the only thing she had to do was vacuum on the weekend and she said she would do it Monday but didn't.

599,"  I've been (20 F) friends with some other 3 girls same age as me for 4 years. The friendship started when I was betrayed by a previous group of friends and then they took me in. At first they were really nice to me and very understanding and I appreciated them. However, for the past year, I've noticed some concerning patterns. 


  Last year we had to part ways because of our universities being far away. So all of them went to their universities and I stayed back to our hometown, to study again for the national exam that ensures your admission to a university. Before that, we had a whole summer to enjoy ourselves and have fun. But I discovered that they had made a separate and very active group chat without me which devastated me because I thought I had finally found some understanding friends. I had to pretend to be happy around them, when deep inside I felt so betrayed and outwardly, they continued being very nice to me. Also, sometimes they would slip up and mention the name of the groupchat but I just played dumb and ignored it. 


  Then schools and universities started. I used this opportunity to kind of distance myself from them by pretending to be very busy studying. They would come to our hometown during holidays and they would ask me to go out with them. I went. Because I was stuck at home all day, I was mentally and physically exhausted while they were thriving because of a flourishing university life. I catered to them a bit more and was the friend they always knew but was just a bit tired to their eyes. I would tell them that once I finished with exams I would be more free and more participating in our groupchats (forgot to mention that there is a groupchat of all the girls and a few boys who are also our friends and also a girls' groupchat with me including the one without me). I finished with exams a month ago. I was so tired and exhausted and I also failed my exams. The girls started inviting me to go out again. I was like, okay, I'll satisfy their needs this summer and after i go to uni I'll never bother with them ever again. Sometimes I would go out with them sometimes I would refuse pretending to be busy. But here come the patterns that I noticed when I went out with them:
 
-When we went out during holidays they were the ones dressed nicely, while I was dressed shabbily and had a horribly pale complexion and they would condescendingly comment how tired I look. Now, I've started regaining my health and dressing more nicely when I go out, they make comments like ""oh why didn't you tell me you would wear a dress, I would have dressed up to match as well."" while never complimenting me, while our guy friends would always say something nice to me and they would just stare awkwardly.

-One of them has a boyfriend now and she wanted to introduce him to us. However, they went to the beach, the girl brought one of our girl friends (the other was busy, I was totally free) and her boyfriend brought one of his friends, but I was never invited. I have to mention that by societal standards, I'm considered more attractive than my girl friends, but apparently this was never an issue because I only wore baggy clothes. This only changed when I started taking more care of my appearance.

-They are never active at the girls' gc with me and gc with the boys as well. Whenever I say something in any of those gc, they completely ignore me.

-Because I kind of have similiar interests with the guys of the group, I can get their jokes very fast unlike my girl friends. But one of the guys pointed that out and made the whole situation even more awkward by comparing us.

-They became acquaintances with my previous friends who emotionally abused me, because they are at the same uni.

-One of the girls made fun of me for having a profile picture related to my interests that no one knows about instead of having, for example, a picture of myself.

-The same girl made an inappropriate joke in front of our group of friends. Specifically, I was wearing a dress and it was getting kind of windy so I was trying to keep the dress down with my hands, so she asked jokingly if was holding the dress down so that my hairy lady parts would not show. Yep, that's exactly what she said in front of everyone. But because I'm non-confrontational I just took it as a light-hearted joke and denied her ""accusation"" jokingly.


I want to stop being friends with them. And I have two options:

1) Endure it a bit this summer, and when I start uni life, never speak to them again and pretend to be busy

2) Confront them about everything without knowing the consequences.

Also, very important fact that I need to mention, last summer I had a relationship with a guy and it ended after a few months. However our hometown is very conservative and I'm afraid the girls will spread this information about me and this could ruin my reputation and relationship with my parents. I also know bits of info that they would not like me spreading about them, however that is something that does not go well with me and I'd rather not resort to that. 

What option should I choose, without risking anything and without them telling on me?",21Jul2020,1

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g139s4/aita_for_not_wanting_extended_family_in_my_life/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

So I (24F) made a post on my Grandad's FB with a picture of mygrandparents having dinner with my sisters, mum and I, on an important anniversary. I mentioned how important it was for us as a family and my mum was nervous it would cause a fight because we didn't mention my uncle, aunt or cousin (all who are unstable and horrible people). My defence was that they could and probably would write a post excluding us if they bothered to see our grandparents to celebrate the anniversary. 
But my mum was right (like usual lol) and my aunt has obviously flipped out because my cousin (28 M) has said some worrying comments on FB about us.
My aunt made a post about deleting ""Fakebook"" and he commented 
""I wish i could take away the pain your ungrateful siblings have left you with mentally and emotionally! You don't have to worry anymore about them playing mind games on social like the immature unstable scum they are! The fight is mine""
Then explained to a friend
""It is sad but hey they want to use my Grandads social media to post about events like we aren't part of the same family. All the immature mind games they've reaped on my mum is enough. If they were blokes they'd be getting knocked out tbh""
(He's told us not to refer to him as family in the past so I'm confused by him being upset that we didn't mention him in a family post)
I'm scared because he has an EXTREMELY low view on women and has actually been arrested for punching one (let off because she didn't attend the court date) and has stood outside a woman's house screaming until he can't even talk. I don't even care about them playing the victim (she's the one who plays mind games) I'm scared for I her safety.

It was already weird because I don't get why would an adult want to be friends with a child, but it didn't look like a fake account, and I once commented on one of her stories a few months ago and she responded and a figured she must have remembered me. We talked a little and she was just venting about her job, her family, and her lack of friends. (She didn't flirt with me or anything). 

One day she started talking about how she messaged my sister(30) out of nowhere. She is s a kind of small celebrity. She said she (my sister) stopped talking to her once she learned she didn't want to become a celebrity like her and just wanted friends. (It was her public insta, she has no private). She said that my sister only cares about the fame. She mentioned that my sister talked about me (which freaked me out because I figured she must have messaged me because I am related to my sister. She even asked If I had a sibling a few days prior but I just thought it was just an icebreaker, but now I think it was her way of figuring out if she messaged the ""right person"". Now she said that she wanted to meat (at a public place).

She's completely changed as a person and I had to adjust to that (so did she to me being changed as a person). It's one thing to Facetime and text her, but being with Sarah 24/7 for 4 days straight on a camping trip? It was intense. In a nutshell, I was being self-involved, selfish, a debbie-downer. I tried not to complain and be positive, but she knew it wasn't authentic. Shit hit the fan and we had a huge dispute.

After the trip, we didn't talk for a week cause I needed time alone and to think things through. I wrote her a LONG ass message on iMessage explaining all my emotions, 100% raw and real. I ended up mentioning how much she's changed. I said how she cares about looks, is superficial, hangs out with bad influences, and has bended her morals. I thought she deserved authenticity from me, but looking back, it wasn't very nice and undeserved. Sarah said, ""If anyone else would've written your message to me, I would've left them,"" But since we're best friends, she decided to forgive me. She's looked past it. But she was shocked that that's how I thought of her. I replied that it's just one bad bone.

609," 

I am getting a playset for my children and I am looking at leveling options but I am wondering if I am missing something.

Most tutorials I have seen say to find the lowest spot and dig out everything from there until it is all level, but this would leave an annoying and possibly dangerous ledge around part of the swing set.

I marked off the footprint of the swing set except for the end of the slide as that is on a high spot and I am thinking in can just locally dig out that spot without issue, and the rest of the set is a 15' by 10' span that varies about 2 inches on the 15' span and 7 inches on the 10' span. If I just dug out everything up to that lowest spot I would have some ares with a 6"" ledge which seems less than ideal for kids playing, but if there was some way to split the difference or I am fine with buying some dirt, but if I just raise the low area I will need to create a gentle slope off the back to once again avoid a ledge.

The set I am getting is listed below. I am also considering in the short term adding a block/paver type footings that can help initially level it and I can add dirt and resod over it when it is all done, but by just digging out and building up the spots where the set sits, it will make smoothing out the rest later more manageable and as long as those blocks don't end up sitting proud, it wouldn't be a safety hazard.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

617,"There are two major things contributing to the way I’m feeling: 

Part 1: My girlfriend(18f) dumped me(19m) about 8 months ago. It took a long time but eventually I started to lose memory of the good parts of our relationship and remember what hurt about it and it helped me move on. I’ve recently started talking to a girl I met a few months ago (let’s call her Claire) and we’ve been hitting it off. A couple of nights ago things started to heat up and we started sexting. It was fun at first but as things got more explicit I started thinking about my ex, but not in a sexual way, just thinking about her. I felt awful and things with Claire died down shortly after. I kept thinking about my ex all night. In the last month I have thought about her a few times but the thoughts were mostly negative. And even now when I think about her I think about how unappreciated I felt with her and how incompatible we are, BUT I KEEP THINKING ABOUT HER. I’ve continued talking to Claire but I no longer have any interest in sexting again and we’ve been talking about seeing each other (we live a little ways apart and COVID makes things hard) but I’ve lost interest in meeting up. I was excited about starting things up with her but once we started getting closer I thought about my ex and got cold feet.

Part 2: I work two jobs currently and I’m making a decent amount of money. Neither job I particularly enjoy but I’m 19 so I really can’t complain. Since getting dumped I’ve been thinking a lot about what I really want to do in my life and I’m just not sure what to do. I am very passionate about computers so I’m pursuing majors in physics and computer science with a minor in mathematics in college and I’m doing very well. One of my jobs is an internship with the navy as a computer technician and this has enabled me to get a security clearance which is a huge stepping stone into future opportunities. I feel like I should feel really good about the place I’m in but I’m not. As stated above I’ve been thinking about my ex a lot and it really brings me down during the day. I try to think about how lucky I am to be in the position I’m in career wise but I honestly don’t care. I love working on computers but I remember loving her a whole lot more. And as far as the future is concerned I ultimately don’t care what I do for work. My life goals are to get married and support a family and I am willing to do whatever I need to get that goal. I know my ex isn’t right for me but for some reason she’s still popping up I my brain as the most important thing.

So now I work more in their production facility than I do at my desk. The CEO is racist, loud, and a sleazy used car salesman type... The other two in charge are awful human beings and I'm constantly asked to do things that I'm not comfortable doing.

I feel like I've completely lost my design career, there is nowhere hiring in my field despite my degrees in marketing and design. There's just nowhere hiring that isn't just an extremely low income retail/fast food job because of everything going on . I have recruiters out looking for me but its extremely slow.. I am an entrepreneur by heart but all my creative business endeavours seem unlikely and unstable given the current market... Ultimately I'm in a huge pit of despair, not sleeping well, unhealthy eating habits, and extremely concerned that their lack of regard to health and safety here means I will catch COVID. The only thing that keeps me going is that I'm trying to keep an income going steady, because my parents are starting to have financial struggles, and I want to be able to help them when it gets to be a problem.

I kept holding on to hope that this place would be shut down by the health department or something so I could collect unemployment for a little while but I've also seen this employer breaking laws in order to deny previous employees unemployment... Its just a nightmare everywhere.

I have experience in many things and I just can't push myself to try to make something of any one thing to escape because its eat, sleep, and this job. I have experience in audio production, video production, full-stack design, marketing, and even CAD and CNC machining. I just don't know what to do with any of it.

Do I quit this job and live off savings hoping that something will come along soon enough?  
Or just hold on and keep trudging somehow?  
Any other ideas?

623," 

Extreme term, I know.

The (very) short version: I'm 35, currently living with my parents, have no degree or education. Worked mostly temporary jobs so far, but I've got a  more long-term job and should get my own appartment soon, so there's  that.

I never had a date or a girlfriend, I got turned down when I asked people out and going to the gym or doing theatre didn't help my prospects. I'm not desirable and my personality is bland.

I'm in the middle of my life and realize that I won't become rich or succesful, too far behind the curve to find someone, I'm below average and that's  fine, but how do I make peace with it? Advice welcome.",21Jul2020,2
624,"So I’m looking for advice on how to handle this situation. I have this friend and we’ve been friends for a long time, but this friend has anxiety regarding certain things. Some things throughout the duration of our friendship we’ve been able to conquer, but one big issue I’m having is coping with how to deal with it. The situation is that I’ve moved away from the town that we both lived in and I’ve come back to visit multiple times and they have not been to visit me once. The drive isn’t super long it’s about 6 hours, but I think my friend has anxiety about never having driven that long by themselves. It just feels like they don’t care because I offered a solution of coming to pick them up, bring them back to where I currently am, and drop them back in our hometown. Due to the world at the moment it threw a wrench in the dates we had planned. But if they could bring themselves they could do an earlier date than wouldn’t be in conflict. I’ve never thrown this in their face about them not coming up, but it is something that bothers me. How should I handle this?",21Jul2020,2

I can easily tell myself ""I'm going to start doing X,"" then go and do the thing. Maybe I'll stick with it for a few days, whether it's writing, working out, eating healthy, cooking for myself, read more, etc, but eventually I end up dropping whatever I decided to do and then feel guilty that I failed at my goal. Most of the time, i don't even do this intentionally, I'll just suddenly notice a week or two has passed since I last did the thing and realized I had completely forgotten it. 

In the past I have tried to plan these things with someone else, but I eventually end up relying on them to keep me going and see them forgetting as a break. I've also tried rewarding myself after an action, but, how did that Tumblr post go, ""Why wait to have a cookie when I can have one now?"".

Honestly though I choose lily over going out and doing things cause I love her so much. I love taking her for drives with my boyfriend  and getting her very own meals at fast food places and showing her new things. We have naps together and she makes me laugh and I love her: I’m literally obsessed with any animal I meet and instantly wanna just be their best friend.

639,"So title pretty much says it all. I am also on mobile, so apologies for formatting. 

I just graduated with honours with a BSc in Psychology with Neuroscience.  I'm starting a MSc in Clinical Neuroscience in September at one of the top 10 Universities in Europe.  Super excited, super happy to have been accepted to such a prestigious university.  With a bit of savings, some scholarships due to high grades and government funding I can afford the tuition for full time option which is great as I want to complete this course ASAP in order to get working and making money ASAP, as I've been set on doing a PhD as well when I finish this. 

So here's the problem: I'll be living at home and making the short 30 minute bus commute every day. This terrifies me as I'm afraid I won't be able to make significant and meaningful connections as I've done for my Bachelor's as I was living on campus and later got a house with my best 3 friends.  We had a super tight group of about 15 individuals and we used to do everything together on a daily basis and so on. However this was only possible because I was living right next to the university in uni accommodation and therefore I was in the centre of it all. Now this will not be possible and I don't know how to prepare myself for the possibility of not making friends. 



I'm still in contact with my previous friends but we all live in different parts of the country/continent and as you can imagine we can't do much more than meetings online. Any advice?

That got me thinking... what if I don’t like my job? Or my career path in general?

I’m a software engineer and it comes with a lot of benefits. I never find my job to be particularly challenging, surprisingly. i am definitely considered good at what I do. I love the flexibility it affords me. I generally could do it in short spurts without ADHD meds but if I had to do it 8 hours it would be exhausting

Working remotely has really helped because I only work 6 hours in weird bursts (8-10, 1-3, 5-7) and generally do other stuff in my spare time between. Helps my mind feel clear.

650,"so for a little background, i stay with my boyfriend pretty much all the time. recently his younger brother was having a lot of problems with their parents and their parents came to my boyfriend asking if he could live with him. now he was instantly fine with it, but of course had to talk to his roommate. which ended up being fine with it too. now i've taken a lot of shit from his roommate in the time we've been dating. he'll call me names, in a joking way i assume. but if we do the same to his girlfriend it's a problem. i'm sure you can tell where this is going.. but right as quarantine happened my boyfriends brother was having people over. which really bothered his roommate. but would expect my boyfriend to some how control his brother instead of them all talking about it. and coming to some sort of agreement like most roommates and adults do. and i did understand bc he (my boyfriends roommate) had to be quarantined as much as possible to be able to see his girlfriend. the punch line is that he wasn't really though and was still going to game night at his brothers coming in contact with various people. he even tried to ask my boyfriend if he wanted to come. and i didn't say anything at the time but i pulled him aside and said that, that was horrible and he needed to tell him that. keep in mind this is after countless arguments over text. nothing has ever been spoken out loud. expect one small argument. ONE. 

and of course bc we called him out he got defensive and turned it right back around on us. now for awhile nothing happened. they still all pretended like nothing happened and everything was fine. but just kind of avoided each other. but as usual they are boys, so sometimes they would game and the roommate would ask to play and then scream and rage quit. it also sucks bc i have extreme ptsd and get sent into fight or flight mode and have a panic attack every single time. now since at least where i'm at, some of the quarantine restrictions have been lifted. so the roommate has had his girlfriend over many times. so the fight about not having people over bc of her is now invalid. and it has now turned into that he doesn't want people he doesn't know in HIS house. that it gives him anxiety. which part of me understands but the other part doesnt, bc that's just simply part of living with people. and the only way to stop it is to live on their own. and i know that's not easy for most people. but they've even tried to come up with a compromise. but he won't budge. when my boyfriend and his brother both pay rent so i don't think it's unfair of them to have people over. not to mention i was once someone he didn't know, and he didn't care or act like this towards me. and every person has been introduced to him. they just really didn't smoke so them and the roommate didn't really have anything in common. there's been small fights here and there. 

bc a few weeks ago my boyfriends brother found the roommates girlfriend cleaning their kitchen and asked why. and she said no one else does. (which ouch. considering i do it all the time to help out) and was very visibly upset. and he said he would finish cleaning and that he was sorry it wasn't done before she came. and she was so relieved and said thank you and walked away. and so knowing if he confronted the roommate he wouldn't say anything. so he posted in the house group chat that we should try to clean up before we have guests over bc she was pretty upset. and now i don't know if he asked her about it, but if he did i'm assuming she said she wasn't mad at all. bc then it was turned around on everyone else. and that me and my boyfriend make messes all the time and don't clean them up, which is not true. and that my boyfriends brother has people over and makes 0 effort to clean before hand. keep in mind i think the last time the roommate did dishes was when they first moved in, in the beginning of 2019. so since then he has nit picked over every little thing. divided all the dishes, even though when they first moved in him and my boyfriend split everything. but it wasn't worth the fight so we bought new ones. now this brings me to last night, we decided to have some friends over bc my boyfriends birthday is in a few weeks and we wanted to celebrate early and when everyone had time. and it was a total of 3 friends over. and right as everyone came inside, the roommate had walked out saw all the people and proceeded to slam his door, indicating he was mad like he always does. but we brushed it off and started playing games. and the night drew on he blasted music bc apparently we were being to loud and he didn't want to hear us. while he proceeded to yell at whatever game he was playing and throw and break stuff. which one of the girls we hung out with is the same way with the yelled and slamming stuff and was very upset. and it made my boyfriend upset bc it's embarrassing. who acts like that when people are over? 

and like if he wanted to hang out with us and have some pizza all you had to do was ask. then we all ended up passing out at around 2. our 3 friends slept out in the living room. now, i had brought my flat screen to his house bc it didn't connect to my wifi over at mine. they had it in the living room for awhile and then we never got to use it bc the roommate was always playing something so my boyfriend moved it into his room. so last night we played games on the flat screen his roommate had wall mounted in the living room. and keep in mind he didn't say we couldn't use it. if we would have a obviously we would have respected it. well apparently in the middle of the night last night he ripped it off the wall and took it back in his room, which is fine. but why even put it out there in the first place if you're just gonna act like that. and stayed up all night blasting music on his phone and turning on all the lights while our friends were trying to fucking sleep. and their bathroom sink is kinda broken right now and it's not draining properly and so i didn't get a chance to clean it. and sure enough at 5 am he sent a video zooming in on all the stuff. saying something about us not cleaning before having people over. and the people he doesn't know were still fucking here. which we had been drinking so of course we weren't just gonna force people to go home at 2 am drunk. that's horrible. and woke us all up at 6 punching the bathroom wall, slamming doors, breaking stuff in the kitchen. 

and i know some people are gonna say it's none of my business since i don't technically live here. but i just wanted any advice even for my boyfriend bc i know this is hurting him, bc the roommate has been his best friend since middle school. i'm just out of answers.",21Jul2020,1
651,"Hi everyone,

The short story is my husband and I got into a bad argument. As a result, I am no longer living in the house and he has told me his is considering divorce. The argument started with something small that I do take responsibility for, I don't want to go into the details but I said something without thinking and hurt him. Even deeper than that, my husband and I have had some issues lately really communicating and I know that our next move should be to deal with those issues.

**But what I really like advice on is this:**

My husband holds a grudge a lot of the time. So even now after I have tried to say sorry he is still really mad and upset (again I do take responsibility) but my thing is I don't exactly know how to say sorry/what to do so that we can start working on our real issues. (to clarify when I have tried to say sorry he either listens and doesn't respond or just doesn't listen at all). 

I guess my question is directed mainly at people who hold grudges. What could your partner say/do in this kind of situation (where your partner did wrong you and tried to apologize)? What would you be open to hearing? or is it just a matter of giving him space right now?

(at this time I don't necessarily need to hear about how problematic this behavior is or anything of the like, I know that I am not perfect and neither is my marriage nor my husband but I know he loves and respects me and with counseling we can build an even stronger relationship).

I'll be celebrating one year with my boyfriend in about a month..... And I'm not quite sure what to make or get him? We are both early 20's and live with each other when I'm not at school (he has a job back home that he really enjoys right now but we usually see each other every week or other week). 
So far I'm making a collage with places we've been and things we've done together with lyrics from our song embedded in the pictures.  We're very close, have already talked about plans after im done school, and are comfortable talking about marriage and planning things out (please no comments of ""you're too young"")

I'm not sure what to get someone who has everything he wants. Our trips are usually to the countryside or mountainside, and he likes working on his old truck in his free time, but hes not good with many hobbies besides truck work as he doesnt have too much free time when he's not echausted. I guess im leaning towards something sentimental or something he may enjoy or be able to use. He's not a big fan of books or things with a lot of words; im currently helping him design plans for a tiny house as he loves to build things, but im more of the numbers and specifics. He's better at putting things together than I am, i just give him the instructions in detail lol. Im sorry if im not good with this description or what else to put...i just don't want to only give him one photo collage...any ideas or other suggestions? 

I don't have a huge budget, I'd say MAX $150 as covid kinda did its thing.

653,"Hi guys! Thank you for your advice!

So I live in a townhouse community. The house to my left is a end unit. There is an empty grassy space and then the next set of houses began. The neighbor to my left is named Ally.   The ones in the next end unit starting the other set of houses is named Tom. 

So Tom just told me yesterday that his dog is responsible for the 16ish large brown spots in the grassy area between the two houses. He also told me that he tosses her poop on top of the hill directly behind the houses. He has a large dog that poops 6 times a day (he told me she poops that often).  Tom said to me ""look at all of the spots my dog as made!! Well, at least it's not my grass that I have to deal with!"" I'm a shy  and awkward person so I just kind of walked away. 

When I told my husband, he said I was morally obligated to tell Ally that Tom is destroying the lawn. She is responsible for keeping up the grass, so this will be an issue for her when HOA notices the damaged lawn. 

In addition, my husband thinks that I should tell Tom not to throw the poop up on the hill. The 6 giant poops a day will add up to an unhealthy and smelly cesspool that will drain into our yards every time it rains. I'm especially concerned about the poop draining into my yard and making it unsanitary for my dogs.

I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to cause/be a gossip/get involved with drama. The two neighbors are both my friends and I want to maintain good relationships with them.

I’m still so ugly that it just doesn’t make sense for any woman to settle for me when they can find anyone with the same traits as myself but aren’t repulsive.

I’ve been on tinder (paying for gold since March), bumble, okcupid, and hinge since October and between all of those apps I have around 10 matches combined between them and 0 dates. I’ve had my friends take pictures of me, help me write a bio, and I had my friends who are girls who are pretty experienced with dating apps look over my profiles, but none of that matters if you’re as ugly as me. I’ve asked out girls in person as well, the last three were people I would consider good friends of mine and they all three said yes. Not a single one of them showed up and not a single one of them told me beforehand that they weren’t coming, I’m not worth the effort I guess.

I don’t even have anyone I can turn to, even my mom and sister told me that despite losing 80 pounds that I’m still a 2/10. What else am I supposed to do at this point? I’d get plastic surgery but I’ll never be able to afford it. I just feel like my only purpose is to be an inconvenience to women who are looking for men who aren’t subhuman vermin. I don’t even have a career to look forward to because I decided that it would be a good idea to take on lifelong debt for a fucking history degree. It feels like I have nothing to look forward to, poverty? Being alone forever?

What do I do?

660,"Hi everyone. This post will be pretty broad, with other more specific posts likely coming in the future. Thank you in advance for reading. 

I’m just starting out with researching into things, but I’m looking for some advice for landing some of my first writing gigs and really establishing myself as a freelance writer and building a base for myself.

As of right now, I’ve only gone as far as making myself a very simple portfoliobox site, although I won’t be making much use of it at the moment. I’ve heard that many freelance writers have blogs, but I know little to nothing about blogging, how to benefit from it, or even what I should be writing about.

As a writer, I primarily write fiction, game reviews, and movie reviews, all as a hobbyist, as I’ve never written for others for work before. I’m open to other forms of writing, but those are probably my specialties. 

How should I start my freelance writing journey and prepare myself as quickly as possible to make writing my main source of income? How does one land their first gig, and how do they get more after that? Where should I be looking as a beginner? 

Thanks again, guys.",21Jul2020,1

662,"So a few months ago I got another financial aid check from my college. We've just randomly been getting these checks and by now they've already covered all the expenses for my first year there. And now there was another one? I've been meaning to give it to my grandma to put it into her account for my tuition, but I kept forgetting about it and now theres 1 month left before it expires.

 But honestly im really tempted to just use it as my own.. I've been out of a job for awhile because of covid and the job I just got I haven't been getting a lot of hours and they pay monthly! I'm so used to being paid every 2 weeks so this feels odd for money coming in.. I have about 200$ currently, I've been trying really hard not to spend any other than gas for my car and occasional outings. My boyfriend has been paying mostly when we go out because he knows. I feel bad about that. 

And I've also really been wanting to give myself a belated birthday gift. Im thinking of a new art tablet and a tattoo. I've been wanting a tattoo for so long and now that I'm over 18 I'm able to! And my old art tablet is kinda flakey on me.. I wanna improve my art. For some reason no one in my family got me anything or gave me any money, which is odd because they always do for birthdays. And especially now with no job it would've been appreciated :/ 

But anyways, I don't really know what to do..I would absolutely love the money right now. But if I took it I'd feel really guilty,  and kinda worried if they ever found out. But also the financial aid for my year already paid for everything and I'm sure it'll continue to give me the same for every year when I apply. Also im not in college currently with covid. I don't like the virtual classes they offer and I can't learn well with them. So im waiting for things to reopen, possibly for next year.. so what should I do?",21Jul2020,1

665,"I’m a 21 year old buying a car for the first time with a budget of $6,000. My family isn’t really being helpful and it’s hard doing this on my own. 


One, I live in a rural area, 30 mins out from small dealers, and 50+ mins from decent dealers (Ford, Honda, etc). So I always need a ride to look at cars, and many times people aren’t  willing to do all the driving back and forth for me because I live so far away it’s a hassle. 


Two, I don’t have any car knowledge. 


Three, the one person in my family that does know about cars either is working or I’m just not a number one priority for him. I call him occasionally and tell him about what cars I look at. But he never has time to look at them with me.
 

My 83 year old great aunt was going to give me a 2006 Kia Rio with 220,000 miles on it for nothing. My concern is the Kia already has many miles on it and has problems with the ignition and brakes. My aunt was supposed to look for a car this summer and let me have the Kia but she hadn’t been actively looking and this was something I was looking to do before school (August 12).

I feel like I’m really lacking support and I am getting to the point where I just want to do it on my own. But when I run across problems like dealers not letting me test drive it until I’m sure I want to buy or cars with no warranty, I’m stuck. 

Should I wait for my family or just do it on my own?",21Jul2020,1
666,"Hello everyone, I’m looking for some advice.

Our AB just turned 7 months old and he is the greatest dog. He loves to snuggle, loves to sit on my lap at almost 80 pounds but one issue we can’t seem to figure out is his separation anxiety.

I feed him at 7am and we go on about a mile walk before I leave for work at 8am. He sometimes gets upset when I leave for work, he’ll stand in the window and whine when I get into my car which usually subsides pretty fast. However, I come home for lunch at 12pm and our house is in ruins. He tears up the couch (we’re on couch #3 in 3 months). He chews the wood IN the couch that he digs to and pulls the cushions off.

He only is destructive when neither myself or my partner is home. When we’re home he’s almost angelic. He is crate trained and is fine going in there as long as one of us is home. If I try to crate him and leave for work he keeps hurting himself (throwing himself at the sides, non stop yelping, chewing on the cage) and he’s damaged the kennel to the point we need a new one from when I tried to crate him and go to work.

We have tried Calming Treats, CBD, Hemp treats, YUCK anti chewing spray, longer walks during the morning/lunchtime, dog park in the evening (he goes at least 4-5 times a week) and honestly we’re at a loss as to what to do. We did have him in puppy classes early March but they have been postponed due to circumstances.

Does anyone have any recommendations? He is 7 months, not neutered, he is the only dog in the house though we do have a cat (they get along pretty well). Any and all suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you for reading.",21Jul2020,2

670,"I’m 19 years old, and my mom is extremely emotionally abusive. Recently, we moved to a rural area, and I had hoped being where she wanted to be would... make her nicer, I guess. She’s been this way since I was a little kid, but I only started becoming aware of what it was after breaking off a toxic relationship roughly 3 years ago, give or take. In the past two months it’s only gotten worse, to the point I’m having suicidal thoughts whenever she speaks to me in a negative manner. Sometimes I worry that I’m over-reacting, but she always calls me lazy, entitled, spoiled, tells me I never contribute to the household, etc. Not to mention she makes her decisions and lets the family deal with the consequences, regardless of what any of us think or say. She screams at me and threatens to shut my phone off when I don’t pick up her calls because her call never went through on my end. She’s struck me a few times for “talking back.” She gets angry when I ask questions out of genuine curiosity when she asks me to do something. She forces me to handle responsibilities that should be hers as a mother, as well. As far as my research goes, she’s a narcissist to the t, and I’m certain she’s trying to hide that she is an alcoholic and is addicted to some of her prescription medications. I’ve talked to my siblings, and they all agree.

In some respects I do have it better than other people and I’m aware of that, but I know that her telling me I’m lazy isn’t true. I’m 98% certain I have depression (I would like to get in to see a therapist soon, but the current matter is more important) but I still bust my ass day in and out trying to find a job and helping her with house renovations, running errands to towns an hour away when I can’t afford gas, and taking care of our livestock. 

I want out, and I have wanted out for two years now. Which is where the wanting to move thing comes into play.

Almost half a year ago I met a guy online that’s one of my closest friends. I’ve spoken to him over video call multiple times, seen his house on video multiple times, he’s open and honest with me about his life, so I’m certain he’s a safe person to see. This friend, his mom, and my girlfriend are all aware of how my mom treats me. My girlfriend doesn’t have the space to take me and my cat, or I would have moved in with her.

Recently, my friend’s grandfather passed away, and he was informed by his mother he might get the house. His mother said she would be willing to take me and the cat so long as I help around the house and cover utilities. The problem is, they live across the country. I’m in Utah, and they’re in Georgia. I’m aiming to move in roughly a month or so. I haven’t breathed a word of this to my mom because I’m terrified she’ll take away my means of escape, but I’m worrying myself sick. Am I being too hasty about leaving to live with someone I’ve known half a year, even if I trust him and his family wholeheartedly? Like, am I crazy for leaving behind people and places I’ve known my entire life and love deeply if it means escaping my mom’s abuse?

TLDR: My mom is abusive, I have the option to move across the country in one month to escape if I can scrape together the funds, but I’m scared. Help?",21Jul2020,1

Hi. I'm a 17 y.o who lives in a third world country, desperate for money right now. I need it for online classes in which starts next month. I have to pay for a new laptop, the tuition and other stuff.

So far, I've been looking for some jobs but none was successful. I tried to go back to my old side jobs like clean the yard of my neighbor, tutoring some kids, and running errands for an old lady across the street.
I also have been selling my old stuff but the ones I've posted on facebook didn't really apeal to anybody (maybe because it was just some old clothes and a blender, who knows) But nope, i couldn't earn money because of the quarantine/virus. 

Lastly, I live with my grandpa and he had a job in which he provided me with all my needs. (I love him so much) But sadly due to the virus, he doesn't have a job anymore. Luckily my sister let us live at her house so we have food in our mouths.
So yeah. I'm really asking for your help and if you could recommend me some ways to earn money.

Note: I am in no way belittling other peoples problems and thinking that my problem is far more heavy than yours. If I offended you in some way, I am truly sorry. I am just asking a genuine question. No adult would answer me properly irl. So I'm hoping i can find some answers here. Thank you :)

679,"Me (28F) and my friend (28F) met two friends at a bar and we both fancied the same guy (Mike) but we didn't really fancy his friend (Dan). My friend was talking a bit more with Mike than me and was trying to flirt with him. I told my friend from the start that I liked Mike too but not Dan but I was giving her a chance to flirt with him or whatever so I wound up talking more with Dan. From the outside it may have looked like she was ""with"" Mike and I was ""with"" Dan.

The next day I get a friend request on Facebook from Mike and I accept. I then call my friend and ask her if she want to go and meet the guys for drinks and she starts to sound weird and asks me if they are talking to me and which one. When I tell her it's Mike she freaks out and starts screaming and crying that every time we go out I get all the guys and that I always get more attention than her.

At first I was going to meet Mike because I don't think I did anything wrong. She keeps telling me that I'm a shitty friend to even accept his friend request on FB and that I should never have started talking to a guy that she was flirting with. The problem is he didn't even like her but he liked me so why should I have to back off when they don't even know each other? But because this seemed to be such a huge problem for her I told her I'm not going to meet him, it's not worth it and I told her I'm sorry.

Still we had a big fight over this online and we both said some rude things to each other so I told her we should cool off because things were starting to get nasty. I gave her space for a whole week and I just reached out yesterday and said something innocent like ""Hi how are you"" and she hasn't answered. She is online and ignoring me. This infuriates me. She even blocked me from seeing a post on her FB (I know bc I asked another friend to check) I have no idea why she is making such a huge deal over this.

I don't think I did anything wrong because I was honest from the start and honest for each step, about  
me liking him, that he added me on FB, that we started talking (not even flirting). She thinks that I should have asked for her permission to accept his FRIEND request, which I think is ridiculous. I think this is a problem she has to fix herself. She told me that she has felt insecure when we go out the whole time we've known each other. I don't think it's my responsibility to make her feel better about herself. I feel like she's punishing me for something I can't control.

I can't believe that some random guy seems to have ruined our friendship when we've been friends for over 10 years. I think this whole situation is so childish and I don't know what to do anymore. Does anyone have any advice for me? Did I do something wrong and I'm not seeing things clearly or is she being unfair?",21Jul2020,1
681,"I am 19 year old and I'm sad because I'm so stupid.. I have recently been diagnosed with add which is probably why I haven't done good in school due to concentration problems..

But with my add I'm a pretty calm person too.. Which made my friends assume I was more intelligent than I myself know I am not.

I've told them before I'm not smart and that surprised them.. A half year later which is recently we watched a movie and we tried to identify each other who we were in that movie..

They identified me with a very smart and serious dude and I then told them that were not true (don't know why.. Guess because I don't like it when people assume I am something I am not but it made me so sad to say it out loud) and explained how I am that ""stupid"" guy instead.

They accepted it pretty quickly because they remembered the last time I told them this.. One girl/friend also said ""nooo :("" in pitty u know.. But then accepted it. 

It's sad cause i feel like I have no personality and I think they also think that.. They have always viewed me as that serious mature guy that is intelligent.. - but I am not intelligent and they know that now so now they just look at me like I am nothing - have no personality.. - and I agree with them sadly. 

I am nothing.. I guess I strive to be kind and stuff but I just feel stupid and like a kid... Or nvm.. Kids are probably smarter than me lmao 

I am calm.. Serious.. Boring... - most people who are like that are at least smart and love homework.. But no.. I am just the negative stuff.. 

I'm also gay and a gay stereotype is that they are smart and I'm not even that.. 

I am kind of a dissapointment :/

Edit: it's kind of sad too cause I look up to smart characters in movies too like.. Dumbledore for an example.. He is so wise and kind and everything... I wish I were that too :(
There are alot more people I look up to but I love the Harry Potter series so I just kind of had to chose dumbledore haha... 

But anyway.. It's sad I have no personality and I'm boring (I also cannot socialize because I'm too stupid to do that so yea.. :/) 

It is also sad because I wanna be a parent.. I look up to mothers and their kindness and intelligence and I wanna be like them - a loving dad.. But I'm so sad because I can't give them wisdom.. I guess I can search things up with them but it's not the same thing and it's so sad.. I'm so sorry future kids :(

(also sorry for my English.. English is not my native language and right now I'm kind of too lazy to correct everything too.. I am not lazy in general though I am just very sad right now.. I don't think ""being lazy"" is an excuse to anything because being lazy is kind of like ur own choice u know.. U can get over it but you just dont wanna and ye...

That requires a lot of money. Hopefully *\*knocks on wood\** in January I'll graduate with a Bachelors in Graphic Design and Web Development.

Like most colleges, the little web development I know is self taught as there have been no classes that teach it to me, despite that I was thinking about going into front end web development. I really enjoy making websites-the few that I have made anyway-but it feels like the barrier to entry is far too high. So the other thing I'm interested in is the cloud. I know little to nothing about it, but I started an intro to cloud course on linkedin learning and its interesting. I'm thinking about dropping the web development part and going to get my A+ so I can get a helpdesk job, and then continuing my certs until I get AWS certified. I am unsure what path to take, and I'm running out of time (am 40yr old female).

The real issue is that I'm dealing with serious depression, and it's difficult to see myself getting anywhere with any company anyway. So I'm trying to find which path I can take that will allow me to see myself actually progress in something. No matter what I do with learning front end stuff it always feels like there's 500 things I don't know that I need to know to get an entry level position and its frustrating the hell out of me. So much so I can't focus. I feel like getting one certification after another is a step by step process to becoming someone who has a real career, and there's nothing like that for front end.

I'm 100% sure it's my depression talking but I'm waffling back and forth between staying the course and forcing javascript down my throat and switching to getting my certs. I can't get past the beginning stages because of it.

685,"...in fact, I don't want him to live with us longer than 6 months or so.

The thing is, I fucked up. I told my friend once he graduates, he can come stay at my apartment because I was living with my boyfriend anyway and would rather my best friend be safe. 

His life at home sucked and he immediately skipped going back home to come move directly into my place. I didn't live there (issues w/ roommate) and since I still paid rent at the old place, I said ""It's cool mate!""

Well, my lease is up in October. 

My boyfriend and I are planning on moving to a bigger place... but my best friend (let's call him Stephen) is moving with us too.

There are a few issues I have with this that have been growing on me: 

1. He agreed to have a job when he moved here (which was May). He had a job in college and said ""Oh it's easy to transfer locations"". He hasn't done it because he had ONE bad phone call with the hiring manager who was busy. He didn't go up to the store. He didn't even try.

2. He has been rejecting job offers because they ""aren't good enough for him"" (either it's a long-ish metro ride or not enough pay). A job is a job and he honestly don't have enough experience in his major (sociology) to get anything good anyway. SO I don't understand why he would turn things down. 

3. He wants input on the apartment, but without a job he has no income i.e. no rent so he doesn't get any input. 

4. BF and I are fine with him staying with us a little while longer, but not forever. We value our privacy. However, it is REALLY hard to get a apartment here where I live HCOL (high cost of living). He'd have to roommate with a stranger which is probably outside of his comfort zone. 

    The reason why he can't go home is because his family does not support him (he's trans) and it makes him depressed and suicidal.

5. He has like 200 dollars left. That's it. I am putting my foot down now and saying that I'm not going to pay for his groceries AND his living here.

I want to be nice. I really do. But I'm not sure how to lay down the deadlines that I just decided with my boyfriend (1 month from when we move in to get a job and 6 months to find a place to live). 

I know right now it's hard to find a job, so I don't necessarily blame him. The world is a shitfest right now. But honestly how can I keep up with this? I can't, I just can't. I don't want him to live with us for years.",21Jul2020,1

That may change but for now, that’s what I am. I have called girls “Pretty” and “Cute” in front of her but I don’t think she knows that I’m trying to give her hints 😅. I don’t think I want to tell her yet, but what if I kiss a girl.. What am I supposed to tell her then? What if I get into a relationship with a girl? What am I supposed to tell her..? I don’t want things to change between us. And I don’t want it to seem like some kind of joke, it almost feels like that. Sometimes I regret ever feeling like this... but when I imagine being with a girl, it feels right. You know? And sometimes boys too. I just don’t know. But when I have to tell her.. how do I do it..?

693,"I am currently doing an online course and am hoping to move abroad for a year or so to experience something exciting and new, but whenever I think about it I realise how difficult it’s going to be because of my family and that just makes me feel burdened. My friends say I should go anyway as I am over 18 and have a right to live my life the way I want to, but there’s too much that I’m worried about and it gives me headaches.

My parents come from a traditional country where people are rushed into marriage and women the ones who are supposed to stay home to look after the family. Having said that, my parents are not exactly typical strict South Asian parents; it’s hard to explain, but my dad is more of a religious hypocrite and my mum is a lot more open-minded. She is also overly attached to me.

My mum does not love my dad at all (in fact, she hates him with her soul and so do I), but she’s married to him because her family wanted her to have a fresh start after her previous divorce. After having me she felt like she couldn’t leave my dad because of our religious community and fear.

My dad has those typical traditional ideas ingrained in his mind (that physical abuse is a good form of punishment, people should be married and have children at a young age, women should stay home and take care of the family, marrying someone from a different ethnicity is bad). So, I’m afraid that if I do get a job abroad and break the news to my parents, they are not going to be supportive of me going, and I’m also worried about my mum’s safety…

Just to summarise a bit more about my dad; he is physically and verbally abusive towards me and my mum, his mood changes dramatically, he has anger issues, he cannot accept his own fault, he has extreme trust issues, he twists anything he can (eg: religious texts, something someone said) to his advantage, he’s a racist, very controlling, lies about everything, and finds it amusing when people are upset.

My mum and I have called the police on him in the past, but the police never really did anything to protect us from him (as they saw abuse as being a normal punishment in Asian culture) although they did say that if they get another call from us regarding my dad being physically abusive, they will take him away. However, my mum is always too afraid to do something against my dad when she has the chance to and so she just puts up with all his bullshit (whenever the police came in the past, she would always get worried and tell the police that everything is “fine” so that they would leave us alone in this hell-hole).

Anyways, I'm worried that once the time comes and I decide to break the news to my parents... my dad will be starting arguments with his and some of my mum's relatives, he will also be very violent towards me and my mum. My mum may try to get her sister to constantly message me to convince me not to go. I'm also worried that once I do go, my dad will start physically and even sexually abusing my mum.

I feel so suffocated like there’s nothing I can do to just enjoy my life without my parents being a burden on my shoulders.",21Jul2020,1

695,"I need advice as to how to intervene/deal with my adult sister controlling and being co-dependent with my mother. I live four hours away and visited this past weekend. My mother who is pretty overweight informed me that she is getting her gallbladder removed in September. I broke down crying angrily at the dinner table because I've spent years trying to get my mother on a diet/exercise so she can extend her life, and now she has to get her gallbladder removed most likely due to the fact that she is obese.  


My mother is the closest thing you could find to an angel on this Earth. Our father is an abusive alcoholic who she finally divorced and took us away from in my last year of high school. The alcoholism and tyrannical abuse left deep scars in my sister, who suffers from an array of mental health issues that run in our family. Anxiety, OCD, depression. I think she might be bipolar also but that is not diagnosed. I myself suffered from severe depression and had a suicide attempt, but I managed to leave the nest, got engaged and am in school for engineering. My sister has never had a romantic relationship and she is 27. My mother has sheltered her and enabled her dysfunction.  


Hopefully I didn't ramble too much there, just wanted to give some background information. Anyways, my mother told me she apparently has tried to go on a diet, but my sister sabotages her because she is self conscious about her own weight. My sister goes absolutely ballistic over anything that she doesn't agree with or that makes her feel insecure. It feels like walking on thin ice when you're around her. So when my mother tried a diet out, my sister blew a gasket about a month into it, ranting about body shaming and unrealistic standards for women's bodies, which is not the problem here. To be clear, my mother doesn't agree with any of this and realizes obesity is not a good thing and wants to lose weight. It seems my mother just decided to stop so that she wouldn't have to deal with my sister's toxic and out of control rants all the time. I am so angry about this, I feel like driving down there tomorrow and demanding that my mother kick her out so she can have her own life finally. My sister doesn't seem to believe that obesity increases your risk of health complications (I see this from her posts on social media) yet my mother now has to get her gallbladder removed which will make it even harder for her to lose weight after.   


I'm at a loss as to what to do about this. I feel like I need to intervene here but I don't want to make things worse. What should I do?",21Jul2020,3
696,So last night I was smoking and maybe about an hour or 2 later my cat started acting extremely weird! She kept chasing something that wasn’t there 🤔 at first I thought it might have been a bug bc it was dark but then she kept hissing and jumping and making the sound cats make whenever they are scared?? I turned on the lights and watched her intensely and she acted so scared! She was running onto my bed looking at the walls and my floor obviously chasing something and then she would run off my bed running into my dresser drawers hissing then coming back out running under my bed where she would make a threatening sound like when cats fight just to climb back onto my bed just to repeat the exact same thing over and over. I picked her up bc she seemed so scared and tried playing with her on my bed to distract her and then she started looking everywhere on my bed and my walls and she was running around on my bed chasing nothing and then in mid run she jumped up in the air and hissed like something touched her! It was so scary as I’ve never seen her or my other animals act like that! Then I tried to get my big dog to sleep with me as I was scared and then he growled and jumped off my bed and out of my room which is weird as I don’t let him sleep with me often so whenever I finally do he is in heaven with the air conditioning and normally doesn’t move a muscle! So I’m not sure if my cat was chasing something I couldn’t see or she might have gotten contact High which is possible but the last few days I’ve been smoking in my room with her in there and she has never acted like this before! She could have gotten a sugar rush??? As I have gave her a small bite of my moon pie and a few bites of my granola bar 🤔,21Jul2020,0
697,"So lately I (F, 21) quit my job at the tattoo parlor I've been working in for two years.
I'm glad to be out of there cause they didn't treat me well but I the job itself.

Where I'm from the pay for tattooing is very dependend on how much you work (although every parlor is a little bit different) and you have to give a big cut to your boss (in my case 70%).
I just didn't see a long lasting future for myself because I plan on renovating a house with my husband (M, 24) in the future or building one which is extremely expensive.

So my only way of making a normal living while being able to put a bit of money aside is to be self employed and open my own shop.
The problem I have is that it scares the shit out of me cause I have no idea if I'm ready for such a big step in my life that could affect it strongly in the long run.
I'm afraid of taking on a huge debt just to not be successful at what I do.
What if I don't get any clients? What if I fail?

I’m trying to buy an original painting from an artist on Instagram and he’s asking me to offer a price. The painting is 16x20 and is unframed.

709,"(There will be more updates) 

But of clarification the last post was actually from a week before on a different account , i just reposted it because the other one was way to long.

Anyway, maybe 3 hours after putting up the (actual) first post, i contacted my lawyer to see the best point of action. 

•Protect my assets

•Paternity test (eventhough this kid is a tanned version of me with curly brown hair) 

•Getting in contact with ""Lea""

The last one was what I was focused on most. 

Two days after we (my lawyer and i) managed to get into contact with her. Later on in the week, we met at this cafe, I decided to go alone. She happy and just in a good mood, i kind of expected her to slap me.

 We had small talk, (i didn't mention making her essentially homeless, she didn't mention my family basically calling her worthless) it was civil. That was until I asked if I could meet him. Lets call him ""Henry""
When i mentioned meeting ""Henry"" that expression changed so quickly. I talked about technically having legal rights to see him, if he's biologically mine. That is when she informed me my name is not on his birth certificate, or any legal documents that would state me as his father. I asker her why she didn't right my name, and she said:

""Why would I right the name of the man I hated the most and a certificate that symbolizes the birth of the boy he loves the most"" 

that one sting, but she is justified. She told me that she has no hate in her heart left for me, and that she is happy with her life and that ""Henry"" is happy too. She regrets nothing from her past, and that if he was not born she would not of had the motivation and strength to get to the point that she as at now. This part surprised me the most, she said and i quote:

""I don't want your money, I want your promise. If i let you meet him it will be on my terms, and you must promise not to leave him the way you and your family left me.""

I promised, we will be meeting soon. But she will just introduce me as one of her friends. Just so, I can atleast get to meet him. I'm freaking out. I don't know what to do to calm myself down.

And before the rude ones come out of the wood work to call me nasty and tell me my house needs fumigation, I live in the south. When you add that to a very old house that is not properly insulated, you have bugs. It's not uncommon, and no matter how clean you are they will always come back. It becomes a process of managing the population because short of spending thousands you won't get rid of them. 

Anyway, my PC has already had these annoying turds inside of it. I periodically take compressed air and spray out what I can but it's an Aurora R6 so the space inside is pretty cramped with lots of nooks and crannies I can't get to nor am I confident enough in my computer savvy ability to try. I've elevated the tower off the ground in hopes that will help and I fully intend to start dusting the insides more frequently because bugs don't like places that get disturbed often. 

My main worry is that even with these measures the PC will end up damaged. I'm kinda living that broke 20 something dream life, and I don't have the money to replace parts or god forbid have to fork out even more for a whole new system.

721,"[Context: My mom has had lifelong PTSD from being tormented and almost murdered by a psychopath, so she's never had healthy relationships or coping mechanisms. She's always been very vocally affectionate and generous towards me, though. She developed a dependency on a much older, controlling guy when I was young, and together they normalized a lot of sexual behaviors. Because of this habituation, when he started abusing me, I wasn't even sure if it was abuse. When my mom got pregnant, they married and my half-brother was born. The man treated my brother like God's gift to earth, while he started abusing me more often, in the middle of the night to keep it from my mom.


When I was 16, I finally told my bio dad about the sexual abuse. He told my mom, and at first she denied it, but when I insisted it was all true, she broke down. I wanted to move in with my dad, but my mom was completely dysfunctional, crying all the time and just repeating ""kids need their mothers...I can't live without you...I would die for you"". My grandparents insisted that she needed me, and you have to understand at the time I was a devout Catholic, so I thought it was my life duty to be strong for my mom and be there for her. So she, my 6yo half-brother and I moved into my grandparents' house, where I took care of her. 


A therapist of mine reported my stepdad to CPS. They/the cops did an investigation and said he could possibly be charged with indecent assault of a minor, but since there was only my word vs his, they didn't think anything would come of it. My mom also said my stepdad was threatening her, so I didn't pursue further. Therefore, this man still has partial custody of my brother, and he is still involved in all of our lives. Above all else though, I made my family PROMISE I would never have to see his face again myself.]


Ok, context over. My main issue: when I was in college, my mom called me to tell me she had to get something off her chest - she hadn't divorced my stepdad yet, because she still loved him. She said ""I feel like I'm betraying you, but I can't lie any longer. If you don't want me to see him anymore, just say the word and I'll stop."" Of course, at the time I was too shocked to think properly. I told her something like, ""I think it's a huge mistake and he's a horrible person, but you're an adult, aren't you? I can't tell you what to do."" 


I thought I could repress everything and just move on from it, but I couldn't. It ate away at me. Every time my mom, my brother (who still doesn't know at 16), or my extended family brings up my abuser's name, like a casual friend who they see all the time, it feels like a knife being twisted in a wound. (I should mention they're all hardcore Catholics who believe in unconditional forgiveness.) I spiraled into a deep depression for a long time. I moved as far away as I possibly could, and I hardly ever visit, because I can't bear the thought of being in a place where he stays often. It doesn't feel like home.


My mom is still seeing him, as far as I know, though she doesn't live with him. At the same time, she is still super loving and affectionate towards me. Always sending gifts and little messages to me, always calling me and talking to me when I'm down. Sometimes, I literally feel like I'm losing my mind trying to reconcile these two worlds. Good moms always tell me that if someone was abusing their child, they would turn on that person in an instant. But my mom didn't do that. At no point did she ever voice resentment, disgust, or anger towards my stepdad. She *still loves him.*


I just don't know how to wrap my head around her behavior. I know if I call her out on it or tell her how horrible it actually makes me feel, she will just cry and say ""oh my God, I'm such a bad mother..."" and become dysfunctional again. But I can't live in a world where this man, who made me think being touched intimately by a grown man at 10 years old was normal, admits to nothing (even calls me an attention-seeking liar) and remains a part of my family, and everyone acts like it's all fine.",21Jul2020,2

It makes me sad that a lot of families may be going through this inner battle too. Of course I myself am tired of staying home and have my bad days, but I still do my part and I wear a mask and only go out for necessities like groceries, gas, and work even with this ‘reopening’ going on because I understand and see that we still are going through this pandemic and it’s not over yet. I don’t understand how this virus could be going as long as it has especially when Ebola and H1N1 was contained quicker than COVID but still the fact that we have to make that choice for our children with little support, or none is heart wrenching. The president expects a stimulus that does not cover a normal families rent for a month to last several months and yet a place like Disney world can get millions of dollars in funding for being closed down during the pandemic just goes to show who’s back our leaders really have. It scares me especially during these time’s all the violence that is going on as well and I am left with a sense of unstableness in our country lately.

I wish us the the people we share a neighborhood with, a grocery store with, a town with, a city with, a state with and a country with could have more compassion, love, and encouragement for each other. I wish we could all understand that we are in this together LITERALLY and we need to do our part to crush this virus and all this bad together. Put aside differences and look at a bigger picture that we do not want people to hurt and die from something we can help prevent. It astounds me that even wearing a mask is such a prevail task for some people and they aren’t understanding the importance it can bring even though in their minds it seems constricting or conforming to something when that’s not it at all. It hurts that our leaders are not being a good role model when we need them especially to the adults that seem to need it, but we need to know better when our leaders do not.

Does anyone have an idea of places worth looking at for inexpensive but charming wedding bands and bracelets?

Can anyone give me some advice please? It's become a problem in other areas of my life

730,"It's a really huge pet peeve for me to just randomly start doing something productive for no reason.  Thing is,I don't want it to be my pet peeve. I have this unhealthy way of thinking where everything has to be ""perfect"". To me there's something special when things begin or end. And probably because of my high ego combined with my low self esteem I'll think, ""special days is when I do special things"". When a month or week begins I develop a routine that's mega productive, but the moment I don't follow it exactly ( i miss an activity or something) ALL MY WILLPOWER DISAPPEARS.

I'm terrified to try to go into a relationship because I don't want to hurt the person the other person. I know I won't say anything to hurt their feelings, I just always feel like I'm not good enough and that I won't ever be.

733,"When I was younger, I could talk for hours with my parents and friends. I would find anything to talk about it and I had some of the best conversations in high school. I used to be able to make anyone laugh. Since coming to college, I’ve realized that I have nothing to say. I listen to my friends complain, I offer my 2 cents, and then I exit the conversation. The only things I can bring up naturally are about school and tv shows. When I see old friends, we just gossip about people we used to know or talk about politics and the pandemic. I’m not even funny anyone. I’ve become so boring and I’m afraid that when I graduate college in a few months, my friendships will become even more dull when we have no one to complain about.

737," Basically, i have no idea why

But im super obsessed with the way i move cuz i think its very awkward no matter what

And i cant even explain how much it is fucking me up, like i cant

Its very frustrating and makes me so angry and unsatisfied

Whenever i walk, i overthink it. I feel like it looks stupid. And now imagine literally everytime i take a step i feel self conscious and trying to ""perfect"" it drives me even more insane. Or i even started to overthink the way i rock my head while listening to music and its driving me nuts too. Like i become self conscious about it, basically things that are done unconsciously.

Another one is the way i freely dance, which i also feel fucked up over too for some reason. (And i dont mean no professional shit, but just moving your body along the music) and again, i force myself to do it just to make sure that i can do it well. Again, these things happen mainly unconsciously and it all is supposed to flow well. When in my case it makes me homicidal (not really)

And basically this are just some examples. And i experience it with other shit as well.

Now, i think that this should be noted: for particular reasons i am at home all the time and dont go out anymore. I dont talk to anyone basically, like at all. Had no close relationships in like two years(and i mean like close friends). And as u can imagine im always in my head. Btw i never even had this problem before too.

Basically, im sure its caused by being lonely and at home. But again, like im not overdramatizing it... words cant describe how fucked up it gets sometimes..

738,"My best friend of almost 15 years and I have always been different, but as we've gotten older it's become more and more apparent that we hold different values and beliefs. She regularly makes racist/transphobic remarks, saying things like ""most black people are bad people,"" etc. I didn't notice it as much when we were younger, partly because I was young and uneducated on the struggles of minorities, but it seems like in the last 5 or so years her bigotry has gotten significantly worse. She is a staunch Trump supporter, complains about having to wear a mask because of COVID, and has mocked Dr. Rachel Levine on social media, just to name a few. We are definitely not as close as we were when we were younger, and we now only see each other once or twice a year (she's married with kids and I am not).

739,"Hello all,

I (27 y/o, F) am having a bit of a dilemma regarding a job interview that I had recently and I’m hoping that someone can offer a POV that I may not be considering. I will not disclose any names/identifying information, but I will do my best to be clear and concise:
I was offered a job at a startup company as a Molecular Technologist and I’m having some hesitations about accepting the offer. They are offering to pay me double what I make now, but I would have to work ~50 hours a week, no benefits package (they told me they want to offer this when they can). The job is in a lab for a genomics/pharmaceutical risk management company. They loved my resume as I have worked in a genomics core lab as a lab tech for over a year and would provide a lot of much needed experience that their lab would need.
My current job doesn’t pay that well, although it is sufficient to support myself. However, it is super stable because I am at a state charter university. This job does provide a full benefits package (paid time off, etc). The biggest thing keeping me there is that the university would pay for my classes and I was recently accepted into the graduate school to start this upcoming fall semester. I could only take 1 class/semester while I am working there, so that’s not ideal, but hey, it’s a free education.
My question is- should I accept the new job and forfeit my benefits and acceptance to grad school for double the pay that I make now? I know start-up companies can be risky but I think that, since I am young, this could potentially be a good time to take some risk. Thoughts?

I hope this is enough detail but I will try to answer any follow-up questions as quickly as possible.",21Jul2020,1

742,"M21 who graduated from college last December, for reference. Normally when I am feeling down about something in my life and engage in negative self talk, I will often try to think of a past example to counteract what my thoughts are saying. If I was struggling with school, I could find an example of how I got a good grade on something I thought I would fail. If I was struggling with a job search, I could point to how I landed past jobs and internships. In a nutshell, having quantifiable proof against my thoughts is how I deal with recognizing them as irrational and harmful.

However, that line of reasoning doesn't work when discussing my love life, or rather my lack of one. With no past ""successes"", for lack of a better term, to reference to in order to prove the negative voices wrong, the negative voices run wild. Some common examples would be that I'll die alone and that I'm not good enough. I know the issue isn't with my looks or life choices, on paper I have just about everything someone could want. With every failed date/rejection though, I get more pessimistic and jaded about the prospect of my love life. I know people will say ""you're still young"" or ""just give it time"" but I can't quell the negative self talk because it's true. As of right now, I will die alone. As of right now, I'm not good enough because no one else thinks I am. It doesn't help to realize that their probably is someone out there for me, because as of now that's a hypothetical, whereas me dying alone is a fact (based on current trajectory of course). Any positive self talk just feels delusional, like I'm trying to convince myself of something that doesn't exist.

Any ideas on how to cope with this?",21Jul2020,1
743,"So a good friend of mine asked me for a huge favor. She has been looking for the Nintendo switch everywhere for the past month and it’s been out of stock at all the stores near her. She checked if it was in stock anywhere at a store near me and saw it was available. She asked me to pick one up for her and ship it to her which I agreed to. I told her the total amount and she venmoed me afterwards. I shipped the package through USPS at my local post office and it was supposed to arrive in 2 days. Long story short, the package keeps getting delayed and has been stuck in transit. She went to her local post office to try to locate the package but it seems like it is lost. The post office clerk told her that I put the wrong address and they can’t locate it even though I am 1,000% sure I wrote the right address. My friend asked me if it was insured but I do not believe it is. When I sent the package, the post office clerk did not ask me about insurance and I didn’t even question it. Of course, I feel terrible and just want the package to eventually arrive but I’m wondering what I should do about the cost. The value of the switch is like $300 plus tax and shipping. I mean technically I guess it’s my fault since I am the one who shipped it but I really blame the entire situation on USPS since I have never had problems with shipping packages in the past. Should I split the cost in half with her and just bite the bullet or pay the entire cost for her since there was no insurance and USPS will likely not locate the package??

745,"Had to repost because there are some new things and the old one had advice received tag.

I'm a 15 year old male and my sister is 16 years old. Recently we moved to a new house and got to pick our rooms, she picked one before me and told me to use the other one. I disagreed at first but realized my room was quieter and it wasn't in anyone's pathway (I'm an intovert and don't like people coming in my room). The way our house is that it has a room between the kitchen and the living room and two other rooms on the other side of the house (There's bathroom and stuff in the middle). My dad and I are currently in the two rooms. 

Just a while ago she came to my room and told me she wants to change rooms, she continued to explain that she couldn't study or read books in her room because of the noises of cars and people in the balcony (The kitchen, her room and the living room are facing the road, there's a balcony that surrounds the outside of her room and connects to the kitchen, there's two entrances to the balcony one through the room and one from the kitchen.) 

I then told her that I didn't want to change rooms because of the same reason.(I usually spend my time watching stuff online and am very concious about anyone else seeing what I watch.) But then she told me that I didn't even study so I didn't need to have a quiet room. I tried explaining to her that I don't want people in/around my room but she didn't care and told me that she would change the rooms.(We have the same furniture in our rooms so it's just moving the stuff in/on them.) 

I definitely don't want to be in her rooms but also her would reasoning seems more logical to outsiders (aka my dad and also I'm pretty sure he doesn't know about the situation yet.) How can I convince her or at least find a way around it? I'm just an introvert and bad at conflict so please no crazy suggestions.

Edit: My mother doesn't live in our house so she isn't involved. My sisters rooms windows open to the balcony and if you leave them open there's a lot of noise but if you close them it gets hot which is part of the problem.

Edit 2: Idk if this helps but: I had the exact problem in our old house and my father usually complained about how hot my room was.

Update: My father talked to my sister about it at dinner today and he said that if he looks at it in a neutral way he finds me right. She then asked me again, I said no and told her she could come to my room whenever she wants to study but she said that she couldn't come to my room everytime she wants to study for 2 years and started crying.

After about 5 minutes when she couldn't hear my dad told me that I should think this through in my head and decide whether it was worth hurting my sister, I told him I offered the best I could to her and didn't want to change rooms, he started to say something but cut himself off.

I definitely do not want to change rooms even if it means hurting her cause up until this point in my life everything happened the way she wanted it to and I couldn't even say a word to it. If it will make it 2 times as hard to study there for her then it will make it 2 times as hard to live there for me.

Like I said I don't want change rooms and stand up for myself. But the good side of me can't stand that she will be mad at me so I want to do this while hurting her as little as possible but still making my point. What should I tell her, what are some words that might comfort her even if they are filler? (Do note that I'm a introvert and we aren't as close as most siblings)

Some stuff that might be important: She doesn't want my dads room which is smaller. She said that I don't use most of my room while she uses all of it which is partly true. She said that she likes her room but doesn't want to use it because it is noisy, I CAN'T use the room because it is noisy.",21Jul2020,1

747,"I’m 26, a woman, and I can’t fucking sleep at 3am. 

I recently left a relationship that was in for less than a month old due to sexual pressure (it was my longest relationship at this point), lost someone who I thought was a friend over it. I lost a job three months ago, and with it, two work colleagues I liked. One that I thought was a friend, but obviously isn’t either due to them not keeping in touch. 

Got a new job a few days ago. I feel like their expectations are too high. They want me to understand the whole business processes, but there is a girl who’s been there for 10 months and is still asking questions on how to do her job 5-7 times a day. A woman who does know everything but has been with the company for over 10 years. How am I supposed to know anything or learning anything, when this girl is still trying to figure out just her role? And I’m in a whole new industry and barely understand the jargon they throw at me. Some of it I don’t know at all. 

I have abandonment issues from a lack of father in my life. Loneliness from childhood. 

I just, feel very alone right now. Stressed. Unable to sleep. Afraid. 

I really need advice. I want to stick out this job, see where it goes. I plan on going on a group Hike this weekend to try and make more friends. 

So I’m attempting to address some of these issues. But is it enough? I just, I’m really scared. And just, want good people in my life. And. Don’t want to be lonely anymore. Or just so stressed and freaked out. I hate being anxious, and was doing good steps to avoid it. Until I felt like this job, wanted too much from me. I hate unrealistic expectations. 

Also, I saw my old Job back up for over 33% more pay than I was earning and I’m annoyed at that too. Made me feel like I wasn’t valued there either.

750,"Hi! Here for some advice/thoughts/insight. It’s long so strap on in, or see the TLDR at the bottom. 
TRIGGER WARNING: toxic parents, racism, self harm, death

I have toxic parents. 
I’ve gotten closer to my mom since getting older and moving out, but she always ignored my obvious mental issues that should have been addressed (Like, in middle school I would get grounded for weeks at a time when she found out I was cutting.) She always disregarded all emotions and thoughts and feelings I’d ever have, telling me I was overreacting and I should just grow up. 
My dad, who, when I was a kid, was my best friend. He was always a bit more loving and understanding than  my mom. As I got older though, he got more and more toxic himself. He owned a bar so he was ALWAYS there, drinking with his buddies. He’d come home hammered if he came home at all. (And then he missed my wedding because he had to host Bike Night, drunkenly told my mom to drink drano and die, and is an overall an awful, racist, homophobic old man who told me he didn’t know if he should kill himself or kill me when I told him I was bisexual...just to name a few things.)

For a long time, I tried to be the good daughter and look past some of that enough to visit them and show them I do still love them, if from afar. 

I’m 26 now and live an hour away and I visit them the bare minimum. Especially since the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests, I’ve spoken to them even less. I’ve tried having the talks with them before on racism and they just won’t listen. They say they aren’t racist but they also say All Lives Matter. I’ve kind of lost more respect for them from a distance because I already know their thoughts on that matter. 

My mom has slowly become more and more disabled over the years (as her several physical diseases have progressed, she can’t walk very well, she shakes really bad pretty much all the time now, leaving her unable to do a lot of things.)
And now, I found out last week my dad is dying due to fairly progressed pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lungs—he needs an oxygen tank everywhere he goes now.)

I’ve worked so hard for so long not to care about my dad in particular. And now he’s dying. I have feelings of sadness but also of guilt because I’m not the amount of sad I feel I should be. I don’t want him to be sick because I don’t want to feel like I should be spending more time with him. I’m probably not going to spend any extra amount of time with him, and that leaves me feeling really guilty and almost evil. Especially when I think about how my family will probably notice that. I’ve done a pretty good job at hiding my disdain for my dad from the rest of the family. 

This knowledge of my dad being sick is new and maybe my feelings will change. I know that the death of a parent causes a lot of stages of emotions but this is what I’m feeling now. 

How the hell do you deal with a majorly toxic but dying parent? 

TLDR
I’m 26, live an hour away from my toxic parents who I visit every once in a while. I love them but my dad, especially, has done a LOT to hurt me. I found out only a few days ago he is sick and dying of pulmonary fibrosis, while my mom progressively becomes more and more physically disabled.

We were kinda awkward when we first knew each other. I had a crush on them that wasn’t reciprocated, which was completely fine. But they used to be mean spirited, rude and keep their distance from me, which I kinda felt some weird comfort in. Now They’re the complete opposite, getting close and being way too kind. I don’t really have a problem with that either other than that it feels weird because they used to make it clear how much they hated me.

It was normal at the start when I was trying really hard to just act normal when they always ended up in my field of vision and always were turned towards me, even if they had a conversation with someone else all across the room. They would always try to give me snacks I didn’t want, our eyes would meet a lot more than they did when I actually had feelings for them. Once when I took a break when I felt nauseous, they (out of litterally everyone) were the one to give me some water, but looked away when they did. Once we sat down having a conversation because there was nothing else to do at that moment, they just stood up and started to change pants out of nowhere, that was extremely weird because I wouldn’t even consider us friends yet. Then afterwards I got a LOT of weird looks. For example when we were tasked to throw a dance party for a group of kids, they put on a slow song, told everyone to pair up, paired up with another one of our coworkers and then proceeded to stare at me during the entire song when I just watched everyone dance.

760,"I am a lecturer at a university and a community college, and I have never felt so unappreciated in my life. I work so hard for these students, and it’s all for nothing.

Students are supposed to respond to a prompt and reply to 2 other students. In a recent discussion board post, I described a scenario about chimps helping other chimps in their groups, knowing that they’ll get a return favor. I explained some different perspectives about altruism and asked if *true altruism* exists in nature. A student complained that the question was click-baity. There’s been multiple times when a student has flat out said that the question I asked was stupid.

Students wildly misinterpret what I say and then publicly complain about my intelligence. A student asked me if I have ever been sexually assaulted before, and to describe it. I’ve obviously had multiple issues I’ve had to shut down and formally report to my department.

I generally struggle with collecting thoughts in a thorough way that allows me to speak fluently without interruption or without making a mistake. Of course, this has a ton of draw-backs which comes out almost as a lack of confidence or even a speech impediment. People constantly have to ask me ""What?"" over and over, and it's just inconvenient. I feel bad for them because they're tolerating my shitty speech and inability to just throw words out without a moment of hesitation.

I'll tend to repeat words I've already said on occasions or entirely mess up combining words entirely together frequent enough to where people point it out. 

I struggled a lot through school due to an inability to focus but still did well academically when I would study on my own terms, but outside of school and now in a working field, I do the same. General small tasks tend to get lots in my sea of thoughts, but larger projects tend to have me fixated or obsessed with finishing them.

I stumble a lot on my thought process or lose the word I'm looking for. I tend to have to search or it'll come to me after about a minute or so after we've stopped actively discussing it. I wish it wasn't a common thing but it happens basically every conversation.

I tend to think faster than I speak, so it comes out almost incoherent or jumbled, as if I'm hopping topics on a constant. I also tend to revisit topics constantly because of a lack of focus.

I bounce, a *lot*. Bounce, meaning that I shake my leg on a constant. Typically, when I'm at work or generally sitting, I'll bounce my leg for 6-14 hours straight without a break minus 10-15 minutes every few hours to walk around and zone out somewhere else.

I tend to also zone out entirely during conversations. If someone's talking to me, it's almost as if their voice fades and my internal dialogue takes over to discuss something I wasn't even remotely thinking about until that very second it pops up and get stuck in a 'loop' of thought process. Trying to solve issues that I don't have to face currently while someone else is talking is emotionally exhausting.

I'm fairly certain I have ADHD, but I need to confirm that elsewhere once I've got the ability to afford someone in the mental health field (therapist/psychiatrist).

Does anyone else have these issues? If so, how do you cope or deal with them? How can I help improve myself here?",21Jul2020,1
764,"My neighbor is a very sweet old man with a deceased wife. Ever since she died he has been spending a lot of money to upgrade the house, but I've only lived here a couple years. He has an inground pool that has become a swamp. I bought a dynatrap, which is a very effective mosquito trap, but they're still around pretty bad (a month later). He wants to get the pool filled in, but his daughters don't want anyone coming over to work on the house because of covid (understandably). He doesn't really care if I go over there and toss some mosquito dunks in there, but I don't want to keep buying them. Could I just pour a couple of cups of bleach in there to kill everything every once in a while? A gallon of bleach will cost me as much as a small pack of mosquito dunks, which I fear aren't effective enough for a large pool.

Lots of people would tease and bully C because she never really talked a lot but she talked to me and two other people + a few teachers. Now C was a nice girl I looked at her as a little sister because she was a grade below me I believe. We consider each other friends yet we don’t know much about each other. We don’t know our likes and dislikes.. we don’t have much in common unless it’s being misunderstood at school &amp; both being bullied in the past.

I get that she was there to comfort me when I had nobody but I feel like there’s no point in continuing our friendship since I graduated and that I feel like I can’t be there for her because I feel like we don’t have much of a connection.

I will be 26 in November. My parents are refusing to pay for my housing if I do not live with a Roomate. They said they have concerns about me living by myself. I’m not sure if it’s because of mental health issues or if they are afraid of me walking home late at night since I live in the city. They want me to live in the dorms on campus or apartments that you’d share a space with 3-6 other girls. I don’t want to live there because as I said I’m older than the average college student and am way past the partying stage of my younger years 18-21.

Me and my boyfriend are together just over a year now, and everything is kinda good but sometimes I feel really hurt by the things he does or says.  
At the beginning of the relationship I found out he was flirting and texting other women, the same day my nanny passed away he was planning to go out to one of them. I was so shocked and upset. I don't know why, but I ended up forgiving him. He would always talk about other girls, how big someones ass was, or saying ''imagine having a girl like that'' while I'm sitting right in front of him. I told him how I felt about it and he said he just wanted to ''make me jealous''.  
Even after a year the way he goes on about women in front of me is disgusting. I can't even go out with him and enjoy myself because whenever we go out, his head is turning all the time. I would be in the middle of a conversation with him and he'd just act like I'm not there as soon as he see's a girl that's attractive. He would gawk at them right in front of me for a good minute, smirking at them, nearly drooling! He wouldnt be listening to a thing I'm saying and then wonder why I get quiet. It's not like he's glancing, its just the fact he's staring at them trying to get their attention. I just find it so disrespectful, I'd never do that on him, it wouldn't even come to my head to do it.  
I just want a bit of advice, am I over reacting or am I in the right to feel this way? If so, what should I do? I just feel so unwanted when were out together. Only time I feel wanted is when were in private and he wants me to take my knickers off.",21Jul2020,1

So I (16F) have been friends with this guy, G (18M) for several years and we’ve both been in relationships until somewhat recently (I ended a 1-year and he ended a 2-year. Neither breakup was related to us- we didn’t dump someone for each other) and he asked me if I’d go to dinner with him. We’ve gone out to eat together many times as friends, but this time he specified that it was a date. We’re close friends and I like him, so that isn’t the problem. 

We’ve gone to hibachi restaurants before, which I enjoy, but this time he suggested Korean BBQ. I’ve never had it before and I’m a bit nervous as I don’t quite understand how it works. I think I understand the basic premise (you get meat, cook it, and eat it), but how exactly does it work? Do you pick the meat? Do they just bring you stuff? Is it buffet-style or do you pay per pound/oz? I’d really appreciate anyone that can help me as I’m already a bit nervous and don’t want to seem even more out of place.

782,"Hello all this post may be kind of hard to give advice too but any help is greatly appreciative 

Most of us have an internet friend that we never met, I have one who lives in a different state as me. I really do enjoy messaging him everyday and enjoy most of our conversations. However, he seems to be manipulating his girl friend in a terrible way. Here’s some quick back story:

A little over a year ago he cheated on his ex girl friend of three years and they broke up, he started to hook up with the girl he cheated with and then had feelings for her, she then got pregnant and dropped him claiming it was from another guy and that broke him. Ever since then he claims he “deserves” everything, despite the fact all the problems started with his actions. 

He then started to date a 17 year old about 3/4 months ago. (he was 21 and 17 was the age of consent) He was her first and he’s been very manipulative to her either begging for sex or making her feel guilty about not having sex with him. He’s afraid “she’s going to go off to college and cheat on him” so he’s obsessed about getting her pregnant so she “cant cheat on him”. He knows she doesn’t want a kid yet as now she’s 18 and knows she’s wants to finish university and start her life. He knows that he’s taking away her choice and is deliberately trying to get her pregnant despite lacking her consent and not caring what she thinks about this situation. I’ve tried to tell him to talk to her about it multiple times and he said “no, I deserve this” when I told him to talk to his parents he refused. He refuses to listen to any sort of logic I’ve told him, and he’s obsessed about nanking wants a kid now and wants to completely throw off the life plans of an 18 year old girl without talking to her about. All of this “so she doesn’t cheat on him” How do I do anything to stop him?

Edit: Forgot to add this info: He said if she tries to get rid of the baby he’s going to convince her to keep the baby by question he love of him. Considering she’s never had another boy friend or someone she could very well be convinced to keep a baby she doesn’t want to have. He’s started multiple times he’ll convince her and say whatever it takes in order for her to have this baby.",21Jul2020,2

786,"Ever since I was around 12 my sister would have me babysit her kid. I am 18 now and she has 3 boys. ( 2, 5 and 11) the 2 year old isn't potty trained and screams for his mom the entire time i watch him. The 5 year old behaves like any normal boy does at that age and the 11 year old has several medical and mental issues including me having to feed him through a tube all while he hits, scratches and bites me. He will also be knocking the liquid he eats all over the place and fights ne the entire time. If he gets upset enough he will force himself to puke all over me and the furniture. I don't blame him and I have no anger towards him. Its just si difficult for me to handle and after doing this for so many years I can't take watching the kids anymore. They are all very sweet, nice boys and I love my nephews. Its just so much to be responsible for the. For hours at a time. With having to change an 11 year olds diaper at least once per hour, and the 2 year old plus cleaning up the puke just turns into me gagging or puking. I am 20 weeks pregnant rn and my morning sickness is pretty bad so I just can't handle doing this. 

Another factor is I am barely being paid. If lets say I have the 3 kids and the dog for 6 hours I am given $20. My sister is not low on money by any means and is easily able to afford her lifestyle as a stay at home mom. Money is only a small factor at the moment. 

Each time she asks me to babysit and I say that I can't she starts interrogating me as to why I can't. If its because I have my actual job she just gets all cold. Of i have lets say plans with freinds or any sory of appointment she will outright freak out at me or hint out that she thinks I should cancel my plans to watch her kids. And when I do agree on occasion its something like watching them while she goes to get groceries or get lunch with a freind and I am only planning on being with the kids 2 hours at the most. 5 hours later I'm still at her house. Several times a week she has been asking me to watch her kids now and I've been having to resort to making things up but she's caught me a few times by showing up to my house to see if I'm really not home. I don't feel good about lying. 

I just don't know if I should keep lying about my plans or just be honest with her. Each time I've been honest with her she has freaked out at me then cries to mh dad who threatens to kick me out if I don't watch her kids so then I have to.

I know this is a lot but if anyone has advice, I'd appreciate it.",21Jul2020,2

793," 

So I have a best friend who is quite loud and popular and for last halloween she used makeup to create cuts all over face. She also wore black dress and had painted her entire ace white. I did not think much of it but it was just a costume. But now she goes out in short shorts and short sleeves and I noticed that she fakes cuts by using SFX makeup and it actually looks really realistic and gory. She gets weird stares from people when we are out in public but she does not seem to mind. Drawing these marks on her body is like another step to her daily makeup routine at this point.

One day I confronted her about them and she told me that she just does it for ""fashion"". I asked her if she had ever considered doing anything and she said no and that she never has. She does not think of it as a big deal, one of our other friends said that it is disrespectful but she does not understand why.

She does not wear any type of gothic fashion and wears girly clothes (not that this matters) but she cannot leave the house without any fake cuts. One day she had no time to do her makeup as she had to be somewhere so he just stuck multiple plasters all over her arms.

This does not personally effect me, because I do not suffer from any mental illnesses, nor have I ever self harmed and I am certain I never will, I just don't know what to do with her? Maybe she needs help?

I have a feeling that she wants to herself but is unable to due to whatever reason, I know how badly she is crying for help. But I don't know if she is just taking the piss out of self-harm.  She keeps on pushing me away and I miss her so bad, she wasn't like this before. There is a part of me that thinks that she is just attention seeking but I still worry about her.",21Jul2020,8

When I try talking to them they don't pay attention or cut me off to talk to someone else. They don't care if I don't eat all day. Me and my mom argue sometimes or we don't talk. She usually has an attitude and argues with me about little things when I start to get slightly better mental health wise and when I seem like im going crazy she'll stop and try to talk to me but at this point i shut her out. 

My dad usually doesn't talk much to me. He usually has an attitude and is super strict telling me (20F) to be home at 9 or something like that. When he calls it's ""come home now"" no hi no what's up. Or if I try to stay out later he tells me he won't move his car out the driveway and for me to stay out all night looking for parking. He doesn't care when I show him my hobbies, or try to talk to him and it makes me feel awkward. He also is always more aggressively toned and annoyed with me. 

Then my oldest sister (who is the epitome of miserable mommy's girl) keeps staying for weeks and it makes me uncomfortable because she watches my every move and talks shit with my mom about everyone in the house. 
They're the type of people you could only talk to if you have someone to talk about, money, or something they could brag about. 

My other siblings are fine. We don't have deep talks but we hang out. My brother buys me food and we play video games or go places. 

I've been feeling really miserable, depressed, and stressed out being here because now even when they try to talk nicely (my parents and oldest sibling) I feel like I can't accept it and I have to be on defense mode because they talk a lot of shit (including making jokes about how much I eat even though I've been struggling to eat properly for months). 

My boyfriend wants me to move in with his family or for us to get an apartment, but I'm just scared to leave this house. My therapist even told me to leave. But even though they constantly hurt me, I'm scared to hurt them and make them upset. I want to leave, but I'm terrified and I don't know what to do.",21Jul2020,1
804,"My parents are conservative and oblivious on LGBTQ+.

806,"***tl:dr at the bottom. 

I'll start with saying, that I rent with my boyfriend in a ~52m²/560sqft flat, which for German standard is quite a nice place for just a young couple without kids. May not seem like this to Americans, but among people my age here it's considered really nice size. 
The block was built just about 2 years ago, so it's basically brand new, We have 1km/0,6mil to a city center, and 50m/16ft to a metro station. We also have a cozy, reasonable size balcony.

We didn't just ""settle"" for that one. We looked for something like this, we were lucky to lay our hands on that one, and we pay quite some money for that standard. We didn't just look for anything, we looked for a place that could be our home, and we want to feel like this in here.

The first issue with our neighbor was that he would leave his balcony light turned on all night long (and day too, for all it matters), it's extra annoying since our balconies are touching, and are only separated by milk colored glass (that doesn't even touch the wall), and since our bedroom is 90° to that light it's constantly bright in our bedroom, because our white shades aren't good enough. (I'll post photos of how it looks like)

After a couple of times I approached my neighbor and told him that it would be nice if he turned the lights off. That's when he told me that he is renting this flat for Airbnb, so it's not him, but his guests that turn that light on, but he said he obviously doesn't want them to do that, so he'll turn the main plugs responsible for electricity on the balcony off. 

It didn't work. I guess guests are crafty enough to turn the plugs back on, because the neighbor actually approached me once on the staircase asking if the light is better now, and he was truly shocked when I said that nothing changed.

But light isn't the only issue. People who rent that flat are obviously on holidays and they act like it. Loud music, loud TV all night long, smoking weed constantly on the balcony (it's not even legal) smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, grilling on the balcony, having VERY loud conversations on the balcony... Sometimes I know how old these people are and what they do for a living, because I have to listen to their phone conversations for hours. 

Also, all of them seem to LOVE to have a sneak peek at my flat by looking around the glass wall. As I mentioned my bedroom is 90° to that, so my boyfriend while sitting by his desk sees somebody's head looking at our place about every second week.. and that's only what he notices.

To get to our flat you gotta walk on kind of a balcony as well, I guess it's similar to motels in USA (at least in movies), and my kitchen's windows are on this side, and I constantly see someone looking into our place even though they have to jump or bend, because we have shades that usually cover at least part of the window... I also can never open the windows wide open, because I can't trust these people. I'm paranoid about someone climbing over to our balcony, breaking the door and killing me in my sleep, or breaking the kitchen window and basically doing the same... I know that is ridiculous, but I can't get these thoughts our of my head. Except from that I am also worried that one day drunk guests will find it funny to destroy something from my balcony, and I have there 5 hanging pots, 2 olive trees, small grill, chairs and table... I'm mostly worried for plants, since it's so easy to kill them with just a spray.

All of my other neighbors are completely normal. Once a couple of weeks someone throws a party on Saturday, but the music never plays after midnight, my neighbor from the downstairs smokes, but I don't even care, since that's the only flaw, so I just got used to it, but I can't get used to different thing that happens every couple of days in the flat next door. For three days it's weed, then for a week it's music, then for two days it's grill, then it's music and light, then something else again... 

I lost my shit for the first time three days ago. I was laying in bed around 6pm, chilling, but I kept hearing conversations. I thought it maybe comes from the balcony, but it didn't. I tried to ignore it, but every couple of minutes someone would start laughing loud or people would talk all at once, so it would get really loud. After trying to rest for 30min/1h I just gave up. I dressed up, and went to the kitchen, where the voices were the loudest. I pulled the shades up and I saw somebody's ass on my window sill. I lost it. I opened the front door with an impact and saw a person sitting RIGHT IN FRONT of my door on the ground, and about 7 other people (age 20/30) sitting all around the place, drinking beer and having fun. I just screamed at them asking if they don't have enough space in their apartment, because some people want to rest in their own flats, and that not everyone is on holidays. They all apologizes and went back to the flat (to the balcony to be specific, so I still could hear them, but at least they weren't sitting on my window sill, so I'm fine). I apologized to them later, and explained, that it's not as much about them, as just me losing it, since I have to handle different guests all the time, and they all were understanding, but it still felt shit to snap like this, and I know I will only lose it more often from now.

I don't know what to do with it. If I tell our landlord and he'll do something with it, the neighbor will certainly know it was me, because he knows I was annoyed by the lights, I don't want enemies. I don't even know if what he does is allowed or not, so I'll just seem like a damn snitch and my landlord will hate me.

***tl;dr I live in a good, comfy flat that I pay quite a lot for. My neighbor has put his flat on Airbnb, so I have random ""neighbors"" every couple of days, and they all behave bad, because they're on holidays, and they don't have to consider other people in the block. Some smoke cigarettes, some weed, some listen to loud music/TV, have constantly a grill, sit on my window's sill, look into my apartment, and leave the light on the balcony turned on for 24h long, which makes sleeping hard, because I don't have good shades, and my bedroom is 90° to that light. I am also scared for my security, and I'm worried that one day someone will just destroy something on my balcony or break in...
I don't know what to do, because I already once approached the neighbor so if I contact the landlord, it will be obvious that I was the one who called, and on top of that I'm not sure if it's even unallowed, so the landlord will just think I'm an annoying snitch.",21Jul2020,1

808,"Hey guys, 

So a little context here, when I was about 10 years old, one of my friends ruined my innocence by introducing me to porn. At the time, I was horrified and didn't watch any for about a month or two until I got pressured by my friends. Once I did watch it, I got curious and continued to watch for about a year then I stopped because I moved away and didn't have my friends to pressure me to watch it. 

Then Once I turned 15, I got curious and restarted to watch porn and along the way, I learned to pleasure myself while watching it. Of course there would be times where I would stop watching porn for about 5 or 6 months and suddenly get a huge urge to restart watching it. 

Now, I about 20 and I haven't watched porn or masturbated for about 3-4 months and I suddenly got a urge to watch it. I have tried to distract myself with stuff like, play games, to draw, to learn to cook and do many other things, but at the end of the day, I suddenly get the urge to watch porn. 

The main reason I want to stop is because whenever I am done, I suddenly get massively depressed and feel like shit and start to hate myself. So I need a little help here. 

What tips can you give me to stop watching porn. 

Thanks for your help in advance.",21Jul2020,2

811,"2020 graduate here (lucky me). Basically, I was going to a university for fine arts but can’t afford it, so I’m going to my local community college. 

They have a cosmetology certification program that’s 2 semesters. In high school, a few girls did it as dual credit and graduated with their certificates. I wanted to do it but my parents didn’t think I actually wanted to do it. I heavily considered it this year but again decided to go for fine arts. However, now that I’m back at square one, I’m considering just getting my certification. There seems to be a focus on hair and nails— I often like to cut and dye my own hair (I literally did it a few days ago) and I’m bad at painting my own nails but I got acrylics done once and I was super fascinated by it. 

My only issue is that I’ve heard people talk about chemistry stuff and I’m not very good at science or math (by that I mean I get Bs instead of As). My parents also don’t want me to “settle” for cosmetology but I also think doing art for a living is a highway straight to complete burnout which I already have an issue with (been trying to promote myself and make money off of it). Also, I “settled” for art— I wanted to be a fashion designer, but people were generally unsupportive (for good reason I think) and the field is very competitive and hard to get anywhere and 50% of graduates quit after 5 years.

815,"Ive had a good friend group for the past few years and i kind of created the group myself by bringing these people together. Due to the past few months ive been going through very difficult times, which caused me to be more easily annoyed to my friends or not acting right to my friends. Im starting to think im a bad person and i deserve this. 
The last one to join the group i felt very shy around because shes very popular and has embarrassed me in the past, at birthday i talked to my close friend about how sometimes i think she hates me and i used the fact that she shared her weed with other people but not me as an example, in our groupchat ive been catty to one girl in particular, and me and my closest friend joke around with eachother and I call her a b word and but its all jokes and she laughs and id never make her feel actually uncomfortable, but the rest of the girls take it personally offensive. I guess little things like that. 
I try to think about it but im not sure what exactly it was. But suddenly everyone started ignoring me except for my closest friend. And stopped inviting me to things, one friend decided to send me a long text to unfriend me because my jokes go too far and i can be rude, i accepted it and then sent a long apology to the friend who i was catty to in the groupchat and she never responded. 
then i heard they said awful things about me behind my back and talked about how they cant be my friend. I heard this all from my closest friend, but what hurt most is that she told me my other closest friend decided like the rest of the girls that im awful and she cant be my friend anymore. This really surprised us because shes been with me through years and years and we’ve grown together. 
Ive sent her a long paragraph about how i was confused and wanted to know whats wrong and days later she sent a long paragraph explaining that she thought i made her feel unsafe and that she thinks i steal from people in the friend group which i have no idea where that came from other than because i would steal from wal-mart, and saying i balantly do things to make her or other people upset then laugh at them when they’re uncomfortable. 
Hearing this hurt so much from my friend for years who ive had endless life experiences with. I still cant believe it because im just so shocked. Before i knew she was mad at me i told her i was going through a really hard time and really needed someone to talk to and i wanted to hang out and she told others she thought i was trying to manipulate her. With all my friends except one ignoring me i feel socially obsolete and cant go anywhere and stay in bed all the time. 
Im from a very small town where friend groups dont change very much and everyone knows everyone. Ive never felt so alone and i cant decide if i brought this on myself.

I should start off by saying, i’ve never been to a therapist, psychiatrist or any sort of doctor. I’ve talked to my parents multiple times and they’ve just never been receptive to my desire for help. But let’s get  to the actual post..

I’m a 17 year old HS graduate this year, starting school in the fall. I am an extremely socially awkward dude that has only a few friends. This social awkwardness began predominantly in my freshman year as a result of being dropped by a group of people that I considered friends at the time. I believe as a result of this, I have a very difficult time keeping in touch with people i consider my friends and making plans. Some days i’ll be willing to go out and just spend time with them and other days I’ll ignore texts and calls hoping that they’ll leave me alone. This habit makes me feel pretty shitty but I don’t know how to work around it. 

Another big problem I have is that I am at a loss of motivation for pretty much everything. I no longer have any desire to work, spend time with family, take care of my pets. Nothing. I don’t consider myself suicidal, I’ve had suicidal thoughts in the past but never to the extent of self harm. So it’s not like I wanna die, I just have no motivation to live anymore. 

So that’s basically it. I spend my days pretty much just smoking and playing video games. I really wanna break these habits, especially with going away to school in the fall. Any and all advice on what’s wrong with my or how to break these habits is greatly appreciated. If there are any questions i’ll be happy to answer them. Thank you.",21Jul2020,1

822,"So I (F/20) have been dating my boyfriend (M/19) for about 2 years now but have been best friends for about 7. 

Little info on our relationship: I'm the only one with a job, I've worked full time since I was 14, he has never had a job. I didnt work because I had to, my family has money my dad was just very big into working for what you get so it was either if I wanted money from my parents then I would have to cut wood or help out with the construction company so I just chose to find a job. 

His parents just bought him everything then would manipulate him to tend to their every need and would never provide transportation to a job for him.(we live out in the country. Cant walk anywhere and no public transit. He did have dirtbikes but his dad still to this day controls the keys) 

We both have our license but I'm the only one with a legal car. He bought a car but never got it registered and his parents too the keys to it. I moved out of my parents house on my 18th birthday and he still technically lives at home. His parents are actually insane and constantly pick fights for no reason and take our stuff. Mostly our bongs and weed (we live In canada its legal) that we used to leave in his grandmothers garage. She is a sweetheart and let us hangout in there and keep it in there. She liked having us around. 

His mom is an alcoholic who refuses to admit it and also abused her sleeping medication. His dad just doesnt yall and follows everything his mom says. He fucks with us a lot to tho. My family on the other hand is amazing. We are very tight nit and would do anything for each other. My father has went to jail in the past for doing things to people who have messed with our family. Family is like my main thing in life, without family theres nothin which is why I cant even wrap my mind around his family most days. My parents are also like 15 years younger then his. 

Anyways, the situation: one day we went to get food and came back to the garage and all of our stuff was gone (about $400 worth of stuff) and his parents were sitting there with waiting for us. They said that there was a scratch on the side of the lawnmower and that they took everything as payment. Obviously we were like no give us our stuff back and it escalated to my boyfriend and his mom screaming at each other and her starting to hit him which has happened in the past. His dad was literally on the outside of the door holding it shut so my boyfriend could not get out. I was in my car at this point cuz when they started yelling I left so I wasnt in the middle of it, when I saw this I jumped out of my car and accidentally locked my keys in my car (dumb I know but I was panicking). 

This is when I got involved and his mom turned her wrath on me. We were screaming at each other but I was basically just calling her a crazy bitch and telling her to give us our stuff back. We eventually found most of it cuz there not that smart but they still have his car keys and wallet and wont let him go back for any of his clothes. I had to call my dad to come unlock my car and his mom was saying she was gonna smash my windows out if I didnt get my car off the property. My dad heard this and warned her that If there was anything done to my car she'd have to answer to him. Finally my dad came and got my car unlocked and we got the hell outta there. 

We never went back for everything else they took and he hasn't even went back for his car. So it's been 2 weeks of him staying at my house literally living out of 2 pairs of jeans. I had to get him a toothbrush and everything. He literally has nothing. A couple days ago on facebook I shared a article about a couple cutting their mother in law put of their life, it didnt have anything to do with her at all and I didnt even make a post is just shared it cuz it was a good article. I was up this morning and she made a FAKE facebook profile to comment this on it. 

""Im not your mother-in-law nor will I ever be your mother-in-law you piece of trash. That's right you are trash and the sooner that my son sees that the better he will be. I NEVER spoke to my mother-in-law EVER the way you spoke to me the day you poured beer all over our $800 lawn mower and pulled the cord out of it. You are garbage and have no family for my son to be a part of. I guess you forget when you got 2 inches from my face and told me i was a fucking cunt for taking your filthy bong out of MY mother's garage after you and Malcolm and those stoners and losers you call friends trashed our only lawnmower. Stay the hell away from me and OUR family. You might want to look that word family up sweetie because you have no idea what a family is.""

824,"Hello! My problem is pretty much described in the title. Overall, I am satisfied with myself. I mean, I am proud of what I have done until now and I am satisfied that I have the will and determination to evolve and become a better person every day. I am doing well in the professional life (university) until now and I'm ready to work hard in order to maintain my success. I have some great hobbies and passions and I'm glad that I have the possibility to practice them and learn more things about what interests me. When I am with my friends, I am quite confident and I feel good about myself. So, overall, I am a happy individual I could say. (apart from the stress and some insecurities/fear of the unknown)

However, there are times when I just feel inferior to other people for no reason. I mean, today I messaged a girl for the first time (we were aquainted, but didn't know each other very well), but she was not so eager to talk to me. Well, it could be because she was in a holiday at the seaside, so I can understand. I don't feel bad or sad because of that, but here is the problem: I saw a instagram story with her and some of her friends and there was a guy (which is considered a cool guy overall. He is quite known among people my age). I know he isn't her boyfriend or something like that, but I just felt inferior in that moment. I thought something like: ""Wow, she went in a holiday with that cool dude. He must be better than me in some way"". I know that it isn't really true. Just because he is popular or taller or looks better, it doesn't mean that he's better than me. But I just get anxious and feel inferior. I was wondering if you guys could help me with some advice to get rid of this ""toxic habit"".

PS: This is not the only situation that my feeling of inferiority appears. Another example is: if I hear one of my colleagues (who is considered cool among students) opinion and if he uses fancy words or has a really sofisticated opinion, I just feel like he's better than me. I feel like my opinion would be ""worse"" than his somehow. It's an awful feeling because, like I said, I am proud of myself overall, but I often have trouble believing in myself.

I’m sure some people feel that it’s a motivation to keep working hard, but I feel like it could be a huge struggle in the moment to see your body becoming disproportionate and awkward looking until you reach your target weight. Was that a struggle for you and how did you hype yourself up during?

6. Do people treat you differently during and after? I myself am guilty of being negatively jealous of people around me losing weight because I wish it were me instead, but have never said anything about it. Do you have people in your life that aren’t afraid to say those things to you, and how do you cope?

7. Relating to 6, are you treated better as a smaller person? Do you feel that after losing weight you’ve received more positive attention from strangers?

8. Do you have any advice for overcoming or coping with body dysmorphia and realizing that you aren’t as big as you used to be?

9. How do you hold yourself accountable and stick to the diet and exercise changes? My biggest struggle is getting started and staying on track, any advice is welcome. 

10. Does your sex life change, negative or positive? Does your partner or hookup care about any loose skin?

11. Is it possible for the tightness or elasticity of your vagina to change when you lose weight? Or your ability to get wet and finish?

12. What do you do if you reach your target weight and don’t like the way you look? What if you preferred your larger self to your smaller self?

13. How does extreme weight loss affect tattoos? do they shrink or become distorted at all?

14. Is it easier to shave as the surface area decreases?

15. This one is very specific, but do your ankles become smaller? I feel like my ankles are big but the bone and tendon seem to be the same size, so I worry that my ankles will stay big as my legs get smaller and then it will look weird. 

16. Do you have any areas of your body that seemed to not change or lose weight? Where, and does it bother you/seem disproportionate?

17. For those who have had their excess skin removed, are you satisfied with the surgery outcome? I’ve been finding that most surgeries make the body look very boxy and shapeless, which has scared me away from it. Do you think it depends on the surgeon, or is that just the way it comes out regardless?

18. Does extreme weight loss have any effect on your hair, positive or negative? Body hair, positive or negative?

19. Do you feel colder more often? Does it become harder for you to warm up? Do you sweat less often?

20. What tips did you learn along the way that made it easier that you wish you would have known from the beginning, if any? 

For context, I am 19, overall healthy, 230lbs with a goal of 160lbs, but ultimately looking for a preferred appearance rather than number on the scale. My biggest insecurity is my stomach, which holds the majority of my weight, so a smaller stomach (but not flat!) would be my biggest accomplishment. I think my weight derives from large portions and frequent grazing. 

If any of these questions do not pertain to you or you are uncomfortable answering, feel free to skip them! Thank you all so much and I look forward to the feedback (:

829,"Recently within online communities the term 'gaslighting' has become very common. After doing a little bit of research I feel like this may be what my mum does to me. 

For context; me and my mum have a very on and off relationship but within the last year I have found her very childish and her behaviour difficult to deal with as well as this we are no longer close. This is due to a lack of trust within her and me, so nowadays she knows very little about what's going on in my life. I have become more emotionally mature and realised a lot of the causes of my anger, however I still have a way to go. The issue with my age (f16) is that its very hard to distinguish between teenage angst and flair ups with parents and actual issues, which is why I'm writing this. I have already spoken to her about not acting the victim everytime we fight and some of the issues i've had in the past but unlike my dad, who I spoke with separately upon the harmful things he's said (and vice versa), she seems to have avoided accountability.

Some examples of her behaviour is; lying in arguments (changing half way through or about situations e.g she told me I didn't need to pay her back straight away but holding it against me at a later date), bringing up very unrelated points in arguments (e.g u owe me money when we disagreed about my going on plans which is also sensitive for me because I got a job as she guilted me every time), crying after every single argument, telling me 'I'm only nice to her when i want something', being made to feel like my emotions are stupid and irrational and never apologising after out of line behaviour.

I have become very unsympathetic and I see parts of my dad slipping in, e.g lack of sensitivity and laughing when she cries, and it scares me that I might carry on and use this behaviour on other people within my future. It has also put me off having kids within the future. It has also become a point of jealousy for other people's relationships with their parents, which is naive within itself.

831,"So I’ve told my parents (divorced) that I’m planning on moving to another state after college. I’ve told them this for 4 years. Today my mom took me out for lunch and I told her one of my friends wants to move to Florida with me. She completely lost it. Saying stuff like “good luck there have a good life”, “I don’t know why you can’t wait to get away from me”, and that I “don’t appreciate anything”. (Even tho I always say thank you at least twice for ANYTHING from ANYONE)

To her the main worry is coronavirus. She’s been worried and clingy to me my whole life since I’m an only child. But I also have epilepsy and can die suddenly for no reason at all at anytime. 

Wouldn’t a rational parent worry but yet be happy they are moving and starting their life?

Basically I feel like s*** and guilty. Idk if she’s doing this on purpose and I’m just paranoid...or if I just am not a good son for wanting to pick up and start life somewhere else.

832,"My wife and I live in an apartment with our 4 year old son. Our neighbor who lives down the block in her house with her children’s father, have 2 girls ages 7 and 4. Our son and their girls play together often. We usually talk together.

One time when we were out there with the children playing, the mother of the two girls had her friend over. She seemed nice and all and we all were talking just shooting the breeze while the children played.

Last night my wife received a series of text messages from the girls mother saying something to the effect that I told my wife to unfriend her from Facebook and that my wife told me about how she (the girls mother) grabbed her oldest daughter rather hard to avoid her stepping in dog poo. Adding that I made her uncomfortable one time while I was supposedly staring at her after she asked me if our son and I were going to hang outside.

The mother of the two girls is animatedly saying that’s she’s been friends with her friend for 30 years and she wouldn’t lie.

Firstly my wife said nothing to me. My wife doesn’t even recollect seeing that.

Secondly my wife’s Facebook account is her own, I don’t tell her who to friend or unfriend. We do have an agreement as to who not to friend (these consist of ex’s and people who we don’t want to share our business with).

I know I answered her saying that we are going to hang and play. She obviously didn’t hear me the 2 times I said it to her.

The mother of the two girls friend is saying she heard me say to my wife that she should unfriend her. Which is a ridiculous, I never said such a thing.

As for the other two things, I don’t even know how to respond.

My wife was upset over this.

The way it was left was open ended with the mother of the girls saying if you want me to keep to myself that’s fine but of course our children can play together.

I’m at a loss about how to handle this. It all feels manipulative.

We really don’t know these people. Our children have been playing together for months now and we are obviously supervising our son when he is out there. I’m not sure if we can even rectify this situation or if we even should. 

Any advice would be helpful. Sorry if this seems all over the place.",21Jul2020,2
833,"My sister was married to a guy for about 10 years and has two kids with him. The marriage was always an unhappy one. He wasnt much of a husband or a father. In fact, he expected her to do EVERYTHING around the house because he was ""working"". He has a full time job, but he uses it as an excuse to literally not do anything else (like groceries, picking up and dropping off the kids to school, putting gas/petrol in the car, getting the car serviced, calling the handyman, the list goes on). Like, if left to him, it will take him 6 months (optimistically speaking) to change a light bulb, because he is ""working"".

&amp;#x200B;

My sister had been lonely for 10 years and she met some she started getting feelings for. She felt horribly guilty and actually started going into depression and started seeing a therapist. The therapist, after asking her a series of questions about her life, helped her see that her husband is in the autistic spectrum. Never affectionate, always obsessed about obsessing about work, lack of empathy, no interest in sex, obsessed with saving every (opened and unopened) mail from a hundred years ago, obsessed with saving every tube of toothpaste ever used by them, etc. The therapist made her realize that it is her life and if she doesnt want to spend the rest of her life being lonely and depressed, she needs to leave him. After a lot of emotional turmoil she did manage to leave him (he was too busy working to try and save the marriage). She is now divorced and living with a nice guy. The husband barely sees the kids ( one day a week) and even offered to pay her a lump sum child support so he wouldnt really have to deal with them (seeing as he is so busy with work).

&amp;#x200B;

But I see that my sister is not fully free. She feels immense guilt. She feels like he was her third child and keeps feeling bad about him. If she cooks a nice meal, she feels bad that her ex is not getting to eat it. If she plans a trip, she feels bad that her ex would have enjoyed the trip. If she buys a dessert he likes, she feels guilty that she is not sharing it with him, the list goes on. I dont know how to help her out of this. I understand he was not well, but she had to choose herself, but now she is stuck in this bad place where she cannot allow herself to be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

Her ex isnt the type of person who will meet someone and move on and be happy. He takes pleasure in being unhappy (I dont know how else to explain it, that is the one thing I remember most about him. The thing that seemed to give him most pleasure was complaining about how miserable/busy he was with all the work he had to do). He hates going out. So she sees him every week when dropping the kids off and feels immensely guilty. Nothing I say seems to help. How do I help her? Please serious replies only. Thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  I did ask about the therapist, but she had stopped going to the therapist after she figured out that she needed to get out. And now due to covid she cant go see the therapist in person, also she cant talk to the therapist on the phone, given her new guy is home all the time due to all the work from home and she doesnt want him to know she is sad about her ex in a non sexual way. So no, she is not getting any help. Also, her and I, we live in different continents, so visiting often is not an option either, specially now. So all I do is worry about her and the kids. She mentioned last time that her older kid is a lot like her dad, very closed off and unemotional. So she worries about that too. Seems like an impossible situation and I dont know how to help her, hence I turned to reddit. This is my first post! ",21Jul2020,3

835,"My parents were to divorce when I was 10-14 (currently 26). My dad had another woman, got her pregnant, got a half sister that lives with her mother, she also has a ""real"" brother the same age as me but he has moved away for a couple of years, I had a good relationship with the mom, I used to consider her my mother back when I was 10-14. I got to see her mom again last year and she was super friendly but she saw me high and I mentioned my drug problem because of alcohol thinking.

At some point last year, she wanted to establish relationship with my dad and I wanted to know her and see her, I carried her as a baby. 

I don't know if should try re-establishing relationship. She blocked me from whatsapp, but that was because my father instructed her after an incident I had with him. Maybe she hates me too.

We went to eat to restaurants after school with my father (OUR father) and I was drunk and high the whole times, I never ate anything. She as a kid must have noticed I have substance and alcohol problems, I remember I saw her scared once because I was high one of the times we went to eat out with and she asked my dad why I was always sleepy. Plus I accidentally told her mother and probably her mother told her to be wary of me. She showed no interest in knowing me much, rarely asked me questions.

836,"So I’m a rising Junior in high school, and during this quarantine time my parents want me to be “productive”, which I think I am (learning Python coding language, preparing for the SAT and ACT, Visiting the Library often and reading, and learning some new things on my Guitar). My parents are not really home all day since they work, it is just me and my two older siblings and we all do our work mostly as my middle brother is taking summer classes for his school and my eldest sister is doing an internship. 

Anyway, when our parents come home, we are usually finished with our work, (around 5) and basically bored, and this is the time that I usually exercise and do other stuff. By the time I am finished with everything, it’s usually 6PM, we eat dinner, then 6:30. My siblings usually spend the rest of the day in their rooms doing things after dinner is over, (IDK what), so I am just left all alone with my Mom, but she usually watches a movie or is on her phone watching something, so everybody is relaxing. 

This the ideal time for me to hop on my PC and go play with friends, but my parents won’t allow me. They only let me get on at 9PM and then I have to be off by 11PM, and sometimes that time gets cut short because my parents want me to watch movies or hang out with them, because my dad works really late, so that’s when he gets home. It does annoy me though, because my parents always interrupt my time, and my siblings get to stay in their rooms ALL DAY. But even though I paid for my PC, the monitor, and everything in that setup, they still put time limits and get mad when I try to argue about why they get to put restrictions on something with my OWN money. 

I try to ask them to let me do whatever I want when I finish all my work for the day, so that way I can at least spend time with my friends and then spend time with my family at night, but they always say stuff like, “You don’t need to be playing that game all the time”, and when I say that I barely even play, they say stuff like, “Oh so now you are talking back to me?”, and I never get to fairly reason with them. And it’s not like they have a thing against everything I do that’s not “productive”, it’s just gaming, because I can mindlessly binge a whole Netflix series for 6-7 hours and my parents wouldn’t say anything, but when I’m on the game at  11:07, they get mad and ground me for a week. (I’m not kidding they actually took away my PC for a week). 

I’m not asking for sympathy or anything, I just want to know how to approach my parents with this topic, and be able to reason with them fairly without them getting mad.",21Jul2020,2

843,"Edit: Just wanted to add our ages, I'm F21, my brother is M30. Parents in Late 50's.

This all happened last night, I'm still reeling from the shock of it all. I'll try to be concise but it's gonna be a long post because I have to contextualize everything that happened.

My brother is the oldest of us five siblings. Right now our other three sibs are living overseas, only the two of us are at home with parents. My brother actually lives and works in Canada but he came to visit my parents and got stuck here (Saudi Arabia) due to COVID. My brother's relationship with our parents has always been rocky due to a number of factors. My dad had major anger issues when he was younger and mostly took it out on my brother. By the time I came along, dad had mellowed out quite a bit but my brother always kept him at a distance. This is was fine before because dad was working and brother moved out after college but now that they're stuck under the same roof, things have been heating up.

According to my Mom, my brother was a very sensitive child. He was the kind of kid who would cry at the movies, he would often bring in stray cats to feed them. He wasn't violent at all, never got in fights at school etc. My dad is a very typical old-school guy. He always wanted to ""toughen-up"" my brother, he used to slap him around a lot when he was little (which my dad now admits was wrong but never said it to my brother or apologized to him).

As a way for my brother to ""grow-up"". Dad admitted him to a ""Quran School"", these used to be very common in the 90's where kids would attend for 12-14 hours a day in order to memorize the Quran along with other studies. Beatings and other forms of corporal punishment was a central part of these schools. My brother attended that school for four-years between the ages of 10-14.

After graduating from Quran school, my brother started attending a regular highschool but he became sullen and withdrawn. He stopped watching cartoons (used to be a big disney fan) and got interested in poetry and drawing. Since drawing is haram, my dad used to tear up his sketches and told him to stop writing poetry. All of this, I got from my Mom since I was too young at the time.

Fast forward to 10 years ago when my brother got his first girlfriend. He obviously hid it from our parents but unfortunately he was going to college in Canada and his GF was staying here. They were in a LD relationship for four years. They planned on getting married after my brother graduated. When he brought all this to my parent's attention, at first they were quite apprehensive because ""Love-marriages"" are still frowned upon in our culture. To my parents' credit, they did talk to his GF's parents but it eventually fell through. They were from a different tribe and her parents hated the fact that my brother ""talked"" to their daughter without permission. She was married off soon after.

During this time, my dad's business started going side-ways and my brother had to become the primary breadwinner of the house. This prevented him from going back to Canada, he took a job here and gave all his income to my parents. He is essentially the one who got us all through college (I'll be graduating next year). He also paid for my two elder brothers to get married.

Last year, when things were going well, my parents had some savings built up and we were all living our own lives. My brother decided to quit his job and move to Canada. My parents were initially against this but my brother didn't give them a choice in the matter, plus he told them he'd earn more in Canada and thus be able to give them a higher standard of living.

I know it's been a long story so far but this brings us to the present. My brother came to visit us in Feb of this year and he was scheduled to return to Canada in May. During that time the lockdown got serious and all international flights were grounded. My dad is retired now and since both him and my brother have been home, he keeps trying to reconcile with my brother. But my brother is giving him the cold shoulder. Both my parents were pressuring him to get married because he's the eldest and him being single at 30 is a major source of embarrassment for my parents in our community. But my brother is totally against the concept of an ""arranged-Marriage"" because he doens't want to break up someone else's relationship like his own. This has been a cause of major strain between my parents and brother. In addition to that he's also told them that he wants to become a writer in Canada and he'll only take minimum wage jobs while working on his novel. My parents think he's joking and keep trying to dissuade him.

Last night we were all watching TV and my brother was reading in his room. My dad was watching an old sappy movie and a scene came up where the main character has a heart-to-heart with his dad and they both hug it out. This made my dad quite emotional, my brother came out of his room to get some water. My dad grabbed his arm and was trying to forcibly hug him. My brother just backed off and tried going back to his room. Dad blocked the way and forced him to sit down on the couch and ""talk things out"".

My brother kept trying to dodge the topic but both Mom and Dad continuously badgered him. Telling him stuff like ""we're your parents, whatever we did was for your own good"". My brother is usually a pretty chill guy but I could see him getting angrier. Finally he exploded! I've never seen him so mad. He started telling my parents that he hated them, he hated what they'd done to his life. He told them that he didn't wanna get married because he doesn't want to pass along our ""shitty-genes"". And my parents never cared about him, only seeing him as a source of income. What shocked me most was when he started telling them how many times he was molested as a kid. Not only by the Quran teachers at his old school but by an uncle of ours who is now dead. Apparently the abuse happened when he was living with us for a few years. Both my mom and I were horrified and my dad remained silent. My brother literally screamed for what felt like an hour. After all that he just went out the front door. It was close to midnight. I don't know where he is. His phone is turned off and all his socials are deactivated. I'm so scared for my brother, I don't want him to do something irrational. What should I do?

853,"My dad and I have never been the best of friends. We get along fine, but we often have fights. These fights most of the time don't start with ill-will. They begin with my dad helping me with something, whether its trying to get me to follow a schedule he sets for me or teach me finance topics (he used to be an investment banker for 40 years). However, as soon as I say something he doesn't like or act a certain way he doesn't approve of, he quickly gets angry. He immediately starts yelling, cursing, throwing/slamming things and calls me things along the lines of a ""fucking moron"". More extreme arguments result in him hitting me or destroying my possessions. His tirades can go on for hours, and it's extremely exhausting for both me and him.  If I try to reason with him back, he just gets more pissed. 

I know his intentions are well, but sometimes I feel like he is overreacting. Even having a simple conversation with him, be it with me or my mom, can be turned terrible because we ""phrased"" a sentence wrong or ""missed a detail"" in an explanation. My dad has to have everything sound exactly the way he wants, and because of how well-read and experienced he is (again, investment banker), I feel like he treats us like one of his clients where we have to live up to his expectations. Whenever he is the one in the wrong, he always denies it and changes the topic. If we refuse to move on, he gets mad again. His view is basically that because he is older and wiser, he knows everything and we don't, no matter what evidence we give.

Because my dad constantly criticizes me, never gives compliments or congratulations, and finds the need to micro-manage everything single thing I say or do, I feel that my confidence and personality has just become more and more quiet/shy over time. My parents always say I used to be so talkative and energetic when I was younger, and although I don't want to blame anyone for that change, I really feel like my dad is the reason why I became such a introvert. Nowadays, I feel so scared when I have to talk to another person, especially an adult, because all I see is myself doing something wrong and them becoming mad at me or judging me.

Now  with me going to College, my dad recently retired, and everyone stuck at home, we are having more and more arguments, almost multiple times a day. Today, we had an especially terrible argument, where he cursed me and my mom out, threw some more things at me, then asked me ""If you were me, what would you do?"" To which I responded ""give up?""

He said ""fuckin fine"", threw some more things, and then said he wouldn't pay for my college tuition or help me ever again. Part of me feels relieved because I won't have him breathing down my neck 24/7 anymore or worry every step I take every day wondering if I did something wrong to trigger his anger.  However, I don't want to ruin our relationship, however thin it might be. If I apologize, it'll just go back to the way things were before, and I don't think I can take much more of it. (This is only one of the many problems we have together as well, I just didn't want to make this too long). What should I do?",21Jul2020,3
854,"
My neighbor lives with his family next door (I think his brother and uncle), and a family member explained early on that he has moderate autism. He is lacking social skills and they said his maturity level is that of a 15 year old. I’ve lived here a year and he recently came to my door to offer to mow the front lawn for me and my sister (who is my roommate). We declined at first because the yard is super small and takes us no more than ten minutes to do it ourselves, but he was very pushy and kept insisting it was easy to do ours at the same time he did his. We asked what he would charge and he told us he wanted $2 to put gas in his mower and something to drink. We finally agreed because he seemed to really want to do it. 

Last week he mowed and we gave him $5 because we thought his asking price was low, but our front yard IS very small and he had basically insisted on doing it. He was very appreciative. I gave him my phone number and told him to use it to text me when he’s going to mow next time so I know when to leave him a drink and some cash. 

That was a mistake. He has been texting me nonstop ever since, telling me things way too personal about himself, telling me he woke up crying because his mom’s dog died, asking me for help “curing” his depression and giving him motivation to make it through the day (I am in no way qualified to do so), and even asking me to job hunt for him. I have only answered a couple of the texts because I am extremely uncomfortable with the sort of conversation he’s trying to initiate, I don’t know him beyond what his family told me briefly, and frankly I’m way too busy to be carrying on a text conversation all day. 

This morning he said he was going to mow again. I left him a five and a cold bottle of water. Afterwards he texted and said he appreciated the five, but really he needs $15-$20 for the amount of work he did. 

I don’t think those prices are unfair by any means, but we don’t have $80 extra dollars a month to pay him to mow when it’s no problem to do it ourselves. We only agreed initially because he was asking for so little and wouldn’t drop it until we said okay, so we figured he was either just trying to do a nice thing or was bored and needed something to do. 

I’ll pay him the $15 this time, but in my responding text I told him we would mow ourselves from now on, but thanks for the help the last couple of weeks. He ignored that part of my text and instead sent me his cashapp where I can send the money “from now on” then followed it up with a text about how we’ll hang out once the virus is over and he’ll be my wingman. 

I’m sooooo incredibly overwhelmed. I don’t want to hurt his feelings or make things awkward since he lives next door. But omg the texts he sends are so inappropriate and I really need to be sure he understands that this was the last time he is to mow our yard. 

How can I delicately word a text to get my point across about the lawn and also put some distance where he has overstepped lines?",21Jul2020,1
855,"Hello! I've always wanted to go abroad for better quality of life. ( I am from India) To be honest, my quality of life right now isn't that bad compared to other Indians. I keep reading how so many people work here 7 days a week and their commute takes so long. I work from Monday to Friday and make decent money according to Indian standards . I work 8 hours and I don't have to travel because I am working from home. But even before, It took me around 20 minutes to get to work from my  scooter. But I know for sure that I won't be able to do things I dreamed of doing in India. For that, I must go abroad.

Anyway, I have applied to some community colleges in Canada for Post graduation programs (not masters) and the fees for 2 years including GIC is 42 thousand Canadian dollars. I do not want to study and I am only doing for the sake of moving abroad for better opportunities and new experiences.

But my other side tells me to stay here as it's not worth taking loan to study if you don't even want to do it and you are only doing it just to move there. My father told me that you can take loan and work with me and you can make good money in 3-4 years. Going to Canada will give you debt, staying here can give you a beter chance of making money provided we both work together (he is an expert in buying and reselling properties and even making his own and then reselling them and he is good at what he does) he is not forcing me but I do believe he is right. Also, I need to collect  40k usd in the next 3 years for personal reasons. I kept reading about Indian students in Canada who work at Mcdonalds after their PG and that really makes me sad. After investing so much money, it is really not fair to work there. This scares me a lot and I think I will regret going there.

But I am already 24 and I do not want to delay my decision of going there because then I will be in my early twenties and I won't be as young and It'd be weird to study a PG program at that age and I just don't wanna go there later. I am confused. Part of me says that you should stay here because going there is risky and other part of me says that I should live my life and do what I really want to do because this time won't come back. Can someone please give me any advise? Also, if anyone here went to Canada, please share your experience in terms of jobs and all and repaying the loan.

Thanks!",21Jul2020,1

858,"(I posted this in r/relationship_advice this morning but it didn't get a lot of replies and I am really desperate for advice. I thought maybe it was better to post here since it's not a romantic relationship. I have updated this post to try to include more information.)

I have a weird problem... sorry the title is so vague. I wasn't sure how else to explain it in a few words. But basically I have been living with my brother since COVID lockdown and I am really worried he is struggling but he won't talk to me about what's wrong and I don't know what to do.

I could write pages and pages about growing up together but basically we have always been really close, always confided in each other, I always knew everything that was going on with him. We did not have a great home life. Our mother is dead and our father sucks. My brother (Steve) was kicked out about a year ago. The idea was he would get an apartment and when he got established I would go live with him. But he had trouble with that and has been couch surfing since and we had just been talking on Snapchat, I wasn't able to see him. When lockdown happened he was staying with a friend but he asked me to come live with him so I didn't have to lockdown with our dad. So I did. His friend (Mike) is fine with it and not here much since he is an essential worker. Steve is also an essential worker but getting way less hours bc his restaurant is take out only. He is obviously glad to have me here and I am glad to be with him but he's just been... weird? I feel like this sounds crazy because it's hard to explain. But I know him so well, we were joined at the hip basically growing up, I can tell when something is wrong. He didn't used to act like this.

Examples (this isn't everything, honestly it's just a big vibe I am getting but I tried to list some examples):

\- He is not sleeping well, we both sleep in the living room and I can hear him tossing and turning all night. He never had problems sleeping before that I know of

\- He seems really jumpy, we live on a busy street and whenever there is a loud noise he has to go see what it was even though there's lots of trucks and stuff making noise all day. He nearly jumped out of his skin the couple times somebody has knocked on the door. He is always getting up and pacing around

\- Every time I try to talk to him about how he is feeling or if anything happened to him he gets upset and keeps trying to change the subject

\- He said some weird stuff about Mike when I asked him if he was sure Mike was ok with me living there (at first I thought maybe this was why he was acting weird, because Mike didn't want me there and he didn't want to tell me.) He said it's fine because Mike ""owes him"" and letting me live there is ""the least he could do"" but he refused to explain it any further. It sounded really sketchy the way he said it. Later I asked Mike directly if he was ok with it and he said he was

\- He seems to have totally changed the kind of TV/movies he likes, we used to like to watch hour long TV drama shows together and certain movies were our favorite to watch over and over but he keeps saying no when I ask if he wants to watch them. I started rewatching Breaking Bad which we watched together before but he doesn't like to be in the room when it's on and this apartment is tiny so he just hangs out in the kitchen or leaves the house? I stopped watching it because I didn't want him to have to do that but he won't say why it bothers him. Now I am watching cartoons instead bc I don't know what else will bother him

\- Honestly he just.... looks different? I know I didn't see him for almost a year but it's like his facial expressions and body language are different. I don't know how to explain it

\- This morning he got out of the shower looking like he'd been crying but when I asked if he was ok he snapped at me and said I was obsessed with asking him that. Now he is sulking in the kitchen. I seriously don't know what to do. He's making me feel like I am somehow imagining all this. He is hardly ever rude or mean to me

\- A couple people in the other thread asked if he was doing drugs. I am pretty sure it's not drugs bc I haven't seen him using anything and he doesn't get chatty/manic seeming like people on meth (our hometown had a meth problem so I've seen it before.) I don't think it could be coke because you have to keep doing that over and over and when he's not at work he is usually right near me unless I put on a show he doesn't like. I don't get a drugs vibe from this

Again, maybe this sounds crazy. It's hard to put it in words. I can explain more in the comments if needed. I just don't know what to do for him. I don't want to be dramatic but he seems like something really big is bothering him and it breaks my heart. He didn't have an easy time in life and I want him to be happy. What can I do if he won't talk about it or admit anything is wrong? Also I know Reddit likes to suggest therapy a lot but there is no way I could get him to do that. He would walk off a broken leg before he would go to the doctor, there is just no way he would agree to that. I don't think therapy is bad BTW I just know he won't. Is there anything else I can do or a way to get him to talk?",21Jul2020,2
859,"I live in a large Texan city, one of the current COVID hotspots. I was lucky enough to get a job offer in Germany (I've been exempted from the travel ban). The start date is October 1, so I should move in mid-September. However, the situation in Texas has considerably worsened over the last few weeks. I have some preexisting respiratory illness and live alone, so I'm quite worried about contracting the virus. I'm thinking about having to sell my car at the dealership, let movers into my apartment, go stand in line at the airport and take that 10+ hour flight (while taking my cat with me). Knowing how Texans are, I'm sure a good number of people I'll encounter will not wear proper protection or adhere to proper social distancing guidelines. My daily life in Texas doesn't actually pose a high risk. Right now I can work completely from home and barely leave the house. I can do my new job remotely as well. It will require my boss to pull some strings, get me a temporary contract in the US and mail me a laptop. A bit of a hassle, but it seems doable.

Of course, my new company wants me to show up in October and is putting some pressure on me to make the move. I have a weekly phone call with my future boss and he's already urging me to find an apartment and open a bank account in Germany. I'm already dealing with a divorce that has to be finalized before I leave the country. Now I'm worried about exposing myself to the virus on top of this and it's triggering my panic attacks. I'm thinking that maybe I can request to work remotely until the end of the year and hopefully things will clear up by then. All my friends and some strangers on the internet think that I'm nuts for not wanting to run for Germany at the very first opportunity. Sure, Germany is a much safer place to be than Texas right now, but to get there I'd have to put myself in a very risky and stressful situation. And if I get sick, no one, neither the company nor these people, will take responsibility for it. Am I just being paranoid? Should I try to delay the move or just suck it up and move in September?",21Jul2020,1

864,I want to take a semester off so I can work and save up money. I’m currently going into my second year of community college and living with my parents &amp; little siblings. I am so unhappy with myself and I think saving up money and not stressing over school for one semester will give me enough time to do what I need to do. How would I even go about telling my parents this? They probably won’t think it’s a good idea and it’ll be awkward and I hate confrontation. Everyone may see it as me being lazy but  I’ve literally been taking classes nonstop even over summer and I feel like I’m college it doesn’t even matter what age you are when u graduate. I’m rushing for nothing when I’m reality if I want a small break I feel like people shouldn’t judge me for it. I just got a really good job and I could definitely pick up more work.

870,"When I first met my Husband, it was initially great, till we went on our first few dates. He was staring at woman, which I chalked up to him being single for a long time. Then it went to him trying to control my look, recommended different makeup, making comments about my eyelashes, foundation color, clothing, ect. Told me the clothing I wore wasn't that good looking, to which I tried returning what clothes I didn't wear. It got to the point where I didn't feel good about shopping for clothes anymore. Fast forward and I was able to tone these issues down, but other areas started becoming problematic. He asked me to take an STD test in order to have foreplay, after already having sex, refusing to take one himself, because of not having insurance. (Which I did and was clean)

There was so many red flags throughout our dating that I ignored. Nearly half a year in we got married, to which I hesitated when he asked me. (Stupid I know) I don't regret our marriage however, I do regret getting married to him so fast and wish I had time to think about it. He was telling his Mother about me very early into dating and quickly wanted a relationship. Now into our marriage we have been having so many issues. He was very aggressive, yelling at me over minor things, being nice one minute then exploding the next. Following me around the house when I asked for time to myself after a fight. Refusing me the right to leave, when I wanted fresh air. Then there was an incident where he was nice to me one minute over a simple mistake I made during an interview process. He put his arm around me telling me it was okay and then when getting into the car he exploded.

Now we are having bigger issues after 3 years of marriage. My feelings for him have plummet, to the point where kissing him or being intimate is almost non-existent. I feel turned off by him, when I don't want to be. We moved into an apartment and agreed to live in separate rooms to see if this would improve things, but this has made matters worse. He will unlock my door when locked and barge in whenever he wants. I can't even unlock my door without using a knife, so how he can get into my room so fast is beyond me. Just recently he was standing in my bathroom closet hallway, while I was styling my hair and having me time and I just hear him say ""What are you doing?"" I jumped out of fear and looked at him asking why he would do that? I felt so angry and sad that I just wanted to cry. On top of this, he is constantly slapping my butt, touching my privates, never just touches me in a caring way that is not sexual. I know we have not had sex in a very long time, but it makes me so incredibly uncomfortable.

I then told him how I felt and how my feelings are torn with us, because even when he says sorry he will go right back to doing these things again. He will also do things and say that they never happened. His response was then ""You should move out then, be homeless I don't care."" I just feel so horrible. When I think about my relationship ending I start doing things differently, cleaning, waking up early, eating healthy and doing things better. When I invest my energy back into my marriage I fall into depression. Please help? Any advice? Am I wrong for having these feelings? I feel so lost...

871,"I’ve lived in the desert my entire life and I’ve never been truly happy, I’m 23 years old and I need to make this change. Everything here is brown, dry, hot, ugly.

872,"Hello, I'm a teenager and around april 2018 I bought a laptop.   Not too long ago I realized a laptop isn't the best and I want to sell it while it's still worth something to buy a desktop PC with the money. 

The laptop is still really good and if I used the money from selling it and my current savings I could buy myself a PC that would definitely suit my needs.

The thing I'm worried about is that the warranty expired in 2019 and even though it's in perfect condition (I even recently got rid of the dust that was inside and applied better thermal paste) I'm worried it's not worth as much as I think it is.

The laptop is Asus Rog Strix GL703VD, has a GTX 1050ti, i7-7700hq, 16gb ram, 1tb HDD and a 256GB system SSD, needs a little cleaning but from what I can see there are no scratches, screen is in great condition and the whole thing runs like new. Originally bought it for around 4000PLN or 1000$ and don't know how much it's worth selling for, whether 600$ or maybe more.

Reason for selling it is it will gradually lose value and at one point break, requiring me to buy a new one while a desktop PC can be upgraded and have individual parts replaced for cheap. 

I already know that the PC I want to build would probably cost somewhere between 700 to 900 dollars and I have ~250$ saved up that I could additionally spend on it. The keyboard, mouse and monitor aren't problems since I already have them. 

Sorry if this is not the right subreddit for this type of stuff, but I couldn't find any others that I think I could post this on. If there is one just tell me and I'll move it there. Also, it's pretty late where I live so I'm sorry if I don't reply immediately.

876,"I am a recent college graduate who just started her first ""real"" job as a software engineer at aerospace &amp; defense company. At 21 years old, I make over 100K and work on crazy, important, challenging code. I have been feeling extremely undeserving of this and like it is just my privilege and luck, and not my intelligence or experiences, that have allowed me to get to this point.

Some background on my accomplishments:

\-I've been smart for as long as I can remember. As a child, I was put in gifted programs, advanced classes, etc.

\-I went to an elite, private university where I studied both Computer Science and Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies. I ended with a 3.7 GPA.

\-I have an IQ of 166.

\-I have published a 25-page paper in a pretty impressive academic journal (ACM TOCS) on computer systems for which I did research using a grant from the National Science Foundation. I was the head undergraduate researcher on the team, despite being the only female.

\-I have had multiple internships with various software companies and startups. I've been TAs for two different courses (one of which was one of the most advanced courses at the school).

\-I received multiple job offers for full-time and was able to take my pick of really whatever I wanted. Where I work now very clearly wanted me to work for them. They flew me down to their headquarters (which was very far from me), put me up in a luxury hotel for 2 nights with any accommodations/food I could desire, took me on a tour of their headquarters, and gave me offers for three different locations. No one else I know of working for this company has had that experience aside from those who were there with me.

\-I had to go through many rounds of technical interviews to get jobs. Of course, I didn't do well on all of them. But I did well on most of them, which is how I got offers.

Reasons why I think my accomplishments aren't good enough:

\-I was smart as a child naturally, but that is not enough to mean that I am still smart. Am I one of those adults who is stuck on their childhood accomplishments? Was I over-glorified as a child and am now cocky about it?

\-I only ended college with a high GPA because Gender Studies is really easy and boosted it. I got mostly As in those classes so balancing a 4.0 Gender GPA with a 3.4 CS GPA is how I ended up with a 3.7.

\-I took that IQ test when I was in like elementary school. How is it still valid? Is it still valid?

\-I have only been given impressive positions because I am a female and they needed diversity.

\-The technical interviews were insanely easy. There were things I learned in my first semester of college. I was only asked like 2 questions that went beyond freshman year knowledge. Does this mean I am smart or that the questions were just easy?

\-Most importantly: I kind of glided by in college. I feel like I didn't put that much work into my assignments and took the easy way out. If there was a group project where there was a coding section and a writing section, I always did the writing. If there was an insignificant homework that would take me hours but wouldn't impact my grade, I didn't do it. If my friends had an uncreative assignment from a previous semester, I would base my ideas off of theirs (I did not often completely copy it but I definitely used their ideas). I never went to office hours. I took the easiest classes that I could (this doesn't mean all of my classes were easy- there were hard requirements. I just took easy electives). I never understood things more deeply than I needed to. I studied off of friends' old exams. I did everything as quickly as possible. I didn't do readings that I didn't have to do. I waited until the night before an exam to study. I never put my full effort into learning because I wanted to spend my time in college enjoying it, which I do not regret (college was the best four years of my life and I wouldn't change a thing). And the amount of work that I would have to do in order to really do what was asked of me would have meant that there was no time to enjoy myself. Did I not learn enough because of this? Am I giving myself less credit than I deserve? Clearly I still know some things, but do I know enough?

Some background on where I think my impostor syndrome comes from:

\-I grew up very wealthy. My family never had to worry about money, both of my parents worked on Wall Street and are incredibly smart, and I was able to afford any opportunity I could desire. I am very thankful for this, but sometimes it leads me to believe that it is just my privilege that has caused my success. I acknowledge that there are often cycles of privilege in which those who can afford good education, tutoring, school supplies, mental health care, basic needs, etc. and don't need to work or deal with family drama are more successful in the long run. I sometimes think that my success is just because of my privilege. I know that part of it definitely is, but I don't think it all is. Right?

\-I am a woman in a field dominated by men. I have always been the only woman in the room at every job I've ever had that relates to my field. I am often assigned to the more creative or easier tasks on first glance because that's what people assume I'm good at, seemingly because of my gender. People also often explain things to me that I already know and understand. And people are always shocked by what I do.

\-I'm also like relatively pretty and normal- I was in a sorority in college, I partied, I had lots of friends. Outside of computer science, my interests are not particularly nerdy. I don't really look or act like a typical software engineer, so I don't really feel like I am one.

\-I've struggled a lot with my mental health. I have depression, anxiety, OCD, and ADHD and was anorexic for most of my teenage life. They are all under control now but there are some lingering difficulties from those times.

\-I was in an extremely abusive relationship for my many of formative years. He was not only physically and sexually abusive, but also mentally abusive. He would regularly tell me that I wasn't as smart as I believed I am, that I was lucky he loved me, etc. This made me doubt a lot of the things I was confident about.

My issue:

I'm not sure if I'm really an impostor or if I just have impostor syndrome. But these thoughts are making work difficult. I am pretty confused and feel like no one has really told me what I'm supposed to be doing. And I am so afraid to ask questions that seem dumb. So I just don't ask questions and try to figure things out on my own. That gets pretty discouraging and I become unmotivated quickly. This kind of thing used to happen in my math classes in high school as I was in class with juniors as a freshman. So I never asked questions when I was confused because I didn't want to seem dumb but then all of my questions would go unanswered and I would fall behind. I don't want this to happen to me again at work because the repercussions are much more serious. I could jeopardize my job by falling behind (which is something I really do not want to do when the job market is so terrible). I could also jeopardize lives if I mess up because I work on an aircraft defense mechanism. The code I'm editing is when lethality does not equal zero (aka I write the code for what happens if you are at risk of being killed). That's pretty serious.

Please help:

Am I an impostor or not? How do I deal with this? How do I stay motivated when I feel like I'm going to be fired at any minute (this is not possible because I don't even have real tasks yet)? How do I ask questions without feeling like everyone is going to judge me for having them? Who can I talk to about this at work?",21Jul2020,1

899,"We usually go to another country during the summer holidays to visit my mother's family. This year, my mother insisted that it was a special occasion, being an old relative's hundredth birthday.

Now, to be honest, I'm not really close with that person so I don't truly care much about her birthday. I am currently working all day long (I have an internship, online due to coronavirus) and have no holidays until possibly February 2021 and I don't feel like dealing with my family in the evenings in a space that is not the usual one, nor my crazy grandmother, nor with the family outings on weekends. I won't have my own room there so even to sleep I wouldn't be alone.

Also I know what it's like to live on my own, and having been confined with them since March, I kinda miss it. I just want a little space, to cook for myself, learn my languages and not feeling guilty for staying in my room.

Since I am an adult, my mother asked me some time ago if I wanted to come with and I said ""I don't really know"" at first because I knew she wouldn't like it. I finally told her this evening, she said ""I know, X told me. I told you to tell me as soon as you had an idea."", I answered that I didn't dare to tell her and she just said ""you're an adult, you do whatever you want."" but she isn't too happy about it.

901,"Like many others, I (23F) and a recent grad, lost out on some job offers that were canceled bc of the pandemic. Currently, I have a job that pays a bad wage, but it's interesting, and I figured I might as well make a little cash while sitting home, but that contract will be coming to an end in December, and the job market has been brutal. However, I think I might be getting a job offer soon that would allow me to move out, but according to Glassdoor, the boss is bad, and I believe the reviews following my interview. 

The boss seems to be a nice enough person but doesn't really seem to know how to manage and thinks that work is the only thing that matters in life. She also keeps pushing for in-person interviews in the pandemic hot spot where I live which I probably can't say no to if I want the job. On the other hand, my home life is a nightmare. I regularly get screamed at, controlled, forced to do things, and I'm insulted all the time.

903,"This is honestly really long, I hope you read it. 

My mom hasn't had the easiest life. She grew up in an abusive household, around drugs, was molested, and has spent 10 years in an unhappy marriage because my step-dad had an affair multiple times. But she stayed for my siblings the first few times. 
She was stuck in a bad situation trying to get her life together and unfortunately my step-dad had more money than the average male in the area we lived in. She had 2 kids from previous relationships and thought it would be the best decision at the time. She got pregnant again and it turned out to be twins. 
I honestly don't know if this was on purpose. Sometimes I think she needed a reason for him to stay and that was her answer to being able to stay home and go to school. 

**- I feel this is relevant but you can skip over to the main issue/question-**

After she graduated high school, her older sister had a baby and my mom was stuck taking care of him. My grandma (her mom) made her stay around to take care of her nephew because my aunt wanted to party and other things. She had scholarships but was never able to really go to college. Then she had me and I made it much harder.
She spent her 20s going around to whoever would let us stay. We weren't really around each other much when I was a kid. She was working in bars and in an abusive relationship with someone from her high school. We were moving from place to place constantly, I was always changing schools, it was just unstable. 
She went through many bad relationships. She would continuously give cheaters chances and pick the ""douchbags"" (she dated males and females for the first 10 years of my life, females she says because of her molestation and fear of men). She was looking for love because she honestly had a really shitty childhood. We were and for the most part always have been very poor (Like, ""west palm poor"", if that makes sense, but for me it was in South Texas). I know she had it rough and she was doing her best. 
After a brief relationship with my oldest sisters dad, she broke it off and met my step-dad about a year or 2 after. I was about 12 at the time. 

**-here's the problem-**

My mom and step-dad have a very toxic relationship. Both sides are to blame. I see my mom getting more and more unhappy and angry. Unfortunately she likes to take it out on everyone in the house. She will scream and yell over little things. An example would be:

She's sitting in the living room at her desk and asks someone where the stapler went. If no one answers in .2 seconds, she's screaming at everyone. 

""no one ever listens to me, because obviously what I have to say it not important"" 
""all of yall are so disrespectful and ungrateful and lazy"" 

And she'll just yell and rant about anything she's angry about or that's been bothering her. 

I'm going to be honest, I don't have the best relationship with my mom. We really clash and I can admit I don't help keep the mood chill as much as I should. 

**-more backstory-**
My mom wasn't really around when I was small. We moved around, I never (and still haven't) made friends. My whole life I was surrounded by violence, drugs, and I too was molested multiple times.
 My mom was always working and going out with friends, so I was either stuck with my mentally unstable grandmother (who honestly had a shitty childhood as well. Same thing as us but she witnessed her mother commit suicide. She was always treated as less because her mother was also mentally unstable and hated her since she was the only girl. Now my grandmother is a bitter old woman who thinks she's entitled to everyone's money but hasn't worked a day for the last 40 years) or some family friend that either molested me or just didn't care what I was doing. 

I was bullied in school because I was usually the new girl. I was also weird I guess. I think maybe I just didn't develop the proper social skills (and still haven't). 
Maybe I just sound like a baby but this really affected me throughout my life. 

I moved away from my mom at 19 to live with someone I met on reddit (I know, I don't need what you wanna say about that). Yes it was a relationship that moved too quickly, but honestly I got lucky. It was my first relationship since 5th grade and he was an amazing guy. I was (and still am in a way) lost when I moved in with him. I was in an unhappy spot and he made me happy. He was a distraction from reality and I thought moving in with him would help keep me happy. 
We were together for almost 2 years. The majority of the relationship was wonderful, but I slowly started to realize towards the end that I'm not happy. I didn't know why. I started picking out flaws in my SO and saying it was his fault that we didn't live a more healthy lifestyle. Over time I realized I just didn't feel that love for him anymore. He was honestly my best friend and I wish I could go back in time and not date him so I would still have someone to talk to besides myself. 
After breaking it off, I moved in with my mom. She said she changed and that I'm more than welcome home. I thought it would be different. Of course, it wasn't so now I'm here. 

**-end-**

But to the people reading this, honestly I'm really struggling to keep going. 

While in my previous relationship, I started smoking a lot of weed. It was pretty great in the beginning, I didn't have a problem. I finally just smoked too much, I know people don't think it's possible but I'm serious. My ears were ringing, like i was just hypersensitive. I started having a panic attack. Our room just looked dirty, and disgusting. We were both disgusting. We kept a clean appearance but our room was awful. 
It made me freak out and clean/throw away anything I could see. My heart was pounding, I was shaking. It was a horrible panic attack. 
This was just the first incident. I kept telling myself it was ok but it really affected me. Almost like ptsd, I can never forget how awful I was feeling emotionally during that time. 
I was stupid and continued to smoke. I did acid and loved my first trip, but my second trip was awful and just made me more emotional. 
I still didn't understand why. Maybe it was the room, maybe it was my sex life, or whatever I thought was wrong with my partner. But I couldn't find the answer. 
I'm impulsive and you can probably see that. By my choices. So when we were really high and he said something that freaked me out, I was out of his house within the week. I didn't give myself time to process the separation. I led him on for a good 2 weeks after leaving because I thought I wanted to be with him. I realized it was only because I knew my mother didn't change that I wanted to go back. The idea of being around him was still unsettling. 
It's a good and bad thing that I moved back. If I didn't move back I would have never realized the reason why I'm so angry all the time. 

I know it's because of my own personal issues and traumas. I have always been extremely insecure and I have bad trust issues. 

A peek into what I'm constantly thinking about:

If someone compliments me. ""They're lying, just being nice""
If I think about going out in public. ""Disgusting loser, who wants to see that in public"" 

My whole life is run by this feeling of shame. I need people to accept me, I can't stand when people don't like me. I really try to be nice to everyone because I hate when people are upset with me. 

I don't mean to sound dramatic but I honestly don't think one reddit post can contain everything that I think has influenced my poor mental and physical health. 

I'm really struggling with what I think is depression.

I've always invalidated it because I don't stay in bed all day and I actually go to work and can be in a good mood sometimes. But in my head it's constant negative thoughts and feelings. I'm so used to containing my feelings because I didn't grow up with a good support system.

I guess the main question is, how do I move on? 

I'm 21 and I need to start college. I can't keep putting it off. But I'm poor, uneducated, and unemployed right now. I know there's grants, but this isn't just about money.

I really can't live with my mom. She has all these problems she hasn't dealt with and her anger is really unhealthy for me. It really does stress and depress me and it's an everyday thing. Not just on occasion.

My options are 

1)  to get an apartment with an old friend from high school that's in the area and just work full time and go to school.
2) stay here and risk my unhappiness but be that positive influence for my siblings. 

The other problem is my siblings. They're all 10 and under. I already see pieces of her in them, her anger and entitlement. They're so behind academically, it's not even funny. My mom is blind to how her actions have affected me and how they're affecting my siblings. I know she's trying to change (she says) but I'm afraid it will be too late.

Should I sacrifice my mental state for them? If i move out, they're going to think I abandoned them with my mom. I've been trying to talk to her about her anger but you can tell she isn't ready to take responsibility and self reflect.

I need to get out. I'm really going through it emotionally and I am seriously considering suicide some days. Not only because of unhappiness but because of how much I will have to struggle, no matter which decision I make.
I always told myself moving out would solve my problems but now I have other people to consider. 
I'm seeing this vicious cycle that I don't want to be in anymore. I want to change and become a better person. It's just too difficult.

I'm a loser that has no experience, formal education, basic social skills, etc. I haven't really been on my own either. My mother made me so dependent, I can't do anything unless people show me. I'm too afraid to do anything because I'm scared ill do something wrong and get punished. 

I'm really lost guys and I don't know what to do. I really need some advice, anything. This is just getting too hard and coping is much harder than I expected. 

I could move out in a few months (if I find a job that pays enough). But should I? Should I really leave 3 innocent kids to eventually go through what I went through? I wouldn't wish what I'm feeling in anyone, let alone my siblings.

905,"Long story short, I have an ex-friend that cut me out of their life 3 years ago which made my anxiety skyrocket since. During one of my bouts of terrible anxiety, I ended up finding their work number (or at least 2 combinations of what I think might be their work number) and I memorized it pretty quickly.

Whenever I have bouts of terrible anxiety, I'm always afraid I'll do something stupid like contact them trying to win back their friendship (I've tried to contact them 3 times over the past 3 years and they never answered every time). At this point, I just want to be able to live with it/want it to go away. I end up reciting the numbers in my head hoping the anxiety will go away, which kind of just reinforces the thought's staying power, but idk what else to do.

I don't know what to do. I feel shame every single time I have my phone turned on now. I'm supposed to be trying EMDR therapy tomorrow, but I can't easily forget something like this. I've been using thought stopping, but I wanted to know if anyone else has been through something similar and what they might have done?

I guess I can say I take solace in the fact that I'm not 100% sure what the number is, but I freak myself out by thinking I'm going to search it up and find out one day. I've been meditating to try to gain a stronger self-control/self-discipline.",21Jul2020,3
906,"In my childhood I was a little off.  Anxious, awkward, and inattentive.  Some diagnoses were passed around including ADD, central auditory processing disorder, and mild autism.  Nothing really stuck or was medically confirmed though.  I did well academically and even picked up a physics degree... and from my perspective I always felt like I could think clearly, just that I was kind of in my own world and couldn't always pay attention to the world around me.  However in the passed few years (now I'm 34) I've had some symptoms arise including more intense anxiety than I've ever felt before, a mild hand tremor, neurological hearing loss (hearing came back thankfully), and most troubling to me but also most subjective and hardest to get a diagnosis on - intense brain fog.

I've seen a psychiatrist and a neurologist and had an MRI (MRI was for the hearing loss but they also did a full scan of my noggin and it came back normal), everyone I saw said they see nothing wrong other than anxiety and a mild tremor.  So the experts tell me I'm ok, but in my non-expert opinion, with the amount of brain fog I experience, I'm in some kind of cognitive free-fall and someday won't even be able to take care of myself.  I think I have some objective measures to point to having slowed down mentally as well...Tasks are taking me longer to do than they used to, sometimes a lot longer.  

This anxiety has caused me to break up with a girlfriend who wanted kids not because I didn't want them but because I didn't trust myself to be a good father, it's caused me to stay at a job I don't like because I don't trust myself to learn the ropes at a new place, and it's also prevented me from moving to a new location (which I've always wanted to...) because I don't trust myself to be able to make new friends or find a new job.  And of course, my confidence is sh!t.  I feel like my ability to think clearly has only gotten much worse this year since the pandemic began, so I do feel like stress is tied into the brain fog somehow.  I've been on and off SSRIs and they do help control my anxiety but I don't think they really help the brain fog.

I'll be honest that I'm currently off the SSRIs and also unable to get adequate exercise due to a broken bone I'm healing from...and I think to some extent this post/these feelings are what irrational anxiety looks like, but I also feel like I do have some other issues that are real and not just imagined.  But of course my anxiety also prevents me from wanting to even address it - like if there was a test I could take that could tell me I was losing my mind, I'd be terrified to take it!

He was in Japan last year from August to February and had a relationship with another girl for about 4-5 months, and he told my sister this month that he had cheated. He had told the girl in Japan that my sister was his ex. He eventually broke it off with the other girl when he had to come back to the U.S because of COVID-19, all while he was still with my sister. 
She told me that she still loves him and is planning to still move to a different state with him in a few months. She also said not to tell my parents or any of my relatives because she doesn’t want anyone to judge him for his mistakes.
My dilemma is that I(19) believe he doesn’t deserve to be with my sister and that she should break it off with him because I don’t want her to get hurt again.

Just this evening, she messaged my girlfriend and I that she was over at a mutual friends of ours, practically right next door. We think to ourselves 'Is this an invitation?', consider our history with her, and cautiously answer 'That sounds lovely, what's up?'.
She responds that she was just leaving, but she'll be back tomorrow!
And again we ask ourselves, and indeed her, 'Is that invitation?'. She answers that she'll have to ask our mutual friend, as in she hadn't even considered the fact that her messages imply either an invitation to hang out, or an invitation of jealousy.

So now we have a hang-out scheduled for tomorrow, by way of, well, not wanting to lecture her on subtext over Facebook Messenger. Reflecting on this short conversation though, it brings to mind many other times where things we say will breeze right past her, or times when her communications can be interpreted in a multitude of ways only to find the most mundane answer.

Between the part and full time job, I got my license. And I’ve been trying to save for a car since. But with the pandemic going on, its making it really hard to save. I’m high risk, yet in March my parents DEMANDED I go back to work (mind you, my adult brothers 28 and 29 are high risk, and so is our grandma with stage 4 lung cancer). So in June, I got a “full time” job. I’m contracted to be full time, but they’re only giving me 22-26 hrs a week when the company’s standard for full time is 36hrs/week. Because of this I don’t bring much in monthly. I have roughly $200-300 a month left after paying my parents for rent (which my dad gets extremely angry about if I don’t pay it absolutely on the first). They keep urging me to get a car so they don’t have to drive me to work every day, mainly because it conflicts with my grandma’s appointments and her life. My place of work is 5 mins from our house, but we live along a highway that a lot of logging semi’s go down, so I can’t walk to work. 

Every time I spend money on something, or even mention it (ie, last week I said I really need a new bed, and that I was going to buy my own, because mines 7+ yrs old and was 2yrs used when I got it. Literally right after I got it my other grandma’s house burnt down, so she got to sleep in it for the first 3 months I had it. Mind you she’s a heavier woman roughly 250LBS.), they grind me for it. Saying I need to focus on paying rent and saving for a car. They keep saying I need to have a car soon because they don’t want to keep driving me to work and want me to be a “big girl” (these are literally their words lol). But the catch is they won’t let me buy a car under $2500. But with the rate I can save at, its going to take me easily another year to afford it on my own. 

I’ve been tempted to see if I can pick up a second job to try and save faster, but I know my parents would just get really upset with me just for picking a second job up to save quicker. 

I really don’t know what to do at this point. With the way they keep acting about driving me to work, and how its such an inconvenience for them to drive me to work (when it’s literally along the road you have to go on to get into town, because we live in the country side), and some of the things they keep saying it sounds like I have a few months to save or there’s going to be consequences. I don’t want to make them angry by not being an adult like they want me to be (which is ironic because neither of my brothers work due to being disabled, however the eldest still has the capability to work, they just pamper him and don’t want him working). 

What should I do?",21Jul2020,1
921,"I study abroad and live in a 2 bedroom apartment with a roomate and once the corona crisis hit my roomate went back home to his home country, after a couple weeks of him leaving a mutual friend of ours asked me if he could move in his room for a couple of days until his girlfriend flew back home because her houses contract finished and keep in mind that he has a house here, i asked my roomate and he was ok with it so he moved in. Now it has been a month after  his girlfriend flew back home and he is still living with me and because he is a bit tight on cash at the moment and he told me he is going to stay for a few days until he can find a job.

I am currently working in clothing retail and I love my job especially my coworkers. I would miss them dearly. However, I have been accepted into an unpaid internship in my degree of field. I have worked really hard to be where I am especially since I have a learning disability.

926,"Apologies if I'm doing this incorrectly. I've never actually posted on Reddit before, but seeing as I'm kinda out of options at the moment, I decided to give it a try.

Ok, so as of writing this I am 18 years old (male) and feeling kind of ""lost"", I guess. A few years back I moved far away from where I grew up, saying goodbye to all of my old friends. While it bothered me for a while I was still in contact with a few of them via Skype/discord, and of course I made new ones at the school I was attending. It  was around a year or so after the move that I was diagnosed with a rare medical illness. I won't get into it here, but it made it impossible to continue school, so I had to drop out. Around that time I was on a lot of different medications and entered a deep depression. It lasted for about two years and I abandoned all of my friends in the process (not just my new school friends but my old online buddies as well).

When I started feeling happier I contacted as many of them as I could, but they had all moved on and had no real interest in catching up. My illness made it hard for me to go outside as much so I struggled to make any friends that way. It is also worth mentioning that I'm a bit slow. I'm not disabled, but I don't have the mental capacity to make quick decisions nor do I have sharp reflexes. It's because of this that I can't drive a car (I've tried many times before but almost crashed every time. I would've if not for my mom being there to help me). Without a car, I can't really travel anywhere so I'm stuck at home.

 I live in a community where all of the houses are connected, making me feel trapped. Not to mention there are only busy roads outside of the community so I can't go anywhere. My doctor (who I see every week for infusions and treatment) is restricting me from going anywhere right now due to the pandemic, as I'm especially susceptible to the virus at the moment. I was planning on getting a job when I turned 18, but all of this made it kind of difficult for me. I do take chemo (it's not for cancer) so I already feel like crud as it is. Note that I've already tried going to multiple therapists/psychiatrists and it's never worked out for me.

I tried to make friends online, through chatting sites, discord, online games, etc. However, I have a social communication disorder, so I've never been able to make a single friend in the years that I've tried doing so. Now we're back to the present, where I'm just sitting here feeling horrible, both physically and emotionally. I feel both lost and trapped at the moment, so I decided to finally try using Reddit.

934,"So basically, my best girl friend is moving away in September, and I’m really not looking forward to it, because for the past two years she’s been my best friend, favourite notification, favourite person to meet with, my crush, and pretty much everything tbh. Although I may not mean everything to her and can move on without me, I really can’t move on without her tbh, I hate the fact that we may lose contact and never speak to each other again when she goes and I really don’t know what to do before she goes and once she has gone. She has said to me that she wants me to come visit her at Uni, but there’s still that possibility that we may lose contact and as well she’ll probably meet a guy at Uni who is everything she’s looking for which I’d be really happy about because I want her to be happy but I also want her to be happy with me.

935,"So my spouse hasn't been able to see or talk to their mom in over a year because my father-in-law is crazy. Little bit of back story I am a 27 year old female my spouse is also 27 FTM Transgender.

 My in-laws have always had a lot of family drama and my FIL has had many altercations with his brothers and sister. He claims that his siblings are keeping his monther from him and interfere every time he tries to visit her. According to my spouse's aunt and cousin the reason he is not wanted over there is because he starts fights with his mom and makes her upset. Including throwing the bibile in her face, which had always been a very Christian lady. 

My FIL has instigated numerous fights between my spouse's family including trying to get his niece to meet him for a fight with our nephew in the car,  trying to kidnap our nephew, and fighting with us and my BIL over all sorts of stupid stuff. 

Last year he decided he was angry about not being allowed to see his mom and wanted us to get involved and somehow convince my spouse's uncles and aunt to let him visit his mom. We told hims we didn't want to get involved in the drama. We also expressed confusion on why he thought they would listen to us about the issue. He started berating my spouse saying they were disrespecting their parents by not standing up for them. He started telling them they were going to hell for being gay and sending 20 text messages at a time getting angry that they weren't responding because they were working. 

My spouse was very upset and after 4 year of bitting my tongue I was fed up. I sent him a message basically saying he needed to stop disrespecting my spouse and harassing them while they were working. He basically told me it was none of my business since it was his family to which i responded to if you're disrespecting my spouse it is my business. He basically started throwing the Bible at me to which I basically said that I'm not afraid of his imaginary friend because the true God is all loving and all forgiving. The argument continued to escalate I called him a phyco and eventually blocked him. He continued to argue with my spouse telling them to put a muzzle on his dog and calling me assssley instead of Ashley because apparently I'm an ass.

For some reason he thought I had taken my spouse's phone and was texting for them, which I wasn't, and began threatening me and trying to pay me to fight him. We ended up filing a police report and they advised us not to respond at all and if he continued we could charge him with harassment. 
My spouse's mother is taking FIL side on everything and is refusing to speak to us as well. I know it has been hurting my spouse even though they claim they are over it. She didn't even call or text for hia birthday last year. My spouse tried to reach out to her by writing her a letter and taking it up to her work. She refused to even look at us so we handed the letter to another person and she gave it to her later. She did write them back but basically said we needed to apologize and ""make things right"". My spouse sent her a mother's day gift despite not being on speaking terms. 

Today is my spouse's birthday and my BIL sent them a video that my MIL had recorded for them. Basically she said she loved them and wanted us to be a family again and they would put the drama behind us but we needed to make things right and apologize. Other than calling my FIL a psyco I have no clue what else we have to apologize for. 

Also I met my FIL mother recently and she said herself she didn't want to see him because he always acts like an ass.

I don't know what to at this point but I'm tired of seeing my spouse cry and hurting from this.",21Jul2020,1
936,"Hi all- starting to get really fed up.  I watch a 13 month old.  I’ve watched him since he was 6 weeks old.  He’s a great baby... but I also have three kids of my own.  I was a SAHM after moving to Arizona for my husbands work, so when someone posted on the neighborhood page about finding a full time sitter for their baby, I thought it’d be a great idea and I’d get some extra money.

Met with the family, they wanted Monday-Thursday, a total of 38 hours per week.  
I told them I was going to charge $200 a week (In home daycare centers in our neighborhood charge less but they have multiple little kids).
The mom told me she only budgeted for $150.  I agreed to it because I really wanted to help out with the finances yet still stay at home for my kids (who are 7, 10 and 12.)

Fast forward one year - they constantly pick him up late.  Late meaning 10 min - over an hour (they have FORGOTTEN to pick him up on three occasions!!!!!).  Most days they bring him over with a dirty diaper that’s been matted to him for hours.  They bought a brand new van which makes me think they lied to me about how much they could afford for daycare for him.  They don’t pay me extra on weeks I end up watching him way more since they are late.
I know some of this is my fault- I should be honest, I had nothing in writing, I was trying to be a good and helpful person.  I guess I wasn’t being that good of a “business person”.

The mom and I get along, we’ve done some get togethers in the community, but she’s also been a huge flake when we have plans and I’m just over it. 

The mom just told me she’s pregnant again and was texting me that I better not “leave” her because she’s invested in me and doesn’t want to deal with trying to find another sitter for her baby.  I’m trying to get out of the situation ASAP but I need advice how to!!!!!  I feel like she is going to lose her mind, because no one else would put up with her shit (there’s so much more to it but I’m rambling) or charge as little as I am.

So- how would you go about it breaking off the attachment?  I do have a backup plan as far as doing marketing work remotely for my cousin where I’d make more.  I am so over the childcare business.  I feel like my kids are ignored all day and next week remote learning for school is starting.

Thank you for letting me vent and I would appreciate any advice!!!!",21Jul2020,1

*Social anxiety* plays a big part of this issue, as well as low self esteem unfortunately. The most I've done with a guy is kiss, but it was when I was drunk. To be honest it was quite awkward. The amount of times people tell me I'm shy and awkward. Online, it's easy for my personality to come out, though in person it's like I hibernate in a sense. I would love to be an attractive and classy young woman (I'm 18)  who is strong and fun to be around.

I understand I'm very young still,however my mind convinces me I don't deserve sex. Sometimes I think I will die a virgin lol.( I'm a drama queen hahah) I don't deserve a long term relationship with a man. It's just sad really. I get lonely EVERYDAY,wishing I could nuzzle up to someone and have fun together. Unfortunately, I imagine happy moments and realising they probably won't even happen...make me disappointed. It is such a toxic trait but I get jealous when I see couples down the street, holding hands. Unfortunately, I have some kind of anger issues as it is. I just feel like such horrible person who will be in this situation all my life. Well of course I know I got to change things. Ahh I dunno. I guess there's no rush. But in a sense I feel some sort of pressure to get into one. Well I'm just a sheep after all. Though to be fair, I understand why people can't cope without a relationship. They NEED that support and intimacy. But everyone is different and dealing with their own shit in their lives. Another thing is I'm afraid of what my parents would think of my hypothetical boyfriend. I can't really date anyone from a different culture as it brings more problems I guess. My parents don't want me to.

Of course, self development,right? Yeah I need to really give myself a kick up the backside and just get my shit together. I will most likely feel a tiny bit better in my body if I was to lose the weight. The amount of fucking times *~~I break down, naked, in front of the mirror..thinking I'm disgusting.~~*  If I was to join a female boxing class, maybe that'll be a good outlet.. Be an independent badass woman! As cringe as it may sound...

I've had a few guys tell me that they want to date me..but to be honest they haven't seen my true self in real life. I guess this post was a sort of vent. I would appreciate if anyone could share their experiences perhaps, or give me some advice. Thanks :)",21Jul2020,7

I personally don't think that this could be possible, he's claiming he's in a US prison and I would think if they gave out this type of technology, they would surely do regular inspections and also monitor network activity / block these types of websites?

My question(s) are - 

1. Is this possible? Anyone work or been in US Jail know if this guy could even possibly do this?
2. How can I go about making sure this guy isn't lying - i've asked for timestamped/avatar photos however haven't gotten them 
3. If this turns out to be true - we need to get this dude away from things such as Habbo Hotel whilst he's in a god damn jail.

Please let me know your opinion Reddit, let me know if you think this is absolute BS too, theres been things such as discord showing his mobile phone as the device, but claims he does not have a phone.

I know it's possible to go on the internet in prison, through snuck in iPhones etc - but this dude isn't saying that, he's saying he's using the prison laptop only.... just seems weird, im also of the impression if you could have a phone snuck in you wouldn't be the type to sit playing habbo all day, you'd clearly made some form of connections to be able to do this.",21Jul2020,4

The first time he left for a week with no explanation and went completely dark, the second time it was a brief explanation and he left for two days, and the third time two days ago was a longer explanation but he came back only a few hours later.

Everyone I’ve gone to for advice is tired of hearing me repeat this toxic cycle and just wants me to leave him so I don’t get hurt but I can’t. He matters so much and I want to be the one who’s there for him because obviously he doesn’t have anyone else to go to. Even my closest real life friend hates him and he found that out recently which made him half leave again.

He basically told me I was too clingy and talking every single day wasn’t good and that we should focus on our own lives instead of dedicating time to each other which I understand. He’s still here but a lot less so. I explained to him my fear of abandonment and being replaced which he said was weird since he’s not replacing me by leaving. It hurt to be called weird but my fears are unreasonable and not logic based so I understand. 

He means the world to me and I’ve had a lot of romantic feelings towards him since April. It’s gotten to the point I feel nauseous thinking about him and have cried so many times over him whether it was him leaving or just general worry. I’ve had three dreams about him all positive and it hurts so much not being able to express my feelings and see him. Not talking right now hurts because I told him I wanted to communicate my feelings and he said communication isn’t the best way right now.

I understand taking a break and I’m still talking to one of his friends who told me that he’ll help me and check in on my friend so we don’t drift apart which honestly means the world to me. I just don’t know how he can hurt me so much and still mean the world to me and be my favorite person when everyone I’ve talked to for advice about him dislikes him.",21Jul2020,7

So I'm in a really indecisive moment in my life. Long story short I'm considering dropping out of uni. The reasons are:
I've done a similar course in college and already have a diploma for it
The job I would like to do does not require a degree and most of my college mates are in full time jobs when we all left college 
The only reason I went to uni was because I was getting emotionally abused and had to move out from my foster carers
I know for a fact my mates are fake and my housemate does even help with cleaning our house on a daily basis
Plus each year I've gone back to uni (1st and 2nd) my mental health has decreased)
I also feel ready to work a 9-5 job earn money and move out to my own place
The only issues I will face if I drop out is I would have to find someone to take over my tenancy agreement for the next academic year, and if not I'd have to pay the rent when it's due each semester untill someone is found and this out worry on me because I'd need to make sure I have £1300 per semester (sep-dec) (jan-april) (may-june) last bit of rent is always cheaper so not a problem.

I’ve been living in my home town for 12 years and I have noticed that things haven’t been going well.

There’s too much negativity, unsupportive and toxicness where I live. 
I’m fed up with it because all my other friends have moved away and are completely happier  in a different country , and I always feel so jealous and left out. 

I felt like  my mental health has been  drained out  by the more time I spend in my own hometown and I feel more depressed every time.

I’m not close with my parents and it’s always been a not okay environment, and It’s hard to find a job because they only allow particular race. My mom and I can’t get along and we always have arguments and j always have to be the one that apologises for things. 

My dad told me that I could tell him anything , but I choose not to because he will end up saying “ it’s all in your head “ when it’s not, he works in a different work industry which is telecom. And I’m always here and there for retail or F&amp;B. 

He doesn’t listen to me.  When I tell him I want to move he’s goes “ if you end up going to the states  for example and you mess up people are gonna swear at you and tell you did a shit job and curse at you and you can’t Handel that because of your mental health “ 

Meanwhile 

The jobs  in my hometown are not accepting me because of my race , and  I face racism and stereotypes. And company’s aren’t training me well to the point I get bullied and I get fired because of one persons opinion, and spreading false information 

when the manger doesn’t know the backstory. As well as the person from the other outlet sees me hardworking and so motivated to work. 



I want to move but I also don’t know how to tell  my parents that I want to move when they told me my home town is more safer and I can live my life here , when it’s really expensive. I mean yeah there’s perks here and there 



It would mean a lot to get advice or any suggestions on what to do

Only one other friend and myself say something else and we get shut down, for example, I like a movie but the friend does not, so when he starts to trash on it, everyone agrees, I say I like it, and then bam, instant shutdown.

955,"Hello, I am looking for some advice on if my friendship can be salvaged or if moving on was the best decision. 

My friend and I (24F her, 27M me) have known each for 2 years, we hung out or talked nearly everyday for the better part of those 2 years, however after she started dating her now fiance back in early 2019 she started to become cold and distant towards me. She would ghost/ignore me, if we had planned to go do something together she would cancel last minute, and if I ever questioned her as to why she was acting the way she was, she'd accuse me of being passive aggressive or bullying her. Things only got worse at the start of 2020, she forgot my birthday, something that she knew means a lot to me, even her apology felt fake. When the quarantines/stay at home started happening she ignored me even more and even blamed her inability to see her fiance on me, as if I was the reason for COVID19.
Eventually it came to the last straw, I wanted to clear the air with her and have a conversation, but when I asked if she was available to talk she told me to ""save it for another day"". I had had enough, so I told her I didn't want to be friends anymore and her only response was, ""that sucks"".

I ended the friendship back in May, I don't believe I am in the wrong, but I can't help but feel like I made a mistake. I miss her, I find myself wanting to talk to her nearly everyday, but is that even practical? Is this something that can be salvaged or have I lost all respect in her eyes and moving on is the only answer? Any advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance.",21Jul2020,2
957,"A bit of back story first, so we used to be best mates, her name is (let’s say) Alice, we used to meet all the time and talk and FaceTime, we were always there for each other and we used to go to each other’s house, and we’d had a few times when we kissed.

So into the story, we started distancing after a while and I used to always try message her but then I asked why she was being blunt and she told me I am ashamed to be with her. After thinking about it I realised, I was a dick and that I was ashamed because my friends would always take the much out of me for being friends with her so I hid it from them. Then we just stopped talking and I always think about her and how close we used to be and then as I finally started to forget about her she messages me about 2-3 months after we stopped talking saying she misses me. I miss how close we were but there was a few times we’d argue and it’d ruin my mood. What should I do? Please help me I really don’t know what to do. Thanks",21Jul2020,1
960,"So if you don’t know a cross sibling is when you share a half sibling with someone with no biological or blood relation. 
-background- so along time ago my dad (S) had a short relationship with (A) and they had a baby(T) a few years later (A) had a baby with another guy (R) and my dad had a baby with my mom(J) and that baby was me (M) T is my half brother and he is also R’s half brother. T used to come around when we were kids but we basically have no relationship with him now and never see him but he does talk to R from time to time not very often tho. My dad knew that my half brother had another half brother but I didn’t know. I knew R through schools for a while before I figured out who he was and kinda had a crush on him( two years ago) and I accidentally figured out who he was to T. But more recently me and R became friends and have gotten pretty close he flirts a lot with me and really cares about me. My question is would dating him be wrong? I’m more worried about what my family such as grandparents mom dad and cousins would think which is what I’m curious about would that be a problem.
~reasoning~ my reasoning is we are not biologically or blood related he’s never around our family and both our family’s have cut ties basically. I see it as if my dad and his mom never had (T) then there would be no problem it would just basically be my dads random flings kid. Somebody that he used to knows kid but because they accidentally got pregnant 23 years ago it changes everything. So what would you think? Is it wrong? How would my family feel?",21Jul2020,1
961,"This is a pretty fucked up story that happened a few years ago. This guy who I had known for just a couple of months, who I thought was my friend, was acting really weird and suddenly started talking homosexually (this was on social media). It got to the point where he was asking if I wanted to see his dick; I initially thought that he was just joking and this was really just a weird part of his personality considering that he had a pretty hot ex girlfriend too, but he did end up showing it. I was completely fucking shocked. That was just so unexpected. So it was evident that he was bisexual, or gay because it wouldn't surprise me if he ""faked"" being straight. I have no issue with anyone's sexuality, but what he did was fucking shocking and just weird...like one of the popular guys who you thought was this really good guy just acts all horny and then shows you his dick. Long story short, I stopped speaking to this guy in real life and social media because it was just awkward and all. Like I remember him acting as if he didn't just send something that was completely inappropriate the previous day. What a strange guy.

Now this is where things get fucked up. I didn't tell anyone about this, and in all honesty I'm not the type to get in to gossip e.g. ""yo you need to hear about this"", ""did you hear about so and so"", etc. However, months later a couple of people started asking me if I'm ""bisexual"" and another told me that the guy had said that I SHOWED MY DICK to him. How fucked up is that? This is a bisexual or gay guy that just made up some complete bullshit rather than openly admit that he's into males. By the way, this guy is a black ""tough"" guy who's popular with boys and girls in terms of friendships, so deep inside I knew that it would be hard for people to question what he had told them, though he does have that ""gay bestfriend"" personality that I would hope people have noticed so they could've clocked on that he lied. I can't put into words the anger I feel that a person would lie like a coward instead of being open and honest about who they truly are. I can only hope that, as bad as this may sound, that the guy gets his karma for attempting to fuck up another person's image to try and hide their true image. Even though it was only around 4 people in total who asked me if I'm bisexual due to what this bastard of a person had lied about, it's just such a fucked up situation...like are those people who asked actually believing that I'm bisexual even though that I said that I'm not? When I think about it, it just seethes me how fucked up society is: one person can say a load of a shit and people could believe it just because of the ""reputation"" of the guy who said it, so he must be telling the truth?

He tried calling the hospital that he had surgery at but they said that doctor is no longer affiliated. How is it possible that within 7 months this surgeon just disappeared? If he did on planning on closing he should have a forwarded voicemail right?!? 

Or at least something to let patients know where to go. Now, my friend can’t track him down and then now what? He can’t retrieve his past medical history from their office either. Ummmm isn’t this illegal? What if god forbid a legal action took place and lawyers tried to call him for ANY medical records..?

\*I was told of this opportunity this morning 7/21, I haven't given it too much thought just yet.\*

I left my small home-town in Illinois at 21 to work in Colorado's Medical Marijuana Industry. I'll be honest I didn't have much of a ""dream job"" besides growing Marijuana ever since around 12(super ambitious, huh). I decided as soon as I completed my Associate's Degree (I went for Early Childhood Education) I would move to Colorado and join the industry, which is exactly what I did. I have been happily employed working in the Industry as a Cultivator for almost 8 years now. Although I absolutely love what I do for a living, the money isn't where I want it to be and neither am I. I have been thinking a lot about going back to school but am not sure what for and as beautiful as Colorado is, I never saw myself living here for so long and now I feel planted here. Although I wasn't very close with my father growing up, he was supportive of everything I did as long as I could support myself. We have phone calls once or twice a month making sure each other is doing well, life updates and family chit chat. So he has known I have been unhappy with my current situation for a bit now. Him and his long-term girlfriend just purchased a new house together and will be moving into it at the end of the year...

He offered me the opportunity to move into his old house in Illinois for as long as I needed, and take the opportunity find a Trade or go back to school. Now this isn't him completely giving me a house for free, but he is offering me 3-8 years of not having to be stressed about a living situation. I think getting into a Trade would be the smartest decision and from working in the Marijuana Industry HVACR seems to be the most stable work. I'm honestly not the smartest person, but I am handy and good with tools. I love working with plants, horticulture really interests me but I don't see much money to be made with the careers.

999,"I am 22 and started my dream job in NYC in January. I worked there just about two months to the day when we went remote due to COVID. I left the city immediately to stay with my family in the city where I grew up, assuming I’d be home for two weeks - four months later I’m still here and our office isn’t fully reopening until Labor Day. 

The thing is, I’ve struggled hugely with anorexia in the past 18 months (been in various forms of hospitalization/treatment for eight of those) and I’d actually relapsed hard the two months I was at my new job. Working from home has allowed me to be flexible enough with my hours that I’ve been attending a new treatment program and really trying to heal. Living with my parents has also given me a level of support I didn’t have in New York - I also reconnected with an old boyfriend and am now in a wonderful relationship. 

Going back to the city in September feels awful and it would be so hard not to relapse. I lived there for so little time, I didn’t really make any friends - even the people I was living with moved out of the city. And my office has said in their reopening plan that all food needs to be brought to the office in sealed containers and eaten alone at our desks.

I heard of otoplasty and I really want to do it (due to having big ears). My dad can’t afford it and my mom and stepdad decided to buy a house off a lot of loans (both not smart with money and picking jobs). My physiologist told me she “would” look into seeing if she can help me lower the price on it. My insurance (via my mom) is horrible and barely pays for anything but she decided to dump over $500,000 (in mostly loans and child support) for some house when we already have a great home.

1010," 

I (24M)  recently met up with an high school friend (25F)for dinner. In high school I  had a crush on her and like a typical freshman went about it by asking  her out over Facebook, which went about as well as you could expect. We  still remained friends and then lost track of one another once college  started.

While I didn't intend to  stay much longer after dinner, I ended up staying at her apartment for  about 5 hours, just talking. While the beginning was mostly catching  each other up on lives, the rest of the conversations were deeply  personal about past relationships, issues that we struggled with in  those relationships, family issues, politics, and a whole slue of  meaningful conversation. Franky I wasn't expecting to get this personal,  but the conversation just flowed from one topic to another and was  engaging.

After I had left, I felt  strangely happy. It wasn't until the next day at work that I began to  get the feeling of something close to emptiness, more like longing to be  back there. That being with her just seemed right. I don't remember  feeling like this over anyone, even past girlfriends. I don't really  know how else to describe it. I'm at a loss and could really use some  advice.  Do you think I'm falling for her, and if so what is my next  step?

TL;DR: Met up with an old  crush from High School to catch up. Ended up with deep conversations.  Afterwards felt that being with her just felt right.

1017,"Hello everyone. I’m a 18F and I fucked up last night. Big time. 

My parents are very strict Pakistani Muslims and they have always been super hard on me. I’m pretty good for the most part, I graduated Magna Cum Laude and I’m getting ready to go to college. They were proud of me. They let me go out with my friends and such because they trusted me. My older sister got into a lot of trouble at my age so they were pretty wary of letting me out, but my grades and behavior persuaded them. 

I started smoking weed when I was 15. Nothing major, just occasionally when I was with friends. Maybe once a month. 

I have a severe case of anxiety. I’ve had to go to the emergency room several times over the years after having severe anxiety attacks. Despite this, they refused to let me see a professional. They said it was because I stay in my room all day and don’t pray. I’m not religious. They don’t know this. I consider myself an atheist. 

When the covid situation began, it took a very huge toll on me. I missed my graduation and prom etc and being inside all day made me more depressed. I started smoking weed regularly to help me cope. I would wait until my parents were asleep and then smoke a little and relax and do some summer class work and go to bed. This is quite literally the only way I’ve ever disobeyed my parents. My parents detest weed completely and think it’s only for loser lowlifes who will end up homeless. And they think weed users will go to hell. 

About a week ago, my mom caught me going outside. She expressed concerns and was mostly confused because it was so early in the morning and I would go by myself. I told her I just go to clear my mind and watch the sun rise. She was skeptical, but she bought it. 

Last night it was raining. I still went out for a smoke. When I came inside, she was waiting for me by the door. She instantly smelled it on me. She began freaking out and crying. I tried to convince her it was just cigarettes but she’s didn’t believe me. We had a long talk for around an hour where I cried and begged for her to forgive me. I begged her not to tell my dad and that it was just cigarettes. I think she almost agreed, but then my dad come downstairs. She had to tell him. 

My dad was enraged. I’ve never seen him that angry. He came over to smell me and said he knows it’s not cigarettes. They demanded to know where I got the “cigarettes” from and I told them a friend of mine gives them to me one at a time, which is why I couldn’t show them the cigarette package. 

My dad cried. I’ve never seen him cry before. My relationship with my parents is completely damaged. Frankly, I’ve never had a great relationship with them, but this really put the nail in the coffin. I feel horrible. My dad broke down and told me that he really trusted me and I destroyed him. I feel awful. Honestly, I thought about ending my life. 

My parents are already really toxic. They constantly belittle me and call me fat and ugly. But I still love them. And I know they love me. I wanted to salvage our relationship before I leave but I don’t know if that’s possible now. 

I’m supposed to be moving out in a month for college. They don’t want me too anymore. I don’t know what to do. They talked about sending me to Pakistan to live with my aunt. 

I would rather die then go back there. Honestly I don’t want to be alive right now. They’re never going to look at me the same way. I feel like I would be better off dead. Moving out was something I’ve been looking forward too my entire life. 

Part of me wants to just take the $500 I have saved up and run away. But I don’t know where I would go. 

How can I fix this? Is there even any possible way? I don’t know what to do",21Jul2020,2

1026,"I’m in my first role as an IT consultant. My employer runs training programmes and then deploys the graduates of its programme to client companies. The problem I’m facing lies in the fact that my employer appears to be dishonest when marketing us to clients.

My experience consists of my hobbyist programming prior to joining the company and the 3 months training that the company gave me. Here’s how deployment started:

My client was under the impression that I had experience with JavaScript (I didn’t other than copying and editing some for a slideshow in a web app). I was assigned the task of implementing a complex JavaScript library application. I struggled with it for a while, but JavaScript not being too difficult to understand and close enough to other languages I’d used, I ultimately managed to make progress with it, and I worked on that part of the project for a while.

I’ve now been moved onto another part of the project and it’s a significantly more challenging. I’ve only been on it for a few days so far, but I’m honestly really concerned that I don’t have the experience and knowledge to actually do it. But equally, I don’t know what to do about this fact.

1029,"I'm applying to med school this cycle. I need to take my MCAT test (planning to take it late August). Applying this cycle (apps open now) corresponds to starting fall 2021. Basically I'll have a year unfilled, if I get in this cycle. I found a job, which employs on a year cycle; starts this september, ends september-ish 2021, with possibility to renew for another year. I can end it on good terms after a year too. Applied, got an offer letter. The catch is it is very far from home. Haven't told parents yet. Parents are of the helicopter variety, and I'm really afraid they'll tell me to decline the offer to stay home, do med school stuff, and generally stay in their purview. I have gotten the advice ""just spring it on them the day you move out"" and have considered it, but that's a super awkward, potentially relationship-ending move. Also moving that far isn't a one-person operation. Dad mentioned in an offhand comment that if I get a job, that wouldn't be a bad thing, he just wants my MCAT done. There is a possibility they would want the score back before they are okay with me going anywhere, which would scuttle the whole thing.

There's just this one thing that occasionally gets brought up and bothers me. His best friend is a mutual friend of his ex-fiance.

Now, while he and his ex-fiance (let's call her Sara) don't speak anymore (at least to my knowledge), they were occasionally catching up before we started dating. At one point in our relationship, he admitted that he had cheated on his last girlfriend, the girl between me and Sara, with Sara.

Sara is married now, to the man that she had cheated on Brad with. From my understanding, for a long period that Brad was single, every time she would come back to town, they would ""catch up"" and Sara would repeatedly cheat on her now husband with Brad.

Given all of this information, Brad's best friend is their mutual best friend (We will call her Anna). Brad will hang out with Anna occasionally and sometimes they will call and catch up. It didn't bother me until I found out that Anna was also best friends with Sara. It made me incredibly uncomfortable. Brad and I are talking about buying a home at this point in our relationship and I'm just not sure if I'm comfortable with our new life together being the ""Tea"" to his still obviously interested ex-fiance.

Don't get me wrong, I like Anna. I don't like the fact that she plays this middle man card to his past, however.

I have a younger sister who's 3 years younger than me and she told the school who they informed social services but my parents never empathised or apologised for being too controlling. They let her go out whatever they want but aren't so scared of me.   


I feel helpless and lonely most nights, constantly crying and feeling suicidal of seeing people out my window who look around my age able to go out. I've looked into part-time jobs near me but I haven't had any luck. My dad somehow controls my bank account of seeing my personal statements and depositing money into it. Most friends think I should just wait another year and tolerate this until I graduate with a degree and find a stable job but I just get so envious and aggravated of being so interrogated by them and them assuming I'm sleeping with someone and threatening to cut me out of university if I don't go there to study.   


I really want a taste of freedom of wearing clothes I want and who I want to see without their constant approval. When I called my friend on the phone and showed the recordings of how loud my mum shouts in the house, I bursted into tears on how mentally tormenting and painful this is for me. My confidence is very low due to their constant comparing, calling me stupid that I won't get anywhere without them, saying I'll go to Hell if I disobey them and how I should be proud that I was born into a Muslim family. I e-mailed my university lecturer and he suggested I try to make a covert online bank account with MetroBank and maybe contact my uni's accommodation.   


I just feel like this is a huge step for me to have the courage to do this that I'll struggle with domestic duties but at least I don't need to be so manipulated and trapped, I don't know what I should do? I keep assessing the pros and cons that if I move out now, I could hang out with whoever I want, not be so much in fear, not cry myself to sleep on their insults and not waste my life of feeling so bored and depressed indoors with these toxic people. My parents don't give a shit about my mental health that they'd rather I die from depression than bring shame to the family. It's like nothing I do can ever please them or make them empathise with me. But on the other hand, I may really struggle financially and have to get used to doing everything on my own.

1036,"I used to be one of the happiest most sociable people when I was a little kid. I had alot of friends in my primary school (elementary for you americans) but as soon as I got to secondary school (high school) I started to get bullied really hard just because I have red hair. It sucks.

I get left out of everything because of it, I'm constantly harassed by my classmates, they put fucking GUM in my hair which takes ages to take out one time I literallyhad to cut it out, girls don't find me attractive because of it. Man it really fucking sucks. I lost all my confidence over the years because of all the bullying I received. I'm super quiet now, I don't speak in school because if I speak I get harassed even more, I get super nervous when I go out to the shops because I'm scared people from my school will harass me which they have multiple times. 

Random people have literally harassed me on the street because of it. I'm super nervous to talk to the girl I've liked for years because I feel like there's no point because girls don't like it. She never bullied me for it but I just have the feeling that she won't like me and if she tells people about me trying to talk to her I will get bullied even more. I just want it to stop.

1044,"So this will probably be typed out in a random manner. These last few years I have struggled with a handful of problems like the ones listed and I have yet to get help. I can not get myself to do anything but work and do drugs. I work 40+ hours a week and smoke weed and have experimented with psychaDelics. I have been consistently smoking weed since I was 14 (now 19) without my parents being aware until recently. I have never spoken to anyone about any of my issues. My parents seem to lack empathy towards their teenage son going through hard times. My issue is I have such intense *grey* thoughts. Nothing at all. I struggle to even put emotion into typing this. I haven’t felt a connection to a girl since I was 15 and dated my best friend and she cheated on my and it absolutely devasted me. I’ve hooked up with others but they have all deemed me boring. I was the class clown and now I am nearly emotionless. I wouldn’t say she was the direct cause of this feeling due to my child hood trauma that I have used drugs to cope with for years that I can barley remember anything Of my childhood years. That is good things, as the only memories I remember are traumatic and upsetting events, that seem to trigger me when I think of them. I smoke Weed to not have to think of them. I also really struggle to form sentences when speaking to people as I really trip over my words and basically just say anything. Like they don’t even make sense and this is when I’m talking to customers and such. I can’t feel connections to my parents or siblings. In the back of my head I love them
But I think of all the bad things I’ve witnessed throughout the years and it makes me push myself father and fatter away. I have never had a good relationship with my father. My mom suffered from a stroke about 2 years ago and although she is ok she is not the same and it kills me. Idk where I am going with this I just need advice as to what I should do. I know I should be talking to someone but it’s almost like I can’t even get myself to, even if I was forced to. I also feel to have lost a connection with myself, as I see myself and think of who I really am. I am not proud of who I am. This took a lot to type. Thank you if u read it

1045,"All I know is that I have extremely painful cycles that leave me uncomfortable in my own home, let alone in public. I already simply stay home from school when I have my period, but I haven't told them the real reason why. Maybe I should look into getting a medical certificate for this and has this been known to be a thing in the past or should it be acceptable in the future? 

I honestly think not any woman should be able to take leave off of work or their studies completely unquestioned because of this reason, as it is part of our everyday lives.. and I'm stuck between thinking we need to suck it up and learn to deal with it and that some women can and will use this as an excuse for time off when they, in reality, don't have any serious discomfort or pain in their cycles- they could lie. 
This is where a medical cert may help though- it serves as proof that your doctor believes you're truly in pain during those times, no? 

I just find myself in a cycle where I go to school fine and dandy but then suddenly take a few days off a month without explanation or with a lie which leaves me feeling guilty and as if my reason isn't truly valid as so many other women do fine. Goddamned power-houses, I swear. I feel like under the surface I'm just making excuses. 
But as I touched on before, not every woman is the same and not every woman has a heavy/painful period. I'm unfortunately one of them, though. And I know there are others. And it's not fun

1053,"My mom and I (22F) work at a restaurant.  I’ve been working there since 2012, but she’s been working there since the 90’s.  She went to school for restaurant management, and she lives and breathes her job.  She started as a waitress, but also hosts and bartends and became manager about 5 years ago.  Promoting her to manager was an easy decision, because she already went beyond her waitressing job and had already had more responsibilities.  Most people (besides a few jealous coworkers) believe she’s an incredible manager, and it’s a widely understood fact that the restaurant would be lost without her. 

The two owners appreciate the hell out of my mom, and are grateful for everything she does for the restaurant (believe me, it’s a lot).  The only person who seems to be unhappy with my mom is one of the owner’s wives (let’s call her Beth).  She works “in the office”, meaning she manages payroll and does all the bookkeeping stuff.  She constantly undermines my mom, always questioning her.  And then when my mom explains stuff to her, she asks her some stupid question about something my mom already explained.  It’s incredibly frustrating for my mom.  Some time ago, Beth also questioned why my mom gets an additional weekly manager pay in addition to her regular pay.  It’s like um... because my mom does way more than the average waitress, and should be compensated for the extra work she does...  That was really insulting to my mom.  Really, she doesn’t get paid ENOUGH for the shit that she does, and a lot of people agree.  I’m also gonna add that my mom worked all throughout quarantine, almost every single day, yet still made/makes less than our staff members who collected unemployment.  My mom also fully set up and programmed our new computer system at the beginning of the year, which really should have been Beth’s job, but she barely helped my mom with that.  If anything, she just questioned her on certain features of the new system, since the new computer company was one that my mom picked.

Yesterday another issue arose: my mom and the owners agreed about a month ago to order handheld tablets for the restaurant, so more orders can be put in more efficiently.  My mom was wondering when they were gonna come, and found out yesterday that Beth never signed for them.  Yet Beth didn’t want my mom to sign for them since she didn’t want them under my mom’s name.  Meanwhile, my mom’s name is already on the company as a manager/contact, and the tablets would be for the restaurant, not under one specific person.  Still my mom was insulted that Beth doesn’t want my mom’s name on anything.  The whole situation made my mom livid yesterday, all day, and she lost sleep over it.  She’s still pissed off today.  It seems like she’s just about fed up with Beth undermining her and not appreciating her.  

It seems to be a constant theme: Beth gets jealous that my mom gets praised for doing everything, but then any small task Beth is given, she screws up, but then doesn’t want my mom to fix it.  It might have something to do with the fact that Beth’s husband (one of the owners) is pretty tight with my mom, and sings her praises.  Beth is also rarely ever IN the restaurant, so I think she doesn’t understand the full extent of how my mom helps the business.  

I don’t think my mom would ever quit her job, and everyone else loves her, but my mom takes things personally so it’s upsetting to her when Beth undermines her.  I’m afraid she’s gonna crack and have some kind of screaming match with Beth over all this aggravation.  What should she do???

TL;DR: my mom works at a restaurant and one of the owner’s wives who manages paperwork constantly undermines, questions her and doesn’t appreciate her enough and my mom has just about had it.  What should she do?",21Jul2020,1

1057,"Hello, this is a throwaway account for obv reasons. 

Back at the start of the coronavirus, our (UK based) university ended the year a week early with the classes all being done online in the usual manner like anyone would expect. I went home and eventually the entire class was told that the exams would be done online.

Essentially the exams would be done on paper or as a word document and then you scan it and send it back using a special site made for homework submissions (bespoke to the university). We were given an extra hour (3hrs total 10:00 - 13:00) to complete and submit the exam which would then be marked over the next few months.

The class had a WhatsApp group chat that the faculty were aware of and which the majority of the year (\~200 students)  were a part of. We would all discuss deadlines/coursework/parties and obv the exams.

Fast forward to May and the exams are taking place, the only problem being is that those same 200 students all tried to get the paper and download it at the same time. This obviously meant the website had crashed and the papers were not able to be accessed until around 10:30. I was talking about the issue in the WhatsApp group chat until the exam was accessible at \~10:30 at which I started. This was fine for the most part as I had revised a lot beforehand and I eventually submitted it at 12:48 sharp at which I was relieved. 

My problem arose about a couple of weeks ago. The university found out that students had cheated in an online discord server from a 2nd-year student taking screenshots. I wasn't worried when I found out as I was not involved in this. That was until I got an email saying this:

[https://imgur.com/a/47yT2U6](https://imgur.com/a/47yT2U6) (The second redaction is just the Site we used to download the paper form)

the one message they are referring to the message I sent here regarding the exam paper not being accessible:

[https://imgur.com/a/Y6cuYcq](https://imgur.com/a/Y6cuYcq)

Now I hate cheaters as much as the next person, (and my course at university certainly has its 'gunners' who are there purely for the degree and will literally do anything to get grades.) and I understand that talking in general, even if it isn't about questions, is not allowed during the examination; but the exam itself wasn't accessible till much later on after this message was sent.

I now have an interview next week on zoom about the case and 'suspected academic offense'.

[https://imgur.com/a/TZnaoIH](https://imgur.com/a/TZnaoIH)

I'm not sure what I should really be saying to them aside from what I've said here. I downloaded my discord data to show to them at the interview that I wasn't on any server at the time but aside from that I am lost for what I should say or do at the interview aside from telling the truth. 

I really do not want to resit the exams as I have already sold my notes, I only just started taking CBT for my anxiety so right now I'm trying not to be in a 'frozen' state of paranoia thinking about '*what if*' scenarios.

I feel insecure about having never left the country or found anything I wanted to do. I never had the money to do things because I grew up dirt poor, and my parents always quickly stifled any interest I had in anything they deemed ""weirdo shit"". My relationship with my parents caused me to withdraw, and I have intimacy issues because of it.

I've had depression for about 20 years and I've only been to therapy a few times. I was a young and stupid kid, and a pathological liar so I didn't get anything out of it. I was prescribed an anti-depressant and a mood stabilizer, but stopped taking them because I was told they made me an asshole. I went to college and dropped out after one semester because I couldn't really absorb any of the information being taught, and truth be told, I only really wemt to shut my mom up who asked me every day ""What are you gonna do with your life?""

I don't have any real skills, and I've never felt passionate or interested enough to get into hobbies. I feel like a cold, boring, gray, ghost who's just drifting through life.

I moved in two months ago and it rapidly became clear that we have very different expectations about what ""taking coronavirus seriously"" means.  I dealt with my concerns about her doing more high risk things like going to the mall and letting her daughter see friends by deciding to stay in the basement we rent from them as much as possible, although my husband doesn't do this and is angry at me for doing it.

But now she is saying she will send her daughter back to school (there is a choice between online and in person learning, and she and her fiance will be home all day) which is a way higher risk and one that I do not want to deal with if I have literally any safer choice.  I talked to my husband about it, and he doesn't really seem to be on my side, but said that we should talk to her and if she is intent about sending her daughter to school we can move out.

I've grown quite popular in many wildlife groups, where I'm the ""bug expert"" as I'm into insects (specifically bees, wasps and the like) and I've probably saved thousands of them by convincing people that they're not a threat. 
Every day people ask me for advice about how to deal with the wasp nest that they found in their garden, or the bees that colonized their roof, this sort of problems. 

I've come to a point where I'm mentioned several times a day to deal with posts about insects, even in unrelated groups, where comments are mostly ""kill them with fire"" and flames are almost always guaranteed. 

I've come to a point that even opening a notification gives me anxiety, because most of the time there's a flame going on and people will be rude to me and I'll be rude to them or to people in real life and that makes me feel like shit.

Then one week later I log in again out of curiosity and find dozens of notifications, most of which from people mentioning me or sending me PM's asking the same questions and making the same arguments over and over. 

I've seriously been thinking of deleting myself from Facebook lately, but on the other hand I like educating people about my field and I run groups and pages where hundreds of people can't wait for my informative posts. I don't want to lose them, or let uneducated people kill harmless bugs because there's no one to tell them that they're harmless.

Most of my friends deleted themselves from Facebook long ago, and I would've done it too if it weren't for the situation I just described. I just don't know what to do. I need some advice.
Thanks for reading through all this wall of rambling.

1072,"I don’t ever want to be someone who comes across as anti-trans, but I’ve been feeling very distraught lately with the idea of financially supporting JK Rowling and what that makes me.

Most people say doing so is a personal choice, but I am still confused as to whether giving her a source of income is equivalent to supporting and condoning her anti-trans speeches. 

Does giving the franchise money mean I overlook what she says/stands for?

This is really long, and I apologize.

Back story: Mom has been through a lot of shit health wise- my mom and I live half way across the country from the rest of our family. We've been out here for over twenty years. In November of last year she had  what I was a told her second stroke. Now all things considered she's well off. Can talk and hold conversation, can sort of care of herself such a bathing, brushing her teeth and hair. 

But she's.. Changed. She's more angry, prone to more screaming when she's upset. Ignoring parts in conversation to make herself right which might be part of the stroke. (Think Brooklyn rage screaming) I got myself a portable AC unit for my bedroom with my own money. We have central AC but she doesn't like running it because it's expensive. That's fair, so I got my AC to keep myself comfortable with my skin conditions. 

I come home after going grocery shopping for us, and the first thing is her asking me to run the AC- when it's reasonable? My boyfriend is in quarantine with me and was using it. It was 88°. My room was closed, central AC wasn't on just the portable. So I tell my boyfriend to turn it off because she's unhappy with it even though I don't understand it. He comes out and says no, because he was using it- mom literally lost her mind. Screaming, red in the face, spitting, that it was her house and her rules, that she can do what she wants. She comes into my room yelling and constantly complaining that it isn't clean in a way she likes it, that she should be allowed in whenever and always demands a place to sit. I pay to live here: electricity, phone, internet, entertainment. I pay my share to live in the space but if I leave there's literally no one who would be willing to move in to pay to live here, to figure all her appointments, take her to them, do her medications, buy and cook all her meals. 

This is one of many times she's gotten so angry and neither of us could understand why. Not to mention she needs help, refuses therapy adamantly, everytime I talk about her doctor's visits or medications she gets angry at me saying 'they won't help me anyways, or they're going to make shit worse, and I've come close to dying so many times I don't give a shit anymore.' But.. if I can't take care of her she'll have another stroke- which she was walking around with her diabetes sky high for nearly a year before her last stroke. So it could have been prevented if she didn't stop visiting her cardiologist, and scheduling an endo before all of this. If she doesn't take her medications she won't be so lucky next time. She's told me her own daughter to kill her if she ends up worse. 

I'm just feeling guilty for wanting to leave and never coming back. I'm mad at her for taking her own health and making it worse and letting me deal with the immediate fallout. Getting screaming angry if I forget anything. I feel trapped being entirely responsible for another person even though I find it hard to take care of myself. I'm just trying to deal with the emotions that I feel. I don't know if they're valid. I want to leave, I can't go anywhere without worrying about how she's going to eat if I don't cook. If I don't pay my part of the bills how would she live at all? I wanted to save up for a vacation with my boyfriend- and even if I can save up for it who's going to take care of her for a straight week while I'm gone? To fix electronics she doesn't remember how to use? I don't have a life anymore and I know I shouldn't feel bad because god forbid she raised me as a single mother this whole time and I owe her my time in return but it's so much harder when she's so angry and treating whatever health she has left as an inconvenience and attacking me for it.

To preface- I am never going to leave my mother. I love her and no one in the family can or would be willing to care for her. But I'm combating guilt and my own selfishness and feeling like a failure because I can't even talk to her anymore without her regaling to calling me an 'awful child' or a 'wicked witch' and me getting extremely defensive and snappy, and being on guard literally all of the time now.

Tl,Dr; I feel guilty, fed up, frustrated, sad, trapped in trying to to take care of my mom.

1076,"I've wanted to change my name for a while. It started out being reasonable, my first name was 1 of 4 and I hated it. Then I decided I had no connection to my middle name, my parents didn't even really pick it, one of the nurses did. Finally I decided my dad and I were distant enough that I wasn't proud of my last name, either. 

This worries me. It feels like I'm trying to run from who I was, I just wanted to change my first/middle names. My dad isn't so bad, but I often refrain from telling him a lot because he criticizes ""frivolous"" things or makes jokes out of them. He isn't close with his family at all, and my mother's side is out of the question, it would be an insult to my dad. 

There is one person in my family I can stand, and whose name I'd like to take. However, bringing myself to ask her is hard. I know she'd say yes, but she might bring it up with my dad. Furthermore, it is a married name. I like her maiden name, too, but feel more attached to her married. Is it even hers' for me to ask about taking?

1089,"Hi guys. I am needing some pretty serious advice. Let me give the short version of a long back story. 

One of my best friends is living in a situation so bad at home that it is a danger to her health. We will call her Jane. 

Jane had a very serious bedbug problem at her previous home.  Along with other cleanliness issues. She lived there about 6 months. I recommended her to my former landlord when she stated she wanted to move.  Jane never mentioned the bug issue. Her late husband was the person who disclosed it when i went to help them move. 

The house she moved into was immaculate when she moved in. Within weeks, the house was completely unfit to live in.

 It has been nearly 3 years since she has been living there now. I have only been over a handful of times. Mostly to feed pets when she is out of town. 

The stove has not been cleaned since she moved in. The bathtub is solid black. There is food that has been left out for over a year that has grown so much mold that you cannot tell what it was. There is a buildup of human feces on the back of the toilet seat. 

Anytime we hang out, it's always been at my house. Over the weekend we went on a trip together with another girl friend. I spotted 2 bedbugs crawling out of Janes suitcase upon our arrival to the hotel.  When i went to shower, my back and arm had several bedbug bites on it. Her luggage was in my trunk. This can only mean the bugs came off of her. 

After the trip, myself and our other friend both have found bugs in our vehicles. They were transfered from Jane's luggage to both of ours. I found multiple bugs in my suitcase. 
Prior to this trip I was not aware Jane still had a bedbug problem. 

I need to stress that my friend and I both love Jane very much. She's a very good person and we truly believe she does not realize she has a problem. I cannot see Jane again until the problem is addressed. I now will have to spend hundreds of dollars to get my house inspected and possibly hundreds more if any bugs are found. This can not happen again. 
Jane deserves to live a very good, normal life. How can our friend and myself approach Jane about this? 

She does not have family we can speak to about it. 

This has to be handled VERY delicately. She has had very tragic events in her life and having her 2 closest friends confront her about something like this could have fatal results. This is 100% a mental problem. I realize this needs to be handled by a professional, but as it is now affecting my life, i have to do something. It is just much more touchier than simply telling her ""you have a problem.""",21Jul2020,3
1091,"Long story, but I feel the context needs to be said before the actual problem. So I work in a public school (Not going to say where nor what type of school it is for safety reasons). I am a secretary and I am the face of the department, so I have to interact with people more than anyone working in my dept. My ""Office"" is basically that work room where you put your printers, scanners, etc. I shared it with one or two other people, but its not that big either. 

When COVID started to get worse in March they send us to work from home. At first my internet was not good and phone reception is the worst at my house, so I couldn't do my job as well. I fixed my internet issues and they gave us this app that connects to our office phones thru internet, so I was in heaven working from home for a few months. In June I think, we get an email from my boss's boss stating that our department need to go back to work, so we did, but with less hours in the office. When I saw the email I asked one of the office personnel if I can move scanners, printers, and all other things that people come in to my ""office"" for as far away from my desk. So that when they come in and get their printout or whatever they're the required distance from me. They said ""we'll see"". So,  I was fine with that since I didn't have much contact with people and got to work most days at home. Then they told us it was an error and we shouldn't have been working at the office since the school was still closed. My boss still asked for permission for us to be here (I have no idea why since everyone could do their job from home since they put all forms/documents online and can sign electronically). Anyways, it got approved and we stayed in the office with the same limited schedule. 

Again, I addressed the distancing issue in my office to my boss and reminded that same personnel about it. They both dismissed me stating that they will see what they can do. BTW the employees who were also in my office, I guess technically our office, got moved to another private office for the same COVID procedures. I was a little perplexed that they didn't also moved me since my office is technically a ""common area"", but didn't say anything. Quickly after that I got sick and I had to take the COVID test. At the same time another few people in our department got sick and tested positive for COVID. Thank God I didn't even though everyone in my department visits my office more than once a day to use the machines. I guess my mask, social distancing, and all that hand sanitizing did work. When I was waiting for my results and heard of others testing positive, I asked my boss AGAIN to move the machines away from me. He basically said no because ""nobody comes to my office only him"" and he wanted to run it by that personnel that has nothing to do with my office, but has been there more years than me. BTW that personnel also tested positive so they're not even in the office nor will be for a long time. I finally got my negative results and went back to work. As soon as I came in I started disinfecting, cleaning, and moving around furniture. I didn't move the printers/machines because I didn't want to overstep him, but he saw me moving things and asked what the plan was for moving them. I took that as permission to move them so I did as far away from my desk. I was happy and almost no one came to my office. Now I am seeing more and more people as in employees coming in, leaving my door open (I prefer it closed since we are not open to the public yet), and even custodians coming in during my work hours (before 6pm) to clean and take out the trash and not keeping the required distance from me. I have addressed this issue to my boss (who is not at the office) he ignored my message. I know he saw it and ignored it since he emailed me about other work things. 

My question is, should I go over his head and email/talked to his boss stating how he is not following COVID procedures and dismissing me on anything to do with change in the office? Or should I just let it be and pray that whomever comes in doesn't give me the virus? BTW I have proof of every time I asked for the changes to be made.",21Jul2020,1

1095,"Long story short, a close coworker of mine has been verbally harassed by a higher up at my company for months. Thankfully it’s not sexual harassment, but he’s constantly telling how that she’s worthless and can’t do anything right and all kinds of terrible things. He says these kind of things to the whole office, but he’s especially bad to this coworker. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve seen her break down and cry twice in the office because of the way she gets treated.

A few weeks ago, she went to HR to complain again, so they said it would get worked out. They talked to the higher up, but he didn’t take it seriously. He even joked about that meeting with me and a different coworker not even a minute after it ended.

My coworker recently had a meeting with the CEO and HR, and they demoted her. They said that she wasn’t productive enough so they’re moving her to a position where she’ll report directly to the CEO (it’s a small company, so this isn’t a huge deal). In the meantime, she’ll report directly to the higher up that’s harassing her. In the past, her new position technically reported to the CEO, but it really reported to the same higher up.

I’m absolutely disgusted at the way this situation is unfolding, and I want to do something about it. I’m not supposed to know about it, so I can’t complain to HR (which would probably lead to me being punished too). I’m already looking for new jobs, but I’m considering filing a complaint with the Department of Labor. I think my coworker is considering it too, but I don’t know if she’ll actually go through with it. Does anyone have advice on how to file a claim with getting my coworker in trouble?

TL:DR My coworker got demoted for reporting harassment, and I want to file a legal complaint without getting my coworker in more trouble.",21Jul2020,0

Some background: I (16F) don't have any siblings currently living with me, I have a dog who I take on walks regularly, and I live with my parents who don't particularly take much notice of me. I have been friends with these people for over 3 years and were extremely close during school, but only two people kept contact with me when lockdown began. 

I also live in England so we are allowed to meet up in small groups. 

So since lock down began, I was okay but started to become very lonely recently. I have been out with another friend once but that has been one of the only  times I have socialised with a friend outside of social media.

It all started about 4 weeks ago when 4 of my friends all went out together to celebrate a birthday and I wasn't invited. I didn't really mind because I wasn't too close with the birthday girl so I just moved on, and because it was only 4 out of the 7 we usually have in our group. But then the next week they met up again, this time with all 6 of them and I still wasn't invited (bare in my mind, this was the week of my birthday). And everytime they go out, they always post a picture of them together and any other photos they took that day. 
This has happened every week and I'm starting to feel left out but I don't know if I'm overthinking or not, and if I should do about it.

I do really like them because they're the first people I felt comfortable around and I have told them this.

1097,"Hi everyone, I'm a 17 M having a long-distance relationship with an 18 F in another state and she's going through a lot of issues relating her homelife and college right now. If anyone could give me any suggestions or advice on how she could improve her current situation in any way I'd be so so grateful. Anyway, let me explain what's going on. My girlfriend currently lives with just her mom, as her parents have been divorced for a while now and are not on good terms. Her home life has been very stressful and straining to stay the least because her mother is very toxic, so she was planning on attending an out-of-state college this fall to finally get away from it all and start living a healthy life. She was all set to move into the dorms next month until she realized that the grants she applied for didn't go through at all because deadlines were shortened when she wasn't aware. She needs $10,000 if she wants to keep going to college and neither she nor her mother has enough for that. She's currently struggling to apply for any grants she can but it's too late for a majority of them. Her mother says that if they can't get help from the school or any additional grants she won't be able to leave this fall. My girlfriend is currently devastated because she's blaming herself for not applying for the grants correctly and doesn't want to keep living with her toxic mother any longer. I'm doing all I can to be with her and support her through all this mess, but I don't know how to advise her actions at all.

We got there and we everyone took of the bed clothes of each bed and gave them a wash. However, i forgot to wash mine that day. We proceeded to drink that evening and eventually all went to bed around 2 a.m. I was too drunk to care about the conditions of the bed. I just jumped into bed and went to sleep. 

I woke up on the Saturday morning and was okay. Went about the day great but yet again forgot to wash the bed clothes. Once that evening came around we were drinking again and a repeat of the previous night occured with myself sleeping in the same bed. 

However, when i woke up on the Sunday morning my left leg was covered in bites. My back was also covered in bites but they didn't look the same as the bites on my leg. So, after this for the rest lf the day i would feel a random itch on my body and it would get really bad during night time. I moved to a different bed to sleep in on the sunday night.

I didn't wake up with any more bites but the icthing is still there with it being worse at night. Went to sleep on the monday and the came back home today. I am now lying in my own bed and can feel random itches all across my body.

1100,"So where to start.. Hopefully this post isn't too incredibly long, but bear with me.

So, about three years ago now I was down and out on my luck. Was making poor decisions and lost my job and got kicked out of my house. So my girlfriend decided to allow me to come stay with her and her parents. I felt super blessed at the time and though of it as a great way to get back out on my feet. Well things didn't really work out exactly as planned again. And we're still currently living here.

Now, we're still currently living here because my credit went to shit when I lost my last house and I'm still recovering from it. I made bad choices for a year or two after that and didn't help it at all. My girlfriends credit is great but she has absolutely no intentions on moving out of her parents house until she finishes her degree. Which I understand because getting a degree is hard work. I'm also pursuing my degree but I have a bit more time to work due to my degree being all online.

That said, I was very close to having the money saved to being able to buy furniture and set a down payment on a place. But covid just took my job away from me. I was laid off for about two months before I got an email saying they didn't plan to see an influx in business and that I would be permanently separated from the company, leaving me with a few hundred bucks and a good-bye. 

I'm at the point where I literally can not live with her parents any longer. My mental and physical health are deteriorating extraordinarily fast due to depression and feeling like a failure. Her parents make it 10x worse by talking about me and my depression behind my back. I have literally no space to escape here and haven't for almost 3 years now. I feel like I could break down and cry most days.

My girlfriend has absolutely no intentions to move out. I try and try to convince her that I will take care of basically all the bills, that she only has to work for a day or two out of the week but she won't listen to me. I just can not get her on the same page. I love her but she just doesn't understand the mental anguish that this situation is putting me through on a daily basis. I'm usually always a happy person but this has taken such a toll on me mentally that I feel completely lifeless. Void of all energy.

1105,"Ok, for some context: 
I’m a cashier at a well-to-do cafe in SoCal; we serve coffee, brunch, stuff like that counter-service style (order at counter, take a number to your table and we bring it to you). We are also located on a busy street where people bounce from shop to shop, whatever. It’s in an higher income area so I have to deal with lots of roughies, all that stuff. 

Anyway, here’s the conflict- we offer a 10% discount to all other employees employed on our street. This is for fellow service employees to get a discount at our place, and build local regulars, all that stuff. 

There’s one guy that comes in almost every day and orders an iced americano, and he’s in his 30s, white, relatively fit, has A DOG with him (a pet), and you can tell he has a higher paying job (nice clothes, mannerisms). Every time he orders his coffee, he asks for the street discount for employees, and I definitely don’t get the vibe that he works on our street. The first time he came in, as a matter of fact, I asked him what shop he works in. After a full 7 second pause, he answers that he “doesn’t feel comfortable telling me”??? Then he proceeds to sit outside on our patio with his laptop and dog by the table and look like he’s working on his laptop... 

So how the hell do I get him to stop getting the discount? At this point, I give it to him bc I know he’s just gonna lie, and I feel too awkward to ask again. I mean, I’m just the cashier, I don’t feel like I’m in a position of power to do so. How can I expose him very obviously so that he stops doing this, without having an awkward confrontation?",21Jul2020,2
1106,"Obligatory ""not my real account"" here, but here's the situation.  


Me and my ex-girlfriend, now best friend, are in a ""Friends With Benefits"" relationship. We use each-other for physical affection because we are both single. I don't really want to get into anything serious with her for various reasons, I just don't think we would fit well together. My issue is, I'm worried that if and when I find someone and break off the Friends With Benefits relationship, that she'll be upset. I've made it clear to her on multiple occasions that we are just Friends With Benefits and using each-other to receive physical affection, because we are both physical affection dependent people. If we don't get it for a long time, we start to deteriorate in terms of mental health. So my main issue is, I'm worried about breaking it off with her at some point and she'll be upset, even if I made it clear to her that we were just that, Friends With Benefits, which I did. I'm also afraid of maybe being ""MeToo'd"", which is unlikely, but I didn't do anything illegal, we're both above the age of 18, and she did consent to this. So... I'm wondering, am I an asshole here? Should I be fine? How would I tell her if and when it comes to me needing to break it off? I just don't really want to hurt her because she's an amazing human being, and deserves all the best. I just am not that. At least, not for her.  


Thanks for the help in advance, I'm just exceptionally worried about this.",21Jul2020,1

1110,"So just as the title says I’m stuck in a toxic work environment until at least the end of August (assuming I can find another job). Currently I am 8 months pregnant and have been struggling with maintaining positivity in my life because of the place I work for. I haven’t left because I need the maternity leave they offer. I’ve been getting by okay enough until this past week. 

About a week ago I asked an HR employee (the only HR representative we have) a question about submitting an overtime sheet (she’s also our only payroll representative). I didn’t understand what she needed on the sheet and asked for clarification on what she had asked me to do. We’re all working from home so a lot of stuff is misconstrued over IM. She literally responded telling me with *don’t question me just do what I ask*. 

Fast forward to today and she IM’d a supervisor (whom im friends with) and told him about how she told me to shut up and how it was super satisfying and he should try it sometime. She also said she thought I would report her but even if I did the owner would be glad for how she addressed me. This conversation was sent to me in the form of screenshots over discord. 

Ultimately I’m going to find another job while I’m on leave and take whatever I get. I still am really hurt and so tired of waking up every day to work for an extremely toxic company. I’ve always struggled with depression and anxiety. I’m really hating myself for not leaving this company years ago. What can I do to get through these next couple months? Also, I’m trying my damnedest to not say anything to this person or attempt to stick up for myself as I don’t want to dig a deeper hole.",21Jul2020,1

nightmare experience at a headshop in colorado. 1st vist, every employee wore a mask except for one who just lazily tied a bandana on his neck. he wasn't assisting me this time and i didn't have th energy to argue. all the other employees were wonderful. this time, they have him on REGISTER! so i go to check out and Very kindly and respectfully ask if he minds wearing his mask. dude gets super defensive and rude, saying it's not a state law nor from the governor so he doesn't have to. dude who's checking out proudly repeats him. other employees are clearly uncomfortable but don't say a thing. i almost walked out but i really wanted my product. all i could say was ""hm, i got a national emergency text days ago declaring it law.."" since he's a damn liar.

1115,"I’m a 24F and I truly believe I don’t have a best friend. I guess I think a best friend is someone that you spend most of your time with, talk to quite regularly, and share your deepest darkest secrets with. They are people that think of you as the first person to call in a crisis and they consider you the first person they want to hang out when they’re bored. I feel like I don’t really have that and I’ve always had a hard time coping with it, so I’m reaching out to see if this is normal, if I’m doing something wrong, or if I’m just looking too deep into it LOL

I grew up having a group of best friends in high school. We still talk to each other and hang out, but I moved away from my hometown for college and have noticed they all became a lot closer to each other in my absence. I think they still consider me a good friend, but I know that they would consider each other best friends. They’ve made a lot more memories and inside jokes together since they live a lot closer to each other, so I’ve always felt a little left out even though I’m still very much included.

I had a couple people I considered best friends in middle school/high school move out of state for college. While I consider them my oldest friends and still keep in contact with them and see them when they’re in town, I barely know anything about their personal lives unless we decide to catch up after a few months of not talking. 

I have circles of different groups of friends from college but none I would consider my best friends. I know that a lot of people I acquainted myself with have a different core group of friends as well. 

I have a boyfriend who is amazing. But even he has his own group of really close tight-knit friends. I would consider him a best friend, but I feel like that’s kind of a given because we’re in a relationship lol

I have two older sisters that I’m really close with, but even they have their own core groups of people who they consider their best friends. 

Overall, I feel like I have a relatively healthy circle of people that support me and care for me. But I don’t think that I am anyone’s first choice if they needed someone to confide in, or if they want to just hang out, run errands, or have a quick chat on the phone. If I am close to people, I am sure that they have other people that they would consider “closer” than me. 

It’s a silly concern but sometimes I find myself wondering and stressing about who my bridesmaids would be and if those people would even want to pick me as their bridesmaid..lol

For even more context, I’m a pretty low-maintenance friend. I share memes with a lot of people here and there, but I don’t really ever call people just to talk or for advice. I reach out every so often through text to see how certain people are doing. I don’t initiate too many in-person hangouts (pre-Covid) because I’m a little introverted and I like to stay home a lot of the time. 

Am I looking too much into this? Is having a best friend really as common as I think it is, or do a lot of you function without one?",21Jul2020,1

1119,"I want to start by saying that this might get swept under by the thousands of posts but any advice is appreciated. And also to put a disclaimer that this about ED(eating disorders). So here's some background.

I have always been active and fit majority of my life. I wasnt a picky eater and grew up with ""appreciate what you have and never be wasteful"" So I had healthy relationship food and enjoyed eating. But when I turned 18 I started to run to health issues. At first I thought it was just starting college stress and freshman 15. But I started steadily gaining weight, feeling sluggish, infrequent periods. I didnt really care about the weight gain. My mother and sister were tall and on the so called ""bigger"" side but they've always been so confident and beautiful to me  so I loved my body the way it was. But then that 15 became 30 then 40 and I was starting to get legitimately concerned. Any large amount of weight gained or lossed without cause is health concern in my book. But the doctors just recommended birth control for the infrequent periods and ""diets"" (keto, vegan etc. Plus exercise)  for the weight gain. 

Now I was already eating ""healthy. I never liked greasy food and or sweets so I mostly ate what is always ate. So I tried to diet. More salads, less carbs, more exercise and more and more weight gain. I was getting very concerned and understandably frustrated but I would get the same bloodwork and nothing was found. ""Have you tried so and so diet"" and ""weightlifting is a great way to fight weight gain"" YES I have tried but no luck doc. After years of constant run around I decided ""Screw it"" and stopped dieting and focused just bringing up my stamina and stopped taking birth control. 

Well after getting off birth control I ended getting pregnant with my then fiance. After giving birth and not having my aunt flow for almost a year I learned I had PCOS. Now i.was.HYPE. Finally I diagnoses. Treatment. Although it's not a very well researched disorder, years of health concerns had an answer. But by this time I gained nearly 60 pounds and was considered overweight. Doctors just said take birth control and ""have you tried keto"" ( I swear I felt like blood vessel was going to pop"" Now I'm just focusing on being healthy. But lately it's been so hard. I'm scared to see my family especially. They constantly make passive aggressive remarks and pick on my weight. When I try to laugh it off and explain the disorder they say things like ""so what does this disorder do make you eat?"" or when I decline certain food the say ""yea shes right she definitely doesnt need this"" to my husband. Some people just say straight up to my face  ""you're getting fat don't you care for your health"". 

My solution? I avoid the hell out of them and look at body positivity on instagram. It works wonders. But with things opening again, family is insisting in seeing me, my husband and son. Today my cousin invited us to her engagement party in September. My sisters want me to go and I said I'm not sure if I will. They got upset and said that they're family and I need stop avoiding them. Just the thought of seeing then gives a tremendous amount of anxiety. I dont really show when I'm down and I try to be as chill and positive as possible. But I dont think i can see them. After the invite i cant even eat because I'm so stressed. And whenever I talk to someone they are usually dismissive and say ignore them. If I could then why am I writing this shaking and hiding in the bathroom. I just dont want to damage my health any further by going to extremes but I'm really teetering and I don't know what to do.

1124,"Hi,

I cannot make a decision and I always had a hard time making a decision because I am thinking about all the missed opportunities.

I went back to high school and finished my degree when I was 22. I had excellent grades and went to the U.S., took some college courses but still felt lost. My plan was to go for psychology but then I realized I do not want to become a therapist and HR or Marketing is not for me (did a few internships). I always wanted to do something meaningful and conventional, something like medicine, law or nursing. 

This year I applied to all three programs and got accepted to the law and medicine program in my home country and to the nursing program in the U.S. 

My dream country remains the U.S. and thinking about leaving really makes me sad. When I think about nursing there are many plus points, but then I think I could also become a doctor and have more responsibility, more interesting subjects to study. My mum is a doctor too so I am a bit afraid that she influences me and I have a bit of an ADD mind. I can be very focused but I am bad at working practically precisely (I mean fine motor skills). 

When I think about law I consider it as a great way to fight for what I believe in and help people to my best ability according to the law. Furthermore, I love writing and sitting at a desk. However, I am afraid that law will be too much competition due to my sensitive nature, but when I fight for something I can become very devoted. Maybe it is just a matter of confidence...

Most people in my surrounding tell me to go to med school because it is something meaningful which has future, but I do not want to do something only for the money, I really want to do something which aligns with my true values. I love helping people but I am also trying to stay realistic about the long working hours and deaths doctors have to face. 

I do not care how long I will study, law will be about 6-7 years in my home country, the same goes for medicine. Nursing would be so much shorter. 

Is there anyone who could give me some advice and can tell me how I can make a decision? I know at the end of the day I have to do what is best for me but what if we have too many options and everything is appealing?  How did you decide for a the right career?",21Jul2020,1

1132,"Necessary backstory: I didn’t have the best childhood, I’m 20f now almost completely financially independent and was recently diagnosed with PTSD from childhood emotional abuse and other things. 
The flashbacks are vivid and I have many horrible memories of how I was treated as a kid, however, my parents hold fast that I’m a bad person/was a bad kid and deserved everything that happened. They also say a lot of it didn’t happen, or they didn’t say certain things. They constantly said I thought I was a good person and that other people thought I was a good person at school/work because I had manipulated them and myself into believing it.
Now I’m working on cutting myself off from my family as I believed a few things 1 I’m a good person who doesn’t make decisions that would hurt other people 2 I was a different child and my family reacted badly to me 3 I can’t be safe or happy as long as my parents/sister are in my life controlling everything I do and telling me I’m a terrible person constantly. 
Here’s the issue: as I’ve been cutting them off my sister found out and made several painful claims that culminated in her saying I’m officially estranged from her. She said she won’t even tell her kids she ever had a sister. This was spurred on by me blocking her on a new social media account. I called her to discuss b/c she sent me a very long message. 
My partner claims the message she sent was manipulative and that she’s just trying to control me and has made some good point about things she said on the phone call that were to demean me and make me doubt myself. 
But it’s worked I doubt myself. What if I’ve tricked my partner into thinking I’m a good person so now he can’t objectively read the messages she sent me and he thinks I’m a good person so that’s why he supports me but In reality I’m a terrible person who was a terrible kid and is now hurting my parents and my sister by making myself a victim and severing ties with them? What if I’m really a bad person who’s making excuses and not paying for my sins as a bad child by cutting off my family? 
I’m terrified. 
My parents are now coming up with reasons to talk to me in their house and it’s terrifying. Such as; I showed up to drop their things off and my dad came outside at first he said “you need to come inside I need to talk to you” I stated my partner was in the car so I didn’t have a lot
Of time, then he said “we have paperwork inside for you” I thought it wouldn’t be there for another two weeks so when I said I had 10-20 minutes and my partner could be there with us (for safety) he said “no the paper work isn’t ready” “but you have to talk to us before we sign the paperwork and agree to our rules”. 
That’s where it’s been left at. I’m so scared of them, but I’m even more scared I’m secretly this horrible selfish person who’s avoiding making up my mistakes. 
My partner recommended I come here for some objective views on the situation, id love opinions on the messages she sent me. And if it’s determine I really am just bad I promise to understand, id never want to be a bad person.

1133,"I'm 21 F and I'm clueless in what I should in my life.
I'm half swedish half english and I grew up in France for the 19 first years of life. 
I have a big brother and we both went to the same French schools until university where we took different paths.  I never got bullied because my brother (more exactly my mom) got the bullies out of the schools before I came there (I had the expectations of getting bullied because I'm not French). 
My mom have dyslexia (a condition that affects your reading) and dysorthographia (a condition that affects your writing) and spotted I have the same thing as her when I was really young thus cared a lot more for me and boosted my self-esteem sky high to make sure I would feel bad about me being behind my peers at school. This created a strange energy at home. My brother would come back from school with no homework (because he didn't have any) and chill, while I had to, at least spend 3 to 5 hours on homework everyday just so I could keep up. My mom would ""call out my brother for being lazy and ask why he couldn't be just like me"" which made me both proud ,and afraid (and still am) to tell when things didn't well at school.
My brother got better grades than me making feel like doesn't matter how hard I try to do my best it would be worth very little, and I hid that feeling to my mom very often.
My brother knew really quickly what he wanted to with his life while I didn't and still am not fully sure what to with mine. I barely got the French baccalorea with ""good enough"" remark (it's woth a bit more than just get it) at 18 alongside losing my dad to old age (he was 72 when he pass away) and went to an expensive French IT engineering school which education system was so different to what I was used I drop out after the first year (making feel like I threw my mom's money out the window).
I took a sabbatic year afterwards where I went to a folk school to ""work on"" my English alongside doing some theater (half in Sweden and half in England). That year was the best year I had in my adult life.
Through that year, my mom continuously reminded me that I need to think of what I wanted to do with my life and I only started of when there was only a quarter left of my sabbatic year and when like ""I like video games so why not do something with"" and registered into a Swedish university to study game design in english. I got in the game design and programming bachelor programme last year at the last moment (3-4 days before the first course started). 
At first, the year went great. I kept up with everyone, I felt like I could do this and then my computer could no longer read the hard drive, I had to change it and lost a lot of work that was enough to break my motivation and I told my mom about the computer problem but didn't tell about how felt I was afraid that she would get mad at me... and well I screw up my year and she founded out progressively about it and was mad for not telling her sooner and we agreed at that time upon I should try to apply for next year but in a different minor.
But right now, she believes that an academic pursuit is not for me and I should get a job while telling me that if I want to continue on this path, I must go through all of it and not screw it up again.
She told me today that I'm the only one in the family  who for some reason can't ""do it"". I have never told her about the moments of my life where I feel like no matter what I do, it won't matter.  I don't want her to feel bad about me and I want to prove to her I can ""do it"" but it feels like I can never make it happen.
So right now I don't know what to do with my life. Should I try to continue with university or should I stop and get a job somewhere?
Because honestly, I feel like I lost in a fog of doubt facing a crossroad that will change my life for ever.
And I know, I should try to talk to my mom about this but it just hard and I just lie or avoid the topic with her, or my brother because he's not the type of guy to know what to do neither he is good at giving advices on this topic, or my friends whom I made back in France because I feel so disconnected to them that I don't think they can help. So that is why I am here asking people online because I feel at least I can let my inner voice out and know that there will be someone out there who will listen and try to help out.",21Jul2020,1
1134,"Hi all,

I'm likely going to find myself in a position where I will be commissioning at least a few thousand dollars (at most a few tens of thousands of dollars) in artwork a year or two from now (depending on whether it's all paid for out of pocket). I am limited in what I can explain about the nature of what I'm creating right now, but for the sake of conversation let's consider it to be a fully illustrated 2D image gallery (mostly scenes with characters) and some portraits for character bios. There will be no 3D elements to the game, no sprites, no level design.

I have started researching commission rates for the level of quality and style that I would like, as well as researching licensing and rights for commercial use, and how to approach artists respectfully and with fair offers.

What I'm missing entirely is any sort of guidance on:

1. At which stage in development or in the project lifecycle I should approach artists
2. Common pitfalls of indie creators when commissioning art, or (if you happen to have done some indie work yourself) mistakes you've made in the past that you now know to avoid
3. Whether it's best to work with multiple artists for resiliency and to reduce dependency or a single artist for stylistic continuity
4. Other things I don't know to ask for (these are the worst!) D:

Any advice you could give me, including links to useful articles or even suggestions on what to search for online, would be greatly appreciated. At this point, I've hit a bit of a wall and I don't even have the proper key words for a Google search.

1137,"Not sure if this is the right place for this. I think my husband has some mental health issues and I don’t know how to classify them because I’m not a doctor and I’m not sure the best way to manage them and support him without loosing my own mind. He is on a few meds that a psychiatrist prescribed to him, Zoloft and aripiprazole are two of them. The psychiatrist doesn’t spend a lot of time talking too him just prescribed. 

My husband is very obsessive compulsive and has strange rituals (like knocking three times on a door before passing, just a silly example of something small) but will get very upset if a ritual is broken. Before the meds he was always loosing his mind, was arrested and spent some time in hospital on a 72 hour watch. The last incident where I threatened to leave was a road range where a guy cut him off and when we got to a red light he dragged the guy out of his car dumped his large drink on his head and started punching him in the middle of the intersection. My 3 year old saw and was terrified. He has also lost jobs over violent behaviour. 

Now that he is on the meds he’s fine, gone from extreme rage and hyperactivity to just hyperactivity, singing the same long lyrics over and over again loudly sometimes for 2 hours straight and just driving me insane and getting our 4 year old all spun out of control. He literally bounces off the walls - happy and not raging out - but it’s till jarring and concerning. He told the physician he is fine and feels great and he actually hasn’t had a formal diagnosis. 

I’m feeling like a very exhausted single mom with a 4 year old a out of control man baby.

1138,"For the past year, I've had this crazy special interest in autism after finding out that I tick a lot of the boxes. I am 21. Why did this not get caught before? Maybe because women are very underdiagnosed, my dad exhibits a lot of autistic traits himself so how would he know (He ACTUALLY thought I was autistic when I was in highschool but that is a long story and it got forgotten...), and there was so much drama when I was growing up with my parent's divorce and mom being in and out of jail for two years and so any possible autism in me could have gotten easily overlooked. 

Now to the current problem - I'm not sure how exactly what I mentioned above is important but I thought it worth mentioning. I WANT TO DROP OUT OF COLLEGE. I never thought I would say this. I have always been an A student no matter how much it stressed me out (I rarely get good sleep in college and I have only one friend). I know how important education is in overcoming obstacles in life. I just think I chose the wrong path. I am going to be a senior in college with a french major. I used to think I was passionate in french but I think I just chose it because I thought it would make me better at being social with people. Now, after having tried a teaching internship in France during study abroad (thanks to a great financial aid package from my school!) my dreams of being a french teacher are crushed as I was way too stressed teaching to actually enjoy it. SO now I don't have a lot of money and I don't want to waste more money by pursuing a degree I don't want (which will eventually have to lead to an expensive Masters degree anyway if I want to make any money with my French Major).  And I don't think I even enjoy learning french anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've decided what I'd do instead if I decided to drop out now (if any of you are actually interested). I'd go to a cheap local community college to pursue a veterinary nurse degree as I love and feel really comfortable around animals. This is only for two years and I know I would enjoy it. I don't care about making less money as long as I have a steady income I am very good at budgeting and know that I could make it. I've already applied to two jobs just in case I can't apply to the community college fast enough for the next semester (I have started the application process). And, I know I would be able to get a job in this field after community college as the skills are relatively easy and demand is very high right now for people with certification. The only problems with this plan are that 1) I would no longer be able to be under my parents insurance as the veterinary nurse program is only a certificate program, it is not an associates degree, 2) I don't have a lot of money to pay for insurance by myself right now, though I could get a job, 3)  I would loose out on some veterans assistance money that I get from my dad's old military job for going to college 4)I would have taken out loans for a college degree that I didn't finish, and 5) My family would not be supportive with me - they would not understand.

What do you think. Part of me is embarrased for asking strangers on the internet to help but I am desperate and I know that outside oppinions are always good! 

Thanks so much to anyone that reads this and replies!!",21Jul2020,1
1139,"I'm 15 and im pretty much scared of everything. I'm scared of bugs, animals, ocean, power, boats and helicopters.  I have many more fears. I have nightmares of any movie or clip which has a sad scene. E.g good dinosaur when the father died. I couldn't stop thinking about that for months. I accidentally watched a short horror clip unaware of its contents and will probably have nightmares for weeks and the thought of it lasting months. I'm always depressed too, it's not really depression, it's just the acknowledgement that I was born at this period. Me knowing that I'll die before any cool advancements such as the becoming of a type 1 civilization just make me sad all the time. So I am scared to die knowing of what ill miss.",21Jul2020,2
1140,I hope this is the right place to post this.I  need to file a police report for something and having the police come  to my home is not an option. The only alternative to this that I am  aware of is visiting the station to file the report. The problem with  this is that I'm high risk due to a medical condition and I'm worried  about exposing myself to the coronavirus. I know that police officers  are very exposed due to their line of work. Is there an option to make a  report remotely?,21Jul2020,1
1141,"I’m worried about my sons mental health, and over the course of the COVID lockdown I’ve become particularly concerned. He’s 16 and has seemed to become a more inward person, and also cutting off his ties to people he goes to school with, as he might be going to a new one at the beginning of the new academic year. He is constantly worried about everything bad that could happen, and also panicking about his GCSE results( as he never took them and the countries grades are being worked out by computers and people). Not only that but he seem to be sleeping less and less, as well as waking much later( usually after midday), and his motivation to even do stuff as simple as watching tv seems to be hard. He’s even talking slower and it’s worrying me very much. I work 6 days a week and find it very hard to spend time with him. 

Any help would be appreciated.",21Jul2020,2
1142,"For example, the only way I know how to force proper sleeping habits at a reasonable time is to force myself to get up at 8 or 9 in the morning, and I will naturally be ready to go to bed at another reasonable time such as before midnight.

But is forcing my body to adapt an improper way of doing it?",21Jul2020,2
