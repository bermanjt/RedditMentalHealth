0,"I've deleted all my social medias. I feel awful because me and her would still be friends if i didnt overreacted. I wish i listen to her when she said it was fine but i kept overthinking. Anxiety is a huge bitch and everyday it haunts me because none of this could have happened. I need some advice.
My anxiety kept making me think I did something wrong. Even though she said it was fine i kept apologizing for 2 years I kept apologizing and one day she got sick of it and ghosted me. I've deleted all my social media because I feel awful for keep messaging her. I know what I did was wrong and I know alot of people here will call me and ""nice guy"", a stalker and an incel that is one of the reasons I kept apologizing because I didn't want to. Everyday I wake up with a heavy heart knowing that it was my fault that we stopped talking and honestly it's driving me into a depression and it's killing me. Also her friend started telling my other friend that I was crazy and psychotic and some other things. I know how I'm acting is shitty and that is why I deleted all my social media because I feel awful and I know what I'm doing is wrong. I'm scared because I don't know what I'm feeling is normal. I talked to a peer supporter at my uni and he told me lovesickness was  a real thing and he told me that I should use my feelings into something creative and thats what i did. It's helping because I've been focusing on writing this little ep but sadly I still think about her and how none of this could have happened if i didn't overthink. I want to end it all but I'm scared of failing suicide.  I tried opening up to a few other people but they ghost me. I'm scared of being honest with a therapist because I'm scared they will put me in some kind of hospital. Also I'm scared if people know  I'm suicidal my life will be less free. Idk I feel awful",18Feb2020,1

I was sitting next to a coworker today when I was giving a presentation and my boss sent them a message saying “This is painful, should’ve been better prepared” on a topic that was my first time even looking into and presenting.

6,"Hi, so I am in a situation that I really do not know how to proceed through, so here I am!

I am currently a student, and my university has a (super awesome) program for students to become licensed firefighters and work for the school fire department. I have wanted to be a part of this program since I found out about it, and I have even been asking instructors from my EMT class if they have any information. On Saturday though I found myself talking to a guy who works as a firefighter for the department, so I asked him about it and he told me that he not only helps run the program, but they just finished hiring people into it and they don't rehire for two years. I was obviously bummed to hear it but he then told me that if I schedule a ride-along, bring some cookies, and suck up to the captain I might be able to get myself into the program.  

Here is where I need advice. I am not a super assertive person by nature but I don't have a problem asking for things I deserve, but I can't figure out how I would ask about being in the program. If I am talking to the captain I just do not see a way to bring up being in the program without seeming entitled or as if I deserve to be in the program, because while I do believe the program is a perfect fit for me and I think I would do super well, I just don't know how to convey that in a way that would help me get what I want.

I will super appreciate any advice anybody has to offer, but please be nice! Thank you!",18Feb2020,1

I’m 19F, on my second semester of college, and I seriously have no urge to continue going. I did terribly my first semester as my depression got worse and worse. I got my meds fixed and went to therapy and decided I was well enough to go back. 

I get anxious every time I think about going, and I honestly don’t care to get a degree, I will do any job and be content with it. I don’t want to fail this semester and just drop my classes and pay them off instead of failing and my parents being disappointed and angry. 

Neither of them went to college and they want me to go and live the life they couldn’t have. But I don’t want that life!

Me and my ex broke up two weeks before christmas and everything just felt numb. Sometimes my hope for the future is to simply reconnect with her in a few years but at the same time that is unrealistic and I want to just be able to have such strong feelings and connections for someone again.

Right now I have gotten myself into a relationship with a female please don't judge me for this. I really like her and its still early into the relationship but I don't feel this huge connection I did to my last partner. Right now I am just checking out what time will bring me.

I might want to even start dating again if things end up badly with my current gf

10,"Hello! 15 year old kid here.   


I just watched a Video of a middle school kid playing dodgeball and having fun. He was laughing with his friends, talking, etc, me on the other hand I was always quiet, didn’t make friends, was shy, scared, etc.   


After watching the video I told myself “man I wish I made friends, had fun, talked to girls, tried, etc. in middle school.

I am in grade 10 now and it’s the same thing. I am shy, scared, no friends, etc.   


Will I look back in 5+ years and feel the same way I d about middle school? When I look back at middle school nothing mattered I should have just enjoyed it instead of Caring what others thought of me.   


So will I look back at grade 10 and regret being a bitch Or is it different now that I am older? Will high school even matter once I’m out of it?

 What is your advice should I just ask out girls I like? Talk to random people? Make friends &amp; enjoy my time in high school? 

the Simplest way to put it is once I am in university will I look at high school like I currently view middle school?",18Feb2020,1

I am a toxic person.


I am negative, I am mean and rude, and jealous. I talk behind peoples back, I feel insecure when someone is more successful than me, I feel insecure all the time. I’m a big peoples pleaser. I hurt people too. And I hate myself.

I’ve ruined my relationship. I was controlling and emotionally abusive (at least that’s the way I see it). I would get upset about small things and cause fights because I am irrational. We constantly break up and get back together and today, I’ve ended it. I’ve explained why, but my ex believes he was in the wrong too. Who knows. I know I was horrible, and that he didn’t deserve that.

And even if we get along, even if we talk through texting, even if I fucking now that she genuinely enjoys talking to me and I enjoy talking to her, I'm still shy af to talk to her irl.

I mean, what the fuck. I'm not even interested in her as a girlfriend, just as a friend (because she has a bf), and I'm still extremely shy to talk to her in person.

I just hate myself so much for that, literally nothing bad can happen, just good things, but my shy ass decides to not talk to her in person.

14,"Okay, so, this is a TA account because I’d rather not have it on my main account.

So I’m 29 and I’m moving out of my mom’s house for the first time. I didn’t mean to stay so long but I went to college in the same city and it didn’t make sense of move out. I could have moved out by now but truth is I’m comfortable here and it is what it is.

Thing is - I’m moving out but not just to live alone but to a whole new country. I finally got the chance I’ve working for for years to change fields. I really dislike my field and this is basically what I’ve been working towards for the past ten years, it’s an exciting opportunity. It doesn’t pay as much as it should but the pay is okay for now and I live with it if it means getting the chance of a lifetime, which is pretty much what this is (I have no background in the field, it’s highly competitive and they took me in because someone who knows me couches for me so I got the interview and spent two months working hard to prove my case).

Anyway, in a span of weeks I’ll be living alone for the first time, in a brand new field that I have very little practical knowledge of (I think I’ll adapt quickly) and in a whole new country and city.

And I’m terrified. I’m so scared. I’m scared it’s such a big leap and I’ll screw it up or it won’t live up to the hype. I’m scared of moving out and losing my comfort, of leaving my mom alone and feeling guilty about it, of being lonely and having no friends. I’m scared that I got what I always wanted (this new city is my dream city and has been since I was a teenager) and now I don’t know what to do with myself.

I’m pretty self sufficient and responsible but I admit I’ve been spoiled and am partially still operating as a teenager at home.

15,"My cat died a very sad, painful death and I feel awful about it. I was not able to get her put down due to circumstances. She has had organ failure a while, but was comfortable enough to keep living quite some time after a successful vet visit where they drained her fluids. I gave her medicine twice a day and gave her all of the love in my soul. But the final moments could have been better, I think. She had a very graphic and intense, bloody seizure. 

I am having a really hard time coping with it. I miss her terribly. I am trying not to focus on what could have been too much... I couldn't handle the loneliness. I got fish to help cope. They're cute, I named them Diplo and Sushi and I'm giving them a great life. I just still feel so sad and heartbroken. The fish help, and spending more time with my fiance.

I woke up today with a sore throat having worked long hours all weekend at my other job. I know from experience that when my throat feels like this, there's a reasonable chance I'll wake up tomorrow with a full blown cold.

Normally I'd just take the route of going anyway and apologising for being sick on my first day, but I'm not so sure right now with the whole Coronavirus thing. I'm concerned that the employees won't like me very much if I rock up on my first day clearly sick, having travelled from a city with not many, but a handful of confirmed coronavirus cases. I don't think I've got it, but I understand that people are particularly paranoid at the moment and no one wants to be interacting with a sick person.

Equally, I feel like it's going to look pretty bad if I call in sick for my first day, resulting in them loosing money spent on my travel and accommodation arrangements.

She never leaves the room unless I do and complains about being bored all the time. She doesnt want to be alone so she wants to be with me and only me. She literally has no other friend than me and wants me for herself it seems. I want to go and meet other people sometimes and it seems to piss her off even if she doesnt say it. I'm also an introvert and need my space and she doesnt understand my cues that I want to be left alone or go somewhere by myself. More recently shes been negative and pissed off at everything and I think it's starting to rub off on me. I've never been so anxious in my life and I think it's her moody personality that's causing it. I've told her that I've been thinking about finding a different roommate for next year so that it won't come as a surprise to her when contracts come out. But now shes told me that if I dont room with her shes going to leave school. She flat out told me shes trying to win my affections back so that I'll room with her. She wants me to make a decision soon so that I can ""decide her future"" for her. I dont want to have to make the choice for her so I feel pressured to stay with her but I also know that she hasn't seemed to care about my feelings until I told her this.

26,"Hi. So this past August I started law school, a top 50 school. I have a reasonable academic scholarship, but I still have to take out about $75,000 in loans throughout my first year. I did well on my first semester, while working weekends, and admittedly not giving it my all. Only problem is, I hate it. Even more so I am realizing I do not want to litigate at all. 
I have “wanted to go to law school” since I was a child. I was always a precocious kid who loved reading and writing. School always seemed too easy for me. My mother went to college, but never did anything with her degree, and my father dropped out of college. I am a first generation law student. I’m not sure I even really spoke to a lawyer before I began law school. 
I’m not sure what prompted my desire to go to law school. It definitely was a combination of being a good writer, loving reading, and having a strange fascination with America’s Constitution and founding since I was a child. I even did a research project in the fifth grade where I dressed up as Sandra Day O’Connor. 
Whenever I said I wanted to go to law school over the next ten or so years, I received nothing but encouragement— I was so convinced it was a good idea that it became part of my identity. I began seeing myself with a career in Constitutional law, thinking this was way more of a lucrative “career” than it was.
When it was time to go to college, I went to a decent school in Washington, DC because this is where I wanted my career to be. I chose to major in philosophy, thinking it would make me standout to the other students who would later apply to law school, who would mainly be political science majors.
College was amazing. I majored in philosophy, I minored in history and German. I completed the honors sequences in philosophy and theology, I worked as a German tutor and a writing tutor. I loved it. I loved learning, I loved writing research papers. I LOVED DC. I had a pretty good social life, and a great academic life. 
As I started my senior year, registered to take the LSAT and began working on law school applications, I started to feel a nagging suspicion that something wasn’t right, a feeling I continually pushed down. I’m not sure why— maybe it was the admissions websites of law schools, which seemed to advertise their schools towards people who had no interest in the history or theory of the law, which had nothing to do with really being passionate about jurisprudence at all. In my darker moments I wondered if I would be happier eventually getting my doctorate in philosophy, going into academia. I had professors tell me I was suited for this, that my love of writing and my love of hanging out long research papers for no reason other than an enjoyment in reading endless articles and books and revising my own work incessantly would help me do well in the “publish or die environment”... but still. I was going to law school. It was part of my identity. I figured, I would keep a career in academia, in philosophy or history, as a backup plan, if I didn’t get into law school. So, I only applied to a few. Three reaches, a safety, and two middle of the line schools. I got waitlisted to a four, accepted to two. I chose the school I did based on the academic scholarship offered and the cost of living in the area— i was leaving DC. 
I started law school, and a few weeks in I realized with an awful, sinking feeling that yes, it was as much work as people say, but not because it was intellectually challenging, or even stimulating... but because it was a huge volume of extremely dry, didactic, monotonous work, under a very high pressure environment. Law school is an endurance test. At first, I took solace in reading that the first year’s classes are just boring, they exist to pound out the fundamentals, teach you pattern recognition and role application. I hoped it would get better, but it’s so formulaic, the education....
And it’s not even the Socratic seminar style that bothers me, Like some students. As a philosophy major, at least two or three classes every semester were Socratic seminar style.’lm comfortable with that. I just feel like I’m dragging my feet, like I’m sleepwalking. 
I was also starting to feel socially isolated however. Aside from the non traditional students, most of my peers seemed to be extremely privileged. 23 years old and still having their parents pay their rent, and such.
Meanwhile, I bartended weekends, and even with my loan, scrimped and saved and agonized over things like buying a blazer or nice shoes for a networking event. A lot of them were also single, enjoying getting drunk and then gossiping about hookups with the people in my section. I am in a loving, committed relationship. I tried to relate, but couldn’t. Soon, my friendships that I had begun to make started to falter, as my peers all bonded over going out drinking, breweries during the day on weekends, going to bars and throwing parties at night, while i served other people drinks for tips. I hate to say that even if I didn’t work, I sort of hoped that social atmosphere was behind us all. I had a wild social life my first two years of college, which I soon realized my junior year that I had outgrown— it began damaging my mental health, it was unsustainable. I settled down and left it behind, and couldn’t be happier.
On top of that, I had always assumed that as I found “my place” in college, after feeling like a loser all through middle and high school, I would feel like I belonged even more in law school. But I was wrong. I still came off as weird for posting on social media about politics, for loving constitutional law and history. No one seemed to care as much as I did. They all wanted to compete, do moot court and trial advocacy. Want to be in a trial atmosphere, be prosecutors. Everyone, even my career advisor, seemed to find it strange that I did not want to litigate at all. That I wanted to do research, to read and write. That I was more interested in policy, and the “how” and “why” of the law, than practicing it. My feelings of isolation and doubt grew. Walking into the library, class, and even through the halls feels like walking into the high school cafeteria and having no table to sit at, accept unlike high school, I don’t have my AP English lit professor or history professors classrooms to go eat lunch in instead. 
I began to do research, and find websites and blogs about how law school is a vocational school, it’s meant to teach you how to practice the law, it’s not meant for people fascinated by the law, by the theoretical underpinnings of it and our legal system. I began reading about “JD advantage” jobs, jobs you don’t need a JD for, but that it helps with. Some appealed to me, like legislative analysts in committees for congress, for think tanks, for lobbyists. But then I would read stuff about how you have to start out on the bottom, even with a degree, work with undergrads on Capitol Hill,’doing work you’re overqualified for, earning less money for, while saddled with thousands of dollars in student loans.
My doubts grew. If this is what I wanted to do, maybe I am in the wrong place.
And to be in academia, in law, your odds are pretty terrible if you did not go to an ivy, and to work In constitutional law, you pretty much have to go to an ivy, and excel. 
It has not helped that I have had several family troubles/tragedies in the past few months, that have severely impacted me mentally.
I was able to “compartmentalize” for a while, but between my doubts, my social isolation, losing my job because I requested too much time off to study for finals, trying to budget while finding another one, and some ongoing health problems of my own, I’m cracking.
The only joy I’ve found this entire time, that’s academic in any way, is a research paper I’ve voluntarily been working on, that wasn’t assigned for any class, or have any bearing on me at all.
I’m struggling to apply for internships because I have no desire to litigate, and outside of DC, internships that aren’t in practicing law are few and far between.
I found one, and I interviewed for it, but if I don’t get it,
I don’t know what I will do.
I can’t sleep, between my health, finances,
My family and these concerns. I can’t focus on reading case after case, trying to find some sort of interest in property law, some kind of passion in criminal law. I’m terrified. I’m terrified that I’ve made the wrong choice, that I’ve made my family proud of me for something that was a mistake, something I cannot see through. I’m terrified that I uprooted my amazing,
Wonderful significant other’s life for a mistake, as he came with me to this new city. My only solace in that is that he received a wonderful job that he quite enjoys and pay well.... so at least he benefited from this move, somewhat.
I’m terrified. I know I could push through, so pretty well, I have less than two and a half years left. I know I can buckle down and get my degree. But if it’s to go into legislating, to be a legal analyst, where my salary would likely be half of what my peers going into practice would be for the first several years, and my earning potential, while good, would still be lower, I worry that all these loans may not be worth it for just an advantage.
I seriously wish that I hadn’t gotten into any law schools, that I applied to continue studying at my undergraduate institution, to advance my degree and work towards a career
In academia.
I know I’d be happier, after talking to professors, and doctorate students I worked with in the writing center, countless times about their experience in their doctorate experience. It’s grueling and stressful, and a test of endurance too, but they were all also intellectually stimulated, and felt a spark and passion in their dissertations and work, a spark I could feel in myself whenever I was assigned a long research paper. 


TL;DR I miss writing papers, I miss philosophy.
I miss feeling engaged in my
Education, Passionate, happy. I miss relating to my peers. Even worse, I fear I made a horrible financial mistake. I fear that I am not who I thought I was my whole life. I should have never gone to law school.  I don’t know what to do.",18Feb2020,1

30,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.. Also bear with me as this story requires context. 

I (F21) have been seeing this therapist for about 3 years now, and while I do like her, she has some flaws as any human does. Sometimes she forgets things that I have told her, or gets me confused with another client. I don’t normally mind because it’s not a big deal and we all make mistakes. 

However, I went in for a session about a week ago with the intention of asking her for a recommendation letter for a medical marijuana card.  I have PTSD and this letter was something she had offered to do for me before. I thought about it for a while and ultimately decided that I was gonna go for it, as weed has been helpful for me. 

Some more relevant background info is that my boyfriend’s family has been having issues and have been seeing this same therapist as well. 

So, I go to this session last week, and I bring up the medical marijuana card and the letter of recommendation. She immediately starts going on about my bf and his PTSD (this is the first him or I heard of this diagnosis) and how it would be much easier to write a letter for him. Her reasoning was that his came from an isolated event whereas mine was “slow and over time”. 

I was beginning to get upset and said “Look, I don’t want to say that either one of us (me or my bf) had it worse than the other person growing up, but his parents never laid a hand on him and mine did.” 

She looked at me and casually said, “Yeah, but just spankings, right?” 

I replied saying yes and then reminded her of another incident where my parent was mad about something trivial and lifted me off the floor by my neck. I am sure I told her about this before. She dramatically dropped her pen, apologized, and said she’ll have my letter ready in two weeks. 

I immediately started bawling when I left that session, it all just felt so invalidating to me. The advice I’m looking for is, should I find a new therapist? Or am I overreacting?",18Feb2020,1
31,"Hey guys I'm a 34(m) year old struggling porn addict who's  been struggling to quit since I found out about porn addiction 8 years ago. I've have a few relationships in my twenties  and was unable to maintain an erection long enough to have sex due to Porn Induced Sexual Dysfunction . I thought I just had anxiety at the time and spent thousands at the Dr. and tried a bunch of different pills with no success. When I was 28 i started getting some occasional comments in my social circle about my sexual experiences that led me to believe my impotence was widely known amongst my social circle. I ended up having an emotional breakdown that year after one of my friends drunkenly suggested he knew about my sexual struggles. My mind has been racing ever since then and I've been in therapy but I'm still struggling to figure out what I should do at this point in  life.

I figured when I was younger id have a wife and kids one day but recently I've been so focused on beating the porn addiction and trying to scrape together some for of satisfying sexual experience/dignity before I die. Ideally id love to have a string of casual sexual encounters but I'm not sure if the women my age have an interest in relationships that aren't geared toward marriage and or children. I think since I became sure that I was sexually humiliated about either one and or all of my sexual experiences I've just been obsessed with over compensating with sexual partners.

I guess my concerns are the best way to move forward? I find myself comparing my sexual humiliation to more traditional  revenge porn and wondering if id rather have naked pictures floating around and whether that would be less humiliating/detrimental to my dating life, is that a dumb analogy? I think part of the reason I might not be a huge fan or marriage is my mother abused my father during the divorce process in my early 20's due to a neurological disease he had and her inability to deal with it emotionally. Is it fair/wise to try and string together a few casual relationships if I can in my mid later 30's and just have a kid in my early 40's if I want and capable by then? I'm sort of all over the place in terms of emotions and pain. I'm having such a hard time understanding how anyone in my social circle will respect me again and the best way to move forward. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Tl:dr: Unknowingly broke my dick to due to porn addiction and and almost certain my  sexual failures were talked about amongst my exes and people in my social circle. I cant comprehend how Im capable of being respected or how to move forward at this point in life and feel self respect? Thank you.",18Feb2020,1

33,"I live in Canada where recreational marijuana is now legal. I get high everyday (and have for the last 5 years or so.) I like smoking weed and what it does to reduce my anxiety.

Cons. I am worried about:
-its effects on my memory (I have a bad memory as is and Alzheimer's runs in the family.)
-how much it costs
-how it increases my appetite

Pros. I like smoking because:
-it makes me feel good

I did Sober October a few months ago and realized:
-it was very easy to stop
-my dreams became more vivid
-I became much more anxious

34,"A guy I have had a casual friendship with for over 5 years, asked me to be his date months back. I hadn't seen or hung out with him since we were in college a few years back, where we first met. I agreed to be his date for this formal event, and since then we started talking. Weeks pass, we go to the event, and spend a couple of days together. It's important to note that since he graduated college, he moved to the next state over.  We continued talking after the event and eventually developed an attachment to each other despite being long distance. I felt things were getting serious between us, and my feelings had grown to the point where I asked him where this was going. By then, we discussed multiple times being a couple, moving closer to each other, even moving in together. Eventually, I started losing interest in him because I felt like it was more talk, than actual planning. My mentality was that I didn't want to invest myself into something that may have just lacked substance. I know he sensed me backing off a little, and began calling and video chatting me more often than usual.

Then suddenly one day, there was no ""good morning"" text from him anymore. It didn't take long to realize that he had ghosted me. I tried reaching out to him encouraging him to just be honest with me if he didn't want to continue talking. I got no response. I felt really hurt, because I felt led on, and then left in the dark. I hadn't felt this way about a guy until he came along. I suppose I mistakenly thought that since he told me some really personal things and I felt comfortable sharing things with him, that we could talk about anything and everything.

I eventually got over him ghosting me. I decided to drop the anger and hurt, because I knew he was struggling with something to the point in which he ended things between us in such an abrupt way. It didn't help when he did eventually get back to me. He texts me a month later and tells me that he is sorry and that he is moving back to the state in which I live in (and where we went to college in), and that we will be closer now. At that point, the anger in me boiled up again and I told him to leave me alone forever.

Fast forward a month after that, and I get a spontaneous urge to text him. I asked him to explain himself why he ghosted me when he knows he could have told me anything, including the truth about how he was feeling. He gave me an excuse saying that he was starting to fall hard, and it scared him. Then came more sorries and regrets. I got some more stuff out of him, stuff he was reluctant to talk about. I appreciated him being open with me about it, but I wasn't sure if we could or should go back to where we were before. And I have felt that way ever since.

I personally don't like long distance relationships. The only exception to make that situation worth delving into, is if there are plans to be together physically in the future. And that's where I stand with him. He has since asked me to be his girlfriend, and I agreed to at first. I ended up breaking up with him because even though I have a strong and deep connection with him, I knew I might never get my needs met with him. To me it seems that us visiting each other, seeing each other, and eventually planning on moving close by or in together, remains just a fantasy. Hence, why I feel like I'm not getting much out of a relationship with him.

He has contacted me several times after I broke it off with him. He is insistent on being in my life, even if that means just being a friend. I asked him if he just contacts me because he's lonely and he admitted it to me, but that it's more than just that. To me, I feel reluctant to give him my heart because even though he knows my wants and desires, I feel like he just tells me what I want to hear to keep me around. I tell him I want to start a family already and that I am only dating seriously now, then he will respond and say he wants that too and has always stuck to that since it started getting serious. I feel the need to set boundaries with him. Then he will just cross the boundaries with sex talk and other inappropriate topics because, like I mentioned earlier, we are comfortable telling each other things. He has some outlandish sexual fantasies, and I think that's why he is attached to me still. Because I was someone who didn't judge him and he felt comfortable sharing things with me. I even agreed to to considering trying some of those fantasies in the past when we were together.

The truth is I accept him for who he is, no judgments at all. I value his honesty and our friendship, but I don't see a desire on his end to really negotiate our compatibility with each other so that we can actually be together. I know he wants a family, kids, and to get a house and everything, but he is so caught up in his sexual fantasies that he has almost lost touch with reality. It gets more difficult to deal with, because he tells me that he wants to be with me, we are soulmates, and he wants to belong to me. I have a strong desire for things to work between him and I, but I also know I can't fit a square into a circle, as it seems. I'm at a loss as to what to do. My heart knows I have never felt this connected to someone ever (he is not just any guy I would normally date), but my mind knows that he is just someone who has a lot of inner problems, and is in love with the idea of love than love itself. I honestly just want us both to be happy, even if that means not with each other. I'm not sure how I should feel.",18Feb2020,1
35,"I dropped out of high school when I was 14 due to depression, which I started getting treated recently, and I'm considering going back. Because I'm 16 with no credits, I'd have to start at the very beginning which would be an incredibly steep climb upwards. I'm honestly not sure if going back would be preferable or if I should just get a GED. I talked to my therapist about it and she didn't really have an opinion either way; public high school would have more social opportunities, she said, but getting a GED would take less time. Right now I'm leaning more towards high school because I want to make friends, although I'm really scared of being there until I'm 20.

38,"Recently (around past 6 months) I've become part of a new friends group. We met through a mutual hobby.

One of the people in this group is a little older than the rest of us. He's divorced, has a son, and told us he went to prison a few years ago for ""a stupid mistake"" which I took to mean drugs. He clearly has a lot of problems in his life. He's struggling to find work and has mentioned having suicidal thoughts. He also told us he's not allowed to see his son and blamed his ex-wife and the courts for discriminating against him (he's a minority in my country.) He also told us he changed his name after he left prison to make a fresh start. I don't think anyone in the group is very close to him, but I think we feel sorry for him and let him hang with us. He did not seem at all dangerous.

So anyway, about a month ago I was looking at his social media. I must admit I was looking for clues about his past, because I was curious. Scrolling back a little ways I noticed in the replies someone linking to a website that's a database of sex offenders - basically an internet vigilante who took it on themselves to make his crime public. The site had a picture of him with his old name and mention of what he did. It was the classic To Catch a Predator thing, he groomed a 13 year old girl on the internet and went to meet her which turned out to be a sting operation. At first I thought maybe this is some troll comment with a fake website but I did some more research and confirmed it's real.

Now that I know this I don't know what to do. On one level I genuinely feel sorry for him and I do believe he's trying to put his life back together and be a good person. But I also personally don't feel comfortable being around him anymore. I have personal history with child sex crimes that make this especially difficult for me. The fact that he lied about why he can't see his son makes me even more uncomfortable. I'm thinking on other things he's told us and I'm starting to wonder how much of it was lies to hide why he went to prison, like changing his name.

I told my SO but no-one else. Both of us now don't feel comfortable socializing with him but don't know whether we should tell the rest of the friends group. None of us have kids but it's possible we could be in a situation where there are kids in the future. Do I keep his secret and just pretend I never found it and just try to avoid him in future, or should I make it public so everyone in the group can make an informed decision? Should I confront him with what I found?",18Feb2020,1

now i've been obsessing over this for the past 5/6 months which is how i tend to get when something is bothering me. i just have a few questions:

42,"I’ve known her 4 years, we are in the same classes at uni and are good friends. M23 F24. In the past we’ve kissed 3 or 4 times, and gone on a few dates. We always enjoy each other’s company.

We went on a year studying abroad and both took a gap year from uni so before September I hadn’t seen her in almost 2years. Anyway, she was seeing this guy from Germany so obviously I didn’t pursue anything even though I still felt that attraction that I think has been there since day 1 (certainly from my side, I’m truly mad about her)
 
I guess my question really is whether or not she is really interested? I’d like to think not based on the following:
Around christmas she had a big fall out and broke up with that guy, it turned out they sorted whatever issue and got back together until now but its over now... she asked me out during that short period. We spent about 5 or 6 hours having drinks and it was brilliant. We always have really strong eye contact, I get lost in her eyes all the time haha but this time she was more touchy feely, relaxed and complimentary 
(She even said I was always the best looking guy on our course to her). I ended up sitting with my arm around her for ages whilst chatting. I regret not kissing her that night now as it would have shown my intent, but I assume she knows I still like her. 

I believe she considered it a real date because we played pool with this other ‘couple’ and she said to them this is our first date while I wasn’t listening... The guy told me later on. 

She actually suggested that the 2 of us go for drinks again soon the other day which made me suspect they had broken up. We were texting today and she ended up confirming it. We are planning on going for drinks again next week (we are both busy this week). 

I guess my question is what can I do to let her know I’m interested for sure? Would you consider what I’ve explained as having potential to go somewhere and what should I look out for especially when we go on this ‘date’ with regards signs that she is interested?",18Feb2020,1

47,"So my wife and I live on a fairly busy road. 2 lanes, fast moving traffic. We have two dogs and our neighbors have two dogs (pitbull mix and a chihuahua mix.) The neighbors routinely keep both dogs outside in a makeshift pin and the smaller, older dog regularly escapes this enclosure. I am always seeing this dog running through our yard or across the road and I roll my eyes and attempt to catch him, which he always evades. This can get frustrating. Today, as I was getting home from work, I noticed the dog across the road. I told myself, ""Okay just get to to porch, put your stuff down, and go get him."" Then, as I got to the porch, I noticed the dog making a line for the road. Before I could react, he had been hit. Moments after, our neighbor and her two young kids pulled up and the awfulness ensued. I scooped up the dog in a blanket and she took him to rush him to a vet, though I'm positive he was gone. I feel awful having witnessed the entire thing unfold and part of me feels like I could have done more. If I had just left my stuff at my vehicle and ran over right then, I may have been able to get after him. But if I would have gone over to try and grab him, he may have gave chase like he always did and made for the road anyway. I'm feeling mixed emotions, but one is of overwhelming guilt because I had seen this dog escape so many times that it was almost routine and I thought to myself that I had a second to put a few things down instead of treating it with the urgency that the situation deserved. Should I have done more?",18Feb2020,1
48,"When I was in high school I made the mistake of thinking I could truly make a lucrative career out of being a “talented writer.” In college, this led to me switching majors twice until I ended up pursuing a degree in media production. It wasn’t long before I hated the major, but I was tired of switching and decided I would stick to it no matter what.

Fast forward a couple years and it’s graduation time. The only aspect of my major I didn’t hate by this point was TV news production, which I had gotten really comfortable with thanks to my school’s newscast. I had assumed for several semesters that there was a secure demand for production workers, especially since the city I’m from has a handful of respected news stations.

My assumption during all that time turned out to be very ignorant, as there is a total scarcity of openings in my city that actually suit my capabilities and area of expertise.

A few weeks ago, I did get my first callback about a job that sounded perfect. The only problem was that this job was in another state, and I’m not ready to move. I still live with my mother and I get homesick very easily, and I knew that moving out-of-state as my first time away from home would overwhelm me, and that I couldn’t handle it. So I turned it down.

Since then, there have still been no openings (and I do mean literally zero openings) related to my skill set. I recently got hired for a job at a grocery store just so that I can start making some money again, and eventually move out.

All this has led to me feeling horribly disillusioned about the promises of what a college degree would bring me.

Now I’m beginning to drown in regret. I wish that I had pursued a different path, like accounting or law. I know I could have done those things and excelled at them, and that there would have been demand and that they would have paid nicely.

But my naive and ignorant high school brain decided to ignore the smart path because I thought I could hit it big as a writer or media influencer of some sort.

So now I’m stuck, taking a job that a high schooler could do and sitting on a degree that is getting me nowhere because there is no demand in my field.

My overwhelming regret and lack of faith in my future has been making me very depressed lately, and for the first time almost ever I feel like I have totally lost my sense of direction in life.

51,"**TL;DR: Roommate is likely going to fail another semester, and according to a family member who advised at our school, he is going to get the boot. He checks off all the boxes for ADHD because he cannot focus on anything other than Pokemon, forgets his course materials, forgets his classes, and gets excessively frustrated with many things. I know he wants to do well and it upsets him that he doesn't, but I don't think he understands that he can fix anything. I want to try to help him in any non-patronizing way I can because I do believe in him.**

My roommate is 22 almost 23, and he has been in college since he was 18. This is his third school he has gone to, and he is about to fail this one too. Iirc, he told me he technically hasn't even finished his freshman year, and his college fund set up by his parents was run dry last semester, so now he's actually paying.

The thing is, he's not lazy. He wants to graduate, he wants to do well, but he *cannot focus.* Since he can't focus, he starts to realize he doesn't remember what he studied for his exams, forgets about class times, and he starts to fail early, and gets discouraged. I don't think he understands that this will be his last semester in this college if he doesn't pass a single class again--my close family member was and advisor at our college and retired last year, which is how I know he's really on his last straw. 

The reason I suspect he has ADHD or something similar is mainly the focus thing, and he hyperfocuses on one thing that distracts him from everything else. In this case, it's Pokemon draft leagues that me and my other roommate also participate in with him, but he is so fixated on it that it's all he talks about and all he thinks about and all he works on when he skips classes. He gets frustrated when people in the leagues with him don't move as quickly as him because he wants to *go go go.* He gets *very* frustrated *very* quickly, which you would never guess if you didn't live with him and hear him break his keyboard when playing a video game. because in real life he's extremely mild mannered and friendly. I don't like to attempt to diagnose anyone, but he *really* has something up and checks all the boxes.

I understand that it is his choice to help himself, but the thing is I really don't think he understands that there is anything he can fix. He's kind of in lala land, I guess. But he's the one of the nicest guys I've ever met, and I know when my SO and I move in together and he has to find somewhere else to stay, he very well might have a really bad time (one of our mutual friends told me that he's going to be very upset when we leave). I just don't want to abandon him, I want to do *something* to help, I really want him to do well and it's very hard for me to bite my tongue every time he admits he skipped another day of classes because he got distracted with Pokemon because I *know* he can do it. I would feel awful if he flunks again and I just watched.

54,"Hi!  I came across this subreddit when searching online for possible advice forums to turn to because in all honestly I'm not really sure what to do in this situation.

I \[F19\] attend college live with my roommate, R \[F19\], my other roommate S \[F20\] and S's boyfriend \[M20\].  It's a small apartment, nothing overly roomy, and we generally spend a lot of time together and I have known R since middle school.

I have struggled with anxiety and a panic disorder on and off throughout my life, but one thing that I truly picked up on in therapy is that no one can help you until you decide to help yourself, and it's something I'm truly thinking may apply to this situation.  R has been diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder and takes medications for these every day, which I guess I'm one of the lucky ones to not have to do so.  However since the start of this spring semester, R has been acting very erratically, guilting me and S to hang out with her and making us feel incredibly bad if we didn't, including making jokes about killing herself.  Multiple times a day when I'm in class, sometimes as few as one or two and sometimes as many as eight, I'll receive ""I miss you, I'm lonely"" or ""I'm sad come home"" texts which I've followed through on a couple times just for her to ask me to smoke with her.  Obviously, we've spoken about this in-depth and she believes she's hitting a depression and has been speaking to her therapist.  Almost every day she unloads to me and will say...shocking? Things to get my attention or to get me to ask about something specific.  For example, I was talking to her about a random dream I had and she interrupted me to say ""I dreamt that you and S were mad at me so I went and slit my wrists.""  I didn't know what to do or say so I tried to change the subject and she interrupted me again with ""Aren't you going to ask why I killed myself in my dream?""  If I say I have schoolwork to do, she'll say I'm lying.  If she asks for advice and I go to actually give some, she'll interrupt me to change the subject.  One other thing she does is if I'm not home when she is, she will text me asking when I'll be home because she ""doesn't know what she'll do to herself if she's home alone for too long.""  She has also lied to me about not eating for multiple days; while she was telling me this and I was begging her to eat, S informed me that R had been eating the entire time even while she was texting me and had video proof she had sneakily taken.

I had a friend in the past who did this exact behavior and I tried to help her as well.  The moment I pulled back and told her I needed to focus on myself although I was incredibly worried for her, she attempted suicide and blamed me for it, which might be why I'm so terrified of pulling away this time.

I'll admit, this on top of the guilting and her general behavior has really gotten to me and I started to really pull away until S opened up to me and told me that R has been doing the same thing to her.  Guilting her to hang out, saying out-of-place things about her depression or inserting these ideas into conversations, and also apparently talking shit about me anytime I'm out of the apartment.  I really don't know what to do -- I want to be there for R as much as possible.  But it's getting to a point where I'm constantly around her so she doesn't do anything to herself, I can't focus on my own mental health or wellbeing, and it's starting to affect my relationships.  We are supposed to live together again next year but I don't think I can do that and I don't know how to approach that conversation without her hurting herself or telling people I'm in the wrong.

I guess it wasn't real. Anyways, how do I get past this? I just want it to stop hurting and I think I am getting dopamine withdrawals from not interacting with her in the way that we used to.

58,"6/7 months ago one of my mates broke up with another one of my friends. He handled it very poorly, treating her badly towards the end &amp; broke up with her at the beginning of a party they were both going to.

She was incredibly upset as she still loved him &amp; 6 months later still isn’t over him. Even though he told her “I’m just not attracted to you anymore” at the beginning of a party when breaking up with her. Overall he handled it very poorly.

They are both good friends with me &amp; it’s hard to watch both of them still not getting over it after this much time (Her especially, as she doesn’t want to be with him but still has feelings for him). 

Any advice on how to help either or both of them get over it &amp; move on with their lives. Keep in mind they are both in the same school &amp; in a couple of the same classes. So they can’t cut each other off completely",18Feb2020,1

My mom suggests about a part time stocking job at walmart, which sounds good, and easy to me, since it's like unskilled labor, so I've been thinking about it. During today, she's on the computer, and she's getting me hired right now out of nowhere, and she's picking out the options, and schedule without me deciding which is ok, such as she's picking out that I have to work on Saturday, and Sunday. I've become nervous, and I'm having anxiety, and I don't know what to expect at the job, so I try to talk to her that I'm not ready yet, and I also want to choose which schedule, and options are better, but she doesn't want to hear it, threatens to take away my phone, and calls me dramatic, making me feel like I'm talking to a brick wall.

69,"TL;DR at the pro and con list after the paragraphs.

I started a new job as a project manager in September moving halfway across the US knowing no one in the surrounding area. This company hires many people after just graduating college, but they’re extremely selective in their hiring practices. With a 3.25 gpa and a degree not in this industry, I’m very lucky to be here. Only problem is that I am hating it. 

By all accounts, I should be enjoying it. The office is gorgeous and creative, the salary and benefits are more than I could’ve hoped for as a new grad with a supposedly raise coming in a couple months, and the people are pretty much all great and intelligent. I also travel frequently (averages out to about every other week).

But I’m hating it. I feel constantly overwhelmed due to a never ending task list that leads up to the culmination of months of work. I feel as though I get more tasks assigned to me than I can complete. I’ve been working 10+ hour days each day to get through customer work + time on weekends to get through the tedious training requirements, and I’m still falling behind. I’ve been experiencing depression and anxiety in ways that I have never experienced before (always been a positive, go with the flow person up until now). I’ve finally reached out for help from the boss on my customer side and the boss from the internal side, but it seems that there isn’t much they can do to alleviate any of the burden and they’ve said I’m going to have to just start working more on the weekends until everything dies down in a couple months. It almost seems like this is a shitty weed-out period. All of this is piling on my mental state, making me feel like a failure and inadequate.

I can barely eat or sleep due to the stress I’m under, and I’ve began lashing out at family when I call back home for advice. Lately it’s been harder to want to meet with the few friends I have made here. It’s extremely difficult to find motivation to get the work done when I’ve been busting my ass and it still seems to go by unnoticed.  

And yet it still seems insane to be walking away from financial security.

Some other things that might be worth considering:

Year long lease that ends in September
I’m going to my first therapy appointment next week
I was staffed to this project mid install, so there was a lot of catching up to do as well as feeling the need to prove myself. The end of this project is within a month of my training deadlines (April 1 and March 9, respectively), and I feel set up to fail due to this.
The hours don’t get better, I’ve tried to schedule meetings with more tenured people and looking at their calendars is extremely intimidating. Many people talk about working 55+ some weeks like it’s a badge of honor (our role on the company’s hiring page states 45-50 hours some weeks may be necessary, but this is every week).


Pros:
The people
The city/area
Financial compensation 
Somewhat autonomous 
Regular raises that are very good

Cons:
Overwhelming workload
Not passionate about the work or the industry
Inability to leave work at work, often working from home after hours, or constantly thinking about it
Long hours
Management not keeping promises to help when I have reached out
Mental health

Should I try to seek employment elsewhere?",18Feb2020,1
70,"We live in a major city and have been seeing each other for about nine months. Over the last few months, we FaceTimed almost every night for at least an hour and spent almost every weekend hiking, playing video games, trying new restaurants, and watching movies. We even went on a few road trips together. 


We both started our careers in public accounting, but I left two years ago while she is still working there during busy season right now and works past midnight Monday to Thursday and 8-10 hours a day on Friday to Sunday (occasional work from home on weekends). This will last about 3 months. Ever since she was busy with work, I haven’t seen her in person for three weeks, we’ve FaceTimed once or twice a week (where she’s usually working from home and I feel like I’m bothering her) and I get a text from her every few days usually about work difficulties. I don't expect things to be like it was before, but I would appreciate a text a day just to see if she is doing alright/working late/got home safely.


As for me, I took a leave from work to take care of my father who was diagnosed with a terminal illness a few months ago. He passed away this weekend and I’m heartbroken. 

How do I feel? First, I’m disappointed my girlfriend hasn’t made much of an effort to talk to me even if we can’t spend time together in person. I’ve worked a few years of public accounting busy season and I’ve always made time for my friends and family whenever I have a few seconds to send a text or a call on my drive home. Knowing my girlfriend’s personality, I’m sure she has spent plenty of mental breaks going on social media, reading random news articles, chatting with coworkers and taking YouTube breaks at home as opposed to talking to me, so it’s not like she’s working 12 hours straight. I try to cheer her up whenever she contacts me as it’s mostly complaints about work, but I rarely call her anymore due to not wanting to bother her. 


Secondly, she has met my parents a few times and my dad approves of her greatly. She is aware of his diagnosis and hasn’t made much effort (or even care) for his ongoing status during our conversations other than a few sad face emojis whenever I tell her about my dad. I honestly don’t even want to tell her my dad passed away just to see how long it’ll take her to ask.


Lastly, observing her consumer behavior, she is a generous person. She has spent thousands on designer handbags and tech gadgets which mostly just end up in the closet. She even proposed spending thousands on a purebred dog which is to be left at my house for me and my parents to care for and her to visit whenever convenient. With that being said, I feel like one of her possessions. Something she has paid an upfront cost for which she can just put away and take out whenever she feels like.


So the options as I see it:

A)	Break-up with her. I use to think I would love her and support her unconditionally, but I’m uncertain if she’ll do the same for me. I question if I’m willing to invest in our future as the present is all about her. After seeing the way my mom has cared for my dad, I worry about all the things she prioritizes in life (I have a feeling there will be more things other than just work) over me.

B)	Confront her. This isn’t a good time for either of us. She’s stressed and busy at work. I’m grieving my dad. I'm still in love with her. She told me her feelings for me haven't changed, but I really just want to tell her I feel neglected and unwanted.

C)	Take a break. Wait until I’m less emotional about the death of my father and she’s not busy at work to bring this up. 

**tl;dr**  GF is busy with work and has prioritize social media, YouTube, chatting with co-workers, etc. over making an effort to talk to me. When we do talk, it's about listening to her complaints about work and she has minimal regard about my well-being and/or how I am grieving my father.",18Feb2020,1

Later on my mom tells me and my brother (1 year older than me), that her job is going south and she’s going to try looking for a new one. I later learn that she found one she’s going to interview in person for, but it’s in a different state; 8 hours away. So all the sad feelings associated with moving came and went, but the thing that really irked me was the fact that we moved into some mans house (Let’s call him D), so D I assume was the mystery man from earlier although i’m still not 100% sure. So we get into arguments because he’s this foreign character in my life, and then he and my mom officially state that they’re dating. So fast forward and my family moves into this house in a good neighborhood, mom still dating D. fast forward like 5 months and D moves in with us and sells his old house. I did not like this at all, we started to butt heads and we still do to this day. We get in arguments that are pointless and my opinions or whatever I say are always undermined by him, I feel like I never get listened to. He always calls me disrespectful, ungrateful, and even things like antisocial (Which i don’t believe i am, it’s just that D doesn’t know how i act at school). So anyways, I have some chores I need to do, which i’m alright with doing, but D always finds something I did wrong; like this morning I wake up to find out that while I was asleep, he went into my bathroom (only accessible by me and my brothers rooms) to check on how well I did yesterday. He points out that I didn’t clean the mirror which I guess I had forgotten. He then goes on about how I never do my jobs well enough and that my mom works too hard for me to be messing up our home, etc etc. I just want to know two things, is this even normal? As in, is this what regular parents act like? Or am I truly ungrateful for what my mom does and I don’t try hard enough? Then the second thing is, does anyone have any general advice for my situation?

80,"Hi guys. I wasn't sure where exactly to post this, so mods feel free to remove it or point me to where I can post this. 

My dilemma: Been single for a few years. I moved to a new area about 8 months ago. Haven't been able to meet any women or have a significant relationship. 

I've tried online dating (tinder) and gotten a few dates but every time its been a hookup or the girl has no interest in dating. I find it hard to not come off as desperate or fall in love too quickly, which leads to heartbreak. I'm an average looking guy, not overweight, about 5'10 and decent looking. 

As of late I haven't been meeting anyone and believe it's because my selfie game is total trash. 

As for meeting people IRL goes, I'm in a central downtown neighborhood with bars everywhere, but have had zero luck in meeting any women there. I'm not sure how to not be creepy about it. The other week I bought a couple girls some shots from across the bar. They cheered and waved and so I waited a few and went over, but they didn't want anything to do with me. 

I refuse to ask any women who is working out, as that's been made clear to me to be something a person shouldn't do. Another issue is that I work nights, and my only days off are mondays and tuesdays when nobody is really out. 

As I type this I'm trying to motivate myself to take a shower and go out but I'm not seeing the point. I'm not sure what I need exactly, but one thing I can see is that I'm lacking confidence. Because of all this, my self esteem has been shot. I've always been a shy quiet person since I was a kid and I'm starting to believe I'm just a cuck/incel growing more bitter as I see the way women my age act. I'm 26. 

I can't watch movies or shows where theres happy couples and I've started having nightmares about my ex again. I'm snapping at family and drinking more.

81,"So I am currently a senior in high school, and my parents and I have come to the conclusion that they want me to go home school. We decided this because on Friday, I was targeted by a student and physically beaten up. I’ve dealt with bullying for 12 years at my school and it’s gotten worse than ever. I know I only have 4 months of school left, but we want to do home school for the remaining period of time. However, my school is declining to offer their cyber school program because they say “it’s too late in the school year to do so.”  
Are schools even allowed to decline that? From my understanding, my school has their own cyber school program.

87,"So like the title says - my marriage has fallen apart. It sucks, but I [28f] am coming to terms with it. It has been a long, steady decline and really culminated on Valentine's Day when my husband [34m] told me that he was making arrangements to move out. We haven't had the formal ""divorce"" talk but it's painfully obvious that it's right around the corner. Ouch. 

Well in the throes all of this emotional hell, my husband's father has passed away. He has been sick for a long time and this was the 4th ""scare"" in the last few months. He was estranged - left the family suddenly when my husband was very young. In our two years of marriage, I've met him twice. Once was at our wedding. My husband and him did not have much of a relationship, although my husband did make attempts over the years. 

I understand there are probably a lot of very painful and very complicated emotions that my husband is experiencing. Even with an estranged parent, the finality of death is hard. We talked very briefly the day after his passing, but it has been silence ever since. TBH, it's been silence in our house since early January - but that's besides the point. 

So. What am I supposed to do? With our marriage in shambles, it feels so forced and unnatural to be the loving, comforting and calming wife. I know that I should accompany him to the wake and the funeral (right???), but I truly feel alien next to him. Not to mention, I will feel like a complete fraud to his family - as we haven't told them the magnitude of our situation yet. 

And before anyone says ""Talk to him!"" - I've tried. He does not communicate about difficult, emotional topics. This is part of the reason our relationship has collapsed. I did ask what he'd like me to do to best support him, and he said ""I don't know, it doesn't matter.""

And yes - he's depressed. He knows it, I know it, we all know it. I have suggested counseling, which did not go well. I have also encouraged him to speak with a doctor for some relief but he refuses. He does not want to get better and I have accepted that all the good intentions in the world cannot change that. 

TLDR - I have no idea how to act towards my husband after his father's passing, as he's been cold/distant for months and informed me last week that he is going to be leaving me.",18Feb2020,1

I'm usually very anal when it comes to following directions, but she is not and I don't want to put all of the blame on her, but at this point i'm going to be double checking everything she does. This lab, I have no way of calculating the data that's required because the data isn't even on the graph/tables that we needed, and unless I redo the lab I really can't do the post-lab homework completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

My second issue with her, she misses class often and for the 2nd time in a row asked me if I would send her pictures of all of my lab calculations/answers so she won't have to turn it in late. I'm not really one to share my work, and my prof made it clear that even though we're partners we shouldn't just copy each other's work. Unfortunately i'm not a ""no"" person and I really have just blown her off and told her I haven't finished it yet to avoid telling her I won't send it. This girl is sort of a friend of mine but her ""classwork"" behavior is driving me nuts.",18Feb2020,1
89,"I’ll try to keep this short and sweet. I was leaving target this evening and to my left I saw a woman with her child which was riding in the shopping cart. I noticed the child was around 3-5 years old I’d guess and the child had what to me looked like Down syndrome. I smiled and kept moving then to my right I saw 3 people, a woman with 2 adolescents a male and a female that looked to be in high school coming out of the Starbucks. I pass these 3 and am making my way out of the door when the woman “jokingly” says to the female teen “this is your cart, special needs” implying that the female teen had special needs most likely in jest. What these 3 did not know was that the woman I saw first with the child with actual special needs was behind them and most likely within earshot and therefore heard their rude and off color remarks. My initial reaction was to call out the woman who made the remarks however I typically avoid confrontation. Regardless I turned around and stared at them and shook my head and then walked away. I was buying diapers for my two children and making it home to them is more important that calling out the stupidity of these people. The world is crazy these days after all and while I feel as if I can handle myself I am not trying to go to the hospital or worse get shot. 

I’m asking for advice on how to cope with the fact that I didn’t stick up for the woman whose child has special needs. I was blinded by my immediate hatred for the 3 others that I didn’t even see if she had heard them.

92,"I need help, but this is a long story. Please read through it all to understand!!

So I knew this guy in middle school, we were good friends until he admitted to having feelings for me. I didn't feel the same way and rejected him. He was disappointed but said goodbye and walked away.

I thought that would be it, but he soon found out that I walk home everyday after school and soon offered to be my company the next time I walk home. Now I actually like walking alone, its peaceful and relaxing, but I was nice and decided to let him walk with me.

The thing is my home is a bit far from school, so the walk is long. Ive seen this guy ride the bus a couple times, so I figured he lived far away and offered that we walk halfway before he goes home. He agrees, but when we reached the halfway point he kept wanting me to walk further so he could know where my house is. I thought it was a bit creepy and made an excuse that my parents would be home and did not want to see me walking with a boy.

He then insisted he just wanted to see where my house is and what it looks like, but would not go inside. That was still creepy for me, so I said no and took the long way back home in case he follows.

He continued to insist wanting to know where I live, but by summer break we never talked since.

Fast forward to sophomore year, I have not seen him since, but he somehow saw me in the halls and asked for my number. I have not talked to the guy in years, so it felt like giving my number to a complete stranger. I said no.

Sadly he knew one of my friends and asked her to have my number. My friend didn't like him and asked me first if that is what I wanted and I decided to be nice and let him have it. I figured he wouldn't do anything with my number.

I was wrong. Our conversation seemed friendly since we haven't talked in years, but instantly he asked me out again. I said no and he laughed it off while claiming his gf wanted him to ask. I wasn't sure if he was in a poly relationship but I wasn't interested.

Since then I began to keep our conversation short and sometimes ignored some of his messages, but soon he began to find out where my classes were and we'd ""coincidentally"" bump into each other in the halls. 

When Valentine's came, he waited for me in the hall and asked me out for the third time. Again, I still did not know much about this guy since middle school, so I rejected him again. He suddenly grew angry and shouted,""Why, why won't you go out with me!? How am I supposed to move on from you?!""

I was calm, but in my head I was wondering how he could still like me after we have not talked in years. Later he tells me he never had a gf and just wanted to see my reaction if he were to have one. Maybe he wanted me to be jealous or angry at him dating someone else, but I didn't care.

At one point I tried to walk away from him when he suddenly grabbed my backpack and yelled in my ear, ""Don't leave me! Don't leave me!"" To anyone in the halls it looked as if we were playing fighting, but I was in a full on panic. 

I didn't want to cause much of a scene and instead jerked my way out of his grip and disappeared into the crowd before he could follow.

Ive since blocked his number over the weekend, but school starts again soon and I don't know what to do the next time I see him. I just want this creep to leave me alone.

93,"I (21M) have a younger brother (18M), who lives a decently unhealthy lifestyle and I want to talk to him about it, but I dont know how. I moved away from home about 2 years ago, and every time I visit, I can tell he's gotten a bit bigger. He doesn't take criticism well as it is, so I don't know how to tell him ""your lifestyle sucks"" without him just shutting down.

Long story short, he eats very unhealthily, like eating lots of carbs and sugary things, and rarely working out to balance it. He buys these bad snacks often, which then impacts his budget. He's currently living at home with only a part time job, and no next-step in sight. He's mentioned wanting to go to school or join the military, but the Recruiters told him he was overweight, which I think just destroyed his self-esteem.

100,"I was diagnosed as a child. I think I don't have typical symptoms (not awfully distractible but it's there in some amount). The main, and the most bothering symptom is the fuzziness after an intense mental workout( 5-10 minutes depending on the activity. If i prolong it, it only gets worse...and 'weirder'), sometimes normal day to day conversations (even unstimulating and boring ones). I'll fail to describe what kinda fuzziness. Think of it this way, I feel like I literally temporarily lose IQ. Rendering me a human brick, exceptionally inept and disabled. No, I don't get distracted as far as I can notice,not from stimulating and cognitively loaded activities. At least those that I've grown used to (Chess as a chief example). Could anyone relate? Any hacks around this phenomenon? There are also other things that could accompany this behaviour. It depends, really. Sometimes I also feel after spending considerable time on a mental task(enough to hamper my brain in showing weird symptoms)that I also think in a very different and weirder way. Including :- I shift more towards using my untamed imaginative abilities unwillingly (such events are often strong and masquerade into reality, though I don't totally lose my composure) at the expense of some other aspect of the brain for eg memory, presence of mind (not really perceiving what's happening around me, sort of a high) So what's the deal?

I've never been very smooth when it comes to having a crush and showing my feelings. I either hide it too well so they don't even know, or I'm a total mess. To make things worse, I'm super shy, so I had never asked someone out before. I thought if I left a note to this guy, then maybe I could express myself. Well, what ended up happening is I left it when he wasn't around, so I don't know what he thought or if he even found it. I thought it could've worked, but my dumbass can't seem to do anything right. I mean I'm atleast a little proud that I tried. But fuck, he probably didn't even like me back. My brain probably just made it all up, and now I've made a fool of myself. He probably thinks I'm a loser or something.

106,"My boyfriend recently broke down crying and was obviously hurting pretty bad, and told me he needed to tell me something. He said he would understand if I wanted to leave him, but he needed to get this off of his chest. He said he’d never told anyone before, and he has never forgiven himself for it — and honestly I don’t know what to think. 

He disclosed to me that when he was around 10 years old, he molested his 2-3 year old female cousin. He said he didn’t feel like himself during those few seconds, before she began to cry and he snapped back into himself. He said he felt ashamed of himself, and it’s been around a decade since this occurred and hasn’t been able to forgive himself since. 

I don’t know what to do. I am in love with this man, we have our futures planned out together with a house and a family and a wedding. He knows it was wrong, and I know it was wrong, but I’m conflicted. I don’t want to break up with him for something that happened a decade ago — when he was a mere child — but at the same time I don’t know if I can be with someone who’s done such a horrible thing.

112,"So like the title says I’m in a tough place and kinda feel like a very lost boy. I started a degree in political science two years ago but I never really wanted to go and would have preferred to have taken a year off but my dad sorta forced me to go. Well unsurprisingly I failed I tried but I was having trouble with mental health issues that I had kept hidden since middle school. I wish I had been able to talk some sense into myself in high school, but that’s too much to ask for. But anyways I failed but I’ve also been doing some soul searching and kinda succeeded, I feel motivated and eager to take on a challenge but in return for this soul searching I’ve destroyed my life. Like I said, I didn’t do well in uni but This year I’ve taken measures to increase my gpa and  have begun the process to transfer to a new program and a new school. I’m hoping to go into a business program closer to my home (I was studying political science in a different city) from there I’m aiming to go into law school and eventually find a job in corporate law. The thing is that I understand how far fetched this dream is. It’s pretty far off from what my reality has been thus far but I know with all my heart that if I really put all I’ve got into it I could make it maybe not to corporate law but definitely be able to do something with my business degree in some type of financial advising job. If I go down this route I basically won’t be able to have a life for the next 7 years of my life and everything would be dedicated to either studying or saving money. My other plan would be to just drop out all together and go into a trades program, something like plumbing or electrician. The thing is that I believe I would be greatly unhappy in a job like this. I would feel like my potential isn’t being met and would soon fall back into a deep depression if I isolate myself. When I ask myself what I value most in life I always answer with Justice, even as a kid. I want something that stimulates me and keeps me on my toes but I don’t know if it’s too late.

116,"Sister is being brainwashed a possibly kept against her will, and I may be sued for not cooperating with her “administrator” and adoptive mother.

So a little back story, my (F21) siblings (19,17 and 16) and I were adopted at ages 10,8, 6, and 5. We were adopted into a super religious household where mental and emotional manipulation was rampant. For example, I was pressured to go to school for teaching, and chewed out for wanting to be in the military, and later for wanting to pursue a fashion degree. I was not allowed home or contact with my younger siblings after piercing my ears at 18 while living out of state for the summer, all because I didn’t ask permission. We were often withheld normal meals, and instead fed cold oatmeal with nothing on it, sometimes for weeks at a time. Bruises were commonplace, I was pulled out of school for two weeks due to “personal reasons”, when in reality I had a black eye as punishment for my D in 6th grade math. I could go on and on, but hopefully that gives sufficient background. 

My sister and I were sent to a religious boarding school at 12 and 14 (think Hepzibah House), where I remained for 2 years, and my sister transferred to a different sister school at 14. She will be 20 this year and hasn’t been able to leave. Having been in a similar situation, I understand the brainwashing and mental manipulation makes leaving almost impossible. She also has no life skills, no ID or driver’s license, never had an actual job. Her phone calls and mail is monitored “for her good”, so she can’t be manipulated by the world. She has no access to internet, and has only been able to have a few visits over the years. To top it all off, she hasn’t been able to finish school. The curriculum they use is self-taught, and due to the school moving states and whatnot, she has yet to complete high school. 

Then things become even more complicated. I and two others were left as trustees of my biological grandmas Living trust. I and my siblings are beneficiaries, and everything left after living expenses and education expenses are equally distributed when the youngest reaches 30. My sister has not had the chance to be informed as to what her options are. Her teacher reached out to my adoptive mother to see what they were, which I understand the inquiry, and I said money was there to do what my sister wished in moderation, and I’d be more than happy to help her through her needs (i.e. housing, transportation, education, etc.), as outlined in the trust. My adoptive mother then asks for a copy of the trust be sent to the teacher. I said no. It is the trustees and beneficiaries business, not people who we know to be manipulative. I offered to fly halfway across the country and meet with my 19 year old sister and talk over the trust, show her the copy if she’d like, outline her options, and discuss her plans for her future. I’d like to hear everything “from the horses mouth”. Our adoptive parents are known to be all about control, and if they think they can control my sister’s future, I believe that’s wrong and should be stopped. It’s my grandmother’s explicit wishes as stated in her trust and from her own mouth, from the other trustees whom I spoke with today, and mine as the third trustee, that my adoptive parents have no say in the trust and our futures. It is meant for us to decide. 

After offering to meet with my adult sister, I was threatened twice with an attorney, who will be “looking over my sisters options.” I’m at an impasse. We have an attorney for the trust, and I have very little doubt theirs will get very far, but I’d like to help my sister, as she’s helpless. She has no means of communication or knowledge of the outside world. And though it seems the simple response would be for her to just “leave”, she will have pressure both from mentors, parents, and lack of knowledge, that she’s making the wrong decision. All phone calls and letters are monitored, I can’t get ahold of her. Do I just show up with the other trustees and ask to speak with her? I have no clue what to do, but I miss my sister immensely and hate to know that she’s missed out on most of her childhood and now adulthood to these people. 

TL;DR, my adult sister is being held at boarding school, possibly against her will, and my parents and her teacher are threatening an attorney if I don’t allow them to meddle in her financial affairs. Also, not looking for legal advice, as manipulation and brainwashing won’t hold up in court. I just don’t know what to do.",18Feb2020,1

And when my father did yell at me it was different than my mother in the notion that what he did was not under his direct control but rather the narcotics he has dabbled in as a young adult while my mother did have her own love for me it was controlling and oppressive. Despite what I now saw in my dad my mom was unrelenting and there came a point I thought my head would explode and started to develop panic attacks.

127,"I've known this boy for around 4 years now. I didn't know him well until grade 10. We got extremely close then and I am so happy to say he became my best friend.  I am almost done with grade 10 and we don't even speak anymore. That is because we both caught feelings for each other and got very close. I know it sounds great that we both liked each other but it goes deeper than that when it comes to why everything ended. He has a hard life at home, he was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and his parents split up. And after one night where we kissed, after that, he acted like I didn't exist. He told me that when his life gets hard, he pushes people away, and that's what he did to me, to the point where we didn't talk but when we did, he treated me like shit. And being months since this happened, I realize now how selfish I was being. He was clearly having a hard time and even told me that he thought about suicide. After ignoring me for weeks he then told me he doesn't like me like that anymore. And all I'm trying to ask is, should I ask him how he's doing? And I want to know if he's okay without coming off as ""Still liking him like that"", which I don't. I miss him so much. And I want to see how he's doing, is that a Good Idea? What should I say?

128,"This is my first post to reddit, but I was hoping someone could help me. I've been diagnosed with mild anxiety and depression, but I haven't been to therapy in a few years. Lately I've been feeling more sad than ever even though my life is great. 

On occasion I feel a wide range of emotions, like being angry/sad/empty at the same time. It feels like I'm so mad that I could punch through a wall, but my anger is trapped in a cage that makes me feel empty. Then on top of all that, I just start crying for no reason.

But I cant ignore the fact that there is something wrong with me and I know whats going on. Too much bad past, too much secret.

I end up picking up some of the pieces, only to relapse again and spiral deeper into this mess I created. 

I’ve been stuck on this mindset for a while now, and only recently has it become quite overwhelming. I could push it away before, and keep doing my stuff but ever since 2018 I find it harder now for me to do just that. 

So I obsess and think, and cry and sulk over my past. And it’s always a specific year, with two more that are closely linked. 2014 is the year I miss the most, and 2013 and 2012 are second. I find myself just laying in bed, recalling insignificant memories like the other day I remembered driving with my uncle to our home while listening to Queen. There was no reason for me to remember that—besides that it happened in 2014. But then I have a difficult time remembering what I did last week or newer, recent memories are foggy.

She rarely goes back to her own apartment, which is actually quite a nice living situation, and only goes back to get clothes so that she can stay here. I know it's not an issue of her not getting along with her roommates, as her roommates are constantly over at our house as well.

The roommates of whose girlfriend this post concerns, is particularly assertive at all times and is not one to back down. They are often viewed as a leader among the house, and is often stubborn to the point that they listen to what others have to say.

While I can't give all the details about this situation, does anyone see a way that I might be able to resolve this? After a while, having another person constantly at the house (eating food, using the kitchen, taking showers, etc) is going to start adding up. Additionally, I signed this lease to live with 4 guys, not this girl. While she is generally pleasant to be around, it is annoying to have someone living in your house for free.

I am going to graduate school in the fall and, until then, I am staying with my parents in a small suburban town with just about nothing but restaurants. My last two semesters of school were very taxing on me (lots of work and stress) and I find that I no longer have any motivation to do anything. I used to have and currently have several hobbies, such as woodcarving, writing, wireworking, and playing piano. I also want to work more on my artistic abilities and start really working on writing a book, especially since I have a few months of not really doing much. However, ever since I got home I have absolutely no motivation. I'd also like to get back into reading, but college has honestly made reading feel like a chore and not something to be enjoyed, so at least I understand why I have an aversion to that.

After thinking about it a lot, I think that a large cause is that I'm an extreme extrovert and I have no friends in my hometown because they are all at school and no ways to meet new people my age. Even my girlfriend is at college for another semester, but thankfully she comes home often to visit me.

Anyways, all I do is sit around all day doing nothing. Even though I know I should be spending the time doing something more productive, I just never have the motivation or energy to consistently do anything. I'm also really bad at self motivating myself, I feel like I need to be working toward some external goal.

He had initially reached out to me to see if I was ok and our relationship grew from there. Eventually we developed feelings for each other and he asked me to ‘go out’ with him/be his girlfriend. This was over the computer and initially I said yes, but then I got so unexplainably terrified that I took it back because I didn’t know how else to make it stop without explanation. At the time I didn’t understand that it would hurt him and he started to bully me too. I never really hated him for it but after graduating I deleted any way of contacting me, changed my phone number, etc and we went to different high schools. I ended up suffering through most of high school trying to cope with the effects, and now that I’m in college I feel pretty much back to normal and I’ve put it behind me. 

Close to a year ago I ran into John at a market will I was with my grandmother. He was also with someone I didn’t recognize, so we ended up not talking to each other, but our eyes connected and he definitely recognized me. He seemed a little shocked too, as I was. I’d been thinking about it since, and about a month ago I stumbled upon a way to contact him. I’ve been debating messaging him ever since to apologize and let him know I don’t resent him or anything, but I’ve felt that it’s probably not important/relevant enough to bring up six years later.

I feel like I have too many things wrong with me, I have too many insecurities, and I know many people have insecurities which are sort of not rational.  but I have too many things which I think are wrong about myself,  I have done much thinking and Ive always been thinking of whether I have body dysmorphia but Ive gotten to the point that I dont think I have any dysmorphia and everything that I don't like about myself is actually there, and I'm not just dellusional or anything.  now a lot of people have 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 things they dont like about their bodies or their voice or they way they look or act, etc... but I feel like I cant think of 1 thing about me that I like, name a random part of the body and I can go in depth of why it is all wrong and messed up on me. and Im not talking about being fat Im talking about things which may be impossible or very expensive to change.  so i was thinking about girls, should I try to get a girl friend? Ive never tried before, Ive never even asked a girl out on a date or anything,  because I felt like i have too many insecurities to be confident in myself.   but i know confidence can be trained but what I want to know is,  would girls like me even if I was confident, could they ignore everything which is wrong with me physically?  for me, if a girl had 1 2 3 4 , or a small number of things wrong physically or in appearance (includes voice, and all unconscious things which are hard to control like posture etc)  I could ignore them, but if literally everything was wrong with her I feel like couldnt just ignore it,  so i feel like girls must think the same about me. 

now i know ur probs thinking I have the incel mentality or whatver, i dont consider myself incel just because ive never pursued a relationship before but I feel like im so much worse in appearance then some of these ""incels"" ive seen in various documentaries or whatever.  and believe im a rational thinker,  I believe I dont have any body dysmorphia.  

now girls are not the only thing Ive been thinking about recently,  I want to find guy friends also, which i have not at the moment, the problem is that I want guys who respect me, and Ive lied before about not being a virgin etc, but I dont think they believed me.  and I could just tell the truth and admit that Im just a freak who never did anything with a girl but then if they do let me into their group, I will just be the person who all the jokes get thrown at, and i will be locked into this way of just taking all the jokes, and laughing at them, and just taking it.  and while im with them its funny but when im alone those jokes get to me, and they make me feel worse.  and I also feel ill get into the trap of having no confidence,  and ive been in groups of guys like this before and ud think eventually id get somewhere with confidence but i never went anywhere i just stayed the same.  

so what do you think and can anyone relate 

to be fair i will ad ive had some girls have crushes on me before but idk.   I try very hard to see what they might hvae seen in me, but no matter how many photos i take of myself, no matter how much i pose in the mirror,  no matter how much i try to see myself in a different light or try to see myself while thinking positive thoughts or whatever,  I still just cant understand how anyone could ignore this ugliness that i have about myself.   

I think those girls who expressed intrest in me where just a figment of my imagination honestly, 

maybe they were sent from god to give me hope.

168,"Let me start by saying I'm unsure this is the right community. If not, please direct me where I should post this.

For starters, I'm a fucking mess. No one needs to point it out. I am self-aware enough.

I'm going to start by saying I don't know what to do. I feel lost. Alone. Afraid.

I'm 36, white, male, and I assume average. Or in the realm of average. I have a college degree and a couple certs to try to be more employable.

I have no job.

My health is a mess. I'm disabled. Here's a list of things I have going on with my health: epilepsy (almost died with the two seizures I had), migraines that throw me in the hospital, and clinical OCD (not the self-diagnosed stuff people claim to have and don't). I also have a mass in my brain every doctor nopes out of operating on because of its location.

I met my wife a little over two years ago. Things felt right so I dumped the woman I was with and things have been generally as good as they can be.

I've had five jobs since we've been together (Jan 2018). Lost two of those, got big enough raises or promises of better working environments to bring me to the others. Never happened. Kind of my life.

Other health issues I had since meeting: ankle replacement (two weeks after we met), a colonoscopy and precancerous polyps removed, and having a hernia removed plus having the lower sphincter of my esophagus so I would stop daily vomiting.

She has mostly done well, except the car accident she was in a couple weeks before we met. But that was fixed by PT/chiropractic. One thing didn't change. Pain in the left side of her jaw. It is/got so bad I can't kiss that cheek anymore. Half a dozen doctors and then an oral surgeon later, it's October 2020. I had no job by November

The day before I had my weight restriction from the hernia surgery lifted (a couple weeks ago) we got news from the oral surgeon she needed her jaw joint replaced and a biopsy. Could be cancer, and not the OK kind. CTs showed no growth. But they have to remove the joint before they can biopsy.

And so far, we've been turned down by two of the local hospitals/medical legions in our city. No one can do the full thing, and no one wants to take out her joint without a direct plan of action after. Now, we are in limbo again. No idea if the insurance company wants to do its pre-authorization thing or if we're waiting on the ""experts"" to get back to us.

I'm kind of freaking out here. I've been through a lot. She hasn't. 34 years is a long time to find someone, and I'm not up for being in my 70s before I can find someone half as amazing as her.

I'm struggling to do my creative stuff. I write (have a story being published in the near future) and do art and photography, but the drain is real. I broke down watching the final episode of ""the Good Place"" today while talking to my sister who lives on the other side of the world.

I don't know what to do or where to go at this point. No therapists want to take on a white dude in my area (LGBTQ+/women/family/children are all the interests I see for anyone who takes Medicaid), and I'm feeling very lost.

I don't even know what I'm asking for at this point. I am working with the Department of Vocational Resources to get me something more than a paycheck job. None of those have been good for me either mentally or physically. They ain't fast.

Either way me and my girl were happy and always messaged and FaceTimed and after we changed classes for semester and didn’t have class together, we met in the morning. 

However since February started until now, she stopped messaging me. The only time we talk was during the morning and that’s it. We hug and go to class. Not talking until the next morning. She also does tell me though not to get her anything for valentines day. So I tried messaging her myself about why she seems distant and doesn’t want anything but after she was being shady and I explained I felt like she might not like me anymore, she reveals she knows her mom won’t let her get me a valentines gift, so she doesn’t want me to get her something when she can’t get me something. I explain I don’t care if she doesn’t get me anything. I just care about showing her I like her and was thinking of her. But when I decide I won’t give it to her if she insists that she doesn’t want it, she changes her mind and says I can give it to her. (I did and she ended up getting me candy too anyway). 

But also in that convo, she revealed that she also thinks thinks her mom and complications are making me stressed and she thinks we should just be Friends so I’m not hurt. I explained her complications don’t hurt me and I still like her. Then she admits that she still likes me and we stay dating. 

But then I message her a few days later and we have the same exact convo. She thinks I’m being hurt by her complicated life with her moms expectations. I tell her it doesn’t hurt me. But when I start agreeing that maybe we should end the relationship and be friends, she gets sad and tells me she likes me and tells me to not end it. So we stay dating. And this convo happened again before me posting this. 

So now for this month we don’t ever talk except for 5  minutes before class in the morning, and when I message her we have that type of convo I described above. I can’t tell what’s going on or what she might be thinking. Anyone have any advice?",18Feb2020,1

173,"I’ve been working at a doctors clinic since last August. I get paid $9.50 an hour. At my last job, I was paid $11 per hour sitting at the front desk of a salon greeting people as they walked in and occasionally tidying up. At the same time, I was working at a restaurant making an average of $15 per hour on tips. And before those jobs, I made $10.50 per hour at Chick-Fil-a. Those were all part time jobs while I was in school. I took a break from school this semester to make more money, so the clinic job I have right now is scheduling me full time. I make $9.50 per hour there, so after taxes, I make around $600 every two weeks. And it’s for a lot of work, I take patients back, check them in and out, and file insurance claims or scan documents in between. I’m thinking it will be great for my application to medical school, but working full time I’m making barely enough to pay my bills, not enough to pay off any credit card debt or save anything for when I go back to school. I’m wanting to ask for less hours so I can work at a restaurant job as well and actually make decent money. What would you do?

186,"Hi, 

I recently have booked a relatively long red-eye flight (\~11hrs) and haven't flown in years. I used to always get sick on flights due to weird smells and a weak stomach (wouldn't be able to eat and vomiting). I am trying to get over this hump and have recently bought a neck pillow, melatonin, and earplugs to help me fall asleep. I also plan on eating a decent-sized meal before my flight and if I can eat a meal during the flight. Do you think this would help? I am trying to get over this.

Also, if I put my neck pillow on top of my rolling carry on bag would it be okay for an international flight (in a small tote attached to the handle)? Or would it be better to put the tote in my carry on roller bag (I will also carry a bag on my back)?

Thanks for the help!",18Feb2020,1
187,"My dad texted me this:
Landry, you have to communicate with me about what you are unhappy about.  I cannot read your mind.  Also, if I or nanny or poppa say something that you disagree with, do not text your mom.  If your mom says something that you disagree with, do not text me.  This is not helping the relationship between your mom &amp; I.  Lastly, I am not a villain &amp; your mom is not a saint.  We are both sinners &amp; we are both imperfect.  You probably won't realize this until you are an adult.  I love you &amp; I hope you have a great week.  


I WANT to send him this:
I can't talk to you without it getting back to Nanny and Papa, and they just give me a hard time. I don't like it when they single me out and you don't stand up for me. All they do is complain about what me and coy do when we're over there. Over the years you and them have severely affected our mental states by shaming us. McCoy talks about getting a liposuction because he is self conscious because YOU made him aware. That's not okay. Parents and grandparents are supposed to build up their children/grandchildren. McCoy and I get depressed when we spend time with you over a long period of time because of how you tear us down. I hate my body and the way I look because of how you point out how I look. You have already done enough regarding my self image so the least you can do is not say anything about it and tell nanny and popa to stop. I get that you never stood up for momma and you go along with whatever your parents say, but that doesn't mean it's the right thing to do. I have longed for a dad that would play with me and have deep conversations with me. I left boyscouts because I couldn't take seeing all these cool dads that would build up their sons and help them out. I don't play sports or hunt because when I was really little I didn't have a father that would be there and play with me. You always missed games or concerts because of work, but I know it actually just wasn't your priority, so you missed out. When the divorce was happening and you moved out we were devastated, but after a short while we realized that mom was always the one there for us. She was the one that came to practices, games, concerts, and meetings. She was the one that came to things that happened at school. She was the one that we could go to to talk to about anything. So you leaving wasn't that different. In fact, it was a good thing, because only now do I know how poorly you treated my mother. What kind of husband corners his wife and yells at her. What kind of husband screams at his wife to shut up. What kind of husband tells his wife on a vacation that he isn't happy with her and her weight. A terrible husband. What kind of father puts down his children. What kind of father refuses to take care of his daughter to make his life easier. What kind of father lets his son cry on countless of nights because his father never spent time with him, and when he did his father treated it like a chore. You were a sorry excuse for a ""loving"" husband to my mother. You are a poor excuse for a father, but I guess it makes sense if your father doesn't let you speak, have opinions, and has to have you always be there and force you to cancel your plans. Ik you live your dad but what about me and McCoy. While you were spending so much time with your dad, we wanted our dad. You have and always put your parents higher than your children. I love you dad, but your dad means more to you than I ever could. You don't know how long I've felt this way. You have never been there for us. It shows how awful and fake our relationship is by the fact that I can't even tell you to your face these things, that I have to spend a long time writing an ESSAY. From your mistakes at least I will know how to be a better father to my children one day.

193,"I am the most senior receptionist at the vet I work at, and lately there has been a lot of stuff falling to me, and I feel like I should have a raise and more authority if all these things are going to fall to me, but I don't know if maybe I'm just more detail oriented and more of a worrier. I do make a bit more than some coworkers, between 50cents and $2, depending on the person. I have no authority and my title is the same.

One such thing is that today I had to come in, even though my boyfriend had taken the day off and we had a fun day planned. I am so frustrated but I don't know if I have the right to be.

Basically we are always supposed to have three people scheduled, because it's doable but stressful and difficult with 2. I originally wanted to do the scheduling, but the owner thought it was better that she did it, which is fine. I've tried to at least be in the loop, and keep the communication going, but often I feel like I am met with annoyance on all sides because I'm sticking my nose in something that isn't my job, or nagging.

So I backed off. I figured the only way anyone was going to realize this stuff needs to be addressed is if we're short handed. But today, a coworker had a death in the family, and wanted me to come in for her. I began calling around, trying to figure out the plan for today, and who might be able to come in. Apparently one of the people that was supposed to come in later today had told the owner she would be on vacation. The other was being phased out and said she didn't think she was supposed to be coming in still.

So that meant that the clinic would not function unless my grieving coworker stayed, or someone else came in. No one else wanted to, so I had to or the grieving coworker who never missed a shift would have to stay for her full shift.

The owner was so annoyed by all of this that she said she was washing her hands of all of this, and that reception needed to get their s\*\*\* together and work things out themselves. This upsets me, because I don't feel like we could have done anything, and I sacrificed my fun day for the clinic, and reception figuring their stuff out basically will mean I have to figure it out. But I don't have the authority too, and it shouldn't fall to me unless I get a promotion. I'm not crazy right? This isn't sustainable.",18Feb2020,1

I don't like those kinds of jokes and I know a lot of other people in the server don't, and if he were someone I didn't really know I'd probably just kick him from the server and that would be the end of it. I was going to reply to his joke in the server, but felt that if I did, other people would back me up but in an aggressive way and I feel like that's not the way to convince someone that something is bad. So I messaged him privately which probably made it seem like more of a big deal than I was trying to make it and pretty much told him 
""Hey, so I kinda wanna keep rape jokes out of the server, it's not my thing and could be triggering to some people"" 
To which he replied saying that you have to know the series to get the joke and if you read the series it can't be triggering for you, then followed with 
""But I mean sure. I’ll acknowledge the majority of your friends don’t have my sense of humor and refrain from jokes resembling the subject matter.""

Since we've been friends a long time, I'd like to continue to be, but it'll be difficult if he makes rape jokes and stuff, I just don't know how to talk to him about it.

Ive never dated anyone before, and there's this boy that i really like and want to go out with. Ive told her before about how I like a boy, but she always seems to change the subject. When i push it she keeps calling me rude names and says i want to go and do anyone. 


I am 100% a good student. I have straight A's, tutor all day after school for my family and friends, I help out at home and even at her work. I cook and clean, ive held down a job before, ive taken care of our family before. Ive done many things that warrants some sort of trust, yet she cant seem to see me as more than a baby. 


I dont lie to my mom, i used to with little things when i was younger, but I'm older now and I'm more mature. I have an older brother that she insists has to go out and make friends, yet she wont let me hang out or even be on the phone with anyone. Her excuse is that I'll focus on a boy so much that I'll lose track of whats important.

204,"So, my girlfriend has depression...I do what I can to  help her. But recently I've been a little  afraid that I might get it. 

Yes I am aware that depression isn't  something you ""catch""

Basically my reasoning  for this is, after I got into this relationship I lost a lot of friends, friends that I've known almost 10 years, not because they liked her or anything but  because they thought that I wasn't making time for them. I could go into reasoning for that but  I would prefer not to.

But with the loss of them that kinda puts me friendless...I only had those few friends. Sure I have my  girlfriends friends but then I have the worry that my girlfriend will break up with me to try and ""protect me"" or something and then I wouldn't end up hanging  with them because they're all girls and her friends who I don't know all that well.

I am quite introverted, hence why I only had few friends, so making long term friends like the friendships I used to have is not something I believe can be done, nor do I believe the old ones can be  mended.

&amp;#x200B;

Below I will say ""my girlfriend"" a lot. I mean that she was my girlfriend at the time, but we are no longer together.

The story:

About a year ago I cheated on my girlfriend. I slept with another woman on a ski trip I took. This other person and I had only met face-to-face a handful of times, but we'd been penpals for a couple months and had written fairly lengthy letters to each other, and also talked on social media. This ski trip wasnt originally planned with seeing this other woman in mind, but she was willing to travel to meet me and another friend, so it quickly started centering around her. I was excited to meet her, I feel like we had become close by writing letters to each other. I never mentioned that I had a girlfriend in our letters. At the time my girlfriend and I had been dating for 4 months give or take a couple days. I dont think there was any malicious intent yet. I've always been reserved with speaking about girlfriends because you dont know if it'll turn into anything serious or not. However, I could have and should have mentioned something during the trip, and I didnt. I created the opportunity to cheat but it wasnt until the last afternoon/night that the opportunity became a reality.

I regretted it immediately, and it was no where close to being worth it. The excitement, rush, or high leading up to the actual sex was the most exciting part. I think that's what drove me to do it. It's the anticipation, like the feeling before a big trip or concert. I also got off on the idea of it, knowing that it was wrong. I rationed it off as just sex, I knew I didnt want to start a relationship with this person. I also didnt think it'd ever come up again. 

My girlfriend felt like something was off, as soon as I got back she felt odd about the trip. She had a guy feeling that something happened, and she was right. A couple weeks after I got back she brought it up to me. I lied and said nothing happened. I lied to myself saying that it was ""better for her not to know, my mistake shouldnt cause her the pain of knowing"". It was also easier for me to lie. Her and I had 5 or 6 more talked about how she felt about the trip, each time I would listen, say ""im sorry you feel this way"", explain everything I did during the trip (except the cheating), and generally do my best to listen to what she was saying and try to make her feel better. I told myself that I'd put more effort into the relationship to make up for this. To make it up to myself. I told myself I'd be a better partner to her.  I felt guilty about it, and sometimes it got to me. Not for long though, I'd either put the thoughts out of my head, get drunk, get stoned, or get myself so busy I couldnt think about it. The feeling would go away. I was gaslighting her, I didnt realize it at the time, but I do now. 

Throughout all this I stayed penpals with the other woman, thinking that it was fine because we were ""just friends"". This other woman knew I was dating someone, I lied to her and told for we had started dating after the ski trip (after I cheated). I didnt think that staying in touch was emotionally cheating, but it was. We talked about some deeply personal things, things I think would be okay if we hadnt slept together, but since we had they were not okay.

What drove me to tell her was the last time she brought it up, she asked me directly if I cheated, and I lied. She told me about the previous people she'd seen who had cheated on her. It all came crashing down on me at this point. We were long distance at this point (for less than a month), I was trying to find a job to move with her. That night I didnt sleep and bought a plane ticket to see her the next day to tell her in person.

When I told her, I let her look through my phone thinking that there was nothing to hide. I let her read all of my texts/messages with the other woman. That's when I learned about emotional cheating and that I had cheating on her in a way I didn't realize but also knew was wrong. I'm still working through those thoughts.

She also found texts from someone else, lets call her 2nd woman. This 2nd woman was a friend of mine that I very casually saw for a couple months, years ago. I had reached back out to her to start hanging out again since I just started working in the city she lived in. We got back in contact maybe 10 months ago or so, when my girlfriend doing an internship in another state. 2nd woman and I hung out a couple times, and I knew that she had once had an NSFW account on reddit where she would sell pics. I confessed that I was feeling an attraction for her, but just wanted to stay friends. We talked about it one night and came up with the idea for me to pay her to take naked photos of her. I lied about my relationship status again, and rationed it off as ""this is porn, im paying for it, so it's okay"". I knew it'd bring up questions if I had told her the truth. I sat there and told her about my girlfriend and how I was only thinking about dating her, how I was unsure. But we had been dating almost a year at this point. The whole reason I got back in touch with 2nd woman is because I wanted something sexual/pornographic/erotic from her and knew how to get it. 

What's troubling is that the entire time I was thinking about telling my girlfriend about the other woman, I never considered the 2nd woman. I had convinced myself that it was okay because I paid for it, that it was okay because it was just like watching porn. That's when I realized my porn usage had gotten out of hand. The time I spent looking at porn had increased dramatically over the past couple years, I'd started paying for subscriptions, websites, and people. I had an online BDSM ""relationship"" as well (prior to this). After awhile it would get bored and I'd more on, and escalate. I let a healthy coping mechanism get out of hand. I'd look at porn all day at work too. Every now and then a voice would pop in my head and think ""this isn't healthy, if you don't get this under control, its going to turn into a problem"" I'd thought this for awhile. But each time I was able to ignore it, similar to the voice about the guilt. 

I'd had similar thoughts on my alcohol and weed consumption as well. I've smoked marijuana and drank alcohol almost every day for the past 4 or 5 years. I definitely abused marijuana, alcohol was more of a dependency. I'd never drink to get drunk, but I'd always have 2 or 3 beers a night. About every other week I'd have 3 or 4 and get moderately drunk. I definitely do not want to try and shift the blame of this on anything else, but I cant help but think this is all related, along with the porn use. I've forgotten so much, don't remember so many conversations I've had. Like all the conversations I had with the other woman and 2nd woman. Reading back through the texts/messages with my girlfriend, its so obvious that all of this was so wrong. Like Christmas of last year, I asked 2nd woman to send me a nude because that was our tradition...I have no recollection of that, but its right there.

All parties involved are now fully aware. I called both women and told them everything with my girlfriend listening. I apologized for lying to them, bringing them into this, and ruining two great friendships because of my actions. I blocked them on social media, deleted their texts, and threw away all the penpal letters. My girlfriend and I have broken up and are no longer talking. She was somehow grounded enough to be able to put this experience in a positive light for herself and offer me advice the last time we talked.

This is not the person I wanted to be, this inst the lifestyle I want have, or the thought process I want to have. I've caused so much hurt, especially to an amazing girlfriend who was nothing short of the perfect person. I need to do this. I need to do this myself, for myself. 

I want to start growing to be a better person. I want to be in a monogamous relationship eventually, certainly steering clear for a good while now.  I want to be an honest person, but have been everything but honest. I want to start communicating more openly, making myself vulnerable, but that's also been challenging. It's difficult for me to express emotion outwardly, and easy for me to lie to others and myself. I had a lot of shame surrounding my drug/alcohol/porn use, and I've internalized that shame rather than showing it. I want to empathize and put others before me when appropriate. I tend to be outwardly nice but judge very harshly internally. Its hard for me to resist impulses, like pulling up porn on my phone whenever I'm bored or reaching for a beer after I get home. Its hard for me to be alone, I've hard a partner or girlfriend much much longer than I've been by myself. I can empathize with people using words but not actions, I have only been prioritizing myself recently. I've ignored my inner voice that warned me about my actions and habits.  I'm capable of doing terrible things: gaslighting, lying, cheating, manipulating. I hate that that's a reality. 

Ive stopped smoking and I'm now drinking on weekends only. The alcohol habit is harder to kick than I thought it would be, I want to cut back even more, but that's where I'm at now. I've started going to a therapist. I was going twice a week for 2 weeks, but I cant support that financially, so I've moved down to once a week. I've been scavenging the public library for any book I think will help. I've started listening to relationship podcasts about infidelity, in an attempt to realize all the various ways and depths that I've hurt my girlfriend. I'm currently reading a book titled ""Willpower Doesnt Work"" which goes over changing your environment to force you to grow. I've already read ""The Gifts of Imperfection"" because my therapist recommended it to me. That goes over letting go of who you think you're supposed to be, and embrace who you are. I'm not so sure about it, but want to read it again and talk with my therapist about it more.

Unfortunately I don't know where to go now or what to do. I want to dedicate as much time to personal growth and understand what I've done as possible. Even after writing all this, I know that only I will know what are the right next steps, but I would really appreciate any suggestions or advice you have to offer.

TLDR: Cheated on girlfriend and lied about it. Cheated on her a different way, lied to myself about it. Ended up telling her and everyone else involved. Realized that I have a problem with lying, alcohol, weed use, porn, and probably more. I dont want to be this kind of person and am dedicating all of my time to change that. I've made some changes to want to learn and do more, but dont know where to go. I'd like suggestions for books, podcasts, websites, or anything else. I'll try to look at them all.",18Feb2020,1

All of us are pretty close, but over the past couple months, I have realized that things have changed (due to us starting university). We normally talk about a lot of things, but girls always come up. We're all pretty good with girls, but sometimes thats all we ever talk about. The bigger issue is that because I study further away from home than them, I feel like I'm missing out on some things. Like for example, if they are talking about some chick, they rarely ask for my opinion. Its like I'm some beta or something.

So I'd say on and off mostly on. I find myself drinking 100 proof Smirnoff vodka and always chase it with a red bull. I always pass out. But if I really want to pass out. I get like a 12% four Loko and as a chaser and have five minutes of 100% off. Instant out. But what I'm trying to say is Monday through Sunday. I drink I pass out stay on my room. Go on online dating websites on my phone.

I have a therapist I see, I kind of take medication I don't take seriously because I know the alcohol really doesn't help it. But I'm stuck in a rut with a low-paying job That's not necessarily a dead end job. But it's an experience job. Point is I feel like I see the end of the tunnel and I feel like I'm just going to be poor for the rest of my life so instead of trying to better myself I just drink. pass out rinse and repeat every single night and it makes the seas in my head not as rough. F*** it's smooth sailing in my head Monday through Sunday. Am I saying I'm doing the right thing? No, am I saying I should seek friends? I don't have any. It is just me in this world. Literally just me and I have no one else to help me. Could I go to my parents? I really in my head there never an option. This is my problem. And I quote-unquote should maybe try and fix this.

214,"To preface, I feel like fucking garbage because my ego says ""If she doesn't want my company, fuck her"". But my heart says otherwise. I have too much respect for her, and her character to just give up. I haven't had a friend like her before. She's one of the rare people I could literally tell anything and always receive a solid truthful response. No bullshit. True friends stab you in the front..right? I miss her a lot and this is making me uneasy.

We'd confide in one another often, and it wasn't just an e-friendship. We'd cook together, hang out, call, vid-chat, etc. There was solid grounds to believe she respected me and cared about me the way I did about her. I like to believe we experienced some good stuff together, and had fun with one another's company.

But a handful of months ago, she began distancing herself from me. Wouldnt reply. Didn't pay me much attention. No big deal, I can understand; people get busy. I experienced a lot of hardship this year and I was definitely too clingy and overcompensating by messaging her a ton. But I've done this before, and she would always reassure me that things were fine. One time she was willing to go out for breakfast, but that was the last positive note. When she was feeling sick, I went to drop her off some meds and munchies, and she was very thankful. But her birthday passed, and since she was super busy I just figured I'd drop off a gift at her place. I was very conflicted about the idea, cause I hadn't heard from her. But I got her a vinyl LP, as I got her a record player for her previous birthday.

And then she ghosted me. Like she ghosted the fuck out of me. 

I messaged her later, asking what was wrong, and she told me that she had ""lost all respect for me"" and that I shouldn't contact her again. I was devastated, and I asked her to explain, but she ignored me. 

I told her that it wasn't fair for her to ghost me without giving me a chance to defend myself. She claimed that I could, and that she hadn't blocked me, thus I could speak my mind. 

I made the point that I couldn't defend myself, if I didn't know what I'm defending myself against...and she blocked me.

In that conversation she said something about removing negative influences from her life, along with ""I feel no ways about you"".

I don't know what the fuck to do, but I thought I got over this shit. Then I woke up after literally having a dream about her. 

I want to text her, or send her a message on something I'm not blocked on (she didn't block me everywhere), and ask her to talk. I don't know what the fuck I did? My biggest fear is I said something before I got to know her (which would be my fault), and somebody used that as ammunition to get her to cut me off. But I can't remember. She also said something like ""You're smart, figure it out"".

I can't figure it out.

I need advice. Thank you in advance.",18Feb2020,1
215,"I also posted in r/internetparents, but I am just so lost.

We've been together 6 years in May, so I'm pretty attached to him you know?

Last night when he went home (from my house) he saw cops on his street and immediately panicked thinking they were there for him to arrest him, despite him doing nothing wrong. (This isn't a red flag to me, he was falsely accused of rape at 16 and was arrested/in jail until it was proven that she was just lying out of spite because he rejected her)

The problem is that last night he texted me that he had gotten home and was going to smoke some weed before bed. We had a small conversation. Everything was fine? This morning I saw a message from him telling me he had to tell me about a dream he had and that he needed some support. Well, wasn't a dream. He saw the cops and split. Drove to another jurisdiction (super far away, like 3 jurisdictions over) and cleaned his car and other tasks I guess? Not super clear on what he did for those few hours. He said he thought about just running away from it all, he didn't really explain why he did what he did other than ""he was scared.""

Well, this is not the first time he's been dishonest and just lied to me. I feel like this is a huge breach of trust, last night was effectively a weekend (today's a provincial holiday), what if he had gotten hit by a drunk driver? Or had crashed in another way? I would have woken up to hearing that tragedy when last I heard was ""i'm home.""

Am I wrong to be upset? Im afraid I'm going to wake up tomorrow, or wednesday, and just find out that he's just gone. How the fuck am I supposed to process this? Ok sure he told me, but he still broke the trust? Like this is a huge red flag, no?",18Feb2020,1

As a child victim of sexual assault then later as an adult I knew right off the bat this guy was bad news. The mother is a terrible person with total disregard for herself and her children. Even after the allegations became factual when I pulled his records bc my radar was operating full force and the case went to court and he was charged but on bail she still allowed him access to these kids. My husband is very lax about confronting the family about the situation bc he's afraid of the consequences (the grandfather, grandmother, mother, his 16 yr old daughter, and two kids under the age of 5) all lived in the house at the time and the c grandmother is a paralegal who manipulates the court system. He has joint custody bc he was 16 when he had her. Technically the grandmother has the final say. The mother has legally no rights.

220,"Hey, so I (20M) went out with a bunch of my friends to a club on Saturday, most of which are the same major as me (and as such, I consider them off-limits). Two of my closest friends have a roommate who I'm less close to, but she (20F) is still cool and we talk. I play videogames with her every now and then and when I go to their house she always hangs out with us. She's pretty quiet and reserved usually, but as time has gone on she's gotten more open with me.

When we go to parties/drink together we usually hang out in a platonic way. I hadn't considered her anything more than a friend really. However, the other night we ended up dancing together at the club and making out, and I really enjoyed it. We haven't discussed anything about it as of yet, but my other friends obviously noticed. While I haven't talked to her roommates yet, apparently they were telling other people that they were super excited that we were together and stuff.

I'm really unsure how I feel about all of this. I could see myself with her, but she is roommates with two of my best friends and I'm concerned that if something happened between us that I may drive a wedge into a pair of friendships that have honestly been some of the best in my life.

My mom made a deal with me that I could stay at home rent free for two years once I graduated high school, as long as I do work around the house and have a job. She's had a boyfriend for over 5 years now, and he recently started living with us. 

Now onto the situation that I need advice on.  

My mom got home from work and said ""Hey, I need you to do something with my work iPad"" Work is telling her they have to wipe it, so to get anything off. She just wanted photos. I’ve shown her multiple times how to upload to Google Drive, and it’s required for her job.

Me: “All you need to do is upload your photos to Drive” Her: “I don't know how to do that, can you just do it for me?” Me: ""What? I've shown you how to do this multiple times, all you have to do is make a folder and- She cuts me off, and in an irritated tone says ""Can you just do it for me?"" I'm like mom, it's super easy. I'll show you how right now. In her irritated tone she says ""Okay, but I don't want to learn how to do it right now, so can you just do it?""

Cuz of her tone, I say ""No, I'm not gonna do it. I'll show you how to do it though"" This really pissed her off, and she told me to just go. I'm like why are you acting like this? I'm just trying to help. Her: “I don't want you to help me. I'm done. Just go” She was yelling, so I say ""You're literally yelling at me when I'm trying to help you""

I continued basically repeating myself and say it's ridiculous that she's getting mad at me for offering help, and that it's easy and I'd show her.

Boyfriend enters and yells loudly at me to shut up. He got very close and looked super pissed. I ignored him as he repeatedly yelled shut up, and I kept arguing with her. He started saying ""SHUT the FUCK up!!!"", and I'm now a little scared because he’s yelling louder than I've ever heard him yell, along with looking at me like he wants to beat the shit out of me.

He yells at me to leave. When I don't, he grabs me and starts dragging me out of the room. I’m not okay with being touched or grabbed, and I'm now in panic mode and repeatedly tell him to get off me and stop. He eventually does, and I take my phone out to start videoing cuz I wanted to document what happened in case he hit me, and to deter him. He was still in my face at this time.

I start the video, and say he doesn't have permission to touch me. He said “I can touch you all I want”. He tried grabbing my phone. I repeatedly said ""stop"", as we were both holding onto it. Him: ""Oh, whaddya gonna do? Whaddya gonna do about it!?"". He eventually let go and walked away, but said he was calling the cops, and pretended to. He ended up walking outside, and then it was fairly calm. I forgot what my mom said, but she said it calmly, and I went away.

If I had a redo, I would've just been like okay, she's stressed and tired from work, so I should just do it for her, even if she is talking irritably, or at the very least I would’ve left the room when told. I can see her boyfriend's side, because he saw me being disrespectful and not listening when she asked me to leave.

She’s saying I need to apologize to him, but I feel he should apologize first, considering he blew up on me, grabbed me, and pretended to call the cops. So what I'm wondering here is if you guys think I should apologize to him first, or what exactly I should do.",18Feb2020,1
234,"I have discovered someone(a 12 year old) was recording a video while my ex and I were having a private conversation and uploaded it to YouTube. 

I was not aware of this video and I am not sure if my ex is. I am NOT comfortable having a video of our conversation and a video of my apartment being on YouTube. 

How do I go about getting this removed? I'd ask them to remove it but I am not comfortable contacting them. I am a private person to begin with(my stepdad used to record me secretly as a child) and this upsets me probably more than it should. The video has been up for 1 year.

235,"So, I looked through my younger sister's search history and found out she has been looking at those Gacha Life sex videos that are rated 11-13+. I know they won't show anything explicit, but any form of porn can lead you to the hardcore stuff. She's only 9. I want to stop her from viewing these things, but she is very protective of her devices and quickly closes out of stuff if someone approaches. I know she'll snap at me and just become even more protective of I ask her about it, because she'll know I went through her tablet without permission. I can't report this to my parents, because I myself am under 18, and they'll get all suspicious if they realize I know what pornography is. These kinds of videos aren't age restricted on YouTube, so there's not much I can do in regards to preventing her from searching for them.",18Feb2020,1

I started to become depressed for this, and other more personal reasons, my dreams of being a experimental physicist was crushed, and I just gave up and only did enough to get by.

Last semester I got a loan from a company called sixup, and my funds got disbursed for fall, but they were unable to disbursing my spring loan die to facing financial challenges. My sister and brother also owe money now too. We chose that company because they didn't require a cosigner and instead based the rates on our grades. I don't have anyone that can cosign a loan for me and I don't qualify to take out one by myself.  I owe $3,000 by April if I want to enroll in Fall classes on time, and $4,000 total.

My family is incredibly poor, so we have almost no savings and my three siblings are also in college (I'm a quadruplet). $4k is alot of money to us. I met with the student loan advisor and he doesn't know of any other companies that dont require a cosigner, so I can't get another loan. I have a meeting with someone else from financial aid to talk about how I can pay it, but I've already been told that I don't qualify for more gift aid or more work- study, so I'm not sure what they're gonna tell me that I haven't already heard.

To put it simply, someone I liked very much for a very long time treated me like shit all throughout our relationship. (I know this may seem suspicious without me giving more context, but trust me, there is no debate who hurt who.) I realized this and called them out face-to-face, and their response, rather than take responsibility for what they did, was to cut off communications with me and make underhanded, immature, attempts to ruin my reputation. To clarify, they failed. All this while refusing to have a genuine conversation with me about our mistakes. I have continued to blatantly tell them how I feel about them, while they have only been talkative behind my back. I cannot go on being mad at them- I hate having enemies- but it’s proving practically impossible to forgive an unapologetic person, especially considering I am embarrassingly prideful.",18Feb2020,1
241,"I’m currently in a relationship that is about to reach 1 year, on the 28th of this month. In the beginning things were great, she was happy, i was happy. The sex was great, communication was perfect, there were literally no issues. But then her life started going down the drain, it was about two months in. A bit of background, we met online on xbox when she was 14 and i was 15. We would play all the time for years. But it was just that, we were friends online and i never tried to make it anything more. i got into a 2 year relationship when i was 18 and then i broke up with her, that break up is a whole another story but it was a bad one. During that relationship i had lost all of my female friends because my ex was really insecure. I rarely played with my xbox friend anymore. I broke up with my ex and i decided to try and talk to my old friend. Of course there were feelings there. We started talking everyday and eventually we both just said fuck it and moved in together. But then she kept making really bad financial decisions and now she’s in massive debt. The worst part is that she made those decisions in the beginning so i couldn’t really tell her not to spend money on something she wanted since it was a new relationship. A year later, shes working everyday and whenever she isn’t she’s too tired and she gets irritated really easily. Because i went from one long relationship to another, i never made friends with another girl and my girlfriend is even more insecure than my ex. I can’t talk to her about my problems because she’s too tired and stressed. She only ever wants to talk about her problems and i feel completely alone.

However, lately I’ve been noticing things like, I have no close friends. I have no problem with meeting people and talking to strangers, but I have a problem with trusting them/opening up to them. Because for the past years everyone who’s come into my life has left. 

So I’m always on guard: “why should I bother putting effort into people who will just leave?” 

I’ve recently met a guy (40-50ish) who I have this weird feeling could be a great father figure in my life. I see him once a week, but I am hesitant into continuing on seeing him. I don’t like getting my hopes high.

247,"I’ve just discovered this subreddit. I am glad I did. I hope. Be Easy on me.? So, I left my abusive boyfriend of 2 years today. I lived in his house. I had nowhere else to go. A co-worker had offered to let me stay with them. So today when things were too much to handle I took them up on the offer. This in and of itself is problematic being that it’s a co-worker. Mind you, I have no friends or family. My boyfriend is the only person I know other than co-workers. Anyway, so, even worse this is a male co-worker. Man. Goddamn. Anyway, so, my car is not working right now so the good news is I have a place to stay and a way to get to work tomorrow. But and not to sound snobby I’m not trying to be ungrateful. The house is filthy. Like, filthy. There is a bed. I have barely eaten all day and have no money to get food. Both TVs in the house are at full volume. Deafening. I’m not going to take my shoes off. His dog outside kept outside all day and night. Has an eye infection and didn’t have any water. Damn. I’m not letting my dog come here I can’t. She’s not an outside dog. That’s not ok with me. 

My biggest concern is that I need advice on how to approach the worst thing of all. Am I being dramatic? Ungrateful? I don’t know. But my room I’m in which is right next to his... it has no door. Am I wrong to want something up for privacy’s sake?

And he keeps on walking by and makes comment like “you’re always on your phone geez!” 

Ummm, like you’re in your room watching tv drinking beer all night sooooooo let’s not be openly judgy. Keep it to yourself like I am. Ok so this is rude of me I know.

249,"I’m female, 25. He’s male, 30. 
Met through mutual friends.

We went on a business trip together (both work within the same field going to a equipment show) and one thing led to another and we kissed. Got back to our state and things went further and he ended up being the first person I’ve ever had sex with. He wasn’t/isn’t aware of that. 

Things were good the past two months, I spend the night 5/7 times a week, we pretty much always eat dinner together unless the other is at work and he gave me a key to his place. But last week I had some *serious* vaginal irritation — swelling, redness, and pain while peeing. I incorrectly feared that he had given me an STI (we haven’t been using protection because we’re dumb, irresponsible, I hate birth control, and only used spermicide sheets + my period/ovulation tracking apps) and according to him was acting weird for a few days. I told him about my health concern and he went with me to the doctor since I have extreme anxiety about doctor visits. 

Turns out I’m just allergic to latex and I had recently used latex based sex toy cleaner. Honestly was a relief, but afterwards I joked saying I thought he gave me something and he’s really upset and hurt. He said no sex at all from here on out which... is weird? We haven’t “defined the relationship” because I haven’t felt there was a need to and I just enjoy his company, BUT, the sexual attraction is part of it. He adamantly declared that I get no more weewee, but he’s still smacking me on the ass and groping my breasts casually. 

He said his feelings are hurt that I thought he could’ve gave me something, but he’s had 50ish sexual partners and did not hesitate about not using condoms with me. I assumed it because I’ve never had any single vaginal issue, not even a yeast infection before and he was the only recent change in my daily vaginal activities. I already told him this, and because I’m active on tinder (... he is too...) he assumed I seeing other guys. I thought the same about him, but apparently I’m the only one he’s having sex with. 

I have apologized and said word for word “I’m sorry for making assumptions, and I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. STI’s are common and it wouldn’t mean you did something wrong, I was just making sure for my health.” but he’s still sulking during his bubble bath and not talking to me.

250,"My name is Dante (Well the name I go by anyway), I'm 19 and I don't wanna live on this planet anymore. I have become so unbelievably narcissistic that I don't even feel like a human being. I come from a family of wealth so I've always been given high expectations of what to become by age 21. At age 16 I dropped out of high school to pursue a music career as I had some views on Youtube (Which I found out means nothing in the adult world) of me performing songs. I dropped my first project at 16 as well, it was a pop ep and it actually was mildly successful, not anything to where I'm a recognizable name but it made me a good chunk of change and it did get me hits on Youtube. I became very egotistical during this period of my life and started abusing drugs, nothing insane but I would for example at 16 (Because I had money and no schooling and lived alone) wake up at 3 PM, turn on my [vape volcano machine](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0209/9072/products/volcano_classic_vaporizer_size_1024x1024.jpg?v=1571264530) and huff 10 big bags of extremely potent weed in my dirty bathroom all day. My depression really started to worsen as time went on and eventually a tragedy actually happened to me. 

When I turned 18 I put out another album but it flopped MISERABLY, my last project had gained millions of views all over Youtube and had given me great admiration among my peers, I felt truly gifted and loved and perfect during that time. However my new project was barely attracting 20 thousand views on my best videos, some of my songs literally getting no more than a thousand views. I had run out of money almost entirely as no one was buying my music anymore and in fact I had actually attracted quite a horde of stalkers AND haters who would send me really hateful messages about how I was nothing and how my music was all garbage and how I should just end my life. I had to move out of my apartment (Which my parents had signed the lease for) and move in with my brother because he was the only one willing to take me in after all of this. Now a year later? I'm still here doing literally just that. I'm jobless, I dropped out of high school and noone wants to pay for my college or GED education and I feel like ending my life really soon. My life really has spiraled into an immense dumpster fire. I can't even get a job at Mcdonalds because I was such a little asshole when I was 16 that I worked at Mcdonalds (Before all of this went down) and acted so horrifically I've been blacklisted from working at their establishment ever again. I also tried doing a security gig at Securitas at 18 but I was caught smoking weed on duty and was almost arrested for breaking a federal law because you legally cannot do that on duty.  

Oh yeah and because of all of this stress I'm BALDING and gaining a lot of weight. I'm so addicted to drugs I need to huff at least 10 bags and have 6 grams of Kratom a day to even feel normal and not like vomiting. I also have these [hideous tattoos](https://i.imgur.com/2wCT1P3.jpg) I got during my ego spree that I vomit everytime I look at them. I can't get a girlfriend because I'm so goddamn socially inept and full of myself, I heard 90% of the girls in my town who know me think of me as some dumb fuckboy with no future prospects.

251,"I (25F) married my husband (25M) legally over a year ago, just a little ceremony in our home with three friends, one of them officiated while the other two were witnesses. We knew we would want to have an actual ceremony at some point to celebrate our lives with our family and friends and just recently decided on a date.

Herein lies the issue: My stepdad was incredibly abusive to me, physically, emotionally, and sexually. It has taken years of medication and therapy to get to a point in which I can allow people to touch me at all. I'm very proud of my progress. 

However, my mother is very much in denial about what her husband has done to me and every time it has come up she argues that my timelines don't add up (it went on from ages 9-13) and agrees with her husband that I'm doing it for attention. The last time we spoke about it was over a year ago, she told me that I couldn't have been raped because she was unemployed and usually home during those years (as if she was constantly watching me for 4 years?)

It has been 7 years since I opened up to my family about what he did to me and after being silenced by my mother I packed up everything I owned and moved over an hour away. Now I see her twice a year, maybe 3x max.

I still love my mother despite her consistent avoidance of the truth and want to invite her to my wedding so she can see her oldest child marry, but I never want to see my stepdad again and I know he will throw an adult tantrum if she is invited without him, and she'll be left dealing with the aftermath.

254,"(This is a disorganized, miscellaneous rant. It gets off topic)

Before I started losing weight, I was 151 pounds and really insecure. I hated every moment I spend in public because I felt like I wasn't pretty enough to enjoy things. I spend all of my time on my then-boyfriend. I had to spend hours getting memes beforehand just to be able to hold a conversation with him.

Eventually I just couldn't take it anymore and began to lose the weight. Right now, I'm 125 pounds and I gave up. I binged a lot. I still do, honestly, but I've been maintaining the weight, and that's why I'm too lazy to stop. 

I'm not as insecure as I was, and I don't hate being seen in public, I just don't enjoy it. I know that I won't be able to enjoy it until I'm 115lbs. I've promised myself that I'd finally do things I've always wanted to do when I lost the weight. But at the same time, I'm just too lazy and unmotivated to do anything.

Also, a while ago, I broke up with my boyfriend when I realized that the relationship was very one sided. Breaking up with him was something I promised myself I'd do when I reached my goal weight, but that relationship was making me so miserable I just had to get out asap. 

He isn't good at starting conversations, but he doesn't like being left alone. He'll follow me around whenever possible and I just feel trapped. I don't have the balls to tell him I want to be left alone. I've told him to leave me alone before, and even though he promises he will, he just follows me around anyway.

Whenever he's around me, I just feel so uncomfortable. Like I have to start spending all of my time getting memes or else we're trapped in that uncomfortable silence, and honestly I spent so many hours on that I don't want to look at a single meme for the rest of my life.

I used to be in a big group of friends, and I miss that. There's also this girl I have a ""crush"" on. Like, I don't have any romantic feelings for her because I barely know her, but we're both in the same friend group and I'd like to get to know her. 

I don't even know what kind of advice to ask for, honestly. I just needed to get this off my chest.",18Feb2020,1
255,"Hey guys don’t really do much of the posting on reddit more of the commenting but I want opinions from others who are unbiased. 

I (21m) unfortunately still love at home while I finish up my studies. Probably a mistake as I should’ve left home during first year but I didn’t and my parents were happy about it as I wouldn’t have to get into debt. At home I do my regular part of doing dishes cleaning my brothers and I room as we have to share as we don’t have enough money as a family to move out to a better place. I never minded though because I grew up in this apartment so it’s all I’ve known. 

I’ve never been ungrateful for anything I have but I have voiced my own opinions on things like them buying a car every two years instead of moving or other things. They have always wanted to best for me and both my mum and dad are expectant of me to achieve great things.

The problem I have is that no matter what I do or have done to try and reach these “great things” it’s never been good enough. My relationship has all but broken down recently with my mum. Me and her have never seen eye to eye on many things and have always had differing opinions. I’m a good student and when I’m not at uni, I work to make money for myself as I hate asking money off of them. Me working 5 days a week while studying was an ideal enforced by my mum when I was 16 because she always would say “you do nothing around the house least you can do is get a job instead of scrounging off of us”. 

Because of that I did get a job and have worked many jobs over the last four years. This is one of the many parts of my life I have changed to please her. I all but gave up a social life my last year at sixth form (like where you go before uni in England) just to go to a prestigious college where I didn’t get along with anyone because I’m a guy from rough east London while all the rest of the student were upper class white idiots.

I get told by my mum nearly every night that I spend too much time on my computer when it’s really not true as I barely get any time at home so when I do I like to spend time playing games and such but in her eyes because it doesn’t fit with her ideals of a perfect Christian family she gets mad saying “you don’t give a fuck about your family and when we are dead you will regret it”

Furthermore she has called me multiple times when I’ve been out with friends or at a lecture for uni saying if I’ve left a plate on my desk or left the bin open or left one of my drawers open. She does this to shout and call me a variety of names including slacker, disgrace and a favourite disappointment. 

One thing she does that really does hurt the most probably is when she is shouting at my younger brother who is 11 she will say “I don’t want you to turn out like (me)”. This rlly annoys me and we will get into a fight always where she will say I’m playing victim and say that my computer and my attitude is the reason why our family is falling apart. This type of thing has been going on for years. 

I think this has affected me in other places of my life also as I get angry pretty easily with other people like I’ll explode and I don’t like to open up with others. 

It also of course has affected our relationship also. I’m actually engaged and haven’t told her because I don’t actually care if she knows. I plan to move to America and live with my fiancée and she knows I’m planning on moving doesn’t know about engagement though  and called me recently saying something like “if you don’t care about your family anymore then you should just go already”

I plan on getting married late this year and don’t really want to invite them to the wedding because of how much i don’t want them to be there. 

My dad has always not taken sides when we have begun an argument because he’s just that type of fence sitter person. Also my mum loves to say to him late at night as she is doing currently “if I’m the problem I should leave” which he tries to coddle her saying she isn’t and then has a go at me and then says “you two are so alike” to which of course doesn’t solve anything but he doesn’t want to get in the middle of nothing. I don’t blame him though he’s just not that type of guy to take sides but when he doesn’t it’s always hers and that alright really.

Well this was long and if you read through it we are fully fledged friends because you probably know more than my actual real life mates. Sorry it’s it unreadable first time posting in a while and was a whole lot of rambling. Opinions would be nice on the situation and if you have any other questions I’ll answer them. I really just want opinions on how I should approach this and if I’m in the wrong or whether I should just pack and leave because I’m close to doing it.

256,"Hello. I’m going to try to sum myself up in a few words. I’m 19, female, sophomore in college, majoring in computer science. Used to be really smart in high school but now I skip all my classes and couldnt learn a new concept if my life depended on it. Very depressed. Don’t like college or my major at all. I don’t like any majors, actually. Which is why I want to drop out. I have no clue what I want to do in life. Well, I do, but I have no clue what career I want to have to be able to have that life. 

Basically (this might sound lame but this is what I want don’t judge me) I want a small house, some land, some chickens, maybe some other animals, and I just want to chill with all my animals and maybe have a little garden. I want to be happy and peaceful, but I am definitely not that right now. I don’t want to go to college anymore. It’s made me into a sad blob of flesh that doesn’t really mind if the world ended right now. I don’t want to be that. 

The only thing I don’t know is how I’ll make money. I owe $10k in student loans as of right now, and I don’t think I’d have to pay back my scholarship(hopefully). So I guess I’m in the hole $10k. I have about $1000 in my bank account. That’s where I am financially. I should mention I live in an apartment on campus while going to school, but live with my parents an hour away on breaks, so I’m not going to be homeless or anything. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m extremely depressed. Not that I’ve been diagnosed, but if I’m not depressed then I couldn’t imagine what actual depressed people feel like. I don’t have any motivation. I have no reason to want to pursue this degree, so I just don’t put in any effort. I want to pursue something that I want. Something that I’m excited about. 

The other thing is I don’t really have any special skills.. I can do art sort of.. crochet.. pretty much anything an old lady can do. If I could play sudoku for a living that’d be great. If you guys have any tips or tricks on how to get my shit together, they’d be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Due to the bad schedules, I am constantly checking to see if she can hang out because she is often busy on her off days and I am often not (she works full time and goes to school, while I just work). She has called this behavior clingy, which I didn’t really understand because how would I know without asking?
Anyway, here comes Valentine’s Day, which is also her birthday. She doesn’t like Valentine’s Day and she was feeling kind of down, but I finally convinced her to go out and have fun on her birthday. We went to several bars together, danced, made out in public, made googly eyes at each other the whole night, all the gross couple shit. At the end of the night, she said that she was glad she came out and that she hated that we don’t get to spend much time together. She said that she hated that we don’t get to spend much time together. One more time. She said she hated that we don’t get to spend much time together.

I told her I am moving really slow and I would like to shower before seeing her but please call when you’re done. She said okay, I began getting ready for the day. So, she texts me after shopping and says that she needs a nap. I said okay and asked if she might want to hang out later, to which she said she might go see some friends. I asked if she would want to swing by my place and say hi, as I knew that she would be taking the freeway to her friends house, so she could easily stop by my house on the way if she wanted to. She said it’s out of her way (which it is by two blocks west) and I eventually just said okay whatever. Anyway, she doesn’t text me for 5 hours, and in the meantime, I just happen to be sinking into a low mood because I am a depressed person. So I text her to ask if she’s awake. Three more hours go by and it’s bedtime for me, and I’ve been sinking into a worse mood, and all I want to do is talk to her. I text her one more time to ask if she’s busy because I would like to hear her voice before going to bed. Immediately, she calls me on FaceTime. We’re chatting about nothing and we’re not able to talk much at all because she’s talking to her new roommate at the same time. She says she feels rude and I say I don’t mind but she said she does and then she straight up hung up on me. It was supposed to be playful and I got that and responded, “Hanging up is rude too...” she replied, “Well, you don’t know how to read a room.” I said, “I was just kidding but okay, goodnight.” She did not respond.
This morning, I texted her, “It is very important to me that we set aside a few minutes to talk today.” I had cooled off and I wasn’t feeling as down because it was a new day. Furthermore, I knew that I had probably bugged her yesterday because of my “clingy” behavior, as well as being short with her when I said goodnight and I was ultimately intending to apologize. I texted her as I was leaving for work so didn’t expect a reply for several hours as she has no work or school today and was probably sleeping late. The reply I get is a three page wall text about how I’m immature and clingy and she can’t handle the emotional drama. She blocked me. I was working, so I didn’t get to see her reply until later. I texted her that I had only wanted to apologize. The message said delivered but I don’t know if she actually got it because she said she blocked me. I also left a long voicemail at lunch explaining where I was at yesterday and that I’m sorry and that I am trying not to be clingy but I can’t help but want to spend time with her, etc. I don’t know if she got this, but the voicemail greeting was still hers by that time, so I hope she did. 
I stewed on this all day at work, pretending to be happy. Eventually, I decided that I would go to her house after work to talk to her. I didn’t want to just show up, so I texted her sister, who she lives with, to tell her that I’m coming by. I knew I wouldn’t get the warmest welcome. Probably yelled at, maybe slapped. But I had to talk to her.  I was greeted by a male friend who I had never met, who did me the kindness of at least relaying that I only wanted to apologize. She didn’t want to talk to me. I left a few more rambling, crying messages for the friend to pass along, but I had to accept that I wasn’t going to get a face to face and left. 
Now, I’m sitting here, trying to decide if I should mail her a letter since I can’t talk to her on the phone. I’m also tempted to text her sister and try to get her to be a liaison.

There is probably more that I could provide in the way of context, so please ask. But here’s the deal: I am in love with this girl and I just want to talk to her and be heard before accepting that it’s really over. What should I do?",18Feb2020,1
258,"My boyfriend is getting 200+ calls  and messages from a girl he went to school with.

The messages consist of vulgar descriptions of how she wants to eat his faeces and how she is going to put hexes on our relationship so that my boyfriend will fall in love with her. She is calling from 2 different numbers, a public and a private. My boyfriend has blocked the public one but he can only mute the private one since you cannot block private numbers.

He has ran up Optus to ask if they can block the private number but they said no.

He has been completely ignoring all the calls and messages, thinking that she would get bored, but it has been 2 whole weeks and she is continuously calling hundreds of times every day.

Does anyone have any ideas that would stop this girl from obsessing over my boyfriend in which she hasn't even seen for about 7 years?

Are there any other websites like FEMA?

FEMA was a website where you could enter a persons number and they would get 50 to 100 spam messages every day, but unfortunately it doesn't work anymore.",18Feb2020,1
259,"I’m sure this gets posted here a lot but I just need to have my own post about it. Basically, I’ve had a lot of time for thinking and I realized that the root cause of a lot of my biggest problems is that I care too much about the opinions of others. I’ll actually hold another persons opinion about me in higher regard than my own opinion of myself, which is fucked, but I just don’t know how to let go. 

Like if I make a mistake and someone calls me stupid, I’ll actually let that affect me and it ends up leading to more mistakes. I’m fairly sure I have some form of anxiety or something that causes my mind to function this way. It has to do with confidence as well. For example if I’m playing soccer with confidence, I can be the best player on the pitch. But when I let people’s criticisms about me (whether they be real verbal statements or contrived inside my own head) affect my mindset, I’ll actually lose all my confidence and play horribly. Which in turn leads to more criticisms and ends up in a vicious downward spiral. 

I need help learning to control this fear and ultimately letting go of others opinions and just living life to the fullest.",18Feb2020,1

What happened today - - - Today really did it, I almost kissed him. We almost always joke around, tease, and feel that tension but today was harder to control. It started out in the kitchen when making completos (basically hot dogs with lots of toppings), I was chopping up the tomatoes and my phone was in my back pocket of my shorts and this boy takes my phone out slowly while standing behind me and after a minute he put it back slowly and Damn... and after that we were preparing the completos and are hands brushed and are feet were touching and Though that is normal I felt every slight touch. After we ate and watched movies my bestie goes to her room and it's just me and him and we start wrestling and in one moment he picks me up and lays me down on the couch and I was still clinging on him because I wanted to win and take him down and in that moment I swear I could've kissed him.

262,"So I, M(18), messed up real bad with this girl a couple weeks ago.

A couple weeks ago was Super Bowl Sunday and was getting ready for going out to eat like my family does every Super bowl. My mom, sisters and I just get home and my mom pulls me aside and says “Hey just so you know ‘blah blah blah’ invited us over to their house tonight”. I was shocked when I heard that because it was the first time I’d see this person in over 5-6 years. 

Fast Forward, get to their house and we re-greet each other (family to family) and all that but I get really really nervous and I end up being a mute. I’m not normally a shy person but it’s been years since I’ve seen this girl and her family and I think that I came off as weird or something. Now I don’t know when the next time I’ll see her is and I feel like I really really messed up by not saying anything. My sisters hit it off with them and i felt like a fool. After all that I went home and I felt so pathetic.

264,"When I was 15, I was groomed by a 30 year old who I foolishly believed was 18 at the time. After months of ‘dating’, he revealed his true age and intentions. Long story short, himself and some of his other veteran buddies abused me for the next several months. They had me exercise in the nude while they criticized me. The sexually assaulted me. My self confidence nearly 7 years later is still destroyed.

I spend a lot of my time criticizing myself. I try to go to the gym, but I see muscle heads and have flashbacks, stopping me dead in my tracks. I hate my body. I also spend an ungodly amount of time considering my beard, my hair, my clothes... all just in hopes of finding my ‘perfect’ look, but obviously to no avail. Those men planted a horrible seed in my head that seems to never go away. My thoughts keep me up well into the night. My boyfriend lies asleep next to me right now, and it makes me sad that he doesn’t love someone with more confidence. 

So my question to the community is split: how do I either begin working out without freaking and finally seeing some results or get out of my head long enough to fall asleep.",18Feb2020,1
265,"Can’t figure out if girlfriend still likes me or not

Both Seniors in high school. 
We have known each other for years and have classes together. Weren’t friends but like we sat at the same group tables and stuff. So we’d talk and be friendly. I ended up liking her. Turns out in December she’s asks me out and reveals she likes me too. So we start dating. And from then until the end of January we’d talk all the time. Either in our class together or we would message. And we manage to hang out once too. (By the way it’s our first real relationship with anyone)

Now her mom is kind of of strict. The kind of person who has gone to school a lot, single, and plays different instruments and has high expectations for her daughter. She also doesn’t want her to really date as she thinks dating causes drama at this point. However she does want her daughter to go to prom and she knows and is happy me and her are going to prom together. She doesn’t want her to date however. But my girlfriend doesn’t agree with that and so she is still dating me. And our friends and my parents see us as dating. But her mom doesn’t see us as dating for now. 

Either way me and my girl were happy and always messaged and FaceTimed and after we changed classes for semester and didn’t have class together, we met in the morning. 

However since February started until now, she stopped messaging me. The only time we talk was during the morning and that’s it. We hug and go to class. Not talking until the next morning. She also does tell me though not to get her anything for valentines day. So I tried messaging her myself about why she seems distant and doesn’t want anything but after she was being shady and I explained I felt like she might not like me anymore, she reveals she knows her mom won’t let her get me a valentines gift, so she doesn’t want me to get her something when she can’t get me something. I explain I don’t care if she doesn’t get me anything. I just care about showing her I like her and was thinking of her. But when I decide I won’t give it to her if she insists that she doesn’t want it, she changes her mind and says I can give it to her. (I did and she ended getting me candy too anyway). 

But also in that convo, she revealed that she also thinks thinks her mom and complications are making me stressed and she thinks we should just be Friends so I’m not hurt. I explained her complications don’t hurt me and I still like her. Then she admits that she still likes me and we stay dating. She also reveals she just wants me to message her more instead of her messaging me as much. Which I admit I should do. 

But then I message her a few days later as I try to be more initiative, and we have the same exact convo. She thinks I’m being hurt by her complicated life with her moms expectations. I tell her it doesn’t hurt me. But when I start agreeing that maybe we should end the relationship and be friends, she gets sad and tells me she likes me and tells me to not end it. So we stay dating. And this convo happened again before me posting this. 

So now for this month we don’t ever talk except for 5  minutes before class in the morning, and when I message her we have that type of convo I described above. I can’t tell what’s going on or what she might be thinking. Anyone have any advice?",18Feb2020,1
266,"CONTEXT: i am 16(f) my boyfriend is 17(m) 
me and him have been dating for almost a year (march 19,2020)
my parents have been divorced for almost a year 

Before the first weekend of November everything was perfect. I still had friends, me and my boyfriend were very happy and in a healthy relationship , me and my parents still kinda got along, and i was mentally doing alright. 

Then on the 3rd of November 2019 me and my boyfriend where caught having sex. I left a big hicky on his neck by accident. I was ripped to pieces by his mom and my mom. They saw my naked photos and they saw our explicit text. I was humiliated and embarrassed. My dad called me a dirty whore and so many other things. Me and my boyfriend went from seeing each other for hours on the weekend to being able to talk to him for 5 minutes a day at school for two months.(both of us had our phones taken). During thanksgiving i opened up to my mom about me harming myself (self harm habits that began freshman year, i am now a junior). I began seeing a therapist. 

Late December we got our phones back and it was awesome. Talking to him again made everything so much easier relationship wise. Family wise it was awful. My mom would randomly go though my phone without letting me know. she’d bring up how disgusting i was and how disappointed she was in me. It destroyed me. 

January was alright for me. Not as many bumps in the road. We almost broke up but we worked it out. His mom wanted us to break up because she didn’t like me anymore (which she never did. she never gave me that chance). I had more and more fights with my mom and dad. Wether about their dating life and who they brought into the house (mostly mom) or just how just how badly they made me feel about myself (mostly dad) there was always a fight at one of their houses. Late January my mom denied me being put on prozac and i was put on on birth control (the bar implant) just to see how’d it work out for me. 

February has already been a complete shit show. I’ve cried everyday after school. I get made fun of for walking home as a junior. I haven’t seen my boyfriend outside of school for four months now. I miss him and being able to talk to him is great but it’s to the point where i need him to be physically here as well. Along the way i’ve lost most of my friends (including a four year friendship because she found more interest in drugs and then sexually assaulted me). And whatever friends i have left i haven’t seen in four months because i haven’t been allowed outside of the house alone. And to put the cherry on top of it all, my 13 year old Beagle that was fighting bladder cancer started having seizures last night. She had four last night and in sheer panic me and my mom took her to a vet at 2 am and left at 4am with seizure meds. Today she had two seizures that both lasted a minuted long. Not wanting her to live like this my mom made the call to put her down. I went with her at to see my best friend of 13 years be put down. At 4:05 pm this afternoon my best friend was put down. When i came home i got into a text fight with my boyfriend and i’m just so tired.

i don’t feel like myself anymore. i feel like a shell of who i used to be. it’s been so hard and i don’t know what to do. sorry for the lengthy story. i just need help.",18Feb2020,1
267,"So here’s the deal: I’ve got a high voice. And yes, it will go away eventually, but for now I’m stuck with this. I’m the antithesis of the squeaker stereotype yet I have actually gotten a lot of flack by just trying to be polite and stay out of everyone’s way. PC games, console games, VR, every single god damn time I speak, I just get labeled. And it’s annoying, too, because my taste in games is a little above what many my age are doing, and it seems like nobody really wants a “kid” (though I’m not, I do not breach the TOS) to pollute their own “mature” sanctuary.  And I get it, but on one side there’s the screaming and yelling and cursing etc., and the other is unattainable.

268,"Soo I don’t know how to start this , I was friends with a girl and since last year I had cut ties and no longer speak to her. I went into the shoe store (which my former friend works at) recently this month with my best friend because she wanted to look into buying shoes. As we went in we weren’t greeted the environment in this store was very hostile. 2 of the girls working in there saw us and quickly ignored us so we went to look at shoes ignoring the negative vibe, 5 min passed by and no one came over to see if we needed a size as my friend has been holding a display shoe for a few minutes then. She had to go up to the register and ask if someone can grab a size for her since no one approached us. We sat down to wait for the shoes, which took her a bit to find but also I heard from the back the voice of my former friend on the phone going “ oh HELL NO, Girl I’ll call you back.“ It’s a small store and it was slow during this time so me and friend gave each other the “I’m guess she knows we are here “ look. After my friend tried on the first pair shoes, it didn’t work and as she put in the box right then and there our former friend walks out from the back and stays behind the register with the associate that was helping. my friend. My friend had to again walk up to the register and explained to the associate that those didn’t work out and suggested if they had a different pair and she told her that she would bring it out. Once my friend moved to walk away, the former friend laughed and whispered something to the associate’s ear which made my friend feel uncomfortable mind you the WHOLE ENTIRE TIME IM SITTING WAITING. At one point there was an old man he didn’t look like he can really understand English and another associate that was helping him was basically rudely telling him “ YOU FOOT IS WIDE” and I work in retail and I know customers can be stressful but there are better ways to handle situations. He left without buying shoes and this girl cleans up her area and passes by and gives a disgusted look and I quietly say to my friend “ wow they can be very bitchy “ and next thing we know no one is on the floor and we hear yelling “ I DONT CARE IF SHES HERE THAT DOESNT BOTHER ME” my friend had received her shoes and tried them on sadly they were small. My friend went to the register to ask if she could order the shoe online and the other associate who helped the man told her “no” without even checking (the one helping her ignored her to do displays so she decided to go to the register). We left and later asked a mutual friend if we could order them since she works at the store but was off that day and she said “ yes you can “ and that’s when my friend said “really ? Oh the girl told me no.” A few days later the same friend who works there (and is sisters with said former friend) contacted me that her mom was getting mad because the store manager had told her that I basically called her daughter a bitch then left and then her mom entered the conversation when we were Skyping to lecture me and tell me to stay out of her daughters’ business and basically forbade me to enter the store. So I called corporate because this was discrimination against me and they understood and said that it would go through the district manager. The district manager was very rude, basically treated me as though I was lying, and ended up making me cry and that was when he finally showed any sense of concern. He ultimately just flatly asked “Well what do you want me to do about it?” I just wanted to enter the store and be treated as any normal customer, and he basically said let me talk to the manager and I’ll get back to you. A week passed and I met with my friend who works there again and she had basically said that she was informed by her manager that I was basically banned from the store and that was the decision of the district manager. I just want to know because I want to shop here without having to drive out 30 minutes because of a lie, what else can I do at this point?",18Feb2020,1

271,"Alright, I am 17 years old (turned 17 2 months ago), and I want to know how I can move out of my parent's home at the age of 18. If you could take the time to guide me and help me out, I will be very thankful, because I dont have anybody else.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are just people that I dont want to be near, they just are not the type of people who I think are healthy for me to be around. More specifically my step father. Dont get me wrong, I love them, but I feel like I just need to be out on my own where they can not affect my mental health. Last month the most traumatic thing in my life happened where my parents got into a fight, and things escalated, eventually things ended up bad with my step father holding a gun to my mother's head. All I could do was sit there and watch. The police was called and he was arrested, but my mother had him released 2 days later. After all of that, it just seems like niether of them have learned a lesson, and is still on the same ignorant shit. They are both the issue, and they cant talk like regular adults. If something where to happen, then I and my siblings would end up screwed up. Thats too much power over my life to people so immature.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also an indie developer, and this project I have true passion for, and I feel like it really has the potential to succeed (I dreamt of this game 10 years ago, I have wanted to create games since I was 4), I have been working on this game nonstop for the past weeks, but I feel that my parents are the largest blockage for this. They dont know the work I am putting into this, and they wont try to understand, its just who they are. My dreams are irrelevant.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, my parents also play intense favorites where its horribly obvious. Lets use our birthday gifts for example:

&amp;#x200B;

\-My little brother has received 200 hundred dollars for his birthday, as well as some clothing

\-I received 65 dollars from my mother and grandfather

(My mother and grandfather gave him 100 dollars in total, and my step dad gave him and extra 100 dollars)

&amp;#x200B;

ANOTHER EXAMPLE

&amp;#x200B;

\-My little brother has not done his house chore ever (he half asses it when people force him to)

\-I get scolded for slacking, and I dont even slack often. Sometime I even get yelled at even if I do do my chore.

(They may use the excuse of ""oh, you are older than him"", but my ""little"" brother is about to be in high school, and I had it way harder than he did when I was in the 9th grade. Its bullshit)

&amp;#x200B;

So yes. That is painfully obvious. I dont even want to interact with them, its been like this my whole life. I am the screw up, and everybody else is just so wonderful. So this screw up is going to live his life, and go 0 contact with everybody, because its obvious that I am just extra weight that they want out anyway.

275,"Backstory: My ex was my first love. She was the girl I followed on the playground aimlessly as a child (approx. 3rd grade) and my feelings for her didn't change throughout high school. She was always THE GIRL in my eyes. Eventually, after 8 years of crushing, I was able to ask her out (she was my first, serious relationship). 

At first, our relationship was great. I never had anything like the connection we had. I lost my virginity to her, we were incredibly close for awhile, and I thought it was something outta story book. Obviously the relationship eventually took a total nosedive. We started fighting a lot. She was depressed and I didn't know how to help her. She started shutting me out and when she let me in, she took all of her problems out on me. Idk exactly when, but she eventually started looking for other people. We had an argument when I found her Tinder/second snapchat with tinder guys added. On our one year anniversary, she wanted to go party/stay at a guys house, who was always trying to take her out on dates. The last straw was when she cheated on me, with a friend, on Christmas Eve. 

I need to state I was far from perfect in all of that. I became controlling. I took my anger out whenever she became upset (probably out of confusion). And I just gave up all together.

After the cheating, I led her on with the promise of staying together. I used her for sex and whatever other things I wanted for about two months until I gave up on keeping her around. All together, our relationship lasted about two years. 

That was two years ago, and she is in my DM's again. She apologized a lot for everything that happened and said I was the best guy she's ever had (she dated multiple guys before me, and I know of about three after we broke up). I can't help but to have feelings for her. She is the girl I compare every girl I meet to. I never stopped loving her, even after the cheating. She said she's changed and after speaking to her for awhile, I am starting to believe that. However, I can't help thinking of the bs we went through. She goes to college 3 hours away from me, and of course I wonder if I could trust her. Also, our families would hate to see us back together.

It's like I'm just stitching my life together by random corners. Words have been slipping from me, I'm in the middle of a conversation then I just can't get past a certain word.

In a conversation recently, I was trying to describe an outline for my Communications class, and I got stuck on ""revision."" I just kept saying it even though I knew I was trying to go on. No matter how hard I tried to say something else all that came out was ""revision."" It's frustrating that sometimes my conversations will be cut short by my inability to speak. I've never had this problem before, but it's been occurring more frequently over the past couple of months.

I've also noticed my hands having a subtle shaking to them. I used to have steady hands, but ever since I stopped writing (my classes don't need physical papers to turn in anymore) my handwriting has begun to fall into an absolute monstrosity.

My cumulative unweighted GPA is a 3.7 on a 4.0 scale and I rank within the top 20% of my class. I’m also really passionate about music. I play seven instruments proficiently, and I’m self-taught on all of them except for one. I’m in the highest level of concert band, choir, and jazz band offered at my school. I was a soloist in last year‘s marching band show, I’m the only person who plays my instrument in a local audition-based youth orchestra, and I’m going to be in my school’s acapella group next year. I used to be part of a rock band, and we played gigs all around our city and were finalists in a battle of the bands at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year. I was also flown out to NYC to give a TED-Talk at one point (for totally unrelated reasons). I don’t say all of this to brag, I’m just trying to show that I’m a good kid.

As great as all of that sounds, I did a lot of it with very little support from my parents. My brother had good grades when he was in high school, but he took mostly normal classes. I vividly remember him being rewarded with a cheesecake for his good grades at the end of each term. I have never received a reward like this for my grades, or for anything I’ve done. My parents have also shown very little interest in my music. I’ve been writing music on my own and for bands since sixth grade, but they never ask to hear any of it. I work very hard in preparation for my choir, band, and orchestra concerts, but the most I ever get from them after a performance is a “good job”. They’ve started skipping my school band concerts (when they do go, I can tell they’re only there because they feel obligated to be), and they only went to one of the several shows I played with my band over the year or so that we were together. They also told me once that they wished I wasn’t in the youth orchestra because it’s apparently burdensome for them, even though it’s pretty much the most selective one in the state and it literally doesn’t affect them at all. They were reluctant to let me perform at the Rock Hall, and didn’t drive out to see me there (even though we played there on two separate occasions and it’s only about 2.5hrs from where we live). The parents of every other person in my band showed up. They also didn’t watch the live stream of my TED-Talk and they just didn’t seem enthused about it overall.

More recently, I’ve been thinking about college. Where (or if) I want to go, what I want to major in, the works. I’ve requested information from colleges and sometimes schools will mail me letters or pamphlets. My parents never used to touch my mail, but over the last few weeks, I’ve found letters from colleges in the trash and under large stacks of paperwork where they seem to have been hidden. I was also selected for an honors society through a college program I’m in, and I found the letter of recognition torn to pieces in the trash before I had even touched it. When I talk to my parents about college, it never goes well. They get uncomfortable, answer in closed-ended ways, and try to change the subject. It’s also important to add that they have $0 saved for my college fund and aren’t going to help me pay for anything. They didn’t help my brother, either. We’re not rich but they seriously don’t have anything saved for me, not even $100.

The thing that pushed me over the edge to write this happened earlier today. I was talking to my friend about how I really want to learn drum set, and she told me that she would (very generously) give me her kit because no one in her family uses it. It’s really nice and I REALLY want to learn how to play, but my parents told me that I couldn’t accept it, basically just because it’s loud. I told them that I would put it in the basement and avoid playing at night, but they still said no. I added that I hear everything they do (and I mean.... everything) in their room 24/7 and that hearing people is just part of living with them, and they said that it doesn’t matter what because they’re they parents and they pay for everything so they ultimately get to decide. I know it seems small, but it really seem unfair to me. I’ve had to put up with them shutting down many similar opportunities for years and I’m tired of it. It feels like they just don’t want me to do what I’m passionate about. 

I could add many more examples, but I won’t for the sake of this post. But basically they haven’t ever wanted to get involved in any activity I’ve ever been part of. They don’t volunteer to help with programs I’ve been part of for years, they don’t ask me about what I’m interested in, they don’t help me reach my goals in any real way, and they just like to stay out of my life. I’ve never had rules or restrictions, to the point that I think they just don’t care. I’ve never had a curfew, and if I say I’m going to a friends house at noon and don’t come home, I likely won’t get a text from them until over 24 hours has passed. I’m 16. I know a lot of kids would kill for that kind of freedom, but it comes across like they don’t care. 

I know it seems small, but they also make meals that they know I don’t like on a regular basis, and don’t have any alternative for what I can eat besides pasta or grilled cheese. It would be fine if it was every once in a  while, but last week they didn’t make one meal that I liked so I had to eat at friend’s houses or just suck it up and make spaghetti for the 500th time this year so far. I’m not an exceptionally picky eater, either. It’s behavior like this that has been building up and frustrating me for years. 

I would confront them, but I’m honestly afraid to. I came out to them as transgender (ftm) 3.5 years ago and they told me I would never be their son (exact words). I haven’t wavered at all in this identity since I told them, and I live my life as a normal guy but they still don’t accept me 100%. About a year and a half after that, my dad found out that my mom had been cheating on him for years with multiple different men. They fought intensely for a long time, and now their relationship is completely different. Not once didn’t they think to put me in therapy. I built up the courage to ask once and they said that I could but they never went through with it. All of this combined with more unfair behavior that I haven’t included for the sake of this post just makes it seem impossible to approach them. I don’t know what to do. 

Some of my friend’s parents will check in on me more often than my own parents. If I’m with their kids, they’ll ask me where I am and if I’ve been fed. They encourage me and I see them supporting their kids and getting involved in ways that my parents have never done. 

Is this normal? Shouldn’t my parents support me more? Shouldn’t they want to engage in the things that I love doing? Do you think it’s because I’m transgender, or because they are always focusing on their marriage? They have their own hobbies and try to get me to join them in what they like, but they don’t join me in what i like. Is there anything I can do about this? Are my expectations unrealistically high because a lot of my friend’s parents are very supportive? I feel like if I had a kid I would encourage them to do whatever they’re interested in and I would help them do that in whatever way possible. My parents kind of do nothing. Thanks so much to anyone that read this, I know it’s super long. 

P.S.

I want to make it clear that I am in no way ungrateful for what my parents have given me. Sometimes I hate living here, but I’m not being abused or anything. They haven’t been actively stopping me from achieving my goals, they just don’t help me whatsoever. I know I’m lucky just to be able to do what I do, even if it’s just on my own terms.",18Feb2020,1

287,"Hello! This my first post to Reddit and it is just asking for advice on my current situation. I'm 18 soon to be 19, male that is in his first year of college. I live with my parents along with my two special needs sisters. Recently I’ve been feeling sad, lost like. I don’t know if college is for me. I’m worried about my future, career, and everything around that. I’m afraid of it to the point where I’ve ended up missing some of the classes at my college because I don’t have the confidence to show up and “attempt” to learn the material that I’m already struggling with. I’ve never really been good at talking to people in groups, or just new people in general so it ends up being very hard for me to make new friends. I don't want it to sound pitiful or anything. I feel so lost and sad that I just want to sit at home and do nothing. I don’t want to go to work or go to school. I don’t want to live a life that I’ll hate. I’m afraid of meeting new people and trying new things. I’ve tried counseling, and I end up just pretending that everything will be okay, that I know what I want to do with my life. Then when I start to think about it, I begin to think that I’ll end up hating it. I’m afraid of growing up, what I’ll have to deal with. I procrastinate on everything I do when it comes to school, and chores at home. Even when it comes to personal things. I have no motivation to do anything. I can still do it, but I don’t know why. I don’t know why I’m going to college or doing what I’m doing now. I’m trying to just “go with the flow” as my old high school friends have done. I don’t think I have a close enough relationship with my parents to talk to them about it. I don’t know. I’m just worried and scared about myself. I don’t know what I’ll be doing or even what I like doing. I know this is turning into a rant but I need to get this out of me. I haven’t been honest with myself before.

Since then, we have been making eye contact multiple times every single day, sometimes looking at each other for a span of several seconds (4 to 5). Besides making eye contact everyday without fail we have never had any other form of interaction and are basically strangers.

I'm confused as to whether this is merely a coincidence or if there's a possibility that he's interested too?

295,"Let me begin by saying that I'm an adult. In fact we're both adults so it honestly shocks me that I'm dealing with such a childish dilemma in my late twenties, but here we are!

I (27) started a new job three months ago as a customer service rep (basically receptionist) at a vet's office. Honestly, I love it; minus the horrible person I have to deal with daily. For the sake of anonymity, I'll call her K (45). This person is the same rank as I am and has only been there one month longer than I have. So honestly, she does not know much more than I do nor have much more experience. Pretty much since day one she has done every little thing possible to just make my time there just as irritating as possible. Her favorite is ignoring me when I speak to her, except for the occasional childish ""Did you hear something?"". When I'm talking to another coworker, she loves to cut in and totally remove me from the conversation. Then there's the snide little comments where she basically calls me stupid. It's all very grating and extremely childish, but it negatively impacts my performance and it needs to stop.

I've already spoken to two managers and HR about the situation. Nothing has been done nor will be done. I've basically been told to be the mature one and let it go. ""Don't worry about K, let K worry about K."" As you can see, we have WONDERFUL management. We have the same role and we're both full time, so it's not as if we can avoid each other. I have no clue why she is acting this way towards me. I show her nothing but kindness and do all I can to not speak to her; I even try to sit as far away as possible.

300,"Hi there! 
Im (16F) in Thailand as an exchange student and Ive noticed that Thais really love to have sweet treats and fried foods. They’ll put sugar in their noodles, drinks, fruits, snacks, etc. I’ve grown to have quite the sweet tooth and recently my family visited me and brought $70 worth of American candy. I eat some candy every day and my classmates love to hand me treats in the middle of class. My host mom will even buy me some fried bananas or fried chicken just to eat after school. I almost feel like people here are just dying to fatten me up like a grandma would. For lunch today I even had noodles that obviously had sugar in them and a very sugary Thai Tea drink. I don’t know how to say no to all these offers of sweets even though I know it’s bad for me. In my head I want to start exercising and eating more healthy but then when I see the basket of candy in my kitchen or my host mom brings me home a sugary drink after she gets off work, I can’t help but just consume everything! 
I haven’t weighed myself in a while, but the last I checked I was 140lbs and my height is 5’5” (Im within a healthy BMI). But my belly fat just keeps growing and Im starting to get really self conscious of it. Im mostly worried not of how I am now, but how it will effect my future. There’s a line of type 1 diabetes on my mom’s side of the family (developed in my mom and my aunt when they got into their 20’s-30’s), and a lot of my family members have some chub which I don’t want. 
How do I say no to the offers, even if they’ve already bought something? And are there any activities I could do in a small space (yoga, stretching, small work outs)? I used to run and last month I did a 10k but dropped running after that. I’ve basically dropped any sort of physical activity and Im not very happy with that. I just don’t have the motivation. 
I guess Im just asking for some motivating advice and if this sort of situation has happened to any of you? I’d appreciate some feedback.

301,"Im a teen and for the past couple of years have been having problems but its been very bad this past week.

For the past week and a half I have barley had any appetite to eat. My step dad keeps yelling at me, telling me im starving myself and to quit being annoying and eating my food. The problem is, im legitimately full, like if i eat anymore i might throw up kinda full. 

I haven't been able to get much sleep, like maybe 4 hours every night and 6 if im lucky. Concentrating and remebering has been really hard for me, especially in class, and i havent found any enjoyment in anything. All i want to do is sleep, but not at night like in the middle of the day, because its better then being awake. I have barley any energy at all anymore.

I have been sad, yet happy, at the same time, kinda like a numb feeling. I feel basically worthless and like theres really no point in living anymore. I suspect theres something wrong but im afraid my parents will brush it off. I have never had a convo in my house about mental health before,despite the fact that thing in my past may have caused some emotional damage for me.

303,"I made a post similar to this earlier, but it was pretty disorganized, so I rewrote it. I'm 5""4, and if it's relevant, I'm also in therapy for anxiety.

My start weight was 151lbs, my current weight is 125lbs, and my goal weight is 115lbs. I started my weight loss journey in July, and I gave up one I reached 125lbs. I've begun binge eating again, but I've been maintaining the weight. 

There are three things I want to do if I'm ever 115lbs, but I just don't know how to get back into the mindset I was in back in July. Nothing motivates me anymore. I have a folder with over 100 pictures of thinspo, and that's not even enough. (I'm not anorexic or bulimic.)

When I was 151lbs, I hated everything about myself and I was generally unhappy with life. I decided to lose weight once I just couldn't take the pressure I put on myself. Now, things are better in some departments and worse in others. I don't hate myself, but I don't like myself either. 

If I get to my goal weight, I want to put more effort into my overall appearance. I bought clothes that I've been planning to wear once I'm skinny. High waisted pants hurt, even if they're loose, and my hair is too thin to bleach. I've pretty sure these problems won't exist once I'm thin.

Secondly, I want to stop being friends with my ex, as I think it's bad for both of us. Neither of us have close friends anymore, and he doesn't want to leave me.

My ex isn't good with conversation. He spends the vast majority of his time on his phone, but he doesn't want to be left alone. I've told him that I needed space before, and he said he understood, but he'd still follow me around. He'll only try to start conversation with me if I try to talk to anyone else. 

We don't talk. When we spend time together, we stand in silence on our phones, and I dislike it. Our friendship feels like a demanding responsibility. When we were together, I'd need to spend hours of my time to get memes beforehand in order to talk to him. Now, I feel like I have to put in hours of work to be able to get out of the uncomfortable silence. I just get burnt out whenever we spend time together, and he doesn't want me to spend time with anyone else.

I don't know why this is one of the things I refuse to do unless I'm thin, but it just is. I can't put my thought process into words on this one.

Third and finally, there's a girl that I have a small crush on. We share classes and have mutual friends. I don't know her well enough to have any romantic feelings for her, but I do think she's nice and I wish I was confident enough to talk to her more.

How do I get motivated to work out and diet again? How should I go about fixing or doing any of these things?",18Feb2020,1
305,"Hey guys, I’m dealing with a really rough patch in my relationship with my mom and need help. To give a little background: I’m a female college student, about to graduate in a few months. My parents are immigrants and we are pretty much the typical Asian family. In my culture, people are blunt without remorse. This could be in regard to your weight, your academics, cleanliness of your room, etc. My mom rarely holds back and sometimes her words really sting me down to my core. I’ve dealt with insecurities all my life, especially about my weight. Although I’m not obese, losing 20 lbs couldn’t hurt. Hell, losing 30 lbs would make me perfect. This has been a problem all my life, I’ve always been insecure about my weight. And my mom doesn’t miss any excuse to point this out. She tells me I need to diet on an almost daily basis - this hasn’t helped me fight my insecurities at all. She tells me that I’ll look pretty once I lose weights It feels as though she’s always watching what I eat, how much I eat. My mom also compares me to my sister, who is very close in age to me but skinnier and overall just better. She’s strong willed, confident, looks good without makeup. When getting ready for events, I always feel like the ugly one. My mom compliments my sister a lot, not me though. I hate being compared, it seems unfair. Whenever talking about us, my mom always says things like: my sister has always been the smarter ones, she always eats less, she’s the more strong willed one. I can’t help but feel like my value is so much less in my house. Whenever we talk on this, my mom says that it’s part of her culture and often times they are just jokes. But jokes at my expense hurt me - I was raised in the US where we don’t make these kinds of jokes. It’s hard for us to see eye to eye. 

Recently I got accepted to medical school. I’m so thankful for it. But I’m sad that I’ll leave home with a damaged relationship with my mom. I often express how I feel but it rarely gets thru to her, she says it’s just in my head and they are my misconceptions.
Today, I made her cry because I told her that it feels like she’s always criticizing me and makes me feel like I’m less than my other siblings. She said something along the lines of “of course, I’m the bad one, i treat you like you’re not my own daughter right? I’m the bad one”. I went upstairs without saying a word and my sister later told me that she was crying about it. 

I don’t know what to do and how to fix this. I feel awful for making my mom cry. But at the same time, I do feel sad about the things she says. Any advice would be great. Thank you.",18Feb2020,1
306,"Sorry this might long... -So I’ve known this girl for the last 3 years or so, and we’ve been pretty good friends through this. For the longest time I never had a super strong interest in her until this last summer when she confessed to me. It was kind unexpected but I went with it, and we talked basically all through the summer. Until school came around (I’m still in high school), and she started talking to me less. We weren’t even talking for that long, but I still think we liked each other quite well, but we weren’t dating. All of the sudden she stops talking to me and starts dating this other guy who had asked her out. To give some context for her situation, she’s a really kind person, the kind of person who would feel bad if she told anyone no. But regardless they dated for nearly 3 months until she broke up with him. This being right around Christmas break. By then I was basically over her, and was ready to move on to new people, until all the sudden she starts talking to me again. At this point I’m already talking to some other people, but nothing serious, and I took the bait. She confessed to me again, and for the first time I told her that I liked her, and so I stopped talking to the other options I had (which may have been a mistake). I was pretty happy to almost have her back. We talked for quite some time reaching almost now. For some reason I, during this time, start falling into a hole of painful depression. It’s not prescribed or anything, probably not depression, but I was sad none the less. I was constantly paranoid of small things, and would get jealous very easily. Even until now I’ve been able to hide it, but it was really messing with me. Now I’m no stone face but crying isn’t something I do all the time. Yet I would fall into these horrible crying sessions, and even prayed a few times. I was so horrified of her not liking me, or wanting someone else, or even simply getting tired of me. And much to my dismay over this last week and the one before, we have been talking less and less. She started replying with single worded messages, and I wasn’t able to come up with the silly and corny responses that I usually do. About three weeks prior, we set up a double date this last Saturday, and so far it was the last time I saw her. The date was actually fine, we talked a bit, but not at all about what was happening between us. It being Monday, it’s been only two days, and we didn’t talk at all Sunday, and barely any today. I’ve talked to one of my friends about it, but any advice that I’ve received so far has been the same. It’s either: move on, or just keep trying till the love is all gone. I’ve already told myself that I needed to move on, but I just can’t do it. She’s always on my mind, and I wish that she wasn’t. I don’t have very many, if at all, options anymore other than her. And I’m sure she’s over me. I tried contacting the text suicide hotline for help, but it was late and I didn’t get a response. I haven’t been able to enjoy the things that I normally do, I haven’t been doing homework, and everything seems pretty bland. I really need help, but I’m not going to my parents. I don’t know what to do anymore, so this is kind of a last ditch effort for any help before I let my mind adrift for the rest of the school year.",18Feb2020,1
307,"Let me break this down because it’s a little untraditional. My mother owns a few apartment complex that keep basically all of our family employed full time. My husband and I work together, but he does regular maintenance for exist residents. I mostly paint and clean/renovate units after people have moved out. We get one check because it’s easier, but that’s easily changeable.

308,"I dropped out of college in my early 20s after a long battle with depression(still have it). I settled at a job I hated(where I still am) because it paid the bills and provided health insurance. Also I have no other marketable skills. I finally decided at 30 to pursue my dream and go back to college. It’s been several years of taking only two classes a semester because that’s all I can do with my job and still get by. I’ve maintained all As, but lately I’ve felt like I don’t belong and that maybe it’d be more responsible to just stay at the job I’m at now where I’ve built up time and relationships.

310,"Throw away at alt because a lot of my friends know my main. My husband (45M) and I (32F) have been together for almost 15 years now, married for 10. I admit I married him young but I had a terrible home life, he was kind, we were in love, and he promised to give me a life free of the torment I endured.

For the most part life has been really good. We have two beautiful kids, a small but lovely home, and I love the life we've been able to make for ourselves. 

Except...there's this one thing that really bothers me. He has always been very interested in my past, and for a while it was very freeing to be able to tell someone about the abuse I've survived. But now I wish I hadn't told him. Because sometimes in the middle of the night he'll quietly wake me up to reenact some of the worst parts. He told me that it was for my benefit, that eventually I would be desensitized by being exposed to those things in a safe environment. A lot of it is him fake choking me, pinning me down on the bed, and having his way with me. He lets me breathe just often enough to not pass out but sometimes I see the spots and am scared he'll wait too long. Sometimes he'll make me get on the floor and have me submit to him face down. Other than a few bruised ribs, I've never gotten seriously injured.

It's been about five years since he started doing this more often. He says he hates having to do it but I need help getting over my fears. I admit that sometimes I suspect that he is doing it because there's a part of him that gets pleasure from those acts even though he would never really hurt someone for real. But I have started to have extreme anxiety at night. I have learned to be silent when we have our ""therapy sessions"" because I don't want to wake the kids. But I'm so scared that one day one of them will walk in on us and not realize that daddy is just messing around and I'm not really getting hurt.

During the day he is my normal loving husband. Dutiful and attentive. He tells me that he hates having to subject me to that and hopes that one day it won't be necessary. I've begged him to stop but it just made it more frequent because it meant I still had a lot of unresolved trauma. He said to just treat it like foreplay and rough housing. That way I could reframe it so it wouldn't be traumatic.

I guess my question is, is there a way I can stop this? I love him but my nights are becoming excruciating and I worry for both of our sakes that he'll take it too far just one too many times. I feel like I can't breath and sick as soon as the lights go out. 

Can someone please help.",18Feb2020,1
311,I have misophonia and my wife does not understand at all.

I have seen a doctor, had fasting blood tests etc.; but they seem to think I am just looking for a pass to be fat. Which I'm not, the easier thing for me to do would be to just eat junk food and look good! But I want to be actually healthy.

Like, my mom is a junkie. My dad is finally just starting to get his shit together, but for the longest time he was an alcoholic drug addict. He now has heart problems though, and I think the only reason he's pushing forward is for my little sister. Thank God for that. 

But I feel so fucking lost. I just work at McDonalds right now, and I've been saving up to get a car... but I keep fucking up with my money and doing stupid shit. I was adopted and raised by my grandparents, and they're good people but they are unable to help me as they don't connect with me, and don't understand the way I think or the things I believe. All of my real friends live miles away either because I met them online, or because they moved for college, or they never lived close to me to begin with.

I was a pretty good student in school though... straight A+'s all the way up to my last year of HS, which I made straight F's quite literally. I had a lot going on. 

And I still seem to have a lot going on... 

I seriously notice I keep doing stupid shit even though I know better. Like, things I've been warned against doing. Like drugs. I've been warned my entire life to stay away from that stuff, as my grandparents are very straight edge people and have basically cut most people off. Yet I smoke weed because I like it. And I occasionally take acid or shrooms. I wasn't taking them to try and fix my depression or anything, but I have found weed especially helpful in numbing out my sad feelings so I tend to stick to that.

This girl and I are the only ones on the lease. We have a cleaning rotation we both follow (dishes are never left overnight, we put our dishes away frequently, bathroom is cleaned twice a month, there’s no moldy food in the fridge, and trash is taken out regularly), her boyfriend is allowed over whenever as long as they pay 60% of the utilities (he stays every night and sometimes when she isn’t there, and my boyfriend is allowed the same he just doesn’t spend as much time here), let her know whenever I have friends over, and I keep my cats in my room until I am home.  She’s texted me about things like the water filter not having enough water, the stove burner being a little dirty, leaving the bathroom fan on after a shower longer, wanting me to watch my cats 24/7, and her most recent text has just left me angry and annoyed. She texted me asking if I could close my door when my boyfriend and I aren’t fully dressed. I had mentioned in our roommate meeting that my boyfriend likes to be shirtless and was told that he couldn’t be in the common areas. I have respected that and he is only shirtless in my room. My door is cracked a few inches to let my cats in and out (I have a mat to prevent my cats from pushing the door out because I don’t want them seeing my whole room), and you can’t really see anything unless you stand near my door, so I’m extremely annoyed she thinks it’s ok to tell me to close my door because she doesn’t like what she saw (according to my boyfriend they only saw him once). I messaged her back saying my door is already closed when we change, but my door will stay open so my cats can come in and out. She didn’t respond, which seems rude to me because she sends so many texts and I always respond because I’m trying to respect this is also her living space. I’ve complied with everything except watching my cats 24/7 and my boyfriend being shirtless in my room, so I’ve said no a couple times, but that doesn’t stop her from messaging me. I made a detailed list of things to mention to her with my therapist, but I’m starting to get worried having this conversation will lead to her messaging me even more or her becoming an outright bitch. I plan to say this in person: 
“Hey I’m not sure if you’ve realized this, but you text me almost weekly about things you would like me to change or do and I appreciate that you are trying to communicate with me, but if it’s not urgent, an emergency, or a reoccurring issue could you please tell me in person, so we can talk it out. I am happy to talk things out, but many of your texts already have a specific action that you would like me to do, and I would really appreciate it more if we could try to comprise together because I also live here and pay rent. I also think your recent text is disrespectful because we chose to live in separate rooms for a reason and what I do in my room is my business and I have already comprised on my boyfriend being shirtless. My door is cracked a few inches, so I feel like it isn’t necessary to look into it. There are times where you’ve left your door open and I don’t look into it because I’m trying to respect your privacy. I’m really open to talking things out, but I want it to be an equal conversation.” 

I probably won’t get to say all this since I’m going to try to talk to her in person, but this is what I’m going to try to say. Do you think this will cause her to talk to me more or do you think this will finally stop all this madness? I have severe generalized anxiety and this has been stressing me out. I don’t want her to hurt my cats when I’m not home or trash my stuff. I don’t know what more I can do to get her off my back. I don’t leave any messes on purpose ( I left water on the table once), my cats only come out when I’m home, and I really don’t care about anything she does besides this. I just want to live my life without a weekly text about something because I have severe anxiety.",18Feb2020,1

Okay so it has been 2 decades since my father died . It was a homicide/ assisting suicide case . Being I was a child at the time not much was told to me and as I grew older many stories and theories have crossed my path. Tonight for one reason or another I found myself messaging the man who was with him in his last moments . He was never convicted of murder as they believe it was a suicide and this man helped him. 

I explained who I was and that I didn’t want to bring back painful memories but as a woman who is happy and living her life he was still my dad and I had so many unanswered questions . I mentioned I respected the fact if he did not wish to speak to me . And made it clear I was not angry as I had many years to deal with it . 

My boyfriend thinks I shouldn’t have done it . But he also acknowledged he has never really lost anyone before. 

I guess I’m looking for reassurance or awakening that this was a bad idea .

354,"My father has always been an angry and abusive man. One of my earliest memories is my father hitting my mom over the head with one of those old school telephones in the 90s. He drank almost everyday since I can remember, but whenever he got mad at my mom or my siblings, he would stay home and drink all day for weeks. 
He would beat my mom whenever something went wrong, beat me with a baseball bat for looking at him the wrong way, beat myself siblings in similar ways and even beat the family dog. He even would throw glass bottles in a restaurant because I looked at him wrong. The stories go on. There’s no end to the stories of craziness from More than 20 years of abuse. 

It’s probably hard for people to understand why we let this sort abuse happen for so long. When I was younger I was just too scared to ask for help from other people or the police. I felt like that would just mean things would become worse for my siblings, mom and I once we got home. My mother grew up with an abusive father and we’re from an Asian country. I came to the states when I was in elementary school. Where I’m from, laws against domestic abuse isn’t as harsh as America. It wasn’t until recently that I realized how easy it was to be free from my dad. 

Recently, my father was reported for domestic abusive. Won’t get into the specifics but the family has cut my father out with this opportunity. None of my siblings and I live at home anymore so it’s not like we were seeing him much anyway. 

I think the reason we let it happen was because we at some point didn’t see hope anymore. My mother told me that he’s still my father and I need to accept him just as her brothers(my uncles) respected her father(grandfather). My mother thought growing up with a father figure would be beneficial and my dad would come around as we got older. He didn’t. As I grew older and when I was in my teenage years, I naturally started to rebel a little bit. However I soon realized the if I rebelled my mom would get hurt. Or my siblings would get hurt. At some point I became scared. Not of my dad but scared of seeing my mom or siblings hurt. I gave in and became the son he wanted me to. 

Here’s the scary part for me. I hate him. From the bottom of my heart. But I convinced myself at some point that this man deserves my loyalty no matter how he abuses my family(physically/emotionally). At this point he’s by himself now. My whole family has left him. I was keeping in contact with him till last week. But he has threatened to commit suicide if I don’t do his bidding multiple times. My father is known for making these empty threats to get people to do his bidding. He’s threatened the people around me also for different reason. Blatantly lying to me about things to make me feel a certain way so I’ll help him. 

I lost the little amount of respect I had for him and I was so stressed out from thinking about how he recently abused my family and his threats that I decided I need this relationship to end. But I can’t help but think that I’m doing the wrong thing. That I should stick by this man while nobody else will. My mom tells me that I feel like this because of how she raised me and that it’s her fault. She thinks that she made a mistake teaching me to tolerate and accept violent behavior. My siblings too.

I was hired to try to fuck, like every other girl there apparently, but I was naive to this at first. 

Most of the girls here are 10+ years younger than the owners as well, and again pretty naive from our age (but boy did i learn a lot). 

There’s a lot of shit, but to get to the point, there were several situations where alcohol was given, and then we were encouraged (even manipulated) to kiss, massage each other, other things of this nature. 

Another thing the owner loves to do is tell us all that our boyfriends suck and that we deserve better, they’re ugly, they’re bums, and just try to find weakness and divide. Sometimes conflicts were created to cause problems. All in hopes that we’ll eventually break up with them. 

I was at a bad point in my relationship and fell for this mans bullshit. I don’t even want to repeat some of things he said to encourage me, because it’s embarrassing I fell for it...

363,"Ok, so here's the situation. 


My girlfriend and I live together in a 2 bed, 2 bath apartment with a roommate. The roommate is rude, hard to approach, and unreasonable. I know that's not exactly the worst, but here's the thing:


She refuses to clean anything, ever. The kitchen is gross a lot, and she chooses to simply blame it all on us, claiming that she's ""always cleaning up after us"" and ""we're constantly leaving a mess."" 


We confronted her about it tonight, and it did not go well. We simply asked her to take out the trash, wipe down the counters, and sweep and mop once in awhile, cause y'know, we do that constantly and she never does. I mean, never. 


Her defense: ""I never use the kitchen""
(She does, obviously)
(Which was preceded shortly by, ""the kitchen is the only space we both use"")
And
""I take my own trash out""
(She obviously uses the kitchen trash recycling at least sometimes)

I know, this is ridiculous. 
But she's belligerent and unreasonable. We tried having an adult conversation with her, and the outcome was her claiming we never clean, she's always cleaning up after us.


""Anytime we tried to make any point, even right at the beginning when we simply asked her to wipe the kitchen down occasionally or take the damn trash out sometimes, she interrupted **every time** to play the victim. All we did was make those simple, reasonable requests, while making the point that simply walking into the kitchen to get water drags in dirt and dust a little at a time, or using the stove to heat something up quickly still leaves behind a bit of grease or whatever. She doesn't understand that despite cleaning up after herself, she still is going to inadvertently contribute to the overall mess.


Anyways, that's her bit.


Now our issue. I live here too, with my girlfriend, and work close by. However, I can't pass a background check due to past stupid mistakes. While I no longer do anything to contribute to that record, it prevents me from being on any kind of lease mostly. 
After this confrontation, the roommate says she's going to the office to tell them I'm staying here full time but not on the lease.
I still contribute my fair share of rent and bills, and despite what roomiezilla thinks, I do clean up after myself, and so does my girlfriend. 


Please help us, Reddit. We need ANY options, with the lease, legally speaking, maybe a restraining order, whatever to get her out of here. We also need to know what kind of recourse she has, to get me out of here and how to counter it. 

I don't have much stuff here, I'm fairly minimalist so it's not super obvious that I live here, but of course I come and go for work, and have clothes and such. What exactly should our plan be? What can she do, what can we do, anything at all you might know or have experience with would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you so much for reading this far.

371,"Hi there, this is my first post in this subreddit and I'm wondering what I should do for my current situation because I just feel so lost :( This is a bit long so sorry in advance for the rant, but I have a **TLDR;** at the bottom!

As the title says, I have been feeling extremely lonely recently because I came to the realization that the only people I actually hang out with are my boyfriend and my one and only close friend. 

The problem is that whenever my boyfriend hangs out with his friends (and he's very popular because he's extroverted), I get somewhat sad and petty, and I believe this stems from the fact that I have no one else to occupy my loneliness other than him. This is the same situation with my close friend; she has a couple of other friend groups as well,  and whenever she's unavailable I become very sad because she's literally the only friend I have. 

I have thought about letting them know of the situation that I'm going through right now, though in the past I kind of ""overdid"" it. Basically, I just felt like a huge burden for telling them my problems and I wanted to save them the trouble of having to comfort me or making them feel sad because of it.

Don't get me wrong, I don't take them for granted. My boyfriend loves me very much and we spend a lot of time together. I also very much appreciate my one close friend even though we only manage to hang out once or twice a month because of our jobs and schools and relationships to balance. 

To be honest, being an introvert, it's very hard for me to make friends because not only am I slightly anxious/awkward when talking to people, but I also don't really know how to ""nurture"" the relationship to develop it into something more than just a classmate/coworker relationship. 

Some of my old high school friends were very toxic and so I decided to cut ties with them for my own well-being because they were very negative, homophobic, and just not someone I wanted to be around with. Others just drifted away, either to other universities across the country, or we simply just grew into different people and eventually lost touch.

My coworkers actually happen to be my boyfriend's friend group as well, considering that he actually got me the job at his location. And while my coworkers are very nice people, I still feel like an outsider to them because I don't want to be that person who tries to ""intrude"" their ingroup; so that's one of the things that's preventing me from befriending them fully as well. 

Sorry if this sounds so pathetic :( I also think this comes from the fact that I have very low self-esteem and little self-love. Sometimes I feel like I just poured myself into my boyfriend and I didn't get to nurture myself or any of my other relationships as a result...So when he's gone, I really have no one.

And for some context, I did take a year off from school and I will be returning to university in September. I'm hopeful and making it a goal to at least make some friends when I start.

375,"Throughout my life, I have constantly had around 1 or 2 main friends that I stuck around and hung out either online or in-person for the majority of my day.

Does anyone have any other advice on how to handle this? Or is that the best way to go? We didnt have to talk much when I was there, but we will be walking past each other often and I sont want to make things more awkward than necessary.

Thanks!",18Feb2020,1
377,"Hi, I honestly didn’t know where to go besides reddit for this. My older (half) brother sexually and physically abused me for years when I was younger. (He was about 16-17 and I was 7-8). When I was 9 I lost contact with him because our mother lost custody of just me. I didn’t see him for ten years, and found out he became a cop. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I can do anything. He hurt me so much and I’m still trying to heal from it, and he gets to pretend like he’s a good person who gets to uphold the law. He’s also apparently trying to become secret service which is just really rough to hear. My other half brother saw his abuse multiple times, but I don’t know if he remembers/would tell anyone. I remember it vividly though. Can I do anything at all? Should I? I’m so lost and I feel like it’s such an injustice.",18Feb2020,1

383,"This feels like a weird question, but it’s worth a shot.

I (22F) met my current roommates (26F, 28M) in a housing Facebook group. They’re great, but I actually don’t see them all that often. I work a job that keeps me out of the house during the day, and when I come home I tend to keep to myself. The two of them are engaged, which has never posed a problem but it does mean that I’m a bit of a third wheel. I have a history of depression/anxiety (diagnosed but unmedicated) and don’t normally seek out opportunities to talk to them, other than when we happen to be home at the same time. We’re friendly but not close - it’s not unusual to go multiple days without us speaking at all.

Over the past few months, I’ve decided that I want to leave my job and go to grad school, and I’ve been accepted a couple places! Which is cool and great, but none of them are the city I live in. I was so nervous about applying that I didn’t tell my roommates, but I have received some mail from universities, so they definitely know something’s up.

My question is: when/how do I tell them that I plan on moving cities? Our lease doesn’t renew until July, so this isn’t an immediate problem, but it also feels important, and I don’t want to spring this on them and leave them in the lurch trying to find a new roommate. And do I owe them explanations/apologies for why they’re hearing about this now, as opposed to when I started applying? This all feels silly and obvious - I have an idea of the kinds of things I /should/ say, but I don’t know how on earth to actually say them, and serious conversations like this stress me out.

tldr: I want to move cities in a few months for grad school, but my roommates don’t even know that I applied. How and when should I tell them?",18Feb2020,1

386,"To make a long story short, from around the age of 5 when I was in Year 1 (first grade) I recall, I've felt like I should've been born a girl and wished every day that I'd been born a girl. However people would tease me for being feminine, having ""girly"" interests and only female friends, and my family would get mad when they caught me wearing my sister's clothes and makeup etc. So I realised that as there was no magic spell to magically turn me into a girl, I had no choice in the environment I was in but to suck it up and do my best to embrace being a guy, masculinity, and try to get into it as much as possible.

Needless to say nothing I tried worked, and these feelings no matter how hard I tried to escape them have just progressively intensified overtime. I'm 21 now and absolutely fucking *despise* myself and how I look, and every time I look down at... you know where, I just feel gross and sick like there's something seriously out of kilter.

Even though I know this is the reality I'm stuck with I constantly hope it's all just a dream and wish I'd never been born. I've been suicidal in the past over this crap and admittedly attempted a couple of times but luckily I'm past that now. I waste hours and hours writing from the perspective of and roleplaying online as female personas, an escape from reality and the only time I feel somewhat comfortable.

I drink like a fish when I get the chance (as I don't want to mess up my degree etc.) to numb the feelings, but then have to be super careful as I act really feminine and girly when I'm drunk, so tend to lock myself in my room so I don't get into any trouble (my flatmates are all boyish jock types and people aren't exactly accepting on the streets). I've never dared tell a soul in real life about any of this nonsense.

Venting aside, I can't fucking deal with this anymore and it needs to just stop - I think I may go to a doctor and possibly uni support services and see if they can help at all, if they can't I have to fend for myself. If anyone has literally any advice on how they managed to get over these feelings, techniques that helped to suppress or get rid of them, if it was just a phase that passed eventually, if they managed to get into masculinity and feel comfortable in themselves etc., I would seriously seriously appreciate it.",18Feb2020,1

Also, should I send him a message explaining myself? I don’t want him to think i’ve been stalking his page, I just happened to look him up and like the most recent post. 

If messaging him IS a good idea, I could use him being on my suggested friends list as an excuse. I could say I saw him there before the like and thought he looked familiar, hence being on his profile in the first place. 

I feel like either friending him or sending a message would be better than nothing, either way it would start a conversation. Like I said earlier, I don’t see him much in person so this is really the only excuse I’d ever have to speak to him.

406,"I (23M) have been struggling to commit to relationships because of someone I had a brief relationship with.

Last year, I was in my final semester of college (The hardest semester) and I couldn't wait for it to all  be over and move on to the next chapter. I hated / hate being a student and  I wasn't getting a break on my last semester. But, I met someone (Let's call her Luna)  that made it better. She was super sweet and cute. However, there was merely 5 weeks left of the semester, 2 of which would be finals. We also live hundreds of miles away. So with this in mind, we agreed that anything other than a temporary relationship would be unwise.

We started to hang out and hit it off really well; we had a lot in common (Something I've genuinely never had with anyone else). Despite the little time we had we still saw each other often and even managed to binge every season of Avatar Legend of Korra because 'I had to see it.' Loved it btw.

A mistake I made was I didn't see what I had. I was extremely stressed, and after all, we agreed this was temporary. I was far too subscribed to that notion to just realize what Luna was about. And since my head was not in it, I was 'lazy' with my actions and intentions. I wasn't as careful and considerate with my words as I would have been otherwise. And although they had no bad intentions, they didn't land as such.

Graduation comes and we say our goodbyes. Luna asks what I have planned at home and all I've been yearning for is to do nothing and recover from this semester. At this point, I didn't think I had feelings for her (I was REALLY attached to the whole temporary thing). But a week goes by at home and I started to miss her. I ask if a visit is possible and she didn't entertain the idea. Luna became increasingly standoffish as time went on and eventually revealed that about a week after I graduated, she had a gotten a boyfriend. 

Whoa what? I in turn reveal that I had been missing her and was hoping a visit would help me see if something was there. Luna reveals that I was ""*The* something / someone she wanted."" But it was too late now, she said.

Only moderately bummed out I was at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the current issue. The summer went by and I had no motivation to look for an SO. In autumn, I started to socialize, but again not much motivation. Then winter, I met a nice girl and we start talking. She's great and all but there was something missing for me there. Something not pulling me further into a relationship. A friend helped me realize that, ""Hey dude, you're still caught up on Luna."" and  I couldn't believe it but he was right! My friend also correctly attributed my lack of motivation and that missing pull to that reason. How could this be? It had been like 6 months. Luna wasn't really on my mind anyway.

I decide to text her and she was standoffish as ever but I understood why. She had a boyfriend and if she's happy with him, so be it. I wouldn't be exactly helping that. But to my horror, Luna abruptly retorts with a few paragraphs that there were a few things I had said that made her feel like she didn't have worth. And that, ""My apologies won't help.""

I was genuinely heartbroken. I had hurt a friend. And even worse was I didn't even realize I did. Clearly how I intend to come off as and how I actually come off were not in sync and that was honestly scary. The things she brought up I was never made aware of before that moment. 

I write a whole big thing apologizing and Luna seemed receptive of it. She said that she was a little harsh and that she was there to talk about it. I thanked her but told her I need some time to reflect on myself.

A week later after a lot of thought, and addressing what needs to change within myself, I decide to tell her what I really thought of her since she was clearly not aware. I told her that she was my friend which to me means that I support your happiness even if that means I am not in that equation. I told her that she is an amazing person and the world is better for it. I told her whatever else. All true. All meaningful. Not long. No professions of love, honestly something I could tell to anyone I consider a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

...She never responded and blocked me a week later. Ouch.

Not long after that, the winter girl I was talking to was asking where we were going and I responded honestly that I don't feel a pull to continue with it. Upset, she said that it was best to end it. I agreed.

I am again talking to someone now who is also great and super cool but again I find ""Something missing."" I don't know what it is. I don't want there to be something missing. This person is genuinely cool and I want to explore it more but I don't want to hurt her. What's stopping me?

I'm afraid that Luna was so close to what I was looking for, whether or not I had realized it at the time. I'm concerned how much I still think about Luna. I'm absolutely shocked I'm this caught up on a 5 week incursion NINE months later. So unlike me. I'm worried that I can't commit to a relationship because they aren't Luna.

**TL;DR**: Nine months after a temporary 5 week relationship, I find myself becoming increasingly caught up on it to the point that it is effecting current, potential relationships.

There's plenty I have left out that I'm willing to share. It is negatively effecting me and I need help processing it. Just a passing thought of it will stick in my head for the rest of the day. I usually am in tune with myself enough to figure it out but boy am I in a pickle.",18Feb2020,1

Both my husband and I are trans, gay.   We do have a good relationship with the family, unless anything gay or trans related comes up.  Then its the 800lb Harmbe in the room.



He did not come to my wedding, and laughed saying our wedding is not legitimate.  He has never at one point come up even after, and say he's glad I'm part of the family now.  Not once have we talked about it.  I let it side because he's a dumb 20 year old kid, heavily influenced by his chruch.  But now he's getting married.  Also in my wedding month of May, which also pisses me off. 



The entire family is gushing over them.  They are so happy, welcoming.  They are so open and excited, helping them. They LITERALLY  cannot stop talking about it.  We couldn't talk about our wedding at all, it was shameful.  His father made a HUGE deal about not coming to our wedding, but ended up being pulled into it only because the mother said she was going with or without him.



There were no truly happy people from his side there, only, well I love you so I guess we have to be here.  They made a point in saying that our marriage is not real.   It's not like they are mean to me in day to day life, they really aren't.   They were terrible during our wedding though.  On the otherside, my family who is not religous, who doesn't give a fuck about our identities, came out to see the wedding. 
They came from over 2k miles away.  I picked up my entire life to marry him. 



But the problem is, I don't live by them anymore, I live only by his family.  The family that wasn't happy at all for our wedding, and was so shitty.
And then, you have the brother in law, who didn't come to mine, and laughed about my legitimate, valid wedding and love for his brother, wants me to come to his.  
And watch, as the same people who were shitty to us, gush over him. 



My husband is coming to the wedding.  He's actually going to be apart of it.  He's stance is being the bigger person, but not when it comes to my feelings.  He gets and supports whatever decision I make, because I only have a limited history with him.  I've been living here for 5 years now.  



In my gut, I do not want to go to this wedding.  I also want to say why, just so its clear that its basically because the way we were treated.  I also don't want to be a major asshole, and can use my job as an excuse as well.  Or, I can be like my husband and just be the bigger person.",18Feb2020,1

We were all supposed to eat breakfast and dinner together in one of the huge seminar rooms. But every time we went to eat I would only eat a small salad (that I wouldn’t even finish) and I could still barely eat it.

Another instance where this happened was a couple months ago I was eating lunch with my friends and then my boyfriend at the time came to sit by us. It was still really early in our relationship so I didn’t usually eat lunch with him and for some reason I just lost my appetite I felt like I physically couldn’t eat in front of him and I don’t really know why.

I don't know what I can do to help her or if I even should do something.
If anyone has experience in this sort of thing I would love to hear your advice

419,"My long distance bf came up to visit for valentines weekend and we ended up doing coke the first night. I did way too much and was tweaking pretty hard when he decided we should stop for the night. I’m a tad fuzzy about all the details but at some point we ended up having sex and i kept complaining it hurt, so he stopped. I just curled up and kept tweaking. And then he pulled my leg up to go again and i froze. I finally told him it hurt again after a bit and he said “but I don’t want to pull out” and thrust a few more times before pulling out. And I just started shaking bc of the drugs and what happened 

The next day I told him that he was being a dick and he apologized and blamed the coke. And he also mentioned how weve talked about rape play and that i have a safe word, which I didn’t even think about at the time because I was high. And then I moved on. And we had a super fun sexy night. 

And then we went to a party and I got decently drunk. He had told me that he didn’t have anything planned for the night so when he started to help me undress i thought we were going to bed. And he started playing with me and i kept telling him it hurt and was at the very least not comfortable. And he asked if I wanted to just go to bed. And, since i have no communication skills and have a hard time disappointing people, i said idc. Which in my head meant I didn’t want to sleep but i also didnt want to fuck. And I know I shouldve said that. And he asked if he could just rub on me and he wouldn’t stick it in so i said fine. But i started getting wet so he went in. And he was talking about how it was our last night for a month and i felt guilty and my brain i guess shut down? I could hear and feel but i was kinda paralyzed. After a while he realized I wasn’t responding and started to try waking me up (with his dick still in). And I literally couldn’t open my eyes until he finally pulled me up and forced me to. And then once I was up, it’s kinda fuzzy, but something about me being wet already and maybe more about it being our last night. And so I let him put it in and my brain started sinking again into that weird zone so he shook me up again and tried to go again before I finally got myself to tell him that he was being rude and I was basically halfway unconscious drunk. We went to bed and he went off on a drunk rant about how i was so important to him and he just wants to make me happy. 

And the next day the same apologies once he realized i was mad and blaming the alcohol. Apparently sober him and coke him learned but drunk him didn’t get the memo. Also ‘im just too hot how can he resist’ 

And im just hurt and confused because he’s told me about his other ex friend who he hates because he slept with a drunk girl. And i told him about my ex who did sorta the same thing once or twice. And i know I’m horrible at standing my ground and I’ll put up with a lot. And i didn’t really tell him to stop I just was hoping “it hurts” would work. But since we’re kinda kinky it gets difficult. But also our kink is usually playful and so far “rape play” has been giggly and not serious because we didn’t really talk that much about it just that I’m interested. 

It was just a surprise because he’s been so kind and caring and in tune with me until now. And I’m not even sure if I’m asking advice or ranting. Sorry for the long post, thanks",18Feb2020,1
420,"Now I know that sounds super cheap of me and quite taboo, but I have NO CLUE what to do with my feelings. 
I will start by saying this. Me and my ex dated for a year when we were 17/18 and that was it. I’m in my 20’s now and it’s been around 4 years. My ex moved on and seems happy (which is so great) (we didn’t end on horrible terms). I see them often. Both my ex AND my best friend/soulmate. Even before I dated my ex I liked his brother so much more but my immaturity ultimately made me decide to date someone I didn’t even like for the sake of having a boyfriend. 
Now me and my ex’s brother have been VERY CLOSE for around 6 years. I’m talking about him knowing everything about me and vice versa. I’ve seen him every other day for years and practically grew up together. We share the same humor and have so many similarities and share the same views. When my ex and I split up I left for around 2 years. I’ve been around again with them (their whole fam) since last feb so basically I’ve been back for a year and we are even CLOSER. I cannot even begin to tell you how much I love and cherish him. I can almost be positive he feels the same way too through his actions. It’s pretty obvious but then there are other times where I feel confused and think he doesn’t see me that way. And I can totally understand why. I wouldn’t want him to hurt his brother by pursuing me. Like I can see why we couldn’t be together. It sucks. Big time. 
I’m not sure what to do with my feelings. I want to talk to him and be honest with him and ask him how he feels. But I don’t want to risk ruining our relationship. We’ve really built our friendship even stronger this last year. I’ve never loved someone so much in my life. I just don’t know what to do or how this looks to other people. Please help me organize my thoughts lol I’m all over the place. 
If you read all of this I REALLY appreciate it. You have no idea.",18Feb2020,1
421,"I've moved out to Phoenix just 2 years ago. I bought a house,  have some friends and family,  finally got a decent paying job and can start paying down debt... but I have issues with living in Phoenix. People are so loud here, they blare music and cuss/ threaten/ harass you if you ask them to turn it down. (They cuss and threaten you for just about anything it seems...) I get headaches and have noticed my health deteriorate. I can't afford to live in the nicer areas with my pleasant coworkers or friends, and i've started ordering everything online to avoid having to go out into my neighborhood. 

I'm tempted to move somewhere else but I fear the only jobs I'd find in my field would be near cities and therefore I'll be subject to the same misery. And if I move, it'll be like i've abandoning a new job that i've only been at a few months and has treated me well, and I would be messing up my finances.

423,"This started as a Google account question, but gradually became more of a psychology one. Long story short, I made myself a YouTube account back when YouTube was an independent site. Not long ago, I was going through a sort of a 'loss and eventual embracing of self' etc. situation and created a whole bunch of different Google accounts I now don't need and even loathe because they all have weird names I came up with during the breakdown. Then, I decided that my 'original' account - that is, the very first account I ever made - was 'destined' and 'meant to' be 'the' my account, and everything else was ashes, dust and madness. So I remembered my log-in details and logged into that original YouTube account.

This is where it comes: Google services system offered me to 'upgrade' my YouTube account to a Google account, that is, to assign a mail address to it. The name I wanted wasn't allowed. While trying to come up with a suitable way to spell the same thing, I basically entered a bunch of gibberish... Little did I know that after assigning that shit as my account's mail address, there was no going back. My original account I used since the old days of YouTube throughout the years is now forever tainted. I do not want this address to be my address. But I now can't 'rename' the account. Google says it is essentially forbidden. I am now stuck with my account bearing a name I don't want. I've been told to 'just' make a new account, but for me that's a psychological problem; I don't know why, but the fact that it's my original account I made for myself and that it says 'created 10 years ago' next to it is important to me, I don't want a new one, I don't want the old one to be 'called' what it's now called. I did set up a new one with a more acceptable name and synchronised it with the old one as an 'alias', so that when I give people my new address, it redirects mail to the old account automatically. But with Google it often happens hours after people mail me, which is more often than not critical, and having two accounts and switching between them in apps 10 times a day is generally lame and not something I ever wanted.

I have no idea what to do. It likely sounds stupid, but for me this is a crippling psychological problem. Sorry.",18Feb2020,1
424,"I am going to try and keep this short.

I have a history with depression, in fact my entire family has. My great grandmother had, my aunt has, my brother has, and I went through a depressive episode at the age of 17. (Am 20 now.)

However my self image, and life has changed so much to the better since then. I study at my favourite university in the most beautiful city, I go out with friends on a regular basis, I even got myself into a poetry slam contest (creative writing contest) and should be super stoked about that since writing is my passion. My job is not too bad either and I might just have found a kind, sweet boy that really cares about me.

So why for the love of god do I feel so empty all the time? I even started one of these self coaching podcasts that gives me amazing techniques to handle negative emotions, still, most days I struggle with finding any motivation. The only explanation I can find for my emptiness is that my living situation is rather shitty. I live with my brother who is going through a depressive episode himself right now and it is really really exhausting. Usually I would
be able to stay with my best friend for a while to unwind from the stress at home, but he is always fighting with his girlfriend so...I plan on moving out this August, but right now I need to save up more money. 

Last time I had depression I was in extreme emotional pain, crying every day etc. My current state of mind just feels...weird. I feel like everything I do is just so pointless. And I don’t know what to do about that. I am not angry or sad, I am just indifferent.",18Feb2020,1
425,"I was talking to this guy for like two weeks. It wasn't anything serious but I really liked him. The attention felt nice after being single for so long. We had an argument about him trying to change how I look for him, and I said I wasn't gonna change myself for a guy I had only met in real life once. The argument was over and he went back to calling me all the cute names he normally does and just texting me.

He sent me a snap of a girl and I think it's just him being petty, but I'm not official with him or anything so I don't think I have a right to be jealous. About twenty minutes of talking later, he basically says ""the girl I showed you is mine"" and I'm like what. He sends a vid of her with him saying ""that's my girl"" and I get angry and I say ""then what the fuck have you been talking to me for"" then he basically says ""idk sorry bye"" and deletes me.

I don't even know if I can even say I've been cheated on, but I don't know how to feel right now. I was talking to him for like two weeks and he seemed really sweet. How do I feel, what do I do?",18Feb2020,1
426,"So I gradually developed a crush on a girl that probably only likes me as a friend. We got to know each other over four months and hung out on like three different occasions without our friends.

Anyways, she invites me to do fun stuff like surfing, camping, and comedy shows. And of course, I say yes. Ninety percent of the time, however, she texts me first and I do feel bad about that. We talked last week, so I know that she’s pretty busy and I didn’t bother her. It’s been like five days since she last texted me, should I text her (what do I say?) or go see her in person?

430,"I've been babysitting two kids (5m and 3f) for about 6 months. I watch them from 5:30am to 8:30pm for $60 a day. This in itself is not really the issue. It is very little money, but I don't need to do much with them other than clean up and feed them. They play with my 3 y/o daughter most of the time or watch a television show. 

However, the issue is far more aggravating and intolerable and I have tried discussing my issue with the mom before - no change. 

The 5 year old does not listen. The worst of it was taking him to the bus stop one morning in December and instead of listening to me when I told him not to run in the rocks (3 times, I told him not to), he continued to run. He fell and broke his nose. He missed school and his mom had to leave work because she didn't (and still has not) give me a medical consent form so I could take him or her daughter to the ER in case of emergency. Her reaction to this was annoying, but not in comparison to her childrens attitudes. He also does whatever he wants whenever he wants. He manages to destroy my daughters room in less than 10 minutes, after me asking repeatedly not to, throws toys, refuses to share the toys he brings with my daughter, whines and cries when he doesn't get to watch the show he wants or I don't make the dinner he wants. However, the worst of it is when he runs and jumps through the house (which is rule #3 in my 3 rule household - do not run or jump). This excites my 11 m/o pup and he chases and tries to play with him. I have, on many occasions, heard him scream at my dog and slap, punch, kick him because he doesn't want my dog chasing him. I spoke to his mom about this and there has been no change. 

The 3 year old is extremely mean to my daughter. My daughter will try to sit with her on the couch and the 3 y/o will scream at her to ""go away"", ""leave me alone"", ""I don't like you."" She has hit, smacked, pushed, and even backhanded my daughter more than once. Again, spoke to the mom and there was no change. 

There are other things like having to keep my pup locked away in his kennel or outside for hours at a time because the 3 y/o will continuously chant that she's hungry unless there is food in front of her. Hardly ever does she actually eat it, but it has to be sitting on the couch where she can see it. My dog is still a puppy, and though he is being trained, he will still snag food. The 3 y/o has also broken so many toys I can't count and she has destroyed my couch because she viciously rocks and slams into it with so much force to put herself to sleep. 

On top of that, I suffer from chronic pain and mental illness, which factors into me being a SAHM. Contanstly cleaning, chasing, yelling because they don't listen not only takes a toll on my body, but also my mind. The amount of anxiety I suffer from not only during their time here, but the time leading up to them being here is exhausting. 

My main question is this: how do I tell them I can't watch them anymore? Should I give a notice, or just tell her I can't watch them anymore because I need to put my family and myself first? Do I go into detail about why I can't do this anymore or do I just tell her I can't do it anymore and leave it vague?",18Feb2020,1
431,"This is something I’ve thought about for years. I’ve had 3 counselors throughout my life (23M) and can’t say I felt they were any help. So I’m thinking of taking anti-depressants but I have a fear of taking medication for this. I go through periods where I think I’m okay but I know In the back of my mind I’m not. Some days I can cope, other days is stops me from doing anything. I’m really hard on myself about everything right now.   I feel like a failure and I hate working a job that I don’t enjoy. I feel like 90% of my life is spent doing something I don’t want to do. I’ve pursued lots of things that I love and still pursue some of those things today but haven’t gotten too far in any of those things as far as making a career out of them. I just feel disappointed in myself a lot and constantly think at 100mph and can’t seem to ever turn it off and have a clear mind. I’m scared to take medication because I fear that medication will only make me blend in with everyone else. I’ll be okay with my job, I’ll be okay with my life and I truly feel like I deserve better. Despite this current state of mind being bad for me, I also think it’s a strong reason why I pursue things so intently. I have a good work ethic, I’m reliable and don’t give up easily. Part of me wants to stop feeling this way because it’s exhausting but another part of me wants to leave it be because I’m scared I’ll lose myself. I don’t really know who I am.

433,"So my boyfriend of 3 years and I had a fight on Thursday night, I was upset at him for skipping Valentine’s Day dinner to possibly hang out with his friend group. In his defense, I threw a huge fit that a girl my age should not and was very angry. I told him he only thinks about himself and never puts me before any of his friends. He said there was no difference between me or his friends, he can treat us all the same. I blew up at him over the phone and cried myself to sleep. The next day he called me and said we need to take a break. I agreed out of anger and then begged for him back. He finally talked to me today and said the break can end and revealed amoung other things, the reason we took the break was that he had a “burning passion” (romantic not sexual) for a girl he previously asked out to prom, but ended up not going. He said he regrets not going out with her, has thought about sex with her and a life with her a few times a month. Hes said if he would have went out and had sex with her , he probably would still be with her and I should be scared of her. I I told him later I thought about messaging her and just asking wtf is up and he said he would take her side. He’s never romantic with me and not very sexual with me, but that’s because I respect his religious wishes, however I am his only friend who knows his religion. 
I know this is a lot but it seems our relationship is just destined to fail , what am I supposed to do.  He never talks about feelings and I’m just so depressed and hurt.

442,"Despite my username, I am indeed thinking too much. My brother, quite simply put, as smart as he can be - is a f*cking idiot. His whole life he’s been going through phases, i.e veganism to name one, didn’t last long. Point is, he puts all his energy into one thing and becomes super focused in it. And it only lasts a few months. He’s had countless girlfriends. Typically they last a few months and he’s certain she’s the one every time. Well now he has a new girlfriend, and she’s from an Islamic family. They have been dating for roughly 3-4 months. After one month of dating, he has converted to Islam, and now in a week he’s going to be getting married under Islamic law (mind you, they were supposed to get married last week but they had a massive fight, which got physical - she was beating him for not giving her sex or some bullshit like that. These fights, while not always physical, are a common occurrence). I’ve made it clear, more than clear, that I do not support the relationship, I don’t support the marriage and I’ve said, while sounding completely unsupportive but I know his nature of making impulsive, irrational rescissions, this relationship won’t last and you’ll learn the hard way and consequences of converting to Islam. Quite simply put - it’s a toxic relationship. She doesn’t even practise Islam. Her parents are the ones that persuaded my brother to convert. I know all this because I’m living in the same house. I have two brothers as well as myself living in the same house. This is where the advice is needed. I don’t need advice on accepting his relationship, I need advice on the house. My brothers and I all bought a house together, however, it is under my brothers name (the one getting married under Islamic law). The marriage apparently is not recognised under state law. I need to know - if they do ‘divorce’ - which I guarantee they will, with no prenuptial agreement signed, will she be able to take half of his assets, which include the house, purely because the house is under his name?

The next day we talked about it and decided we could work on it. Her reason for wanting to a break was she was feeling lost and didn’t know what she wanted. Ever since then I have not been feeling too confident in our relationship. I have become super insecure thinking that I’m not what she wants and that I’ve done something wrong. I’ve already told her this. Every time we hangout I feel sad even though I want to be happy to enjoy my time with her. The past times we have hung out we end up arguing because I don’t feel like she loves me. I’ve asked her to talk to me more and show me more attention that I think I need. It feels as though she doesn’t care. I’ve asked her to let me know what she does throughout her day and the only time she replies is if I am the one to ask her what’s happening. It seems the only time we hangout is when I initiate it. I don’t know what to do..,18Feb2020,1
445,"I have recently turned 18, and I'm at a point where I feel like I've ruined the next few years of my life already. I've practically known with certainty that I'm trans of some kind since I was 10, going into middle school (yeah, a tad young, I have a late birthday). I never really said anything until Freshman year of high school, where I told my mother about what I was experiencing. She claimed to be supportive, and that she'd help me ""figure it out."" Apparently by that she meant ignore it, only after telling many other family members. Over the next four years or so I kept trying to convince her to let me see a therapist or doctor about it. I'm sure given the fact that I'm writing this it isn't hard to come to the conclusion that it didn't work. I was becoming increasingly depressed and anxiety ridden, let alone plenty of unrelated physically taxing conditions. I lost my drive, aspirations of getting into some choice colleges, my grades dropped, I couldn't hold a job, practically flunked out. I only graduated because of a few very helpful school programs that let people like me catch up to graduate on time. I finished school Spring 2019, at 17 and not a dime to my name. So, naturally I was stuck with my mom and siblings, day in day out, being a general shut in while all my old classmates and decidedly temporary friends forgot about me. As of about a  month ago, a situation came up that left me on the brink of homelessness and I've been staying with a cousin on the condition that I did everything I could to get a job. I now have dozens of applications out from the past few weeks and still no sign of any source of income. I'm decidedly less likely to find help for this crippling dysphoria at this point than with my willfully ignorant mother, and I'm getting closer to losing the trust of the only person who was willing to take me in. Looking back, I see countless missed opportunities to have avoided this, both in terms of mental health and financial stability. It's regularly below 20 degrees outside and I live a good hour drive from even the edge of a large enough city to find resources to help me given the likeliness of being kicked out to figure this out without the luxury of a roof over my head.

449,"I work in the healthcare field and got called in to work over the weekend for a sick coworker. I work 40hr work weeks then had to pull a 12hr shift so I wasn’t too happy about it. My coworker (we’ll call her Jan) told me that if I didn’t think I could handle possibly getting called in on Sunday too, to ask another coworker to take my call. Jan gave me a coworker’s name to ask but told me not to tell her that I had gotten called in on Saturday. I should mention that I had never gotten called in before, so this was a new process for me.

Now up until this point, I had always valued Jan’s advice because she’s been there for many years and is known as a rule follower, so I had no reason to question her on it. It turns out that I should have told my coworker that I had gotten called in, because she ended up getting called in on Sunday too. It turned into a whole mess because she took the call even though she wasn’t able to actually work it. 

Long story short, other coworkers got pulled into it and called Jan to ask what had happened. When questioned about telling me not to tell my coworker that I had gotten called in, she told them that she was just joking when she told me that. Jan told me this first hand tonight at work. I called her out on it because I knew she was dead serious when she gave me that advice but she doubled down and claimed she was joking. So now I have a whole department of coworkers who are being passive aggressive and think I’m a crummy person when I was really following Jan’s advice.

So now I’m not sure what to do. Everyone thinks I’m a horrible person, but I honestly didn’t think Jan would direct me to do something wrong because she’s a trusted person in the department.

I’d rather stay home alone in my pj’s than go sooo much! I’d rather go to the dentist than go on a date.. each date takes a toll on me.. I also get attached to fast and hurt too easily because I hope I’ll be able to stop dating so much

I know you can’t get what you want without making efforts which is why I force myself to go, but each time I hope it’s the last which has made me ignore red flags more than once.. Actually what I hate the most about being single is having to go on dates

Strangely, I don’t get that way when I go on a date with someone I met in another context and that I got to meet for another reason

I’ve been talking to this guy who seems nice enough but I find myself dreading going on a date with him so much.. There’s something in the way he thinks and sees life that really clashes with me but I don’t know if it’s true or if I’m just looking for a good reason to pass on him.. I’m just worried I could be passing on meeting my true love and never have to date again, but even that thought doesn’t give me the motivation to go..

P.s. I’m 23, been single since may. I forced myself to date a lot during summer, forced myself to continue seeing guys I didn’t like that much and dreaded it and continued seeing a manipulative jerk when I should’ve stop but I’ve been lazier since December and haven’t been on any",18Feb2020,1

He told me she's trans (male to female) and that he didn't bring it up since he justified it as her technically being a guy. We've had discussions previously about his past interaction with trans girls. He asked if I'd ever be open to him hooking up with trans girls since they're technically guys. I said I'd possibly be open to it. We've also had previous conversations about non-monogamy but never came to a conclusion or decision.

468,"I (26M) work for a ""smaller"" hotel chain that has hotels scattered throughout several states. I currently work as a Night Auditor, but was recently put through some management training and officially made our 3rd Shift Manager on Duty.  


Today, my AM Supervisor never showed up and so I stuck around to get things operating smoothly for our first shift (being that it was President's Day and we were going to be at almost full occupancy.) Around 08:15 AM, a ""local"" Police Department called and was requesting some information on a recent family that stayed with us who had committed a crime, and being flustered but recognizing that it was official, I provided some information regarding the family and their stay (I've never dealt with this before, and was given some training on how to handle this situation in the future ATF.)

At 9AM, we have what we call ""Stand Up,"" which is basically every department's AM Supervisor/Manager gets together and we go over how the day is looking, anything that needs addressed, etc. I had mentioned that our AM Sup never made it in, things were off to a busy start (but smoothing out so I was looking to leave soon,) and then the chain continued. Afterwards, I consulted with my current AM MOD (Manager on Duty), HR Director, and General Manager about the situation. Apparently I had mentioned about 5 times (without recognizing that I had done it) that because our AM Sup never showed, and this was happening, and the AM Sup wasn't here, etc. etc., I gave this information out to the PD. 

&amp;#x200B;

My GM pulled me into his office and had a good little training session with me that included the following:

* When I speak, I need to stop and think - especially of the big picture (He said that as I communicate verbally or in written form \[emails\], I tend to come off as direct/attacking. I need to work to not come off as attacking, especially since I may not see what is going on behind the scenes to take care of a situation. I also need take more ownership in what I did/am doing)
   * i.e. Because our AM Sup was not here, I decided to stick around due to having a higher volume/influx of guests coming to check-in so that my agents weren't overwhelmed and guests were being assisted in a timely manner vs The AM Sup never showed up and I stuck around because the phones kept ringing off the hook, people kept coming up to the desk, new agents kept approaching me with questions, etc.
   * i.e. Because the PD was requesting certain information, I provided what I had readily available as I was unaware that they needed to subpoena the information vs Because of the influx of people and being overwhelmed and our AM Sup not being here, I just gave them the information because I wasn't thinking of the situation at hand in its entirety
* In general, but especially with my role (specifically as MOD), I need to remember that I am ""The Communicator"". I need to look for ways to put a positive spin on situations as I communicate them, and I need to learn how to communicate them simply yet effectively without attacking
* I need to look for ways to communicate situations in a fashion that isn't ordering commands, but rather providing a description of the situation (i.e. If there is a door that is messed up, and I am trying to relay the information to an Engineer, they are thinkers. They want to resolve it their way, and they hate taking directions. I need to relay the information in such a way that I am informing them of how a Door is not operating properly and let them examine/resolve it instead of telling them that the screws are loose and need tightened.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been one to love formal communication. I love being detailed, and making sure that I especially CYA. Obviously there is a time and place for this, but specifically in my current position, I do not need to include a story with every single situation. However, I am not the type of person who knows how to just take a step back and write out a properly simple response. I have never been simple in all of my life, haha! I always over-complicate things, I always include way to many moving parts/variables in my communication, and I don't know how to just KISS. I will provide one example below, and then wrap this up:  


Last night (02-16), I had a guest who had a bigger suite. It contained a Master Bedroom, as well as the standard living area with two beds. The guest said that the AC/Heater unit was making a noise every time it would turn on, but it would keep turning on every few seconds. I dispatched maintenance to examine it who said everything was normal. I comp'd the guest's late check-out fee for the inconvenience, but the guest was requesting adtl. compensation because they ""weren't going to be able to sleep in this room with this noise all night long."" I offered 25% off their total rate because I was told by maintenance that nothing was wrong, but the guest insists there is and they can't sleep in that room now unless they turn off the machine. They accepted it, but boldly told me that they would be seeking adtl. compensation in the morning. In my e-mail, I said:  


""Room# / Name - Guest called about their AC unit in the master bedroom making a noise when it would turn on. They said it kept happening every couple of seconds. Maintenance was dispatched and said that there was nothing wrong with the unit. I comp’d the guest’s LCO for the inconvenience, but guest was escalating the issue. I offered 25% off their rate + LCO and guest said “I can see you’re trying, but I feel like you should be doing more since I can’t use one of the rooms I paid for and I’m spending (x amount of dollars) for one night.” Guest will be following up with AM MOD to seek adtl. compensation.""

&amp;#x200B;

In this particular example, what should I have changed or how should I have re-addressed the situation in my e-mail to make it short/sweet/to the point without too much or too little information, and without being attacking towards the guest? How do I simplify my communications in the future so that I can properly, efficiently/effectively, be ""The Communicator""? 

&amp;#x200B;

479,"Hello! I'm a 17 year old transgender, female to male, living in a country where being transgender is illegal. Not only that, but my parents are very much transphobic as well. Since it is a muslim country, I can not just stay here for the rest of my life, especially since it has mostly very judgemental and intolerant living here. 

Being a closeted trans guy is very very hard for me, so I planned on leaving to Canada once I get my bachelors degree and leave, since Canada is very LGBT+ friendly and I would be very safe and happy! However, there are many things that are wrong about this plan: 

   — my country is very much family oriented. People in here get married at a very early age (early 20 for females, which is what people think I am), and getting married is considered a very important thing, if you don't get married, they see you as unsuccessful, especially for a woman. My family expects me to marry a man before I move out. I am very uncomfortable with that. I would rather wait until I am at least 30. And I can't wait that long to go to Canada. (also, this opens a whole new discussion of if my husband would even accept me as a man.)

  — my family still didn't accept or deny if I can move there yet. They keep changing the subject and keep telling me it's too early to decide, even though I'm in my second semester. Teenagers or young adults don't get jobs here, so I can't just collect money on my own.

  — if I do successfully travel to Canada and have my surgeries... I would have to never see my family ever again. They would hate me, be disappointed in me, talk shit about me, possibly even hate themselves for raising a child that ""turned out to be trans"".

485,"Since Day 1 of freshman year, I became friends with a girl, who I met during a club for first-generation college students. We had a friend group, consisting of 10 people. Over a period of time, our group broke apart but us two stuck together. We had a special connection and developed an amazing friendship. 

Last spring, a dude started hitting on her in one of our classes together. He had a bad reputation for taking advantage of girls at our university. One day, he sat next to me in class, asking me questions about my interests and notes for the class if he missed a day. I genuinely thought he wanted to be my friend.

Guess what? He was only using me to get closer my friend. As soon as he got comfortable with me, he started asking information about my friend to know more about her. Then, he said something that crossed the line. He made some disrespectful comments about my friend, telling me that he only wanted to take her out, with the hopes of taking advantage of her later on.

Being a good friend, I thought it was the right decision to inform her. Ultimately, I told her everything he said about her and she ghosted him immediately. I felt good about my choice because I believed that I saved her from getting hurt by a guy, who didn't have her best interests at heart. 

When the guy noticed her change of behavior, he asked me what happened with my friend. I told him that I had no clue. You could tell that he was disappointed. But I didn't want to see my friend get hurt, since I really care for her. Shortly afterwards, he dropped the class and we didn't hear from him again. 

Last fall, I noticed him hanging out on my side of campus. He would walk by me multiple times and not even acknowledge my existence. Then, early last week, he walked by me with another girl and said to her, ""I know that guy."" I kept walking while he looked back. I pretended that I didn't hear him.",18Feb2020,1
486,"So a few years ago I lived with my mum. Me and her never got on and were always arguing. At 13 I could see she was manipulative and narcissistic and had a boyfriend who was the same. 

I eventually decided that I had enough and walked out the house with nothing but the clothes I had on (my school uniform at the time) and moved in with my dad who lived a few streets away. 
When I arrived I was panicking and crying but we sorted it out and thank god im still with my dad here. 

My mum and her boyfriends side of the family would come to our doorstep to yell at us and make my anxiety shoot through the roof. I had suicidal thoughts. I didn’t talk to the whole side of her family because of this. I used to get calls almost daily from them either telling me to talk to my mum or saying how it’s destroyed her. 

A few years later I’m 16. After my mum and her boyfriend broke up we started to build our relationship back up again sometime last year. It was fine. I thought she changed. 

Yesterday she came to my door out of nowhere and yelled at me like she did years ago and of course the anxiety happened but I grew stronger to it over time and didn’t cry like I used to. I just stood there until she was finished and left. She yelled at me because i ‘ignored’ her messages. I replied to all of them when she messaged me. The only one i didn’t reply to I apparently ignored because in the half hour she sent it and came to my door I didn’t reply. 

And now today my sister has been told we both have to go to her house with no choice and her family is there. I’m being forced to go and it’s all happening again. 
I really want to cry because I know everything hasn’t really changed. I hoped it would’ve changed but she’s still the same. 
But I don’t want to stop talking to them because it was so bad last time. All I want to do is not exist. I don’t know what to do. 
I’ve already said I’m definitely not going but I know she will come to my door and try to grab me out. She used to pull me down the stairs by my wrist for things. I’m scared of her. I’m literally shaking typing this.

487,"(it's going to be a long one)  (please don't criticise me for my grammar )

A few months ago my phone got confiscated for me making a minuscule slip up of me spilling milk on the kitchen wooden plank floor at breakfast. My parents immediately started attacking me and made me feel pretty bad calling me useless and retarded. But on top of that they also confiscated my phone. 

My parents believe that all I do on my phone is talk to girls or play games all day and all night everyday. But this is not the case. Most of my time i spend on my phone is doing my online school homework during empty times such as waiting for the bus in the morning, waiting for school, or after school in my spare time ( after all my after school activities) and i only talk or game when i have completed all my required school work and a bit more for a few minutes. Since my school is very fond of making us students complete our homework on our phones since we spend “ a lot of time on it”

But when my phone is confiscated I cannot do this. I become more stressed with homework and I am spending more late nights on my shitty computer desperately trying to finish all my homework before school since that will be the only chance I get at doing it until next all nighter i am forced to pull. But sometimes the required work requires more time than I can supply, leaving me with unfinished homework. I've been forced to be restraints by my teachers and I try to explain to them but they all say that “it's your responsibility to manage your time” or “ all the other kids managed to complete it so what makes you any different?” but the worst thing is that my parents don't take this lightly. 

I've been a good student in all the top classes but recently moved down two classes in maths and one from every other subject for not turning in my homework on time and my asian parents are mortified. They attack me physically and emotionally. They call me names, hit me, punish me, scream mean things like “ i wish you were never born” or “ you should just go and kill yourself. ”I've thought about killing myself plenty of times and whenever i say something to them they bully me more. I've begged to go to the school hostel but they say it's too much money even though I know that they can easily pay for it 20 times over.

All this for spilling milk on the kitchen floor. I can't live like this anymore. It's driving me insane and I can't handle it. It feels like my life is just driving towards an ocean cliff and there’s nothing i can do to stop it. Now most of my nights i spend crying and planning my suicide. But i haven't told anyone else thinking that they'll either not believe me or just blame it one me.

488,"I started having feelings for my best friend and I’m not sure what to do. There are things that make me think he might feel the same way and things that make me feel like he doesn’t. 

Me and this dude have known each other for 7 years, but we didn’t become better friends until about 6 months ago. Around the time we started hanging out a lot, he was going through a rough time and I was trying to be the best friend I could. Ever since then he hugs me a lot and tells me he loves me all the time. I didn’t read into it much at first because some guys are straight but just kind of affectionate with their friends. But there were other things. 

The way he hugs me is the first thing. He holds me tight and close. Sometimes hugs me with his hands around my waist instead of my upper body. And sometimes he doesn’t want to break the hug for 2 minutes or more. He also sometimes puts his hand on my thigh if we’re sitting close and not around other people. He has kissed me on my cheek and forehead while hugging before. 

Also, I’ve seen him playfully flirt with girls and certain things he does/says to flirt with them I’ve noticed he does with me too. Another thing he does that seems flirty is I catch him looking at me sometimes and he makes a funny face when I catch him lol. 

It’s starting to get difficult because aside from the emotional feelings I’m starting to get for him I’ve never been more physically attracted to a guy than him. And he is a very sexually charged person. There are 2 different girls that he’s not dating but has sex with regularly, and he’s very open with me about his sex life. Sometimes while we’re hanging out he’ll call one of the girls on FaceTime and make her think he’s not with anybody and he’ll gear the conversation so she talks about how big his d*** is and how good he is in bed. And while she’s talking about this he always glances at me to see if I’m paying attention and nudges me with his elbow or leg. 

There are a few things too that make me think he would never in a million years be into a guy. First thing is how woman-crazy he is. That alone doesn’t make it impossible for him to be into a guy, because I definitely have my woman-crazy phases too, but he has made some homophobic jokes (which is one reason I’m scared to lose him if he does find out about me - even though he does have a couple gay/bi friends, but they’re not as close as me so I don’t know how he would react)

It’s just starting to bother me because I’m really getting strong feelings for him and getting more attracted to him physically and I don’t know how to deal with it. I feel like at some point after some time I might be able to tell him I’m bisexual, but after a good amount of time. But I’m not sure if I could handle telling him how I feel about him, I don’t want him to distance himself. 

I honestly thought about just cutting off ties but it would hurt me and him both, plus would be awkward because we have a lot of the same friends too. But I also don’t want to keep wanting him so bad that it hurts. Any suggestions on what I could do?",18Feb2020,1

496,Is getting plastic surgery so bad? I don’t think that I’m straight up ugly but i don’t mind changing my face completely. It’s more about aesthetics of it. There’s this certain look I really like but I’ve soon many people shit on it. I just don’t want to be treated shitty because I got plastic surgery in a way that doesn’t look “natural” to other people. There’s this girl called Amanda from the tv show botched that I’ve seen and she looks so pretty to me. It’s a obvious “I got plastic surgery” look but not overly dramatic. I personally think it’s such a gorgeous look and I would want to look like that but I think making friends or getting a boyfriend would be way harder than it normally would be.

503," I think I was born with Asperger's/autism, I could never fit in but i was satisfied with my social life though, because I was active in this game and had alot of online friends from it, so I never felt lonely. I really wasn't lonely untill 2018, when college started and me and my online friends grew apart, except an online relationship at that time and some other friends that I could tell anything to. When college started, I felt like shit going there, it just feels like such a waste of time, waiting for classes and shit, waiting for transportation to get back home, I was depressed seeing so much girls that I am attracted to but being unable to talk to any of them because I was a socially awkward person, I was always an anxious and tensed person. I didn't learn anything there honestly, I dropped out after 5 months and wasted quite a fortune. I was studying Accountancy, a 2 year program, I think the people that started with me are graduating this year, while I'm still nothing, did nothing these 2 years, spent most of my time playing video games and getting depressed because I just feel so lost in life. During those times, I m glad I had that online girlfriend that I knew for 5 years, having everyone to say I love you to and virtual hugs was nice. Last year she changed, no longer cared about me and I was lonely ever since. To this day, I still couldn't get over her. Right now, I kinda still have online friends, but the thing is I don't really have anything to talk about with them anymore, they were my only friends.

I remember in the beginning of this year, I thought about wanting this year to be very different to the past depressing years, but dang, it's almost March and I'm still the same, didn't even bother finding a college to apply to, because i feel like Life isn't going to be happy for me from now on.. I just feel so numb? Ever since that girl online that I thought I had a future with, just left me cold like that. It really changed how I see this world. Things just aren't the same anymore, like once I go to college to study anything, my future is pretty much set in stone. And it's just not a life that i want. I don't want to work everyday. I didnt sign up for this kind of world. doing tasks that I know is meaningless to me just to survive to live a boring lonely life. Like right now, I guess I am kinda happy? I am just practicing my skills for fps games and seeing little improvements everyday makes me happy. I just have this fantasy that I'll be rich and famous one day for being the best player ever. But that's just wishful thinking. But anyway, I think this post is kinda confusing, a tl;dr would be: I am fkin so lonely and maybe i can act to fit in, but emotionally il never really fit in and be happy around people, I still think of the past from years ago alot because those were the times when i last felt alive and excited to wake up. I don't know what to do with my life and I am already 21. I don't know when I will commit suicide, but probably if nothing changes in a few years",18Feb2020,1

507,"
Throwaway account because I’m a shy bit*h and I don’t want anybody to know who I am, hence the reason I’m even in this predicament in the first place. 

Anyways. I (21F) have this friend, we’ll call him Adam (23M) I met Adam probably around June of 2019, through mutual friends. Ever since then, we’ve hung out countless times. Mainly with other people within our friend group, but sometimes just us. Me and Adam have so much in common that sometimes I’m even a little shocked. So over time I’ve gradually found myself developing feelings for Adam that are more than just wanting to be his friend and I don’t know what to do with these feelings. I’m not 100% sure he doesn’t feel the same way because he’s never straight up told me that, although I’ve also never asked how he feels because I am deathly scared of rejection. We’re both single and sometimes while hanging out with friends we playfully flirt etc, or after drinking we always seem to end up cuddling for the night, but it has never been brought up between us afterwards and it’s never been anything more than that. (There has been a few occasions where someone has asked if me and Adam are a thing because they’ve seen this happen to which I’ve said either no or “I wish” jokingly”) 

Now,  i’m an extreme introvert and I have such bad social anxiety that if it was up to me and I didn’t have those key extroverted and supportive loved ones/friends in my life, I’d probably never leave the house at all other than to go to work, buy groceries, etc. and when I did those things, I definitely wouldn’t go out of my way to actually TALK to anybody unless of course it was completely necessary. That being said, I have little to no experience with relationships. Especially trying to bridge this awkward gap between a really good friendship and something that I feel like could possibly be more??? At least I want it to be... 

Do I tell Adam how I feel in hopes he feels the same way? Or do I keep this to myself to avoid ruining the friendship that we do have in case he doesn’t feel the same way because I don’t wanna make things weird? I get anxiety just thinking about putting myself out there enough to make the next move because my head tells me “if he wanted to be more than friends he would have done something about it already” but deep down I just want to KNOW for sure so I can stop thinking about it. Help me reddit??? WTF do I do???",18Feb2020,1

My parents have recently divorced a couple of years ago and this was much needed as my father was abusive physically and mentally to my mum and me and my siblings . I have been with my bf for 3 years now and his father used to be physically and mentally abusive to him and his brothers and more so to his mum. I absolutely despise these sort of men who have this sickening kind of behaviour and being in an indian family this kind of abuse was swept under the carpet and not talked about and nearly all of my indian family including my mums mother pushed my mum into staying with my dad eventhough this was life threatening for my mum, me and siblings. My bf is mixed race and his mum is white and eventhough she had left my bfs dad over ten years ago talks about him with such praise which is ridiculous as he used to beat her up and cheat on her all the time. My bfs mum is constantly bringing him up in conversation and this gets on my nerves however i keep my mouth shut. Over a day ago one of her sons (she has 6) said that his dad is getting married and that he would attend the wedding along with some of his brothers (but not my bf as he does not speak to his dad). Her son also said that my bfs mum wanted to go and i find that so stupid and so demeaning for her to even consider it. I feel like she has no self respect for herself and the fact that some of her sons talk to their dad is discusting. I am now worried my bf will go to the wedding and start talking to his dad and i will not tolerate this as it will change what i think of him as what son/daughter would be so pally with someone who gave his mum hell?

513,"I (F18) am in my second semester of freshman year. First semester didn't go too well but now it's even worse. I'm only taking 4 classes, failing 2 of them, and not doing great in the other 2. I don't know what's wrong with me but I feel broken? Like I'm malfunctioning. I WANT to do the work and get good grades, but I physically can't bring myself sometimes. I have the motivation, but without the ability to act on it. I used to rely on the last minute ""oh shit"" feeling to get my work done but I can't feel that anymore, it's just one long droning feeling of dread, failure and anxiety that,  somehow, isn't enough to make me do what I need to do,  but enough to give me the occasional thought of ending my life.  OVER GRADES. I really have no idea how or why I started to feel like this. 

Recently I've been skipping some classes,  justifying it to myself by saying that staying home and catching up on work will be more beneficial to my situation than going to class only to be completely lost, as I am weeks behind. But then I just don't do the work. 

One of my teachers seems to be trying to get me on track with my assignments, which I'm grateful for but I am so behind in the class, I'm embarrassed, and I don't think their efforts to help me in this particular class would work. I want to tell them that I can catch up by myself,  which I know I can do, maybe getting help here and there,  but I don't know if I can force myself to do it.

I just want to start this semester over. I don't know what happened to me but I'm scared of it. I'm thinking of withdrawing from the 2 courses I'm failing but I don't know what that means in the long run.

514,"In the Stanford marshmallow experiment, 50 kids were given two choices. (1) Eat one marshmallow now. (2) Wait 20 minutes and eat two marshmallows. The story goes that the kids who resisted the temptation and chose the second option went on to do better in school, get better jobs, and so on.

I don't know specifically how reliable/valid that study is, but I think common sense says delayed gratification has benefits. Here are some examples:

1) Saving money makes the future a lot easier, even though splurging that extra cash on a night out is a lot more fun in the moment.

2) Studying for an exam over a planned out period of time helps retain the information better, even though it's really tempting to procrastinate and have fun until the last minute.

3) Eating fewer desserts is good for your long-term health, even though eating cookies and ice cream everyday is a lot more fun in the short term.

I know full well that I should be thinking about my long-term future, but I often give into temptations. Especially when I'm tired, I totally blow it.

Now, my father wasn’t the best person; he was abusive to my mom and strict to me and my brother but he really did try to change a few months before his death.

Then they met a fitht time and finally managed to talk and figure out that they both kept an eye on each other for months now. It really seems shes happy with that guy and she is so enthusiastic about him.

She told me that story on the roadtrip for 1 hour straight in great detail. And throughout these 60 minutes I could literally hear my heart shatter. I didn't know that she still means that much to me but hearing that she's getting in a relationship broke my heart. But on the other side I'm really Happy for her she's an amazing person and she deserves the perfect guy.

I was really sad the last few days and I don't know how to feel about it. As I said I'm happy and supportive for her but at the same time I'm heartbroken.",18Feb2020,1
528,"I'm 21 years old, not done with university yet and is working part time. I have a 17-year-old sister who is so smart with her money that she handles her finances way better than I do. Recently our mom had health issues that prevents her from working, which took a real blow to our household finances (because of the bills and the loss of income). My income used to only support myself but now I partially support our family too.

To address the money we owe my uncle (hospital bills suck), our dad started working over time, for a job that is already asking more from him than what they're paying him. Through this we were able to payback our uncle and have a relatively balance financial situation.

My sister and I already have switches, but we both study a city away so we're living in dorms and all, and on the weekends playing on my switch really detoxifies and reconnects ourselves. We can see how much our dad wants to have a switch of his own, but we also feel how much pressure he's in to provide for our family. We figured that since he worked so hard all our life, and we're kinda in a stable position right now AND he's turning 50 years old soon, we could pool our savings and buy him a Nintendo Switch of his own.

But we're worried that since we only found our footing again recently, that buying him a switch might be impractical. Or it might hurt his ego for his barely indipendent children to give him a luxury item (he considers anything that goes beyond basic necessities luxury items). Or we need money for an emergency and we're going to spend it on a switch. So we're torn if we're going to but him one.... Should we?


TLDR: my sister and I want to buy our dad a switch for his 50th birthday (and for being an awesome dad) but we have only just been financially stable after our mom's health issues, so we're not sure if buying him a switch is okay.",18Feb2020,1

he berates me and even though everyone in my family knows I have crippling depression and ptsd this c\*nt gets away with saying in front of both my parents mind you shit like “no wonder you have no friends your an asshole to everyone of course nobody likes you your an annoying piece of shit” and all he’s told by my parents is shit the fuck up and he’ll keep going without them doing shit, 

now if I did this either he or my parents would definitely hit me, I need him gone but I can’t move out cause I have no job or friends as you can probably tell atleast not in the same area as me, and when I say he should move out my whole family just turns to me and say why don’t you and when I say I have no job they tell me to get one cause I’m a lazy prick,

Hi!

I'm a girl (17 soon to be 18). I live in a small town where nothing really exciting happens. My father died 2 years ago from an accident at home, connected with his prolonged alcoholism and because of that my mom sometimes has emotional breakdowns and cries. She blames herself for what happened and has severe depression and panic attacks which were diagnosed before I was born and my father had depression too he was even suicidal.

My problems began when I started high school at the age of 14/15. On my first day, I had a nervous breakdown in front of my new class because I was afraid that nobody would like me or want to talk to me and they probably thought that I was weird. So yeah I didn't really connect to anyone there and I guess I still don't. The first few weeks I was constantly crying, had stress dreams every night and couldn't bear to go to school without a pill to calm me down. Anyway, I continued trying to make some friends which didn't happen. I spent the next two years completely friendless, I stayed home did my homework listened to music and slept. My parents were arguing a lot which they had been doing since I was little. I was always afraid or crying.

Then I became a 10th grader things got better I reconciled with an old friend of mine from my class who I had hurt years ago by choosing another friend over her (this so-called friend did the same to me later). This old friend is friends with almost everyone from the class and she is cheerful and lively and beautiful... just everything that I'm not. Then I started going out with her company and it was pretty cool she started changing though. She said I was her best friend but she didn't show it much. Then I got a boyfriend and we drifted apart even more. Now I don't know if we are friends or not (we never really talked in school just sometimes went home together).

I managed to find friends from my class but they seem to have other closer friends to hang out with and I just feel excluded and isolated. They all try to be liked by the popular ones from my class.

I'm just confused and tired of everything. I don't know what I want in the future I haven't decided on a profession I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I've been having breakdowns a lot, moments when I cry, scream and just want everything to end. My whole body shivers and my heart beats very fast and there are these thought like I'm about to die and I just feel like I can't breathe.

I don't know what to do and I have no one to share this with if someone out there knows something that I can do to fix my situation please tell me.",18Feb2020,1

542," Hello,  
I'd just like to start off by saying that, I have had this issue with my hobbies where i'm always looking to get money out of it, and I don't think practically, For example, i played Video games a lot, took it up as a hobby AFTER quitting a sport, I eventually got good at it and then just looked to earn money out of it whether it be through, Youtube/twitch or even tournaments. The problem I'm facing here is that, I ended up losing my passion for the game and as of now, its been Three weeks, where i haven't done anything, no gaming, just watched youtube videos to kill the time. Now that, I've given a bit of context i thought I'd ask for help with; 1)What more hobbies could I partake in, now that i have no interest in gaming 2)I feel like i have a defeatist mentality when it comes to things like these and also a negative attitude when it comes to associating money and hobbies, like if i think about animation, i'm again thinking too far ahead... I can't pickup anything because of this,i'm always looking at an end goal and ruining the hobby for myself 3) Any advice in general regarding this issue could help me a lot tbh, i'm just feeling so empty/stuck right now.",18Feb2020,1

I said that because in interacting with people and helping them is how it will make me better for when i become a psychologist. Did i do wrong in saying that? I panicked but i dont think that it is going to impede me from getting the job. Eveything else went great except for the how long do you plan on working?

They gave me an estimated date on when i would start if background check came out okay.,18Feb2020,1
544,"I just want to know if this is normal for people or not. 

So let me start this off by saying this. I have 2 half siblings. 1 has mild autism. The other has very very bad ADHD. And me. Supposedly the 2nd coming of Christ (not litterally) according to my family. All I ever hear is how I was the best child ever. Quiet. Extremely smart and advanced. Very artistic. Picked up any talent I wanted. Etc. 

But now I'm an adult. I had a really crappy life when custody switched and I lived with crack headed parents through middle/high school. Got sorta depressed and had to fend for myself in pretty much every regard. I grew up fast. And I've always been very calm, level headed. I've never been ""rilled up"" before. Never angry. Never aggressive. Always very passive on things, opposite of my parents. 

But.. now I'm starting to think maaaaaybe I have something too. Mental/behavior illness wise. I may be solid emotionally. But Im starting to think that the way I am... May not be normal? Here's what I'm talking about. And I've recently started realizing it may not be a typical thing. 

I get obssessed with extreme things. For like 1-2 days. Research the hell out of it. Make detailed plans to do it. Then just throw it out the window when I find something better or more exciting to think about. I've been doing this since I was maybe 13? 

For example. Just over this past weekend. I have gone through these topics. And researched EVERYTHING I could. And made detailed plans. Before ditching it for the next. 

1. Barn cats, I wanted some barn cats to help our mouse issue we were having in our house. Read everything I could. Contacted agencies. Found barn cats. Lost interest, next. 

2. Buying a camper. Wife brought it up. I think great idea let's do it. Scour Craigslist in the surrounding 3 states including mine. Contacting every single person in our price range and talking with each and every one that responded. Even went to see 2 of them. Full steam ahead wanted a camper. Then, decided nah bad financial decision. NEXT

3. diet and fitness. Realized I wanna go on a really healthy diet. Not some normal shit. Let's research being a vegetarian and plant based diets in top athletes. Now I'm going to the grocery store and buying a bunch of vegetables and crap to start my diet. Now I just need a way to exersize. I used to lift weights. Loved it. Researched Craigslist for weight bench. Promised a few id be in touch when I get paid . Watched bodybuilding documentaries while putting my daughter to bed. 

4. Why aren't we lumberjacks anymore? I'm from the northeast. Lumberjack country (maybe?). Further my need for a weight bench to get jacked like a lumberjack. Or maybe I'll just go buy an ax and start cutting down some trees. Maybe I'll start a business chopping firewood to sell. Do I have enough flannel shirts? Where can I find the good flannel shirts? You know what lumberjacks love? Pancakes! We call em flapjacks back In my day (definitely didn't). Proceed to buy lumberjack pancake mix with real maple syrup.

This all happened in the course of this weekend. That was my weekend in a nutshell. The other thing? Don't ask me if I wanna go somewhere. Or move somewhere. I'll have interviews lined up and apartment tours to go view this weekend. I can litterally move a house. Get a new job and a new apartment. In a NEW STATE. Within 48 hours (I've done it before). I'm definitely a go getter..... Lol.

So..... Yea I'm gonna assume maybe I should talk to a doctor..? I dont obsess about these things to others very much.  My wife hears about some of it. So does my grandma (bless her heart, all the ideas she's had to listen to for hours). But to most people? I'm a totally normal dude with a family. Laid back chillen kinda guy.",18Feb2020,1
545,"I've started realizing recently that I have an almost obsessive tendency to focus a lot of my thoughts and mental energy on the future.

For example, I'm currently on vacation with my wife and kids. Yesterday I realized that rather than just enjoy what we were doing, I was thinking about our next vacation. Plans we needed to make, things to do differently so we'd enjoy it more.

I don’t know if this friend is even toxic but she makes me feel so worthless most of the time so I want her out of my life. The main problem is that we have the same friend groups and go to the same school. Like I have two close friends she isn’t also friends with but I only see them every few months.  We’re also both in a smallish online community and a lot of people associate us together. But since last June most times I hang out with her I feel so shitty about myself. She makes fun of my hobbies, interests and style. She’s even made fun of my name (I’m trans so it’s really important to me) because it’s super similar to a fictional character and therefore not a valid name. She’s made me feel suicidal and even relapse with my ed. Every time I’ve asked her to stop she replies with ‘I’m so sorry I’m such a bitch I’ll never do it again’ then she’ll vague post about me on her spam/vent accounts (that I follow) and then a few days later she starts it again. 

She does have really bad depression and a bunch of mental health issues but so do I and it’s really damaging for me to stay close friends with her but I don’t know how to tell her or even if it’s worth it.

I seem to always be the one that attracts drama all the time. And when there is no drama, I am somehow the one that unintentionally creates some. I guess I am quite a negative person and it is difficult for me to not always look for things that can be improved.

I work in a leadership position with a very strong character which tends to react very well with some people but creates tension with the majority. Some coworkers absolutely love me but with others I have problems that raise the managements eyebrows.

I have run into these situations since childhood, throughout high school and church class, university and now at work. Sometimes I feel like I am creating the drama so that I can see who sides with me and then get validation through that.

Anyone else has gone through this and has some advice how I can work on myself to not be the center of all drama anymore?

For backstory, since I was around 10 my mother has been an rampant alcoholic that has basically decimated our once secure and functional family. My father has been forced to give up work and an income to undertake housekeeping and motherly duties that includes being responsible in taking care of me and my 2 other brothers. Since then my dad has been forced to sell the house to take care of debts, but for the last 9 months he has moved us into a raggedy, downtrodden house that honestly makes me depressed just to be in. My dad changed a lot emotionally in the last few years which I can’t blame him for, but it has resulted in him being quite emotionally abusive, occasionally resulting to the point of physical abuse. He cares more for his now girlfriend than us and chooses to spend more of him expendable income on her that his 3 kids to the point to not even provide enough food and amenities for me and my brothers. Our overall standards of living continues to get worse and worse which I fear is going to have a toll on my short and long term mental health. 

Moving out and escaping has been on my mind for the last 6 months or so, but I fear being totally independent as I am still 17. I fear losing contact with our brothers that I have formed quite a close connection to. I have researched moving into colleges, Flatmates, or student accomodation, but yet again I am stuck.

In reality I have serious aspirations to travel, my first destination is the west coast of the US where I’m hoping to be in roughly around a years time. What I remember from this dream is that I had planned with my girlfriend (who is my real gf) and some of her friends to go to California. The next thing I remember is being in Venice Beach watching a beautiful sunset with everyone, but my girlfriend wasn’t there. Turns out she hadn’t come with us all and I remember in the dream trying to find out why she didn’t come with us but never getting a straight answer.  Now idk if I’m overthinking things like I’ve been prone to do in the past but I feel like my moral compass has lined up in the right directions in recent times, I’m at least able to say that I’m relatively comfortable in my current situation, granted it isn’t perfect but I’ve accepted that it has been worse and it is a lot worse for a lot of other people. But here’s the thing. I don’t see my girl very often, she’s a full time university student so she tends to be quite busy.

I met a girl at a party last week and things were going great that night. We kicked back, drank wine and hooked up (made out) in the bathroom. 

I really really liked her, it felt like it was like a love at first sight kinda thing. We just got along so well and she just seemed like the most amazing person. 

But then as she went off to go use the toilet, two girls walked up to me and said “just letting you know in case you didn’t, but she has a fiancé and she took her ring off before she came to the party” 

I then asked her why she wouldn’t tell me the truth; and she went on about how things with her fiancé hasn’t been the same and what not. She just kept apologising and ended up just leaving the party. 

She messaged me the next morning, basically saying that she loves her fiancé and she wants everything to be put behind her. 

I don’t really want to lie about how I feel on here. And I know it’s naive to believe that she was the ONE, but it really did felt that way.

The mother has slapped the entire family around multiple times, and was actually arrested for it not too long ago.

They just do whatever they want and seem to have this care free attitude with my gf. The middle brother had recently left the family car unlocked in their driveway, only to find out that the car had been broken into and my gf's purse had been stolen with all her cards and money and everything else inside. A day or two later she got a call from our police department saying they found her wallet with nothing in it but her I.D.. The middle sister just takes my gf's clothing that I bought for her and wears it whenever she wants. It's really not that bothersome to me because it's just clothes but this is just background. The thing that recently happened is the biggest problem I'm having right now. around Christmas last year, me and my gf took a trip across the state to go see some christmas show that was happening. We had some pictures taken of us and printed (think mall santa pictures). Fast forward to valentine's day, me and my gf had seen each other and I gave her a small box of chocolate. When she went home, apparently her sister came out yelling that my gf open the car door. My gf didn't do it so her sister comes outside with the pictures that we took from our trip and ripped them apart. This is the part that has me so pissed off. I have so much anger that the last thing I wanna do is confront the sister and explode with anger and getting myself in trouble with the law and with the family. I have been so angry by this that I haven't even slept. It turns my stomach inside out just talking about it. I can tell how much this hurt my gf because she was crying just telling me what happened. My gf really has nothing in the house that is hers besides that picture. My gf went to their mother and apparently the mother had slapped the sister around a bunch  and that's then end of the story as far as I know. The mother is pretty awful too but that's a whole different story. I just feel super helpless. My parents have offered that my gf come stay with us for as long as she needs but she always refuses. I can't do anything with the siblings as I am bound by the law, and the last thing I wanna do is make the situation worse with the mother by overstepping. She's almost leaving to college soon but for now I can't stand seeing her treated like this. Idk what to do because one of these days I'm convinced I'm gonna explode and go off on everyone in that house.

567," I’m a student at Stanford University, and I’m not proud of it. 

During a meeting with a Senior Associate Vice Provost at Stanford University in the month of July, when I indirectly referenced a cover-up of a critical police incident on campus, she viciously railed upon me, yelled in a small room, banged her fist on a table, and threatened my legal rights. All in the span of half a dozen minutes.

In a follow-up meeting that she forced, she now sat alongside another Stanford Staff member, and in this meeting, she felt it alright to laugh at the memory of my dead sister. Luckily for me, I made sure we were not in an enclosed space and have witnesses (and a legally recorded tape) of this. 

Seeking to resolve the matter internally, I tried to find a way within Stanford to complain of a staff member. Funny thing is, they don’t give you one. After weeks on emailing around, the best I got was to go to this staff member’s supervisor. There are no documents, guidelines, or outlined procedures of how this works. The best I received from the superior – a Vice Provost – is that she would have to “conduct interviews and gather evidence.” 

All I asked in my thirty-minute interview with her was to ask the other Stanford Staff Member present in the second meeting about what happened. This interview was on the first of October 2019. Somehow, it took a month and a half for this Vice Provost to “conduct her interviews,” though she constantly claimed she needed nothing more from me. In mid-November, I saw a Stanford Daily Article stating that on October 31, 2019, the Stanford Staff Member present in the horrific meeting in which the SAVP laughed at my dead sister had “abruptly resigned without a statement.” 

Soon, the Vice Provost “investigating” the matter gave me a “final report.” On the list of people interviewed, this Stanford Staff Member – the only other Stanford Administrator present in the important meeting in question – was never interviewed. In fact? The second meeting was never addressed, and the Senior Associate Vice Provost minimized what she did in the first. She claimed she made “wild hand gestures” and “raised her voice” out of concern for *me*.

**TLDR**: A Stanford Senior Associate Vice Provost laughed at my dead sister in a legally recorded meeting, and when I tried to resolve the matter internally, the superior Vice Provost covered for her underling, and the only other staff member present in the meeting “abruptly resigned” during the Vice Provost’s “investigation.”

***How do I expose this to the public effectively? Any advice? I want to move on from this (and Stanford), but that can only happen after publicly exposing what happened.***",18Feb2020,1
568,"I'm 26, female, and a resident of the uk. 

I've had an odd career, basically taking any job available and staying a year, to change to a completely different field. 
There are not a lot of jobs in my area of the uk, its renowned for poor pay and lack of opportunity. If I had the money, I would move, but sadly I currently don't. 

So far I've worked in customer support in a tech company, account management in a energy sector and then customer support for a finance business. 
I've hated every job and cant stand it 3-4 months into the role, so I stay as long as I can (a year ish, sometimes 18 months) and leave.

I've left previous jobs due to 1 failed probation, 1 intense depressive state I was considering suicide, and 1 naive decision because I was young and thought I could do better. Hard life lesson was applied. 

People tell me to do what I love, but that's not possible. I don't really know what I love anymore and the things I enjoy aren't really career fields?
I enjoy my houseplants, I grow succulents. I enjoy sewing the things I can successfully make, I enjoy baking. None of these are really businesses or workplace skills though. 

I check garden centres for jobs, retail art shops for work, but so far in 4 months nothing has come up. I'm worried if something did come up, I'd end up hating it, like I have everything else. 

My partner tells me i should focus on getting a real job, like in an office. I'm pretty sure I hate working 9-5, business wear, jargon bullshit which is getting me down. That's what all my roles have been so far, all office based. There is so much stress for the little pay, this can't be all life is?

I feel like I make the wrong choice everytime. So where do I go from here?

I'm educated to degree level, no children, I can drive and own a car. Please throw any and all advice at me, so I can finally make a good decision.",18Feb2020,1

571,"I’m an only child, 21 years old and my father left before I was born. It’s always just been my mother and I and we are incredibly close. She had me when she was 15, we are more like sisters.

I’m now in a long term relationship and looking at moving out with my current partner. Financially and physically, I’m capable of living on my own. I have a very stable job and I earn great money, so in that aspect, I’m ready. However, if I left, I’d be leaving my mother on her own.  

I’ve toyed the idea to her before and it leaves her in tears, she says she knows it’ll happen one day but I know she’s not okay with it. My mother is lonely, whilst she is quite young and lively, she doesn’t have many friends and she does not have a partner (single for 6 years). She’s even struggling with the fact that I have a partner now and I’m not spending as much time with her as I used to. I know when I eventually leave, she will stand in my empty bedroom and cry for months. Being a mother is all she knows. 

I’ve hinted at the idea of my partner moving in with us, but I really don’t think she wants that at this point, and to be quite honest, I don’t want to have to wait until she’s ready when I’m ready now. 

I really want to move out and start gaining the independence I have never had. I’ve always had my mother do everything for me, be there for everything. She is the ideal mother and she is my best friend, and the thought of leaving her all by herself absolutely breaks my heart. But I know that it’s something I need to do and something that I actually want to do. 

Is there any way to make this easier for her and for me? I’m really just looking for some sound advice or even just understanding. I feel like I’m the only person with such a close bond with my mother and no one else will understand how hard this will be on both of us.",18Feb2020,1

One night Mom went to go sleep at a friend's house and the next day, she moved back into her Mom's. Every night I would feel so sad and ashamed of myself because I didn't say something I should've or I just kept on thinking about one thing I said I caused the fight (Both of them would tell lies to me about the other and then I would tell that other what they said). It's been three years and now we have a custody schedule. Sometimes I miss the fighting for some reason. Maybe it's PTSD or something, but I know it's not healthy to want to go back to mindset. My Dad and I are good now and I'd say he redeem himself, but sometimes when I look at him, I just remember the evil man who would argue with everyone until they broke down crying.",18Feb2020,1
573," 

Hi guys

12 months past ACL and meniscus tear

11 months post surgery. Only my meniscus was repaired, however not my ACL since that one was only partially torn.

I have done physio too. My doctor and my physiotherapist were pretty happy with the results. I am mostly painfree, I have hardly any immobility issues anymore. I have been working legs simultaneously for 10 months too. I can even squat up to 70kg multiple times without hardly any issues on my ACL or meniscus. Most of the time it will be the fatigue of my legs (plural!) that make me stop since they are not used to lift that heavy anymore.

I have been playing volleyball too. At first (4 months past surgery) I was extremely careful not to hurt myself. Since then I have started to play more regularly with time and even risk more. I am jumping and running around, thank god no issues at all, even back in the day. When I first started to play, I was always considered a handicap for my team but now people see me as one of the more important ones. Note, we have only been playing on sand...so it was more like beach volleyball. My knee would only hurt shortly after at home, it was more like a burning sensation around my mensicus but it has never bothered me much.

My friends want to sign up for a volleyball course at the university and I am really doubtful about it somehow. I am kinda scared. I have talked to my doctor; he always said that I should avoid contact sports at all costs (which volleyball really isn't) until like 10-12 months post surgery. This time it wouldn't be beach volleyball either, it would be normal volleyball.

My doctor asked me if I wanted to sit and lie down at home for the rest of my life. I mean...he's right, he really is...but I don't know if it's too early?",18Feb2020,1

577,"Im likely just paranoid. But I think one of my sisters is impersonating me on the internet again. 

I have an older sister who is some sort of cluster B personality disorder. It is between borderline personality disorder and clinical psychopathy. She is genuinely frightening. In the past she would take photos of myself and pretend to be me. She also would take photos of our other sisters kids and tell people they were hers on forums. 

I feel she is doing this again. I have become locally famous in the art world and feel she might be impersonating me on tumblr or facebook. I am an artist and performer and former model so this is worrying because she obviously is unstable and is likely making an ass out of herself. Which would reflect on me. I think this because ai will be out in public and will catch someone staring at me. When I do they look angry or horrified. It has happened three times and I wasnt in a position to ask the stranger what the problem was. I am tattooed and have dyed hair but this doesnt seem to be a legit reason to give ugly looks.

588,"Hi! So my dad bought a 2018 mazda 3 at 0 down payment and 60 months to pay. He gave that car to me at day 1, and I gladly accepted it because i thought it would be a gift. 

6 months in he told me that he would make me shoulder the remaining payments after 2 years. So I was a bit shocked but just went with it. fast forward to today and a year in, I'm doing pretty well for myself right now and ever since I really wanted a miata. So I talked to my dad and told him that I'll be getting one and we could just sell the car right now so that he won't pay for it anymore, since i would be using the miata as my daily. 

The thing is, right now he doesn't want to sell the car because he wouldn't get anything in return since it's a 0 down payment car, the only upside here is that he wouldn't be paying for it anymore. and right now he's having troubles financially because of the mazda 3. 

Now I'm in a dilemma because I really want to have a miata. I'm stuck between taking the mazda 3 off of his hands and pay for it myself. or just get the miata and let him realize that he really has to sell the mazda 3 (I really want to go with this option but does it come off as being ungrateful?).

Me: ""That's nice but I asked if you wanted to go to the park?""

Me: ""I didn't, but it doesn't matter. So you wanna go to the park?""
Him: ""No seriously, you specifically said ""Do you want to get dinner with me"", I know what you said!""

I talk a bit quietly sometimes, but I know what words I use. Is he just not listening to me? This happens often, a few times every day and I'm honestly tired of arguing about this. He gets upset because he thinks I'm doing it on purpose or something. But I honestly don't get why he hears such different words than I say. Even if I make sure to talk extra loud/clearly pronounced he still sometimes completely misunderstands.

It's lead to some big arguments because he's like really set on being right with this and won't accept it if I say he misheard, as it happens so frequently. He says there's nothing wrong with this hearing and he never misunderstands anyone else - and at the same time, I don't have this issue with other people. No one has ever mentioned not understanding me besides the occassional ""can you speak a bit louder?"", and I asked my friends about it too and everyone was really confused because they have no trouble at all understanding the words I say.

593,"Okay, let me start with a lot of background. I currently am a sophomore in college living with my very emotionally abusive father. My boyfriend and I met by accident a while back, and within a week were were together. Since then it has been perfect, with him popping down to see me any chance he could get. That being said, I always had a hard time spending time with him due to my father; I can’t even tell my dad I am going to see my boyfriend as he will take my car, phone, whatever he needs to to ensure I can’t do it. Due to this, he doesn’t even know Tim (what I’ll call my boyfriend for this) exists. Before anyone asks, my father does pay for things since I go to college 4 days out of the week and am currently working on a show (which is mandatory since I’m a theatre major).

What Tim and I set up this past weekend was that, in May I’d leave with him. I wouldn’t tell me father, although the people I can really really trust will know, and stay with him for a month or so. After, we will be moving back to my state so that I can keep in state tuition and he can finally escape the town that he is living in, which he absolutely despises. The big thing I’m worried about is him making it the two months; his work has been absolutely terrible, to the point that just thinking about going to work in the morning makes him physically sick. Not only that, in order to move down here he will have to have all 5 of his car fixed up enough to make it through a 10 hour drive. He feels he can do it, and I’ve made it very clear that it doesn’t have to be done by May. I am going to be there, but he can still work on things. When I go, it doesn’t all already have to be done, I’m staying there long enough for him to get things together and for my father to calm down. He makes it clear that that isn’t about me, as he just wants it done ASAP to ensure he can leave his job as fast as possible; he wishes he could leave now, but he desperately wants to move to my state and can’t find a good enough job here until he gets a through his ASE tests. He also knows that he can’t drop this job and work another one for like two months and then drop it, as it will look really bad on him. 

I feel like if we can make it just until May things will improve; he will have at least a little less to work on and I’ll actually be there so he won’t also have to stress about the distance. Also, I think it will show him that it is possible for big things to happen, as he is a pessimist who always assumes something he does will send things to hell in a hand basket. He even explained that he feels like if he can make it just till May that he will be okay in the long run; right now it just seems impossible for him. What can I do to make things easier? How can I encourage him and show that it’s all possible? He seems so broken and crushed when he has to go, to the point that he comes home most days just to rant for several hours about how hellish his work day is. I offered for him to not take me, but he said that that wasn’t the issue. The issue was the job. I told him that I can simply take online classes next year, still move in, and then he could work another job for a year or so. Still no dice, as he doesn’t want to stay in his area, where all towns are over an hour away and mostly offer minor mechanic work at shops like Autozone. He is set and determined that this is the best way to handle it, and I do trust him, but I don’t know how to help him. If anyone has ideas, please let me know. 

TLDR; I am supposed to move in with my boyfriend, who lives 10 hours away, in May as to avoid the blow up of my abusive father, and after a month or so move back to my state with my boyfriend so that I can continue with college and he can finally get a job he likes and be free of the town he so hates.

595,"Like the title says, I am planning to move my brother out and away from our neglectful and abusive family. He's 23-years-old, I live with my partner and our son.

The choice and planning began last year, when my brother started exhibiting really worrying side-effects of the lifestyle he lives between our mum and grandmum. Chest pains, lethargy, worsening depression, and increasing lack of mobility.

We had my brother over for a game night, so he can see his nephew and have some time with us. We brought up our concern gently, and offered to move him in with us so he can learn to navigate adult life and finally have his own. I love my brother with all of my heart- so does my son, and my partner really likes him too. We, and our collective best friend, want him to succeed.

I made it clear that our intention was all of the above, and to help him take steps to lose weight and start living a healthier life. I don't want my brother to pass away because our family enables him and has no regard for his survival. 

I have a list of basic things that we will need to purchase/replace due to an incredible amount of heavy chainsmoking from our grandmum/mum.

Beyond that, I really hope I can receive some guidance on planning for the long-term.

My brother has never had a job- he has been overweight to the point of disability since we were children, has literally no social life/experience outside of us and some internet friends; he has no income, no ID of any kind, no social security number, and my mum has put off replacing all of them for over 5 years. The one time she tried last year, she was told he essentially does not exist.

He can literally only cook frozen pizza, scrambled eggs, and microwave meals. He is a very picky eater because of the diet our family has provided him our entire life- which is literally everything listed above.

I plan on replacing all of his ID/social security info myself as soon as possible. Health related issues will obviously handled by/at the suggestion of medical professionals.

My partner volunteered to help get him onto social assistance- but beyond that we don't know how to help him learn everything our family never taught us. 

I've just been winging it and leaning heavily on my friends/partner/internet to learn what I have (which isn't very much still).

My brother is finally starting to talk about having a life and a will to survive. I need to do be able to do my best to make this happen.

Any advice I could get would be deeply appreciated. I'm more than a little desperate.

Her son also said that my bfs mum wanted to go and i find that so stupid and so demeaning for her to even consider it. I feel like she has no self respect for herself and the fact that some of her sons talk to their dad is discusting. I am now worried my bf will go to the wedding and start talking to his dad and i will not tolerate this as it will change what i think of him as what son/daughter would be so pally with someone who gave his mum hell? Please give any advice or should i just put up and shut up with this as this is affecting what I stand for and what morals i have. Thankyou for reading",18Feb2020,1
601,"My girlfriend at the time &amp; I were supposed to be attending a concert later on this month. She ordered the tickets about 6 months ago, and I paid my £50 to her for the ticket - it was agreed she’d keep hold of them until the gig so they wouldn’t get lost.

Fast forward two months &amp; we are now no longer together. Today I asked her for the ticket, to which she asked why. I then explained that I knew other people who were going that were willing to take me since we hadn’t been on good terms (we still spoke a bit at school, however things were very complicated). She then refused to give me my ticket, and when I asked for the money back, she said she wouldn’t do that either since I wasn’t going with her anymore.

What legality surrounds this whole setup? Is there any way I can legally get my money back since she’s effectively stolen from me after refusing my ticket?",18Feb2020,1

609,"This is one example of my brother’s behaviour which happened yesterday and I’m still annoyed and hurt by it, but a part of me feels like I’m overreacting. 

A bit of backstory for you to understand the situation: I am close in age to both my brothers so when my older brother (OB) started learning to drive my dad bought a small car for the three of us to share as we each learned to drive. A few months ago my younger brother (YB) passed his test and as my OB is at uni for most of the year now, I mainly share the car with just my YB. 
I am currently house/cat sitting for my grandmother, who is on holiday. She lives about 10 minutes drive from us. I have the car with me, as my parents don’t want to be driving me back and forth, but I told YB that if he wanted the car I would drive it back for him and then he could drop me back off on his way out to wherever he’s going (I will say because of where we live, if he is going out anywhere he is pretty must passing my grandmothers house anyways and it will take an extra 2 minutes to drop me off). YB is 17 and I am 19F.

So this is want happened: About 2:30 he text me asking to have the car tonight from 6 onwards. I text back ok and that I would be back with the car at 5:50. I got there and yelled that I was there and went to say hello to my mum. At 5:55 I went in the living room and asked my brother if he was ready to go. And he said where? I said to drop me back on his way out. He was confused and asked why he was dropping me off and that he thought that I was staying at home and would drive back to my grandmothers once he was back with the car. I asked him why he would think that as we had previously agreed that he would drop me off. He just said that was what dad said. I said well no we agreed before I left to go house sit that that was the deal and dad has nothing to do with that (my dad doesn’t want to be apart of the car situation and said when we first got the car that we had to sort out sharing it between ourselves). YB said fine we will leave in 10 minutes. I agree and I check the clock it’s 6:05, so we will be leaving at 6:15. I go talk to my dad for 10 minutes then go back into the living room and ask YB if he’s ready. He then says that he say 20 minutes and we aren’t leaving for another 10 minutes. We started arguing as he have said 10 minutes and by this point, I left my grandmother’s house over 30 minutes ago and I want to get back as I have homework and coursework that I need to do  and was already stressed about getting it done on time and I need to make myself some food. I feel that I have already gone out of my way for him to have the car and also I have a medical condition that limits the amount of energy my body produces, so that just that 30 minutes will affect me. 
He starts saying that he is meeting friends at 7, so it is best for us to leave at 6:30 (which is another 15 minutes) as that is enough time to drop me off and then meet his friends. I start getting annoyed and ask why he asked for the car from 6 onwards if he didn’t need it till 6:30, if he had said that I would have come later. He just said that he thought I was staying and that it wouldn’t have made a difference. (So he expected me to stay at my house while he was out and wait for him to get home??) Because of my condition I have to have a route to manage so I try to eat at roughly the same times and go to bed at the same time every day. And HE KNOWS THIS. I am not waiting until god knows when for him to get back.
I get really angry as he is just sitting there on his phone and when I get angry I feel like I want to cry (I don’t know why). So, I go to talk to my mother as I’m getting too upset and I tell her what’s going on and she goes and tells YB to drive me back to my grandmother’s house now or I will leave and take the car (yes I ran to mummy, but my YB never listens to me and I was tired and wanted to get back, rest and have food before continuing with my homework). Finally he got his shoes on and the whole time is complaining that is wasn’t a big deal. My mum said that I had been there 20 minutes (I’d been there longer, but she wasn’t keeping track) and I shouldn’t have to be waiting for him. At that he scoffed and said yeah 20 minutes like I hadn’t been waiting for him. This just pissed me off as minutes ago he was arguing that he said we would leave in 20 minutes. 
When he finally dropped me back it was almost 6:45, so I had been out of my grandmother’s house almost an hour. 

Just to be clear, he is not going out for a night out, he is meeting some friends at the gym, so will only be a few hours, but I still feel like he shouldn’t expect me to wait around because it’s more convenient for him, as I am going out of my way for him. Btw this is by far not the first time he has expected me to go out of my way for him, once he asked for the car 5 minutes after the bus I would have needed to get to college left, when he missed the bus, I said no as I wouldn’t be able to get to college. (Previously we agreed I could have the car that day). He then asked my mum for a left in, but she didn’t have time as she was leaving for work in a different direction. I ended up having to drive him in as I didn’t need to be in college until a little later than him, but I had a test that day that I wanted revise for, but had to drive him to school instead.

We had a conversation about her doing this and she admitted it. She says she’s insecure and her father made her feel like she wasn’t enough which I understand. I even told her how sorry I am about that but she needs to find her own self identity. 

She agreed and said that she’s trying to speak to a therapist. But I haven’t seen much progress and she still continued to do the same thing.

Can someone please tell me what I can do about this? My heads been very messed up and I've no idea what is real or not anymore.

My ex boyfriend sexually abuses me. We are not together anymore but I still live in the same house. I can't afford to move out on my own. We have a 1 yr old son and my ex constantly tells me that if I move out I can't take my son with me because he will go for full custody and win and I'll never see him again.

I am so very distressed. My son is my life! I love that kid more than anything. I'm so terrified of losing him.

Me and my son sleep in a different room. But my ex won't ever let me shut the door says it's his house he makes the rules. He'll come into my room at night and just demand sex. He hits me when I try hiding from him. Everytime I always say no and try to make him leave. He's a pretty big guy and can be very intimidating. It's hard to fight him off of me and I usually never can. it's also very traumatising since I'm trying to be quiet so I don't wake Bub up because I don't want him to see something like that.

I threaten to call police but he just laughs and says I wouldn't because then I'd lose my son 😔

He has videos on his phone of me doing some illegal drugs and doing sexual things. But these videos are from ages ago and I'd never do anything like that now that I have my son! He says it dosent matter and that he can report the videos anytime he likes and I'd lose all custody of my son and go to jail. And that he would never let me see him again.

I don't understand what I'm suppose to do. I'm so terrified of going to anyone for help or reporting anything in case they take my son away. He's not in danger I'd never put him in any danger I'm just so scared of losing him.

I'm so terrified it takes such a toll on me mentally I'm always stressing. I feel so stuck in my situation I don't see any way out.

I am scared of my ex but I'm more scared of losing my son 😞 Please tell me how I can get help without losing him.

620,"Tldr at the bottom.

So I live in rural Kentucky, and recently my boyfriend (call him Robert) has been staying at my house. It's been all well and cool until we decided to take a walk on the farm. We have near 200 acres worth of property, and most of it is fenced off by a barbed wire fence. So, the past Sunday, we took a walk to one of our ponds and I began to notice footprints, footprints that could not have been ours because we haven't walked there yet. I let it drop though, and we continue walk. Then we go towards the bottom of our property where the property line is a creek. 

When we got to the creek we were just looking around until I spotted a bottle. We go to investigate and see that it's recent, and could not have gotten there by any other means than by someone carrying it. There are no teeth marks and it was above the flood line. Then, Robert points out more prints. 

We begin to walk and see several paths that are human steps. Large boot prints that sink into the ground, so he assumes adult men. Then we see a tree in the middle of the field. Robert then points out a large sinkhole beside the tree, and the fact that there is short, green grass around the tree (insinuating people walk there often).

Then we find bones. Something that looks like a tiny femur bone, half a jaw bone, part of some type of skull, and the spine and ribs of a small animal (possibly a racoon skeleton) all within a 10 foot radius. 

So then, we returned to the house and told my mother about what we had found. She seemed concerned about all the evidence we found and was confused about where people would have come from. But she refused to call the police. I urged her too, because the night before the alarm on our truck had gone off after midnight. But she still refused and told me it was nothing to worry about. 

We went out to walk yesterday, and found fresh tire tracks. Too wide to be a four wheeler yet it had off road tires (I later deduced that it was most likely a Jeep because of a vehicle we found parked on our property before). We tracked the tire tracks to where it followed a path down to the creek - where we had seen the bottle, bones, and tree. I decided to get out the four wheeler again while the entire time my mother was trying to convince me we had no gas to fill it up with (we did, there was plenty to fill the tank twice over). We rode around for a while and found more weird evidence and then went back to the field by the creek. We found the bones had been moved and the grass trampled on again. 

We then tried to return to the house by going up the hill (it's sort of steep, but I've driven it several times with no problems). We get halfway up the hill when this dread feeling creeps into my mind. Then the four wheeler died. It started skipping, then simply died. I had to let it roll back down the hill to the bottom, and it still would not run. We were forced to walk up the hill, and the dread feeling returned. I'm not entirely sure what triggered it but I had a sudden, intense panic attack. I felt like I HAD to get off the hill. 

We did eventually get back to the house, and my mom refused to call the police. Now I'm afraid to sleep in my own house; had a couple knives at my headboard cause I was afraid to be without them. 

I don't know what's going on but I need advice. Should I talk to the police and disregard what my mom said? She blames the neighbors, but there's no way someone can get to the field by the creek except by going through our front and back yard from the road, so does she know about it? Is she possibly in on it? This seems like more than simple trespassing.  What should I do?

tldr: Found human tracks and fresh tire tracks on our property, accompanied by an arrangement of bones, bottles dropped on our land, and a strange feeling that I shouldn't be looking into this. Should I call the police?",18Feb2020,1
621,"Whats wrong with my son's j-shaped penis?

My son is 19 and though I have not seen him nude since he was a boy, I had seen him by accident about 6 months ago, when he had somehow ended up falling asleep naked in his room after a shower with his door wide open. He was on his back and erect in his sleep. I noticed his hard-on had a severe curve upward. It was bent very sharply like curling up backwards. I had never seen anything like that on any man. It is about 7″ long approximately and is bent more toward the tip in a definite shape of a letter “j”, or a hook, to attempt to describe it to you.

I was so shocked that I panicked, and woke him up right then and there. Thinking back, it was not very tactful, but I could not wait to try to get at what appeared to be a real problem. It all made sense, how he would not shower at gym class, and didn’t date, despite being a very well built and handsome boy into sports always. I had always wondered if might be gay, though he denied it always. He awoke surprised and shy that he was naked, but I moved his hands from his erect penis, and asked him what was the matter.

We sat and talked after locking his bedroom door. He told me it had started when he was like 12 and got worse, and as I examined it more closely and attempted to straighten it out, it would straighten only very slightly before it would hurt him to force it any further. It being erect, it was very hard and stiff. We allowed it to subside by him putting on his robe a while, and was considerably more normal in the soft state, yet still tending to be curved upwards slightly.

I could straighten it easily while soft, but it would bend back up like rubber. As he became erect again it curled up before my eyes into the “j” hook shape despite my trying to keep it straight. Sometimes it even curls while it is in my hands.

Now the doctors all said he is fine and it’s normal as far as being a medical issue. They said they could operate to attempt to fix it, but the cost was out of my reach. I am a single parent. So we took trying our own methods, in which I would tell him to stroke it straight whenever he thought about it, and while masturbating to attempt to work the curl out a little more each time.

I had taken a little massage therapy classes in the past, and I even work on it for an hour or so 3 days of every week in the evening. It was embarrassing for us both in the beginning and I know it still is me being his mother and all, and even more so that he ejaculates every time during the massage. It is really embarrassing for him when some of his ejaculate gets on my hands, but it turned out to make massaging it in the post-ejaculation, semi-soft state really effective because then I can massage it and straighten it. It curls back in my hands and I massage it straight over and over again, until he becomes erect again and semi hard again after ejaculation, three times in a row, usually over a span of an hour to an hour and a half.

It has given good results, as I would say he is 50 percent improved. I continue to treat him 3 days a week.

I am here to ask anyone with information on this condition for advice and/or tips technics on how we can further correct this.

627,"I have a 1 week vacation from college now. And vacations make me very depressed.

1 week vacation means I have 7 days where I can spend 16 hours a day to do whatever I want. And what do I do? Half my time is spent playing Overwatch, a multiplayer game. Most of the time I hate the game and it frustrates me, but I just keep playing it because it's easy mindless fun. Sometimes I even close the game, then start it up again 5 minutes later, because I have nothing else to do. 

The rest of my day I check Reddit 100 times a day in search of something interesting, watch Twitch, or simply lie with my head on my desk while listening music. 

This feels like such an absolute waste of a vacation that it makes my life feel completely worthless. Even when I wake up I think ""what's the point of getting out of bed? what am I even going to do once I get out? Eat breakfast, walk my dogs, and then what???"". Living costs effort. Effort for what? To spend my time playing a game I don't even like? Am I making tons of homework, and will I eventually work a job 8 hours a day, so when I come home I can just lie with my head on my desk and listen to music? What's the point of that? Being dead sounds like it actually has less cons than being alive. And with that thought, making homework is extremely hard. 

I used to like games all my life but not anymore. I've refunded like 20 games in 2 years, and more games I stopped playing after 5 hours. Almost no game seems entertaining to me anymore. Sometimes I'm 10 minutes into a game and my body will already start screaming ""NOOOOO"" with no energy/willpower/motivation left to play. Only Overwatch and Rocket League I can play for hours. 

I used to like anime. I've been a fan of anime since I was a kid. I still watch a few but the thought of sitting still for 20 minutes watching one thing feels like a chore nowadays, and very few shows actually appeal to me. Not just anime but nothing in general seems fun anymore... 

**What I know isn't for me**

Creative skills or projects are not for me, like learning instruments or drawing. The mere thought of something taking months or even years to learn sounds extremely appalling. I have no motivation/ambition for that. I thought ""hey, let's try to make music with FL studio"" a few months ago. 5 minutes into the first tutorial video and I already felt mentally exhausted and gave up. I also hate long term projects. I used to video edit and create music videos in the past. Sometimes I would spend an entire week on one video. I HATED that, a week was already WAY too long for me. 

I'm also a perfectionist. Making games sounds cool to me. But I know that it will take many months of learning, and years of creating, before I'll ever make something truly good that I'll be completely satisfied with. I don't want satisfaction 4 years from now, I want it now.

I'm not interested in sports. They're fun to play a few times but I don't have the ambition to seriously practice them. I have no interest in going to the gym either, I don't care about my looks or health.",18Feb2020,1

Since I graduated from University ( trash University was supposed to be good but it was not, no one accepted me in any other due to a long back story) I have not been able to learn, every time I try the purpose fades slowly, I become uninterested I can't work my brain into understanding the material ""it doesn't matter""....""too much""....""we can't do it""... ""even if we did it's gonna take a really long time""
There is always a sense of security when I listen to my brain and leave my interest.


Life refuses to let me be something,

I found a few things that I had high interest in, enough to get me through most of it so I can understand it, my own way, the way my brain likes it.
Stopped, I can no longer do it I can no longer continue due to circumstances that are out of my hands...wait for it, maybe?
 
I waited sometimes I can go back to doing it but now my brain refuses it.
I waited most times I can't go back to doing it the circumstance is permanent.

I wait for something to happen, I can't do anything, I tried! ( Did I ?) 
I forgot how to learn (really?) 
My brain only does what my brain likes (am I not my own consciousness?) 

I feel lost but not really, this bothers me but not really.

One thing is for sure, I have yet to become something.",18Feb2020,1
635,"Hi all,

I really don't enjoy my job, it's boring, repetitive and every single day we just hit wall after wall (welcome to science).

Basically, after lunch I really struggle to stay alert and motivate myself to do my work. I currently feel like I could just sleep. I've tried coffee but don't want to become dependent and I think it has caused some spots on my face.

I really lack motivation, mostly because it's just constant failures and there is no room for personal development. Plus, the company is struggling for funding so I feel my job is on the end of a thread. I am applying for jobs but haven't heard anything back as of yet which has been quite disheartening.

Please, I am becoming desperate for help!

TLDR: Fatigued and lack energy and motivation at work. Need advice on how to stay focused and alert.",18Feb2020,1
636,"Three years ago, I started dating a man I was absolutely enchanted with. For the year and a half I was with him, I genuinely thought that he could do no wrong and that the aggressions, the yelling, and anger was my fault. It took me years to realize that what he did was abuse. It took me even longer to realize that he me at the beginning of our relationship. My current boyfriend is far more understanding and generally a much better person; in fact, he is the one who helped me make these realizations. 

However, they’ve been in the same group of friends since high school and are still relatively close, and though my current boyfriend doesn’t seek out his company, only his friends, it’s functionally the same thing since if you invite one of them, you’re effectively inviting the whole group. We’ve only been dating for three months and I thought I was fine with this, but the more time has progressed, the more uncomfortable I feel about the situation. Though our current lives are separate enough that there’s an extremely low chance that I would run into my ex because of my boyfriend, it feels like by continuing their friendship as if nothing happened is the equivalent of excusing it. 

The complexity of the issue arises when you consider that nobody knows about this besides myself, my best friend, and my boyfriend. I don’t want to confront him, nor do I desire to completely ruin his life, even if he deserves it. Furthermore, my boyfriend has developed depression because I will, in all likelihood, be leaving the state for college. He currently goes to our state school and has asked me to attend school there, but for personal reasons, I would prefer not to. It’s also the school my ex goes to. 

He says that my ex’s friend group allows him some respite from his depression by providing a distraction, and there are limited alternatives because he has an extremely hard time making human connections (hasn’t made a single new one in two years, only developed the ones he already has; re: dating me) and his other core group of friends are scattered throughout the country (one of them is actually in Italy right now!) though about half are at the same school he is. He also believes that attempting to push away solely my ex will not work and alienate himself from the whole group. Thus, he argues that they are what’s currently keeping him alive and will continue to do so after I potentially leave for college. 

The problems I have with this is that a) it does not excuse the fact that one of the people he is close to is someone who hurt me, b) me leaving for college is, at a minimum, six months away, and even then, I don’t know if I’m leaving at all or even if me leaving would cause a breakup because we’re both willing to attempt long distance, and c) if he has a relatively large social network that he places this much gravity on, then why is my absence so profound especially since we’ve only been dating for three months? 

I honestly don’t know what to do; he’s appalled at my request to attempt some level of isolation from my ex while I feel like that’s a fairly reasonable request. If one of my friends had done something similar to anyone, I would have no hesitation in cutting them off, let alone if they had hurt someone I cared about. It hurts that he’s placing his connection with my ex above what I feel is basic human decency, but I also don't want to infringe on his life too much - I didn't ask him to cut out my ex or take any drastic measures, just see if he can distance himself a little from my ex and see how it goes. I'm at a loss because I want my boyfriend to get the support and help he needs - the last thing I want to do is cut him off from the people who can help him, I just wish that he wasn't getting it from someone who hurt me this badly.

How do I navigate this situation more emotionally intelligently and consider his needs properly without disregarding my own emotions as well? ",18Feb2020,1

646,"I work for a really small company. We have under 20 employees and no HR. I take care of people in a secure home setting and these people have a lot of behavior issues. I’ve been spit at, bit at, head butted, and slapped on a daily bases, I love what I do but it’s not without it’s stresses, and dangers. 

A lot of the residents sun down which means that those of us on Second shift are the ones to deal with the negative behaviors. We often have people run outside or get into agreements so our day is busy. 

I think you have to understand what I do for the next part. So I have this Co worker named A. People tend to be a little scared of A. She isn’t afraid to say she grew up in the ghetto and won’t take anyone’s shit. She is extremely blunt. She works third shift alone which I get is really difficult because I did it over the summer when she abruptly quit but than she did come back so I went back to second. 

So the washer at work broke so that meant that we’re terminally behind on laundry. First shift left us a load of bedding and the washer wasn’t draining so we had to dry everything twice. We do about four loads of laundry, but we were up to five because there was a lot of heavy laundry that needed to be done. I had to dry every load twice because the dryer couldn’t keep up with how wet the laundry was coming out. 

So anyways she put it on our app 

A “How did second shift end up with FIVE loads of laundry that got passed to me? 
Why are there wet clothes in the clean clothing basket and not in the designated hamper and now mixed with dry clothes?
Five loads. Three wet, two dry.
I was told the washer broke. But this is messy and ridiculous guys. 

I'm still doing laundry. There is absolutely no way this is possible. Laundry is a part of each shifts job. Did 1st shift not finish their laundry? I understand if you guys fall behind and leave me like two loads but this is clear that all the laundry was left last minute and then the washer broke. What time did the washer break?
I've worked here three years (minus a few months ) and have never had this much laundry left for me. 
While laundry isn't on top of the priority list, it's still on your list. Now my things arnt done so I can catch this up. And before any one rolls their eyes and shrugs this off.... if this was all left on just you... you'd be just upset as I am. “ 

Other coworker: “ I can’t answer all your questions because I left around 8:30ish. Before I left, I restarted the dryer which in it was a very large load that needed to be split up into two to dry because of how wet it was. The load I restarted was still the first half of that load. It was  laundry and sheets. That washing load was started around the end of the meeting. They tried respinning it to see if that would help. When I left, there was a load in the dryer, and a load waiting to go into the dryer next door. 
When the lodge 1 washer was broken, it took a long time to dry in the dryer, but there was just less laundry over there to be affected as much by it. We do about 4 loads in lodge 2 on 2nd shift, sometimes more, sometimes less. 
It could be a simple fix. Maybe it is just off balance from that first oversized load. 
Sorry there wasn’t a warning that there would be laundry left over. I get it, it does suck. But I don’t think that this one is from lack of trying. “ 


A: “ We've had a billion discussions a out overloading the washer and dryer. At this point in the game we should honestly know better. I was told they were behind on laundry... but that isn't behind.. that's a shit ton of laundry. ""That sucks"" shouldn't even  be said. There are two people here on second shift and it should ha e been ran back and forth until some of it was done. If you left at 830 a d those were the loads, there was 2 and a half more hours that something could have been done and it was not.” 

Again the dryer just couldn’t keep up. 

This isn’t the first time she has called us out on blast. It’s not like we don’t have a million things to do too. I’m sick of feeling like I have to walk on egg shells around her because if things aren’t done 100% to her pleasing and if we don’t do things exactly like she wants them done we are called out on the app in front of everybody. 

I will finish up the month so my boss can go on her vacation but I think my coworkers will think I’m an asshole for quitting because we are super short staffed and people are already working 16 hour days trying to make it all work.

I've been looking at this summer programme abroad for a while now (Oxford Royale Academy) (7000km from where I live) and I recently pitched it to my parents, they were initially on board with it but quickly changed their mind when they saw the price tag. Totally fair, I don't blame them.

651,"Title pretty much says it all.  This person is very smart and is currently in college.  They have one or two friends but not a really strong support group.  They were curious and bought some acid on the dark net, and they tried it for the first time yesterday with their closest friend.  They enjoyed it enough to want to do it again.

I've heard lots of horror stories about people doing acid regularly and losing their minds - becoming paranoid, seeing things, etc.  I'm aware that one time doesn't carry a high risk of causing these symptoms for non-schizophrenics, but it's my understanding that doing acid repeatedly will cause slowly increasing amounts of side effects?  There are no schizophrenics in this person's family medical history, but I am still very concerned about this.  

I don't know much about acid and certainly don't want to hinder this person's journey of self-discovery during their formative years, but the last thing I would want is for them to become permanently injured.

653,"My husband is a hard worker, but every single job he has had since I’ve known him, he’s bitched and complained about. Sometimes he gets so mad complaining about the job, that he yells at me about it.  My brother got him a job with the company he works for now, which is a mechanical and refrigeration job that will pay for him to take all the necessary testing to become certified and it’s still not good enough. The hours are wonky right now and he’s been working overnights, which has really set him off. He keeps threatening to quit, which I know he won’t do because we have a child to take care of, but I can’t take the constant complaining from him. He keeps claiming that he’s not supposed to be doing this kind of work. That there’s something better. I’ve reminded him that he’s said that same thing about EVERY job he’s had. 

Backstory on him. He joined the USMC around 20 and was in for 8 years. In his tenure there, he met his now ex-wife and had two kids which are with her currently.  After he got out of the Marines, he used his GI Bill to go back to school. Right before he was about to start his final semester, his wife at the time, filed for divorce  and he ended up having to get a job to take care of the kids. He still hasn’t finished school. I think may be where a lot of this anger is coming from. Also, I think he regrets leaving the Marines. 

My question for advice is how do I handle this? I’ve tried and tried to reason with him and I know he won’t quit until he has another job lined up, but I’m also worried that this will cause a rift between me and my brother because he’s the one who got him hired.

My Brother asked her out a while ago and they had been texting each other. She told me about this i think to gauge my response and I said that they are adults and whatever they do is none of my business and As long as it didn't effect our relationship then they can do whatever.

They have gone out together for drinks a few times but I have noticed that they are speaking to each other constantly now. I am now the last one to hear about anything, If I tell one of them something they have already heard it from the other etc.

All of this I could get over but speaking to my friend today I suggested a girls night soon and while she said definitely to the girls night, added the caveat, although things are a bit different now, i don't think you need all the details etc.

Basically we had talked about that none of us really wanted to see anyone else or have sex with anyone else, or at least not actively seek it, but if it happens it happens and we are just gonna be honest with each other, and i would be totally fine with it, because its just sex and who cares.

She says she would never be able to just have random one night stands, and if there was any connection with this guy, which she also don't know yet, then she would maybe want to be like seeing him.

In about a year we'll be tested by an external tester, which presumably knows what's right and will crush my classmates' grades.

Until then, the teacher will probably keep insisting on his wrong way in tests and assignments.

Replacing the teacher or complaining to the upper management is not an option (damn immunity).

669,"Hi everyone,

I'll give you a quick run down first.

My grandad, 82, has suffered from knee pain for years now. We have watched as he has went from hobbling around to using a stick and now really struggling. 

After months of nagging (stubborn as an ox), we managed to convince him to make an appointment at the doctors.

The doctors referred to the xray clinic with suspected osteoarthritis and apparently the results showed nothing of the sort. He has a completely health knee.

Is it possible that they've missed something? The pain hes going through is awful, even affecting his sleep sometimes.

We have tried joint pain cream, paracetamol and the lot but it just isnt helping.

I was just wondering if there is anything else it could be that an xray wouldnt pick up? We just want some sort of resolve before it gets to the point where he falls over and injures himself badly.

Thankyou everyone.",18Feb2020,1

681,"I recently moved into a new 1-bedroom apartment. Despite being a bit pricey for the square footage, the new apartment has all the trappings I was looking for, including being located in great area, a washer dryer in unit, central air, good food options across the street, etc. However, the apartment has one MAJOR problem that is making me regret my decision. The unit is attached to the single elevator within the building.


When I was inspecting the apartment, I did notice that the elevator was very close, but I did not notice the elevator noise within the unit for a few reasons. (rookie mistake on my part)


•	When I was touring, the current resident was still there with her TV on.


•	I was only in the unit for 10-15 minutes


•	I was talking to the real estate agent and not paying attention to the outside noise


It was not until the first day after I began moving my stuff into the new apartment that I started to notice an almost constant rumbling emanating from the wall. And once I noticed the noise, I realized how distracting and constant it is. The elevator is old, and the building probably has over 100 people within it. Thus, the elevator is constantly running from the morning to well past midnight and it is driving me crazy. I don’t think I can last a year here.


I inquired about breaking my lease with the property managers and I was told that I would be rent responsible until a new person takes over the lease and I would also have to pay a fee for breaking the lease which would equal a month’s rent (I essentially would not get my deposit back).


I wanted to know my best course of action to avoid paying out of my ass to get out of here. 


Scenario 1: I advertise the apartment now and notify the managers after someone agrees to take the lease. I then find an apartment and move out before new tenant moves in. 
Problem: I don’t know if I am allowed to advertise the apartment without the landowners’ permission. I also feel like I have an obligation to tell anyone interested in moving in about the constant noise. (I wish someone had told me before hand). 


Scenario 2: I find a new place first, then notify the managers after the fact. The managers then advertise the unit. In this scenario, I would be responsible for two rents and my budget cannot afford that for more than 2-3 months. 



Scenario 3: I just deal with it. My parents say I will get used to the noise. I don’t think that I will. The idea of being here a year makes me sick.

**TLDR: I signed a one-year lease for an apartment I desperately want to get out of. I need advice on best way to do so.
Please advise,**

693,"Hello,

For my question I would appreciate honest answers. If you are unsure that's just fine, but I would appreciate an honest truthful response void of any judgement, or any attempts to discourage me in my decision. After years of trying to deny/avoid what I've always felt would be my fate, a few months back I started planning my suicide. I'm just fine with it, honestly there is little fear and there's almost a sense of relief when I think about it. When I happen to be find myself in the middle of conversations where people are discussing events/plans for the future, I often think to myself ""Not going to be around for that"" and feeling happy about that fact. It's actually very surprising to me that I'm even still here. My biggest hang up about my decision though is my mother and finances. I know it will break her heart, and there is some concern about me being indirectly responsible for her death. She's very sickly, although her doctor's say she has a healthy functioning heart,  and is pretty healthy overall, she is often in and out of the hospital for spiking heart rate and blood pressure, and I have witnessed how emotional she can get at the loss of loved one's, to the point where she becomes ill, throwing up, migraines and mailaise, as well as the spiking heart. I am very protective of my mother so of course I struggle with how this will affect her, but at the same time witnessing her decline in health, being someone she is highly dependent on, and the fact that I can guarantee that if she were to pass I'd just kill myself immediately after anyway, makes my choice a little more easier. She doesn't know it but she's the only reason I'm still here, because I've always known how much she needs me, but what's happening is I'm suffering through this existence to help alleviate her own, and I've finally decided it's time I be selfish for once. Either way i look at it my life will end in tragedy, If i don't end it myself someone will, cause I've gotten to the point where I'm so restless and angry about being stuck here, cause I'd be gone now If I could, that I have no issue stepping into the face of a 200 pound man pointing a gun at me. Anyway, it would bring me a little more peace of mind to not have my family spend their own money to bury me, I'm fine with no funeral, but I know my parents will ignore my wishes and do it anyway. I have a little money saved up, but enough to just give me a funeral, I would like to leave them behind with a little more. I've searched the internet but have been unable to find specific answers and I don't know anyone who has dealt with someone who committed suicide while they had life insurance. My plan is to purchase an insurance policy and run out the time on the suicide clause. What I would like to know is will the insurance still not pay out despite this?  I know there may be some back and forth and investigating, but I'd like a percentage of likelihood that the policy will pay out? One of the policies I was looking at was 2 years. I thought i'd give it 4. I'd appreciate not receiving any response strictly attempting to lecture me about how life is worth living, and how it'll get better or it's just Depression and I should speak with someone or try new things and blahhh blahh blahhh. I've heard it all. I'm good. I do want to thank anyone in advance who happens to have helpful information.",18Feb2020,1

696,"So, we hired a guy about a year ago. Let's call him John.

John oversold his skillset when he was hired, but we managed to work around his lack of coding experience. Even so, he has struggled with the job basically since starting. He definitely has some social hang-ups, isn't great at interacting with people (he can come off condescending, sometimes maybe intention, but mostly I think he's just socially unaware).

However, the biggest sin is that when he makes mistakes (which everyone does), he tends to try and cover them up, or pin the blame on others. It's create a scenario in which none of us in his department trust him to help with our work. And really, that's the goal we've been trying to achieve; that if someone is out, anyone else in the team can do their job. Nobody has any confidence in him.

Well, I feel like there's a bit of bad blood between us. In that, I've been pretty stern with him on certain things (especially when he tries putting blame on someone else), and I can just sort of *tell*, he thinks I don't like him. He seems to have some insecurities, because he constantly wonders if people are talking about him (which, to be fair, seems increasingly true; even people who don't work with him have issues with him).

Last week, the President of the company asked me by her office. We were talking about other stuff, but she asked how this guy was working out. I was honest; he is good about certain things, and while he makes mistakes, I think he's tripping himself up more than anything. But I find his instinct to cover up mistakes or blame others to be hugely concerning.

She seemed to indicate that he may not be long for the company, but asked me to personally ""mentor"" him. That, if he doesn't stay with us, she wants him to be able to take something away from his experience here.

I'm... not sure how to handle it. I've been a bit stressed about the prospect over the weekend, to be honest.

Because he thinks I don't like him, or that I'm talking about him to management, I feel like if I talk to him saying ""the president asked me to mentor you"" might come off as a personal dig at him or something.

And really, I don't even know what ""mentorship"" would *look* like; our job is largely repetitive, and aside from pointing out *negatives* (ie. ""you really need to work on your communication skills, and double-check your work, and own-up to your mistakes"").

On the other hand, considering the *president* of the company asked me (even when we have a ""supervisor"" on the team), I wonder if this is an opportunity or test to see if I can handle managing others?

Part of me thought about asking the president or vice president if they might be willing to meet with him first, just that me ""mentoring"" him might come better from one of them? We're coworkers, and I don't think he likes taking advice from us *anyways*. If the word came from upper management, maybe he wouldn't see it something ""I did"".

And I enjoy what I do and I do a damn good job bc I’m slightly ocd/ perfectionist about it. And I’m usually a pretty upbeat kinda person.   I am an early 30s female working around all men which I’ve been doing for 7+ years so I’m not bothered by much and have no problem getting my hands dirty which happens everyday. My boss’ step son works there as well and has a drug problem, as well as another employee, which he’s already been fired for once in the 5-6 months I’ve been there. And hired back. Right before he got fired, I started picking up on the vibe from my boss’ 2nd in command that I wasn’t trust worthy I guess you could say. I’ve never taken anything from anyone at any time the entire time I’ve worked there or anywhere I’ve ever worked for that matter. I’m honestly just not that type of person. I don’t have that kinda mindset. I was raised to treat others how you want to be treated. When the step son got fired everything went back to normal. For a week. Until my boss let him come back. And it’s only escalated since. To the point of My bosses, coworkers, vendors, and even family members that work next door (yes they gotten everyone involved) constantly popping in unexpectedly trying to catch me doing what Idk (like prolly 15-30 times a day when before it wasn’t unexpected and maybe 5 times a day to just check in), waiting til I leave and tearing everything I’ve done apart and putting it back together before I come back the next day, Getting me to run an errand suddenly so they can review my work while I’m gone, putting cameras in the bathroom (very illegal I know but have no intentions on getting them in trouble), going thru my truck and belongings when I’m not around and now they’ve got a spy camera set up but only watching me mind you. YOU CANT CATCH SOMEBODY DOING SOMETHING THEYRE NOT DOING!  The first time I spoke to my boss about the situation, it helped mine and his friendship but only made 2nd in command worse. That was 2-3 weeks ago. It had gotten so bad that I said something again couple days ago bc it was affecting my home life. THE STRESS OF BEING FALSLY ACCUSED IS THE ONLY FUCKING THING IM TAKING HOME WITH ME. And at this point even if I was that kind of person, over my dead body would a take a fuckin thing bc I’ll be damned if I give them the satisfaction of being right. So now no ones allowed to speak to me, my boss and mines friendship is severely strained, every move I make is being watched, videoed, and talked about. For one I don’t like my name being slandered. And I really don’t like the fact it’s hurt my relationship with my boss. I think a lot of him and have a lot of respect for him.  I was going to quit but I have since changed my mind. Why should I be punished for a crime I ain’t committed? I don’t have another job lined up and even if I did, i like where I’m at. Well I did. Now it extremely awkward and tense. They refuse to believe anyone else might be doing it but couple days before the step son got fired, my boss went home and opened his safe which had been cleaned out and guess who had been there twice in one day? You guessed it. The step son. My boss has court for the next couple days so I don’t have to go to work Thank you Jesus! I need advice on how to tread when I do go back. I’m so stressed out. If it gets much worse I’m gonna snap and punch the step son in the face. In my opinion, he’s not a good person.",18Feb2020,1

722,"For context, I come from a house of abuse, escaping my abusive father and going to a women's shelter. It had a max 3 month stay but because I don't have a job and am receiving benefits from the government, I am not earning enough money to qualify to rent from a real estate. My salvation came, being only three days off being removed from the shelter and homeless, in the form of a woman who works at the shelter who said her male friend would be happy to rent my younger sister and I a room until we were able to find ourselves a house.It is a three bedroom house shared by another man, Joe, while the landlord lives in another state. Joe works away at his job and is usually only home on the weekend. Both my sister and I are petrified of men for obvious reasons but putting up with this guy for 2-3 days a week is better than homelessness. Every six months, the landlord comes down to the house for six weeks and stays in the third bedroom. Immediately after meeting him he gave my sister and I bad vibes. He was scary, way scarier than Joe. We mostly hid in our shared bedroom, trying to avoid him but still tried to be really friendly with him when he spoke to us. Today while my mother was visiting for coffee, my small dog who is extremely protective of me against men again for obvious reasons, saw him stomping around the corner when he was moving through the house to collect things from his room and ran up and started barking at the landlord's feet. I grabbed my dog immediately and my dog did not at all try to bite the landlord, only barked at him and jumped up a little. He is only a small dog and was trying to scare him away rather than attack.

The landlord immediately flew into a rage, yelling that if my dog ever ""attacked"" him again that we would be kicked out and that he ""would not be responsible for what happened to the dog"" I immediately began to profusely apologize but he was extremely mad. He entered his room for a few seconds to grab something and then when he emerged it was almost like nothing had happened... He continued to talk to my mother about the question she had asked when he walked into the room. I am so scared of someone who can fly off the rails like that and then just act fine... My mother then went on to explain how my dog isn't vicious and was only trying to protect me since he had gotten scared by the stomping. She tried to lighten everybody's mood by then talking to him about how he used to rescue cats and rehome them, but he made it very clear that he doesn't like dogs.

What can I do? He has literally been here for three days and this is the first and only time my dog has run at him. I am now terrified to leave my room in fear of seeing him and having to talk to him. I can't leave, because I am only paying $100 a week here, otherwise I would be homeless. Is there any way to make myself be not so scared? It has shaken me up so badly that I literally have a panic attack leaving my bedroom even though I know he isn't in the house",18Feb2020,1

I have ""friends"", but I'm always the butt end of every joke. I'm not seen as an equal to any of them. I'm popular to make jokes about, to pick on, to bully, and frankly I'm just excited to leave this life behind and start new in college.

733,"I absolutely shouldn’t have, but her inability to communicate at work has been infuriating. She texted me how she was feeling about a situation at work (on my day off) and I called her out in a responding text message she sent yesterday (rather venomously) about the avoidance behavior she has been acting out. I was feeding off what I had been feeling the last months working with her. It turned into a spat battle over text messages, which I am not proud of, but I do feel slightly better having spoken out against her actions at work. 
I also told her and the other co worker (separately) that we all need to air this out the next time we see each other. 

For some context:
I tried to be a mediator between her and another co worker, and she shut down and refuses to speak to either one of us now. Since she is now treating me with the same silence, and it may be affecting her work performance.

Present day:
Yesterday, the day after her and I worked together, she sent a text to me telling me if we had a problem, she would tell me directly, but has yet to show any gumption (meaning, she only speaks when I ask her questions, and did not tell me that she is having a problem with me, when she obviously is). She claims she already talked to the other co worker, and does not want me to get involved. I would not get involved if her passive aggressiveness didn’t make everyone uncomfortable. 

I should mention that we have no manager, no HR and an owner that is a ghost. There is no one else to ask to help mitigate. People rely on me to be the diplomatic one, and fumigate toxicity.

I am unsure whether or not to escalate the issue further when I see her next, and continue to call out her inability to communicate and express discontent.

Every day he is walking in the door either the minute he should be clocking in or a few after.  I’m worried that he will lose this job too, which he seems to think he is overqualified for, because he simply doesn’t want to be responsible.

737,"I (20M) am a uni student who still lives at his mother's with his younger sisters (15 &amp; 12).
It's all in the title. Every evening when I come back from uni, the moment I get in my bedroom, I just put my bag on the floor and panic.
I don't really know why, all I know is that I feel resentment towards my jacket for just being on my shoulders, my phone for being in my pocket and everything else for hell knows what. The slightest change in my room, the smallest sign that anyone has been into my room while I was not here enrages me. I don't scream, I don't jerk my arms in every direction, I just wrap my head in my hands, breath heavily and sit on my seat while boiling inside. It's usually just about 2 minutes and then I proceed to do whatever I usually do, but it's each and every single evening.
Today, I knew that my father was coming during the day to put some shelves he made for me in my room, no problem. But it's been an hour and a half since I'm home right now and I'm still sort of freaking out, even though I knew there would be some change in my room, because my sister put everything that was on the ground and already existing shelves on the new, bigger shelves and even took the things on my desk to put them on the shelves.
I feel like it might be linked to the presence of my mother in the house, I spent a few months abroad in a house with 5 other students and I never felt this for the whole stay. Even when I'm in her house but she's not there. Where I live we get two school weeks off every holiday, and as a uni student I only get one, the second. My mother and sisters would usually go somewhere for a few days and leave me the house during the first week off. I never feel this when I come back home and I'm alone in the house.
I don't really like my mother. She's really, really invasive and uses the usual ""I'm your mother, I'm doing enough for you so that you can help me once in a while"" type of guilt to make me say what she wants to hear. She would take money from my scholarship to buy crazy amounts of clothes and take us to restaurants, and when I blocked her from my account she nearly kicked me out. My grandparents had to negociate so that I could stay.
If everything goes according to my plan, I'll be out of here in about two years, when I'm out of uni and start working. Any ideas how to cope with this ?

743,"So first a little background. I will call this professor Mr K. He is my German professor, he has been for three years, and I hate him. Every class that he held with us he insulted either one or more of us. Since I attend the school which has many students from small rural areas, in which old residents have odd isolated dialects, Mr K makes fun of the way people talk in those regions. Even if the student has never heard of a certain word he would make fun of them. He suffers from serious favouritism. Multiple times when we had two periods in a day he would hold both of them. Nothin unusual right? Well, when another class had a double period he let them go free. From both periods. In my class, he favourites one of my old friends who I will call Hannah. Hannah was the student of the generation in secondary school, and she continues to have amazing grades to this day. She is completely safe. If she doesn't know something he would let it slide. But when I or a few others don't know something he would give us an F without batting an eye. He would insult us, tell us what our goals are ""Unavailable for our level of intellect"". He thinks that he is always right even when he is clearly not. He asked my friend about who was with is a car, she was with her boyfriend. He was driving her home. And so many other things that make my blood boil.

I am dyslexic, I wrote this post with Grammarly, and I have great trouble with reading and writing. Not only in German but English and my first language, which is phonetically consistent. I told all of my professors about the condition when I came to school for the first time. But he doesn't care. All of my professors do admit that it's hard to read some of my work, but they look past it. Me K on the other hand, he makes fun of me for it. We had a dictation today. I didn't attend the first time because I was out of class for a reason. And no we don't know when there's a dictation. He told my class that I would answer questions about a text to make it up. I was happy about it because I do much better at speaking than writing. I prepared the texts and all that, but today he called me in to write the dictation with another class. I obviously failed. He corrected it when I left the classroom in front of another class. Then he read my mistakes out loud. My friend told me everything about it and I'm pretty pissed.

I want to get him back, not only for what he did to me but to all of my classmates. I found a way to do it. I applied for a festival in theatrical arts. I wrote a couple of plays for the school which Mr K never commented on even though they were talked about all around the city. One of my play was also on the news. Now I am writing about a woman going through the afterlife. She has to go through international where her body betrays her is she lies. And other things like measuring the mass of her good and evil deeds. I want to attribute Mr K's actions to her and take him to trial. I would list out all the things that he did and confront the character in the play about then with three other Angeles. I then want to send that character to hell.

754,This is with ford credit. I have a 3 year lease on an suv. The website wasnt working for the last couple months and I didnt pay for 2 months. I got a phone call saying that what I owed and given a number to pay by phone. I screwed up and never wrote down confirmation number and just left it at that thinking everything was good. Today my car was repossessed. I checked my bank account and the money was never sent. The company is saying since it is the last 3 months on lease that it wont go on my credit report as a repossession. Im confused because they are saying I cant pay off what is owed and pay impound fee and get my car back since it is near the end of the lease. Lease ends march 11. Im confused because they said all i am responsible for is the amount owed plus impound fee and any wear and tear. I will get a bill after it is inspected and auctioned off. He said I wont owe thousands and it doesnt matter what the amount they auction it off for. What im asking is it true that I wont be able to get car back and also if im gonna be screwed by them auctioning it off,18Feb2020,1

My best friend lives in another country. We've known each other for years and it's been amazing. So we were talking about something and he said he'd do something to which i replied ""what can I do to make you not do that?"" we were both joking and it was nice

So he said ""it's a secret"". After a lot of bugging and begging, he finally gave me a clue to the secret. It's :

\-red ribbon

\-meteorite

\-far away

We've talked about going camping and watching stars. So maybe that's related to the ""meteorite"" part haha but i'm not sure

756,"I’ve just started an online talk show and could really use some honest opinions. I’ve got no audience so it’s hard to know whether there’s any potential or not. Hit me with your honesty!

757,"My parents are really set on me going to Geneva college, but I’ve been there and it makes me feel uncomfortable with how strict it is. You have to go to church on campus and if you don’t, you have to pay. There’s visiting hours for boys in the dorms, and the door has to be open. I’m sure there’s more rules. But it makes me feel uncomfortable.

But I’m still seriously considering it because my dad said he will help pay a lot more for Geneva than other colleges. It’s a lot of money and a lot of debt I could save myself from. He would pay for me to live on campus. He even said he would work a couple more years before he retires to help pay. I also got into the honors program there and that’s a good bonus to it. 

If I don’t go there I might go to a local college but I’d be stuck commuting. And my parents are about just as strict. They won’t accept any secular school because they don’t agree with the teachings and beliefs. My family makes enough that we get little to no financial aid, but my parents come from poor backgrounds and refuse to spend money on the more expensive colleges. 

It makes me feel stuck and forced to go to Geneva because I feel pressure from my parents. And maybe I’ll just suck it up and take the money. But the atmosphere of the place makes me feel like I won’t be able to have fun. Or do things that I want. 

I’m not a big party person, but having so many restrictions on me makes me feel like I’m being watched. So if there’s a way around that, then I wouldn’t mind going. I don’t believe they have a curfew, but I could be wrong. I just don’t want to feel trapped there. 

Is the money worth it? Should I just go to Geneva and then live my life how I want afterwards?

I literally obsess over the past I try to remember everything since I was 10 (I’m 19 now).

I have been working since I was 15 and at least in high school I had a thriving social life, while smoking pot. 

My memory is hazy which bothers me because I used to be a pretty “sharp” kid. Now I’m in my 2nd year out of high school and wasting this year as well. I don’t even work anymore because I literally lost all motivation to do anything even hangout with my friends. 

I recently got sober and plan to stay sober. I can’t help to think I wasted so much time doing all the wrong things. I try to remember the past because my present is shitty.

765,"Hi, I'm new to this community but I'm seeking advice.

So I live in New York and I grew up here but since becoming an adult, I had my siblings move out to San Diego and my father passed away a few years ago, my mother also moved to Penn State. With all of this being said, I'm pretty much on my own in the state of NY. I mean I have a few friends but most of the people I know are from other parts of NY since I met them in college. Now that I'm done with college, I kinda have been contemplating moving west with the rest of my family and I believe that my mother will join me in the move. 

I also met this girl not long ago (from college) and she wants to move to the city that I live in from her city (also in NY) she has a year left of school. so do you think I should give it some time to see if things between her and I pick up or should I do what makes me happy and move out west? Or should I wait for her and in the meantime save money in case I do decide to move out there and I'm not able to find a job right away. 

Should I continue to job search in my city for some experience and finish my master's degree before I move out there or should I go to school out there since I'm going to end up paying out of pocket for it anyway?

Also, I'm a bit nervous about making such a large move like that, because I'm afraid of not being able to find a job (in my career), but I'm also an experienced casino dealer so I could also do that in the meantime, but I don't want to spend a career in the casino industry. I love it, but it's just not what I went to school for but it's nice to have that option.

But then she said she doesn’t believe I actually want to be a bookseller anyway and I just want to be one because I don’t know what I really want to be and assumed I just do two years of gap year (instead of one I’d do anyways) to see what I want to become.

A couple weeks ago he wanted to go to the library and we had planned on this specific day, but he ended up with a stomach bug and could’ve leave the bathroom, I went anyway because I had to renew my books and he asked that I check out a few for him, since he wasn’t present I used my library card to check them out for him. Since I wasn’t checking out any books myself the little slip of paper with the due date was put inside one of his books, I don’t remember which one. Over the course of the next few weeks I kept asking him to look for that slip to see when they were due, he kept putting it off until finally he said he couldn’t find it and asked me to check online for the due date. I then honestly forgot about it for a few days until today when I called the library to find out our books were 4 days overdue, no big deal. So I told my boyfriend and he said “so who’s going to pay the fee?” I said “I will pay the fee for my books and you can pay the fee for yours”. He doesn’t think that’s right, he thinks because I didn’t check online when he told me to I should have to pay the fee for all books, I think we should each be responsible for our own books. Mind you through out these couple weeks he didn’t ask me once to check when they were due, besides all the times I asked him to look for the slip.

780,"Basically when i was younger i was the skinny nerdy looking kid. I used to starve myself as a form of hurting myself and i thought i was the most unattractive thing there was. When i got older puberty hit me pretty hard and i started to do everything i could to man up like my dad and brothers, i started training MMA and getting involved with dangerous circles and doing questionable things on the streets just so i could shake my former image. I started my own business ventures and business acquisition company simply because i thought it was manly and modelled my business life after tommy shelby from peaky blinders as he is the masculine fictional character i look up to. I have found success but at the cost of putting on a false hard as nails persona at networking events and meeting with accountants, lawyers entrepreneurs etc trying to hide my crippling anxiety that people are looking at me like im weak or then can use me etc. I think everyones out to get me and i need to be a brick fucking wall and calculated like my dad would be and my other role models etc which has given me success but its not me and it seems to make my anxiety worse on whether i am acting tough enough.

More importantly my love life is all over the place, to start with anytime i talk with a girl sober i think i am still this unnatractive weak little pussy when i was younger and i get really self concious. For example towards the end of school there would be girls in my year who had spread round that they liked me etc however i could never get with anyone that knew me when i was younger as i would think back to them seeing me the way i was back then so i would push everyone off. Now i have left school i find it much easier getting with random girls i don't know but i still never really initiate things at all since i still have that self image distortion when i think no girl would want me to initiate anything with them so i never pursue anything except when a girl pursues me. Which i assume is narrowing down the amount of people i could be getting with. But anytime i have hooked up with a girl i really liked and then we say we will meet up when sober etc i get the self image perception thing thinking she only got with me cause she was drunk and in real life she wont like me much at all so i always cancel and push off these girls as well cause i dont want to get hurt or be awkward and make my self image problem worse.

I feel like i have dug myself in a big ol self esteem and worth hole that i cant get out of and only compensate for by doing what i perceive as the opposite of what i used to be by being the strong and silent solemn type but when i am drunk my true self comes through where i am pretty extroverted and would like to think funny.

Its like everytime i feel threatened or vulnerable for people perceiving me as weak or what i used to be i harden up and push girls away like as if wanting nothing to do with them after i have slept with them is the manly thing to do even thought i have let some fantastic girls slip away thinking im a fuckboy or a dick when i really genuinely liked them and it makes me feel terrible knowing i will never get another chance with them. From time to time i would go on tinder and get talking to a girl but before we would meet up i would look through my pictures and just see who i used to be there and then delete the photos and the app for fear of people seeing it and seeing me as who i was. Same thing with photos actually i hate my photo being taken for anything and all my social media accounts are empty because im too self concious to put anything up because i know i will look at it and then feel shitty for the next hour or two, but i play it off saying yeah i dont use social media its shit etc to make it more manly than it is cause thats the only way i know how to deal with this.

785,"Me and four guys live at a house in the suburbs (super near my work) owned by one of their parent's.  My lease is until October.  The verbiage is very clear that my rent is how much only I owe for one room (not how much we owe for the place) and there is no option to terminate the lease by the landlord (I have read the lease). Two of them are leaving in May because they just graduated college.  Weeks ago, another of the roommates got wind of this and confronted my friend who basically told him his parents are terminating the lease in May.  The first I heard of this was when he was walking to out the door to move back home (LLASY NIGHT) because he was pissed.  My roommate still hasn't told me this is happening. I feel backstabbed and blindsided. I'm going to talk to him about it tonight. Though it's pretty clear from my conversation with the departing roommate that my friend has already made his decision (he could've easily tried to find two replacements for the departing roommates we know tons of people, but he choose instead to run the other guy out at first chance).

I'm not happy about how this went down (behind my back), but I'm not devastated, because I was planning to move in with my parents at the end of the lease (October) because they need financial help very badly.  I really did want to live where I'm at through the end of the lease though, because it's right by my work and gives me more time and logistics to socialize, exercise, and study (for professional certificates). I figured that in the months until October I could make strides in those 3 areas that would make my life easier when I move home.  I also thought it would lead to a hella fun summer.

So I guess that leaves me some options;

Option A: I see it through until May, continue to make my payments, forgive my friend and move on.

Option B: I tell my friend I'm very disappointed in him planning all this behind my back and I can't continue to live with him.  I move out before I have to pay my March rent.

Option C: I demand monetary compensation to release my stake in the lease (free March-May rent) and I use that money to help my family rather than people who were going to kick me out without telling me.

Option D: I continue living there through the Summer and making my rent payments.  I force them to take legal action if they want me to move.  I have my fun Summer alone in a big house!

Other ideas? Advice?  I'm leaning Option A tbh but I really want to make it clear to my friend how betrayed I feel.  Thanks in advance!  I know I may sound a bit petty here, but that's why I'm asking, because I've always struggled with finding proportional responses to people wronging me.

791,"Dear community of r/advice,

Im a german 10th grader, currently preparing to undertake the MSA, something akin to a final graduation exam to get to highschool. 

The issue im running into is with my presentation, which is due in exactly 4 Weeks time and is already done 90-95%.

I have already finished the PowerPoint and made Notes for the presentation. The only thing I have yet to complete was the *Exposé*, a little word document that explains your PowerPoint further. 

Here is where the problem begins: My father. As I've already mentioned, I finished the lions share of my work during my Holidays, working 3-4 Hours a day, basically depriving myself of any free time. I already told him what I did, yet the only thing he says is how lazy and incompetent I am. Again. And again. All the time. I took one week off of working on the PowerPoint, as I wrote 2 Exams during the week and had to divert my effort to them.

After studying for them, I said I was done with Homework and started relaxing. Mind you, I came home at 4 pm and worked until 6 pm for the exams. Then, out of nowhere, 15 Minutes into me starting to watch some videos on YouTube, my father bursts into my room and screams at me. I was being too lazy and not taking school seriously. 

On Friday, I usually go to my rowing practice, since I need to walk on foot (because for some reason he doesn't want to take me by car due to him wanting to relax) I have to walk an hour there, as opposed to the 15 Minutes a car ride would take. 3 Hours later, now having come home at 7 pm., I want to relax. You can guess what happened, right? Endless screaming on how lazy I was.... 

I played games for 15 Minutes, he ran into my room, turned of my PC mid game and screamed at me. 

I can't deal with it anymore. It is breaking me. No matter how much effort I put in, I always get told I don't take it all seriously. How can I cope? Thanks in advance.",18Feb2020,1
792,"Hello! 

I (F18), am thinking of moving out beginning of next year. My parents aren’t the best so ideally I’d want to move to the city (far enough away from them). I’m a college student and I already work part time but I know that I’ll have to step up my work game. Does anyone have good advice on budgeting, what I should look for apt wise, what is an ideal rent price, things I need to buy new versus second hand shops etc.? 

Thanks so much!!",18Feb2020,1
793,"One of my closest friends moved away when I was 7 because her brother burnt their house down being stupid with a lighter. I’ve not spoken to her since she’s moved (ten years) and recently found her account on Instagram. We’ve got no mutual followers and found her by simply searching her name.

I just don't know what's wrong, it's the same with relationships although I am less thrilled about that then friends. I don't know if it's me who's wrong or if I am just not meant to have friends or future partner. 

Could anyone give some advice? I'm unsure on what I am doing or what to do. I would appreciate any type of advice. Thanks",18Feb2020,1
795,"Hi all my friend of 10 years has gone radio silence for almost a year after telling me she is harassed at work by an older man. Ive tried to contact her repeatedly just to ask if she is ok or she needs help to no avail. Im getting conscious there is a fine line between concernes friens and pest.

Long story short,  I [30M] have this friend from uni [31F]. We've been friends for 10 years and have hooked up a couple of times (just for full disclosure).

Although she was always prone to being a aolitary figure and had periods of silence, her long spell has me worried. She works at an NGO for the fair treatment of prisoners of a particular religious group.

Last time we saw each other, being drunk she confessed she is harassed by a man there, who repeatedly makes sexually aggressive moves towards her. She won't speak about it because he is very important to her organization.

Shortly after that, our usual cheerful banter and online discussions were cut short. Radio silence. Ive called and sent messages multiple times, from different numbers and asked female friends to call just to ask if she is alright.

I tried going to her house on a Sunday morning to check up on her but she wasnt there.

797,"I made a mistake of prioritising my relationship with a boy over having real relationships with my friends, myself and my religion. I was so attached to one person that I didn’t feel the need to develop new relationships with new people especially in school, and because of that, I felt as if I cannot connect with anybody. That problem led to me not having any close friends or friends that I could depend on so I depended greatly on that boy. After I’ve lost that relationship, I realised how little friends I have in my life and how uncomfortable I felt when opening up to them. I tried to talk to them about my issues but I couldn’t let my entire feelings out because I feared to feel vulnerable or judged. I hated sympathy but longed for acknowledgement and approval. Now that I’ve lost that relationship, and a few more, I started to think that I’m incapable of sustaining relationships. I started to think that my personality is underlining problem of why friends avoid me and I couldn’t help myself improve. Today, I tried to talk to friends which I’m less close to instead because I just wanted somebody to talk to about my feelings of emptiness but I felt anxious, uncomfortable and stupid again for opening up and becoming vulnerable.

806,"To begin with, I broke up with my boyfriend of almost 2 years a year back. A lot has happened since then. To begin with, he cleared this super difficult exam to get into a prestigious job and became the talk of the town immediately. Bad news for me because his intense focus on himself and this exam was one of the reasons we broke up.  He was so into it that our relationship suffered severe setbacks - a breakdown of communication, little time to meet and almost no talking on the phone for months at a time. There were other issues like him just wanting to make out or have sex instead of talking whenever he could squeeze in some time to meet me. 
Long story short, we have parted ways since then. I moved back home with my parents and he's doing really really well in life and gaining much popularity in his field of work. Now the difficult part about this is that I'm preparing for the same exam now and I can't tackle it without constantly being reminded of some aspect of his preparation or his success in life. I feel I'm not good enough compared to him and that he's going to have a good laugh when he sees me fail in life when he's doing so well. My self esteem and peace of mind have touched rock bottom.  
How do I detach myself from all of this and focus more on my own self improvement? Any tips from experienced peeps?",18Feb2020,1
808,"Before I start this: I know that the blame here is fully on the guy who committed himself to a relationship and is breaching that commitment. I know my friend technically has no responsibility for “ruining” the relationship, as it was the person in the relationship who chose to do that. 

So, my friend and I are both in college in our early 20’s (F). She has a record of doing this, and both of the other times I just tried to see it from her side and didn’t have too much of a problem with it personally. 

But it’s happening AGAIN and this time, I know the relationship has been occurring for a while now, and it also seems by the way he texts her and gets all anxious about how to “sneak out” and stuff, that this might be the first time he’s cheating on his girlfriend. 

I have personally been cheated on and it absolutely destroyed me, and affected me permanently in many ways. I felt so much disgust and hurt towards the other girl in my situation, even though it was my ex’s fault ultimately it just made me sick that she knew about me and kept doing it anyways. 

It really makes me question my friend’s morals and the fact that it doesn’t seem to bother her that she’s potentially hurting another girl very badly, and she actually seems proud of herself for it. 

I know it’s not my life and I shouldn’t be passing judgement on someone else, but it’s just really affecting the way I see my friend and it’s making me build up a resentment towards her. I hate when she mentions it to me or shows me what he’s texting her like it’s something she or I should be proud of. I tried to bring it up to her the other day, and I said “I know it’s (the guy)‘s decision at the end of the day, but I just don’t support it and I think it’s really wrong of you” and she just kind of brushed it off. 

I don’t want to ruin our friendship over something that shouldn’t even be my business, but as someone whose been in the other girl’s position, it just makes me really angry at my friend.",18Feb2020,1
810,"First a little backstory:

I started at this company in 2014 when I had no actual job and had to work in telemarketing. This job kind of saved me from that. 

I briefly quit in 2017 to work for one of its competitors, hoping I’d be able to elevate my skills. That company was not right for me and I went back to my previous (current) employer. The job was and still is easy and has no real challenge anymore, but the coworkers are fun, and the boss is very laidback and understanding of personal life and issues.

Here’s the problem. I don’t make a LOT of money, so I asked for a raise in October. I was scheduled to get a raise in January. They couldn’t give me a raise because ‘I would get one in January’.

I got a raise this past January, but it’s way less than what I asked for. Not even a fifth. Since then, I’ve felt very unmotivated. There are days that I barely do any work, or when there are any setbacks, I feel like I should go home. I have talked about this with coworkers, who pretty much all feel the same way.

The company lacks clear direction, management is weird and frustrating sometimes which doesn’t help.

I have started my own business recently, but until that can support me and my family, I have to survive this.

I can’t talk to my boss about it, I have tried on several occasions. There are no other opportunities for me and the pay won’t increase.

Any advice on how I can just suck it up? Thanks!",18Feb2020,1
811,"Last night I was with my best friend sleeping over. We switched phones to look at something we were showing each other and a weird feeling came over me telling me to check her messages to see if she was being shady. I usually wouldn’t do something like that but my gut told me to. I typed in my name in messages. Boom. A fuck ton of text threads between her and my other best friend. Calling me ugly, making fun of my sex life, screenshotting photos of me making fun of me, calling me a whore, etc. literally just being blatantly mean and vicious. I have been sisters to these girls for 7+ years. I just couldn’t believe it. So I confronted them and they turned it around on me for looking through the messages and didn’t even apologize once. I know that reading them was an invasion of privacy but , if I didn’t I would be friends with two fake bitches. They still have not apologized once and one of the girls never even responded to me.",18Feb2020,1
812,"I started having feelings for my best friend and I’m not sure what to do. There are things that make me think he might feel the same way and things that make me feel like he doesn’t.

Me and this dude have known each other for 7 years, but we didn’t become better friends until about 6 months ago. Around the time we started hanging out a lot, he was going through a rough time and I was trying to be the best friend I could. Ever since then he hugs me a lot and tells me he loves me all the time. I didn’t read into it much at first because some guys are straight but just kind of affectionate with their friends. But there were other things.

The way he hugs me is the first thing. He holds me tight and close. Sometimes hugs me with his hands around my waist instead of my upper body. And sometimes he doesn’t want to break the hug for 2 minutes or more. He also sometimes puts his hand on my thigh if we’re sitting close and not around other people. He has kissed me on my cheek and forehead while hugging before.

Also, I’ve seen him playfully flirt with girls and certain things he does/says to flirt with them I’ve noticed he does with me too. Another thing he does that seems flirty is I catch him looking at me sometimes and he makes a funny face when I catch him lol.

It’s starting to get difficult because aside from the emotional feelings I’m starting to get for him I’ve never been more physically attracted to a guy than him. And he is a very sexually charged person. There are 2 different girls that he’s not dating but has sex with regularly, and he’s very open with me about his sex life. Sometimes while we’re hanging out he’ll call one of the girls on FaceTime and make her think he’s not with anybody and he’ll gear the conversation so she talks about how big his d*** is and how good he is in bed. And while she’s talking about this he always glances at me to see if I’m paying attention and nudges me with his elbow or leg.

There are a few things too that make me think he would never in a million years be into a guy. First thing is how woman-crazy he is. That alone doesn’t make it impossible for him to be into a guy, because I definitely have my woman-crazy phases too, but he has made some homophobic jokes (which is one reason I’m scared to lose him if he does find out about me - even though he does have a couple gay/bi friends, but they’re not as close as me so I don’t know how he would react)

It’s just starting to bother me because I’m really getting strong feelings for him and getting more attracted to him physically and I don’t know how to deal with it. I feel like at some point after some time I might be able to tell him I’m bisexual, but after a good amount of time. But I’m not sure if I could handle telling him how I feel about him, I don’t want him to distance himself.

I honestly thought about just cutting off ties but it would hurt me and him both, plus would be awkward because we have a lot of the same friends too. But I also don’t want to keep wanting him so bad that it hurts. Any suggestions on what I could do?",18Feb2020,1

(I also sincerely apologize for my grammatical errors and run on sentences) 
Okay to start, I currently work at Cracker Barrel and I make about $10.25 an hour. Now I like my job and everything, I mean you get the occasional ass that comes in and ruins a bit of your day and such but that’s about the only thing wrong with the job in its own entity. However there’s this manager, I’ll call him Manager 1. He’s the GM, the real big guy (yk atleast below regional management, but they’re never there). At first he was super nice, but as I moved away from being a newbie it took a turn for the worst. For example, to save money they’ve been cutting corners and cutting hours. Which means that we’re running with as minimal servers as possible. Add the fact that you have 2 new servers who can only have a few tables a piece and you’re essentially screwed. Now being a Host, that means that if we’re getting packed and you’re having to double and triple seat servers, you need to start trying to get drink orders and cleaning of tables yourself or else everything is gonna go to shit. Now I was getting to the point where I was having to even quadruple seat because people were coming in so fast... and then a line forms. I’m by myself, doin whatever I can to make sure i’m doing my absolute, which is getting tables sat. At this point i had atleast gotten a few tables cleaned off so I went to go take care of the line. So yk i’m seating and doing what I do and I get back up to the host stand and there was a group of 4 that wanted to be sat. I smiled and said “Hello! How many today?” and then sat them after they told me how many. At about 2?? It finally died down a little bit and I was still workin and moving trying to get everything cleaned up and get out any food left in the windows from the rush. I then got called in the office and was told that I had been complained on and that I had rudely asked a table “how many?” with no formalities what so ever by Manager 1 and was told that if i got one more complaint that I was fired. I have only gotten one complaint before and that was because I informed someone that they weren’t allowed to take in items from the store while they were eating. Every other manager i have says that I do a great job and I handle everything super well and my servers tell my things like that as well. But if the GM  thinks i suck then im not too sure that matters. Out of spite, I applied for Ingles (A grocery store, for those not familiar) after being pulled into the office and they interviewed me the next day and are offering me $10.50 an hour to work in their deli. To put a long story short i’m just wondering if i should just go work at Ingles instead. I mean I know that there’s always gonna be someone at every job that doesn’t like me and will scrutinize almost everything I do, but i just clash with manager 1 so so so bad that it ruins every other good thing at Cracker Barrel.  I would rather not have to be on edge at every given moment that i’m going to be fired. Can i get some advice?",18Feb2020,1

So me(23male and married) live in a house with my wife, brother and mother. My father died like 7-8 years ago and thats when things fell apart for me and my family. He was taking caring for all of us and loved us all and gave us all hope and motivation in life, but he died a sudden death and thats when i realized, things are not going to be the same anymore. 

Since then i had basically be my own father and son, i had to take care of my mother and the house, and from early on taking care of every bill every letter and everything around the house, and yeah about my 2 brothers... they were not helping at all.
My eldest brother is a piece of trash, not caring at all for anything or anyone, he just lives here, i dont see him that often, and he basically let me do all stuff alone without helping me in any regard, he only drinks, sleeps, eats and shit here. My second brother doesnt live with us he moved out from our country and enjoys his live at his best.

Now about my wife, she is the best person in the world and since she came in my life i felt happiness again, i felt love and still do, she is not the problem.

So now lets talk about the problem... my ""mother""(if i can call her my mother). Ok, she is biologically my mother, but i never felt a ""mother-son-bond"" with her. Even when my father was alive i almost never talked to her except what i needed to talk. Since i was a baby, she fell ill and was in coma for several months, she woked up eventually. My father took care of me all the time and thats why i felt more close to him, but yeah after he died i had to take care of her.

My mother is like, the fricking worst person on earth, seriously, my wife is still schocked after 2 years how can someone be like this? She basically does not care at all for anyone except herself, not even for me, and im her 'slave' basically for 7 years. I dont feel at home when she is around, and she is always because she cannot walk alone without a support person. You cannot talk with her because she does not listen at all, you cannot talk against her because she is attacked by anything and she is always the best person in the world, you cant disagree with her because she will yell and cry and curse you (because you disrespect her), thats why i stopped talking to her, i only talk to her when i need to.

When she is around i dont feel like home, i feel like some stranger is present because i always have to watch for what i am talking, and sometimes does not talk at all because of her, i dont imagine being ""home"" should feel like this, lets also mention how she treats my wife.

She treats her like a slave i can only say this so you can imagine. 

My wife always tells me ""i dont feel home because of her"" and i do the same but i didnt tell her anything. She never lets us have fun, do something by ourselves, she always wants to be with us because she is bored at home alone not because she loves us, she has so much money she cant even count but never gives us anything, she even always asks for money when i get my loan. We dont have a life with my wife because of her, i want to move out with my wife and live on my own, but on the other hand (i really want this feeling to be gone of me) i feel sorry for them, at the end she is my mother and my brother... i dont love them, but i somehow care... can i somehow stop this feeling? I just want to move out and just dont care about them what will happen, but i cant.

826,"Hello. I've never posted anything on reddit ever, but I'm in desperate need of advice rn. 

So my mom and my dad have been in an ""open"" relationship for a while. It all started when they went back to Chile (that's where my mom is from and also where they met) for a few weeks. I don't know the full story, but basically my mom gave my dad permission to go meetup with a lady he used to date. at the time my mom had a crush on some guy from the office so this kinda cleansed her conscience aswell. It was all good.

A few weeks ago my mom suddenly declared that she's going to spain to meet one of her friends. She asks if we are okay with it and we reluctantly answer that yes, she can go do whatever she wants. I already knew that she had more than platonic feelings for this ""friend"" because we're close and she often asks me for advice. This whole thing actually made me very uncomfortable. I would often tell her that it was none of my business as long as she didn't take her friendships too far. A part of me was hurt that she felt it necessary to go outside of the family for comfort, love and attention.

Appearantly she has taken it too far. She's all smiles these days but my dad has been looking gloomy for awhile. He's always tired and he's always telling me he loves me a lot. My dad and I are both the kind of people that feel deeply, but my dad isn't very good at vocalising these kinds of things. He's a real scandinavian when it comes to talking about emotions. Today was the first time I saw him cry. He held me close and told me that he wanted to leave this place and live somewhere else. He loves this place. I told him he can't leave,, if anything she should be the one leaving. It lasted for no more than a few seconds. He just apologised and went to do the laundry. For the rest of the evening he acted like nothing happened.

My dad is afraid of rejection. He had a very traumatic childhood and had to go to therapy for it. He has no one else to go to. He's got no friends. Out of the two, I'm especially close to him. He often holds me through my panic attacks (I have severe anxiety and suffer with depression). He's the most special person in my life and I love him more than anything. 

I don't know what to do. I'm trying my best not to antagonise my mother. Everything is really difficult right now.

829,"About 2 years ago I became extremely suicidal. I was about 19 years old. My trigger was my car. Everytime I would drive I would just want to drive fast into something and die. The suicidal feeling would go within seconds tho. 

I went to a lot of therapists. Went to an outpatient program as well. They always asked “what’s you’re motivation”. Or what’s keeping you alive basically. I always said my dog. And that was it. I got my dog when I started to get depressed. 

Well about 4 months ago my dog passed. It was and is the worst thing. But I got through it. Of course I still miss him. 

I have social anxiety and depression. It’s very extreme. I also work. And with the social anxiety, that is super difficult. I’m a daycare teacher, I love it but honestly it’s really not worth only $11. I can’t afford to move out or anything. 

While at work I just snapped. I came to realize how shitty my life is. I want to die again. I really can’t push myself anymore. I wish I could be happy. But I’ve never felt happiness in my life.",18Feb2020,1
830,"I recently went on a date with a guy I met on Bumble. I’m from a city about an hour away and was staying at a friend’s house in the city he lives in. I took a Lyft to the restaurant and met him there. He asked for my phone number before the date was over (we kept all communication on the app before we met). He opened doors for me, dropped me off at my friend’s house, kissed me for about 10 minutes, and then he texted me literally two minutes after he dropped me off to make sure I got inside okay (he watched me go in my friend’s house, so he knew I got in okay). He also texted me the next night to make sure I made it back to my city okay. He did ask me the next time I’d be in his city, but I said I didn’t know (because I don’t). No plans of a second date were made, and I’m guessing that’s because of the hour difference between us. I do like him, though. Does it sound like he’s interested to you guys? Should I text him next time I’m there? 

I’m only 24 and I’ve been in a LTR for a few years and I haven’t dated much. The main reason I ask this is because one of my friends told me it made me seem like I wasn’t interested because I told him I didn’t know when I would be back to his city. She said that was essentially him putting the ball in my court - is this true? That really wasn’t the case - I truly don’t know when I’ll be back. Thanks for your input!",18Feb2020,1

834,"I’m 18, have no source of stable income, and my mom is putting our house up for sale in the next week to move across the country to go back where were from. But in July I’m supposed to move across the current state I live in with my fiancée so he can continue college. 

I’m just at a total loss because lately I’ve been having awful feelings about wanting to go back home but knew they were unrealistic because of my friends and relationships I’ve made in my town. My fiancée goes to college here currently but still lives with his parents to save money while he can. 

Having feelings of worthlessness due to my unemployed status has really brought down my mental health. Ive gone to stores and gas stations and fast food shops and anywhere I can to try to get a job, but in the middle of winter in an oilfield town, there’s not much going on when it comes to hiring. 

I’ve been told by multiple people I’ve done all I can do because I’ve handed out resumes, called places, gone to speak with them in person, and no one is calling back. I’ve resorted to selling some of my belongings to make money and trying to make macrame wall hangings out of yarn to sell to friends. (If anyone is interested, message me and I can show you what I’ve done so far)

 I am afraid I will be abandoned once our house sells because my mom said she would “figure out what to do with me,” meaning I more than likely won’t be moving with her. 

I just feel so scattered between not having a job, being forced out of my house, and my friends not exactly being there for me in this situation. I’m not expecting people to gush and offer money or anything, but once I start talking about my situation they just get uncomfortable and change the topic. 

I’d like some advice on what to do, if there really is anything I can do right now, because I’m really struggling mentally and emotionally with all of this new information. And there’s also no way for me to get a job out of town because the closest town with anything is 2 hours away.",18Feb2020,1

Due to my aspergers, I have difficulty expressing my urgency or politely refusing people's invitations to hang out.

837,"This is an intricate and long story, but I will try to keep it short. TLDR below.

A number of years ago now, I (a closeted gay guy) met another guy at school (straight), and we quickly became very close friends (and now among our best friends to each other). Over the years though, even at the beginning, I started to really fall in love for him. I think this because I could not stop thinking about what he's doing, how much I like talking to him and even how attractive he is to me. I knew he is straight all these years, because he sees girls and shows no interest in guys. But even through that, I just can't get it past me and move on from loving him.

I moved in with him and a few roommates a couple years ago. I had my doubts of doing this because it would make us be closer in proximity at all times, and my attraction toward him will just overtake my emotions. I still moved in though, and since then it's been so hard to get over him and move on. I can't be attracted to anyone else anymore, emotionally or even physically, because I've become so obsessed or even addicted to my friend. Nothing else compares to him, in my head. I feel like I'm crazy.

I went to therapy before and I was recommended I should think about moving out. My friends who I have talked about this before also thought that would be a good idea. But I also hate the thought of moving away, it's like breaking our close friendship apart. Mostly that's because I feel that in order to get over him, I really have to cut off *all* contact with him. The thought of breaking our friendship apart for this just terrifies me and makes me incredibly depressed, since I don't have any other friend like him. He doesn't deserve to go through this because I decided to fall in love with him, and continue to feel this way even after trying to stop those feelings.

I want to talk about this with other people. It's been years now since I've struggled with my feelings toward him, and I know for sure that there is no chance of me being with him. He's currently in a relationship that seems to be lasting. I've talked about this briefly before too and all he said was that he hopes I can find help.

I feel stuck. I want to move away, but with that comes cutting off all contact with him to get over him. Otherwise, I feel that if I keep contacting and hanging out with him even after moving away, my feelings won't go away at all. Is there even a way to get over someone you've fallen in love with, while still living with them or still hanging out? I feel like that's almost impossible, since I've been trying that so hard.

Yesterday I had a breakdown, and finally cried about this. It hurt so much. I just cried on my entire drive home and later again at night. I don't know if I'm finally realizing that he will never love me the same way? What mostly made me so sad was thinking about our past and our friendship together, and how it might have to be ripped away from us because I need to get over him. It might be better for both of us and our friends and his girlfriend. But it would just hurt so terribly much. I really don't know what to do anymore.

I want to try to find a therapist again, but I just find that to be a huge struggle itself too. I just want this to not be a thing, and I just want to not exist anymore. I wish everything to just reset, or that I never would have met my friend and clinged onto him so much. I feel so much regret and sadness, and wish there was some answer to guide me toward feeling any sense of happiness again.

TLDR I live with my best friend who I feel I'm in love with. To the point I have become obsessed of him, and I can't imagine being in a relationship or attracted to anyone else. But he has no interest in me since he is straight and I'm closeted gay. I want to get over him, but to do so I feel like I have to cut off all contact with him and probably move out. But maybe I can try therapy first. Has anyone else had a similar experience?",18Feb2020,1
838,"I've had PTSD since I was two years old and no matter what treatment I try it doesn't work. My last therapist said that all of my social issues come from fairly advanced C-PTSD issues and that she was very ""concerned"" for me.  It's leaked into my work life and it's causing massive problems because I can't deal with people. I have some good days but I can't keep people from getting to me, and my mood ends up fluctuating from stable to genuinely homicidal several times per shift, sometimes apropos of nothing. Sometimes I'll be completely fine but some high-maintenance customer just approaching me or hearing ""excuse me, miss?"" while I'm trying to stock will set me off. I'm becoming extremely bitter and brittle and I hate it. 

I have very few skills and have no natural aptitude, so I've basically been limited to retail, serving and bartending. 

Every job I get is the same. I start out very strong (at my current job I got promoted within two months of being there), but dealing with customers all day feels like someone's going at me with a cheese grater. Some of the customers are great but most are entitled, high-maintenance, and downright nasty. Just the other day I had someone lunge at me from across the counter because the computer bounced one of her coupons. She left, after calling me a cunt and telling me she would come back with a weapon. 

Even though I'm technically a manager, we're short-staffed so I'm always the one doing the client-facing work. The people never stop coming and there's nowhere I can go to get actual work done. 

We keep hiring new people but they're either flakes or thieves, so they get fired before I can get trained to actually manage. Plus, whenever we hire new people, their hours come out of my hours. So, I'm broke on top of that. I'd love to get a second job, but I would obviously run into the same problem regarding my decreasing capacity for people and their bullshit. 

I couldn't afford college and I have no idea how to get out of this loop. Like I said, I have absolutely no natural talent and I don't have the stomach to go into the medical field. I don't know what I could possibly pursue that would be relatively recession-proof and didn't involve me dealing with people all day. 

I know there basically isn't an answer. If I can't find treatment for my CPTSD that doesn't aggravate my situation, I'm screwed. There basically is no future here. I've been on r/CPTSD and basically haven't found much. I guess I just needed to vent. Thank you.",18Feb2020,1

But I remember this one time I was re filling strawberries in the freezer and she went to go slap my butt, umm a little weird but whatever right, next few times I work with her she keeps saying how I should have a 3 sum with her and her boyfriend, I laughed because it made me uncomfortable.

854,"I’m currently a high school junior. Throughout high school, I’ve never been really active in any clubs or other activities. I’m also not very social, so I don’t hangout every week with my friends or anything. I only go out with friends every once in a while. I’ve always been really close with my family though so I never felt particularly lonely or isolated. 

Since junior year started though, I decided to actually start being productive and start looking good for colleges. I went out and took the SAT, started doing full-time dual enrollment at a big university, and got my driver’s license. I hang out with friends a bit more often. I started volunteering regularly and went a step further by getting a job. I thought my parents would be happy about it, but they’ve only ever been salty and resentful towards my new job in particular. They’re always asking, “why are you working?” “Why do you need to work?” “Why can’t you just quit?” 

I just got into a big argument with them because they were criticizing me as usual, but this time they started to question my honesty and academic commitment. They questioned if I was actually working when I’m on my laptop or if my coursework is actually as difficult as I make it out to be. I’ve always been a straight A student and obsessed with my schoolwork, so admittedly I spend more time studying and working than other kids but to actually question that? I found it unbelievable. I accidentally let out something I’ve been keeping in for a long time and asked them if they’re like this because they just want to keep me home all day.

856,"So when I was in second grade I moved to a new state, my mom was from this state so she knew the people around. So my mom introduced me to her childhood friend’s daughter (let’s say the daughters name is Beth). So me and Beth had huge crushes on each other from 2-8th grade, and even still had little crushes on each other since then (currently juniors in high school). Now on the other hand, this girl I had a crush on my freshmen year likes me too and we’ve been a thing for like 3 months (let’s say the freshman year crush’s name is Carly). Keep in mind Carly rejected me freshman year for a junior boy. So now that me and Carly have been a thing for about 3 months, we hang out everyday and I’m happy. 

Now take it back to New Years Eve, my and Beth were talking all night and it just kind of rekindled all my feelings for her, and I haven’t been able to get her out of my mind since then. 

Today I told Carly I need to take a break, as I’m overwhelmed because her friends always pressure me to ask her out (like to make us official) but I don’t feel like I’m ready to date again as I got out of a bad relationship like 9 months ago, but i know that it’s been a long time but I feel like I wanna just have fun and not he locked down. But then again Carly is amazing and she’s really nice and sweet. Also she tried to tell me she loved me and plus other factors like the boys getting mad if I hang with her for too long over them and other things like my parents recent divorce.

858,"Will try to keep this short. 

My friend (now used loosely) and I are in college together. I moved in with her last April and she quickly started letting venmo requests for shared expenses etc. pile up. Weeks turned into months, I'd get an occasional ""on sorry I forgot, I'll ask my parents for the money"" and then wouldn't hear about it for another month, etc.

Then last month, she revealed that she hadn't been paying our utilities for months. I sorted it all out, got the numbers, etc. and we paid. 

During this ordeal we had a conversation about it and why it was a problem, and I printed out a spreadsheet of everything she personally owes me. She paid a portion of it and said she'd pay the remaining bulk of it on or before February 15. 

Feb 15 passed, and on the 16th I left the spreadsheet where she'd written the deadline of the 15th on the table before going to work. She left a sticky note on it that said she ""totally blanked"" on the date and asked if she could pay this Friday instead. 

My problems are:

1. I have zero reason to believe she'll actually pay me this friday considering her track record
2. She's kissing my ass by buying things for me (came home last night with a ton of face masks for me??), which is only annoying me more because I don't want face masks, I want my money back
3. The principle of it all is what really gets to me. If it mattered to her at all, she would've put a reminder to pay me back that day, but didn't and let it slip her mind instead. It's money that she's owed me for months that I've had to pay cycles and cycles of credit card bills covering and she has zero sense of urgency to get it back to me. 

I want my money back, and I want her to understand how wrong the way she's handled this is. I have a tough time being assertive with her because she always cowers and cries, and I need some words of advice and encouragement.",18Feb2020,1

I know there’s no medical condition involved with her personal smell, and that it can be strictly attributed to her hygiene habits. She rarely brushes her teeth, she has admitted to never using deodorant, and she only showers MAYBE twice per week. 

If I’m being honest, she’s kind of a gross person all around. She’s never washed her sheets since we moved in to the best of my knowledge, to the point that there’s a brown body print where she sleeps. She doesn’t clean up after herself, she leaves dishes for days, and it’s impossible to get her to clean anything in the house. But her personal body smell is just pushing me off the edge. I can’t even hang around her anymore because her smell is so off putting. What do I say? What do I do?",18Feb2020,1
860,"I've had plenty of jobs, sometimes multiple at once. The longest I've ever held a single position has been two years but the average is 6-7 months. 


I'd say the main reasons why I quit these jobs is because of a clash of ideals and pay rate. I'm self reflective to a fault. If I'm not constantly preforming above and beyond all the time then I get more depressed. The clash of ideals comes into play when my co-workers see that I'm a hard worker that will finish everything I have to do and right after, I start helping everyone else finish what they're doing. I like to be helpful. However the reason why my shelf life at a job is about 7 months is because that's about as long as I can take being taken advantage of. There's no worse feeling in the workplace than busting your ass so you can do what you have to do so you can help others out but then when you turn around they've all left. So it's just you doing their work while they hang out in the break room or dick around on their phone all day. It's even worse when your bosses see you're the only one doing any work in the building and say ""you're doing great work here, chief. Oh and I need you to stay late and come in early. We're short staffed."" I really wouldn't mind coming in early and staying late IF every other person in the building actually did even 2% of the work. But it's all me all the time. 



When I ask for a raise because of how I'm the only one working I'm always met with the same ""oh, it's out of my hands"" response. I hang in there for a while longer until it becomes too much to bear. My peers and supervisors that are paid much more than I am are now giving me their work so they can run off and get paid for doing nothing without me even offering to help because now they just expect me to do it as if I wasn't just being nice before. If there's one thing I hate most in this world it's being used and abused. The reason I work so hard for these people is because I don't have any friends or family. I want to feel like I belong by being useful. I don't want to feel like people are only being nice to me so I do their work for them. 


It's the same cycle everywhere I go. Once I hit my breaking point of everyone pretending to like me just so I do all their work, my bosses having me practically live in the building without any hope of promotion or raise, and covering for other people when no one covers for me, I have to put my two weeks in. The look on my bosses face when I tell him is always the same. He's not sad that I'm leaving, he's sad that in me leaving they effectively lose 90% of their workforce and he won't give me a raise so I stay because there's so much legal garbage in the system that they can't do it. Then my co-workers find out somehow instantly that I'm leaving and treat me like shit for 2 weeks, yet every time when I needed help with something no one has any idea until weeks later.


I just don't get it. What sense does it make that you're punished for working hard? I've even been told to slow down at work because if I kept up the pace for long enough the management would increase the workload because we'd have too much down time. I didn't believe them so I continued doing what I was doing but at my current job they actually DID drastically increase our daily duties and a lot of people quit because of it. No raises came with that workload increase either. This kind of stuff makes me feel like I'm going crazy.


Everything is just so terrible. The people are terrible, the jobs are terrible, the pay is terrible, the commute is terrible, I have no time off and the benefits are nonexistent. Every day I ask myself ""Why?"" Why do any of this? Why continue this path of garbage I've walked for so long. There's only more garbage to be found along the way and I feel as though I've seen enough.",18Feb2020,1
863,"Like 4 years ago, I fell in love with this girl and it was very special for me because that was the first time I have felt that way about someone. We became like very close so I had hope that maybe she felt the same way as I did. After the summer break, she basically ghosted me for an unknown reason and it worried me. One day, when she basically said to me that I should leave her be and gtfo. So I did, but I can't say Ive recovered from that. I really don't have anyone to talk about my feelings so I didn't talk about it with anyone, which is bad because pretty much everyone noticed that I wasn't happy. The only person Ive talked to about this was back then only an internet friend (we've met since then so yeh :) ), but I still felt miserable. Well, after a few months, I decided that I can't stay sad forever, so I made a tinder account. Ive started to chat with this girl and we had a lot in common, but I didnt rlly love her. I thought of her as like a really good friend. We even talked about rlly personal stuff like our relationships and other hardships. One day, like the girl from before, she also said that I should leave her be. I was totally clueless as to what did I do wrong again. Again, I was like I cant be sad again, so I found another girl on tinder, who was really nice and we talked about all kinds of stuff. We even met up once and had a great time. Like everyone else, she also ghosted me and then said that I should leave her be. I just didnt know what to do anymore at this point. Now, Ive basically started talking to an old classmate, and I really think I like her. She rlly is a good person. But now, she basically ghosted me like everyone else did. Im now really sure that I am doing something wrong. So, Id really really appreciate if someone would tell me what am I doing wrong. Ever since i fell in love and had my heart broken (i kno i sound super cheesy but i dont kno how else to describe my feelings rn), my goal was to feel that way again. At this point tho, I feel like im not destined to be loved.",18Feb2020,1

Won’t go into detail but it ended horribly. Friendship was ruined and everything. 

When she left I begged her back (super pathetic) and did all this weird drama. Ultimately she rubbed it in my face how she is with someone else. I then went after her and texted her some awful stuff. 

She told everyone she was afraid of me and I felt so horrible. And I started making up scenarios where I may have said things that were scary and I just couldn’t remember. 

It stung at first real bad but I moved on. Thing I forgot is that she is a client at the place I work at. And she won’t transfer to another place cause she has so many points with us that her visits are next to free. 

About 7 months after the breakup she came by and I was there. We talked about her treatment nicely. After that every other month she comes in and I deal with her. If I’m not on the case I still stop and say hi to her. 

However this guilt that if she is still scared of me lingers on. And the more I think of what I could have said the more guilt I feel.

871,Idk if I’m officially depressed or not. I haven’t seen a professional or anything but for the past few months I haven’t been happy at all. It all really started when all of my friends didn’t respond to my birthday invites that I sent twice. No reply to decline and no reply to accept. I stopped talking to them to see if they would invite me to anything and I still haven’t heard from them. Lately almost everyday at work I’ve had customers yell at me bc policies I don’t write cause them inconvenience. I’m in a long distant relationship with my gf and I’m longing to see her but can’t afford it and don’t have the vacation time. I’m also afraid of pushing her away by telling her all of this so I put on a happy mask just like I do at work. I just feel so alone and that I feel like I’m the one to blame when it comes to my friends and I. Today at work a customer told them I did their transaction wrong when I did it how they said but they just switched it up (I work at a bank) and bc we value customers is lose out on an incentive that I sort of depend on. I understand that life has ups and downs and I’ve experienced them before. But this has been ongoing for months and I feel that this is the first time I’ve felt truly depressed.

Our relationship is great, were best friends, we tell eachother everything. I'm very sure she wants to stay with me for a very long time. The thing is I don't know if I'm 100% happy. I haven't really had any alone time which I'm craving. I can't seem to find a balance between work, school, friends, hobbies, alone time and her.

I still live at home with my parents and me [F21] and my mom [F47] have trouble with my dad [M53] lately.
If one of us says anything that slightly offends him (even if it's just a normal question) he immediately raises his voice and when you tell him (politely) to keep his voice down completely flips out. Most of the time he accuses us of conspiring against him.

He also complains all the time how he is so stressed and has to do everything by himself...well, my mom and I both have 40-hour work weeks; he only has a part-time job and most days when he gets home, he just watches TV and does nothing. Even the small part of housework my mom assigned him (vacuuming and cooking) is too much in his eyes.

Today at dinner we all got in a huge argument over essentially nothing again. I started crying midway through because I don't handle screaming very well. He told me I had no reason to cry because I was an adult. Moments later when I defended my mother he almost ordered me to shut up and that I was just a child and didn't understand anything...

After he angrily left the room my mom told me that he was drinking a lot of alcohol lately and she stopped trying to talk to him about it because he ends up screaming at her anyway.

I don't know what to do about this. Every time we try to talk to him, he throws a tantrum and I'm slowly starting to feel unsafe in my own home. I also currently have no chance in moving out; I'm still a trainee at my job and don't have loads of money because of that.

878,"Hi, people of Reddit! I ask for advice from humans who have experienced the burdens of choice of the apartment for rent.   

Me and my boyfriend currently live separately but we have decided to rent an apartment together. Initially we planned to do that in May 2020, because that would be both the end of the spring semester (we are both students) and the contract of the flat that my boyfriend is renting right now with friends will end by that time. But since the housing situation in our town is quite complicated, we have already started to look for options recently.   

Today we had the first potential apartment tour and we both fell in love with that flat. It is in a new building, has a spacious wardrobe, huge balcony with chairs and beautiful view, clean kitchen and bathroom of good quality, comfortable sleeping place. And for all that the price is really affordable.   However, the landlord understandably does want us to move in already in the next month. So we are faced with several problems:  

1) If we move in now, then paying for the apartment and the room in the old apartment for several months is financially possible but hard.     
2) It is the first apartment we have visited and we have nothing to compare it to except for the photos available online (which, I assume, is not always reliable).   

Do you guys have anything to say on that? Have you maybe experienced similar problems? We would appreciate any piece of advice.",18Feb2020,1

She opens all my mail. She put a tracker on my phone (I have a line off her line so she’s the account holder). She reverse lookups the numbers I talk to. She basically stalks me in our own house, sneaking around, hiding, listening to my conversations with friends in person or on the phone and anything I might be doing until she hears me coming down the stairs.. day or night. Our home is a very big house but it’s older so the floors creak so it’s impossible to walk silently anywhere in the house. I’m a very private person.

880,"Good afternoon.  This is my first post to the thread.

Here is some background.  I graduated in 2017 with a degree in psychology.  I initially wanted to be a psychologist, but do not have the funds to go further. I thought I would get out of college, work for a couple of years, then decide to go back if that was necessary. With a sizable chunk of student debt, my parents let me move back in until I could settle my debts. 

First job out of college I worked for a furniture company. The company uses fear to keep people in place and they applauded a sense of conformity. I am diagnosed with adhd. needless to say, my boss constantly harassed me specifically for performance issues and threatened me my job on a regular basis. This went on until I went to HR to tell them about what happened and they decided to tell my boss everything I said in confidentiality. Boss tells me everything I told HR. Fed up with this circus of a company, I decided to give my two weeks notice then and there.

The job paid very well. I was able to pay off the entirety of my student loans a little after 1 year. I was saving the money I made to finally move out on my own, until the whole debacle with management and HR.  Now that I left, I am also stuck paying expensive Insurence payments. The hard earned money I have been saving is now being sucked away by about 650 per month. My net worth is now half of what I was saving. Going back to school is now out of the realm of possibility because I refuse to take on student debt. Again.

Since the day I quit, I have sent out on average 4 applications per day since August 2019.  I am constantly looking for opportunities in either logistics, retail, or other people related opportunities. I go to job fairs, church functions, and career seminars trying to figure out what else I can use in tandem with my psychology and 2 years experience in logistics and customer service.  I need help in ideas for career paths which make use of psychology or ideas of other career choices with the experience I have gained.",18Feb2020,1
881,"I’d like to preface this by saying I have terrible anxiety and I’ve been binging to cope with this.


 
I’d also like to say that my roommate told me he preferred I not bring guests because he doesn’t bring anybody home...which later proved to be false.
My roommate is also the landlord. It’s just us two and I barely see him. He comes home late evenings/nights and I usually clock out early by 630-7. The first weekend after I was settled in, I was woken up by loud noises. He had come home and brought a girl. She had absolutely no volume button. I could hear her asking him questions about me like my name, my race etc... very personal questions and I was uncomfortable with him giving her my details as I’d never met her. She goes to the fridge and finds my cheese. She asked him for a piece and was still begging for some after he said it was mine. I’m pretty sure he let her have some because I didn’t here him protest and she said something like “I just really love cheese!” in like a satisfactory to justify her needing a piece of my cheese. After blasting the tv they go into his bedroom and she was really loud. Like is she even capable of having sex at a normal volume??? I refuse to believe the sex was that great because they usually finish in less than 10 from the time the door closes to the time the door opens... not to mention her moaning usually starts like 30 seconds after the door closes...



Anyway, I digress. Since then he brings her over at least once a week and I have to continue to be subjected to her loud, squeaky voice both inside and outside the bedroom. I have also gotten into an unhealthy habit of stopping what I’m doing when they’re in kitchen to listen if she’s touching my stuff. She was here yesterday as well and I had made a dish predominantly of cabbage. Guess what I hear come out of her mouth... cabbage! After he let her touch my cheese the first time, I don’t trust them being here together because I can’t help but feel like he wouldn’t stop her from exploring and touching my stuff. 



I left one negative environment and I thought here was a better, safer space to handle my depression, anxiety and eating disorder. Things were good the first few days but after 2 &amp; 1/2 months of being here, I dread the weekend because that’s when he usually brings her. I even have terrible anxiety when my roommate comes home alone. 



I want to say something but I’m afraid of any potentially negative repercussions. I’ve been a quiet, clean roommate. I know his schedule so I try to avoid interacting with him, mainly because I don’t want to interact, but it’s a plus for him as well. I’ve also causally been looking for another place in the meantime but no luck so far. 
I don’t know if I should say something to my roommate about his girlfriend or if I should continue to keep quiet and look for something else. 

Any advice on the situation would be so helpful!! 




TL;DR 
My roommate (who’s also the landlord) is almost never home except for late evenings/night. He brings his girlfriend over once a week. She’s has no volume button inside and outside the bedroom and she goes through my side of the fridge. I want to say something to my roommate but I’m afraid of negative repercussions since he does own the place.

Like...what? I have no clue why  but now I just want to delete them. Wish ig just deleted people when they delete you. I don’t want to be that petty  but it’s just annoying. It also hurts a bit to I guess not understand what I did. I get it that people move forward in life and like different things but we have been friends for a long time. To be drop like I was nothing I think hurts the most. Anyways is it a bit childish to delete this person just because they deleted me?",18Feb2020,1
889,"I'm a 29 year old guy, single, jobless (by choice) and well aware that I've just come into the prime of my life. I have skills to burn so there is no real fear of becoming broke like I was for my entire upbringing. But, even if I were to lose every penny I have, I am pretty confident I'll be able to manage since I have before.

I keep busy during my time off. I have clients who I do work for and who love me. I have a lot of brilliant caring friends. I have a big family and they're all crazy (but who's isn't?). They're great in spite of their flaws, and I love them each dearly. Everything seems to be going very well for me. Almost every day I force myself to suffer because of awareness of my many privileges. I realise that people go without food, so I fast. I realise that people go without money, so I leave my job and fend for myself. I realise that people aren't perfect, so I try my best to have patience even in the most irritating of times. I realise that some guys can't get a woman, so I am celibate.

Unfortunately, the last denial there is not voluntary. I am becoming an incel. Without the pent up rage and hatred probably, but I can't get a woman anymore. I haven't slept with a girl in more than a year and I just don't see it on the horizon. I can't even see myself doing it. Sex itself has become twisted in my mind since my last break-up — which was almost 3 years ago now. When I left her (and I did leave her, which is the crazy thing), I went on the most destructive rampage of my life. With drugs, prostitutes, skanky girls, and alcohol. For years. I've calmed down a good bit on that front now, and I'm a lot more calm. But I still dream about her. I still think of her. I don't want her back by any means (she actually has a new bf I found out recently), but I just can't see any other girls at all.

3 years is a little long to still pine over an ex lover, right? Where is my mojo gone? I used to do ok.",18Feb2020,1
890,"Hello.

This is going to be difficult to start off, so I’ll start with my age and location.

I’m a 16 year old male living in the United States. When I was 15, a psychiatrist diagnosed me with depression. This was in the beginning of November 2018. To make a fairly long story short, I was attending therapy for 3 months, up until January 2019, when my mother discontinued my treatment saying that i was “faking it”. I have since been living day by day, unsure of whether or not I was actually depressed. I have lived through what may be emotional and verbal abuse from her. I have constantly questioned my mental state and have discredited any concern of my mental health, thinking “I’m probably just overreacting, it doesn’t matter”. Sometime around May 2019, I went to the doctor with my mother. At the end of the appointment, I was given a clipboard with a pen and told to answer all questions honestly. I immediately realised that it was a PHQ-9 test; a test to help determine symptoms of depression. I desperately wanted to fill in the answers honestly, but I knew I couldn’t with my mother in the same room. I filled in all the same answers, essentially saying I was happy with no signs of the mental disorder. I was right to do what I did because my mother then forced me to show her the paper. The conversation went something like this:

Mother: Show me want you answered

Me: I don’t want to 

Mother: *Show me*

Me:  No, this is not for you to see. You have no business seeing it.

Mother: I am your goddamn mother now give me the clipboard 

She then proceeded to take the said clipboard out of my hands. Nothing significant happened afterward, but I still think about this situation often. I was forced to abandon a chance at getting help because if I hadn’t, then my mother would’ve most definitely gotten pissed. 

Either way, I’m starting to feel concerned for myself and my mental health. I don’t want to go into details, but I want to at least talk to a therapist to be sure. But maybe I genuinely don’t have a problem. Maybe I’m just like everyone else and I actually don’t have a problem? Maybe this is normal and I *am* overreacting.

Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read this post, I just really need some advice right now.",18Feb2020,1

I have a low GPA to apply to MPH (Masters in Public Health) programs. I am looking to take classes this year to help buffer my low GPA.

I have heard that sometimes schools will frown upon the fact that you took classes at an external university after graduation. Is it valid to take classes at an accredited university (in my case Rutgers Camden) and will schools consider that in light of my poor academic performance in undergrad? How do schools view those grades in light of my poor undergrad GPA? Will they consider that I am taking courses and hopefully doing well in them, into consideration when looking at my academic performance?

And just when I thought life had made its point, my mom and step-dad died tragically leaving me as a abandoned adolescent with no purpose in life. That sense of never having the opportunity to prove myself to both my mum and dad creates entitlement.

917,"I apologize for the length of this post. It’s going to be messy but I appreciate if you stick around to read it.

Some background info: I’m a 23F. I work full-time making $15/hr on the east coast. I live with my boyfriend and his family, luckily and thankfully rent free. I have about $700 in expenses monthly, so I’m able to save while still being able to afford my bills.

I moved to this area to pursue my degree, and ended up dropping out of college because I lost my housing and my loan. My family is not financially capable of helping me. They live two hours away in an area that lacks opportunity and advancement, so I really didn’t want to move back there. Hence why I ended up with my boyfriend.

When I dropped out, I found a full-time position working in a doctors office (the job I mentioned above.) I am not happy here, and had nothing to do with what I was going to school for, but it pays the bills, it’s day shift, and I get the weekends off to do what I please. But I can honestly tell you I am not happy working there, as it is mundane and most of the doctors treat you like the dirt on their shoes. 

During the course of these giant life changes, I’ve become very indifferent towards everything in my life. I wake up around 5-7 every day, sit in traffic for an hour, work, sit in traffic for another hour, and come home. I have lost all ambition for my own care. I no longer enjoy doing the things I used to do. I don’t go to the gym anymore. I don’t do yoga. I don’t practice makeup, or fashion, or read. By the time I come home I’m so drained, all I want to do is sleep.

I don’t want to be this way, you know? I want to become a better version of myself but I feel so ungodly stuck. I feel alone. I feel tired. I don’t make enough to be on my own. I can’t go back to school yet because I am in a lot of debt with a low credit score ($30k+ with a 520 credit score)
I really just feel like I’m floating through my twenties without actually living and it’s making me bitter towards everyone my age that hold better jobs or that do exciting things. Some of it is my fault, and I need to take blame for it. Some of my problems were handed to me by my parents, and I can’t change it.

Where do I go from here? I want to be happy. I want to be energetic, and start doing the things I love. I want to be successful, have friends, do things I know I’m supposed to be doing at 23. I don’t want to have regrets. Any and all advice is welcomed.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I noticed my sister was upset with someone by the tone and volume of her voice on the phone. Although, all I knew was that she was talking about someone. Not too the person she is angered with. I didn't think anything of it as it is normal for her. She is very extroverted and befriends anyone but isn't afraid to stand her ground. 

I only got involved once it was about 10 P.M. and she asked me to lock the door behind her and be up when she gets back. She wanted to get McDonalds with her friend whom was already over. We'll call her friend (Jack) and my sister (Kayla).  We live in a trusted neighborhood so no one really worried about locked doors... so this was strange; but, I didn't bite until Kayla came rushing inside with Jack as I was about to lock the door. 

She's on the phone with someone and Jack is just standing around. I follow them to her room ready to ask what's going on. All she tells me is that there is a creeper after her and that he knows where we live. Obviously, I wanted more details but she insisted in going to grab food. From this point, I thought it couldn't be too serious if shes okay with leaving. 

Then Kayla calls me on her way back. She tells me to glimpse outside the window regularly to ensure no one is coming up the drive way. If someone is coming up, to call the police immediately. She's then telling me on the phone that she believes she's being followed. I obviously am a bit panicked but I wasn't going to show that. I just told her to keep driving till she gets here.

Kayla shows up about twenty minutes later. Unless they ate it all in the car, I didn't see any McDonalds. However, that didn't pass my mind until now. I was curious and worried. We decided to talk outside so that she could watch the road and so my mom couldn't hear. 

She goes on to tell me about a (Mason, 18m) that she has encountered. As far as I know, he claimed to be in a gang and is addicted to heroine and methamphetamine. Kayla also claims he is  a criminal informant for the police. She only got involved to help Masons girlfriend escape his abuse. Masons girlfriend left for about a week before returning to him. While they were separated, Masons girlfriend stayed at my moms house. (She also later tells me that she has hung out with him after the fact because she believes he deserves a second chance. I tell her that there's nothing that she could do to help him. Then she explains that its actually therapy for her because she talks to him about her problems and she gets a free smoke from him (Marijuana)… of course I explained how neither of that is worth it.)

However, she's not afraid that the girlfriend went back to him but that he might rob our parents and apparently he tapped into her phone. She tells me that Mason would text her replies to a conversation that Jack and her are having vocally in her room. She also shows me a text from a random number of a screenshot. It was of her Venmo money being transferred to someone else's account and ""thank you"" followed it. Kayla also states that he stole her I.D. so Mason knows where my dad lives and his girlfriend knows where my mom lives. 

I tell her that the only thing we could do is go to the cops to write a report and she refuses. She is now telling me that she ""knows too much"" and that ""they'd be out for her head"" and it'd be OK because he's a criminal informant. SO, of course I ask what she means. Kayla is now claiming that Mason admitted to being a part of a double homicide that happened a town away, about a month ago. I explain to her that this is all the more reason to go to the police but she absolutely refuses. She began to attack me about irrelevant things and stormed off. She did later text me an apology.

&amp;#x200B;

She was so paranoid: continuously looking out the driveway, left her phone in the car, wouldn't go to the cops. I even heard an unusual lisp in her speech. I know Kayla used to do coke but she stopped after she began going to the doctor and got married to someone in the military.  She began to gain weight and looked healthy from the beginning of November till now. I have a gut feeling she's doing something heavier now. I did ask her later that night if she was doing drugs and she told me no. 

I just need advice on what you guys think and how I should approach the situation. Note: My parents would not be the best go-to. Especially my mom. My dad is more than willing to pay for her therapy but she always refuses. She's very hard headed.

tldr: Afraid that sister may be involving herself in heavy drugs and I do not know what to do about it. My parents aren't the best to turn to. She also claims to being stalked and possibly attacked by a guy whom has claimed to be a part of a recent double homicide. She refuses to go to the cops about this.",18Feb2020,1

926,"Unsure where to post this, and on mobile so apologies in advance for possible formatting issues. Cross-posted in r/career advice. Let me know if there’s a better sub!

My boyfriend is getting laid off (SF, CA). He's been with the company ~6 months, and as far as I know, it's a standard at-will employment. He has no formal write-ups, but two emails from his manager (one in November 2019 and one from a week ago) following verbal conversations about areas of improvement. The emails, verbatim, say the exact same thing.

The second email came 10 days ago. Yesterday, he was called into her office and given a ""48 hour heads up"" about a formal performance review happening on Wednesday (tomorrow). Between the arrival of the second email and getting the heads up, only 5 full business days had passed.

He was told that he will be given two options:
(a) be placed on a 4-week Performance Improvement Plan. That would be reviewed after the 4-week period is up, and if he doesn't show improvement, he is terminated with no notice/severance.
Or option (b), leave now and take a 4-week severance package.

His immediate gut reaction is to take the severance. He loves the company, but has been very unhappy working under this manager (she berates him in private. He's first in, last out, and feels underappreciated, to say the least).

My questions/areas of advice:
- It boggles my mind that he was only given 5 business days to show improvement before getting notice that a PIP is coming. Much of his work is based off monthly processes.
- I know it's at-will, but he has no formal write-ups. Or do these two emails count as substantial documentation?
- Could it be considered a negative from a future employer that he doesn't take the PIP? Are there consequences to him signing any paperwork regarding the PIP?

Next steps - He's updating his resume and will be applying for new jobs asap. He also intends to file for unemployment.
- Are there any good counseling/career coach resources I could recommend (that aren't crazy expensive)?
- How does one best find recruiters relating to your industry?

I was talking to two coworkers (a manager and someone more my pay level) causally when it got brought up that I should get a raise and that I needed to go ask for it. So, I went to my boss and got denied pretty much flat out, and told that I might be getting the position soon (once again, she’s been saying this forever). 

Then a few days ago, she sent a text out with the link to an application for the position. Which I promptly applied for and even drove down to her office immediately after to talk with her about it. She seemed hesitant.

929,"STORY
So yesterday my iPhone 7 screen just stopped working; buttons worked fine, screen turned on, but wasn’t detecting any touch contact. 

I got to work, called (with someone else’s phone) various places to get it fixed, all quoting £150-£200 for a fix. At that point I started looking into replacing it with an iPhone XS and saw that amazon had them on sale with a third of the price off. Perfect, I planned on upgrading phone towards the end of the year so I thought this would be a easy win. I order the phone and several accessories and get on with my day.

Then, to my horror, my phone starts working normally again. A buddy of mine opened it up, wigged some bits and all seemed fine. This is great, but it is too late to cancel the £645 I just spent on my new device.

I talked myself into the purchase: new phone, much better camera, unlocked so can put a American SIM card when on honeymoon in it. 

The camera thing is a big selling point; I’m not a social media fan, nor am I a photographer, but I do like to take decent photos and print them off, all reviews for the XS have ticked the right boxes. 

I have disposable income, and tend to save at least half my monthly salary, but recently I have been a bit frivolous and purchased a number of large cost items. 

I’m also on the market for getting a new car, this is something that I have factored into my savings, but would take a large portion out of it, especially before an expensive trip to America. 

I don’t like using credit either, so buying the phone outright is a short term hit, but a long term save. It’s just come at the wrong time.

My phone works now, but a part of me thinks it could happen again. I’m just not sure what to do really, I planned on upgrading to this new phone eventually, but with honeymoon looming, and needing a new car, it feels like maybe I should return it.

I know it’s not a major thing, but the pros and cons out weigh each other. Not really sure what to do to be honest.

Recently married, going on honeymoon soon, need to buy a new car. Old phone broke, replaced with new phone, old phone now works. Not sure if to return new phone or not.",18Feb2020,1

It's a good way to stay connected with him and the band.  I also follow a handful of other YouTube guitarists who are very talented and entertaining.

I like to cook and learn about food, so I follow Gordon Ramsay and Binging with Babish on YouTube.

My wife has hobbies too, but she goes about them in a much more personal manor.

* She loves snowboarding, but she doesn't follow any pros, keep up on competitions going on, etc.
* She likes country music.  She's a fan of Eric Church, but if he showed up on Hot Ones or something, she wouldn't watch it because she isn't interested in hearing his perspective on the country music industry or listening to him talk about how he got into music in the first place.  She just a fan of his music, not him as a person or of country music as a bigger industry.

She wants to understand the desire to follow what other people are doing outside of your immediate family/friend group.  To her, rather than watch Gordon Ramsay cook, just go cook for yourself.  Rather than listen to Eric Church talk about his life &amp; career, go talk to your parents or friends about how they're doing.  Instead of watching a guitarist on YouTube, go play guitar yourself!

I tried explaining that it's

1. A way to further connect into your hobby/interest.
2. A way to learn from people with a perspective that you may never get to have.  I'll likely never be in a headlining, world-touring band.  So when my favorite band uploads a video to YouTube titled ""Check out what we do back stage to prepare for a show"", I'm like ""Oh, that's interesting.""  The same way a movie buff might want to listen to Steven Spielberg talk about directing or a major actor talk about acting.

I also tried explaining that she's treating shallow, reason-less obsession and casual, genuine interest as the same, when in reality it's the difference between reading People magazine and tabloids every week and following someone on YouTube or whatever because they do something you are interested in, and occasionally checking in to see what's new.  It's a spectrum, with her on one end and TMZ on the other.

She says that this makes her feel disconnected from other people because a celebrity name will pop up in a conversation and she's in the dark about it.  I tried telling her that that's fine, that she can have her own interests and her own way of pursuing her hobbies, but she just can't come to terms with it.

She kinda gets it, so I'm trying to think of other ways I could put it to her.",18Feb2020,1

934,"Hi everyone, 

For context, I’m a 23 y.o, currently studying for my Master’s degree. 
For the past few weeks, thoughts about the future keep popping through my head, and I’m having more and more trouble trying to push them away. 

I still live at my mom’s, and while I love her and the cohabitation causes no problem, I struggle with the feeling that I am not independent, and it feels like it will take forever before I get there. 

Next year, I will be taking a “concours” (not sure what the translation would be, but sort of a national examination) in order to be accepted into a “judge training school”. The preparation will require a lot of work outside of my regular school hours, as well as a private preparation program that’ll cost about 3.000€. I feel awkward for making my mom pay for this, but I really won’t have time to get a part-time job to help her with that expense. If I pass this examination, the rest of my life will pretty much be determined, which would be great. 
However, if I fail, I can either give up my dreams of ever becoming a judge and get a job, which means gaining the independence I really wish for, or, I can try again, and hope to finally pass. 

Also, my boyfriend (who’s 27) is another reason for me to long for independence. Like I said, I live at my mom’s, and he lives in a shared house with a roommate and his son (the roommate’s). So we never really get to be alone, just the two of us. The only solution would be for me to get my own place, which is almost impossible considering the high rents in my city. 

The majority of my friends come from wealthier families, so all of them left their parent’s houses right after high school, are moving in with their boyfriends, finishing their studies. I feel like I’m stuck and everyone around me is evolving. 

I feel like I’m not even entitled to complain about this, as I’m lucky enough to have a home, that my parents can still pay for my school, and have a great boyfriend. But as time passes, this feeling of being stuck intensifies, and I don’t know how to deal with it...

Thank you for reading, I’m sorry it was a little long, if some of you experiences the same feeling as I do, I would love to hear advice on how to overcome this feeling, and the guilt for even having it in the first place",18Feb2020,1

937,"This is gonna be a bit of a complainy type post... Sorry.

I have to do a group coursework at my university course (compsci) and I grouped up with some close friends. 

The issue is, they are a bit incapable of doing this particular coursework. They often don't understand some of the basic stuff that we need to make this work and I am very happy to explain it to them. However it pretty much ended up being me having to explain literally everything and then coding it myself anyway.

For the group coursework, we have to do the programming, write a report, and do proper team management and version control (e.g. Trello, Gantt Chart stuff, Git). In the report, you can write group contributions, like who did what. However if I wrote that I did everything, my mark will be the whatever our coursework gets, and the other guys will get less. If I wrote that we all did the same, we will all get the mark that the coursework got. So basically there is no upside if I tell the markers that I did literally everything.

The downside to me telling the truth (that everyone else did literally nothing) is that I will lose my friends because you write it in the report which everyone has access to.

I started off actually basically teaching them everything that I was doing but it became too much and I ended up just doing everything by myself because it really is easier than me having to do everything and then also explaining it and answering their questions.

Before anyone says they are bad friends (which they might be but this is my defense for them), they actually do try. They attend lectures and listen and they always make sure they understand something before we move on when I'm explaining stuff. It's just they are a bit slow or struggle to understand some of the stuff.

I'm only a bit struggling with the workload right now but it really is the best case scenario if I want to make sure I get a good mark as well. If I just leave them to their assigned parts and they can't/don't do it, I will also be penalised even though I did all of my part. And they always show appreciation and guilt that they aren't able to help.

So that's it basically. What am I supposed to do? I don't want to lose my friends but I also really hate the workload that I have. I've been ill with a cold (it has been so shit, I am so drowsy and have a headache but I still have to do work instead of rest) the past few days but am still doing so much work.

Honestly, ngl, this is sort of a vent post. I already know there's not a win/win outcome from this but if anyone has any ideas that might be good.",18Feb2020,1

We made would laugh and share personal stories SOMETIMES. she was usually the one that really dished out her business and since I’m private i gave as much as i felt comfortable saying. Which wasn’t much. Maybe a “this person made me feel like this” story here and there. I noticed she was trying to be friends very fast and i like to take my time so things began to get weird. She began to compete with me in outfits, shoes, and what our boyfriends bought. It got really weird. I wasn’t trying to do that at all.

I am currently unemployed, have been for almost 6 months. I’ve actively been searching for work but have been having a really hard time! I am looking for new postings constantly and upgrading my resume so it’s not like I’m not trying. But even with doing those things I still have a lot of down time in any given week. I do relatively normal things with this time - watch T.V, take care of pets and keep up with any housekeeping that needs to be done and occasionally will see my friends if they’re free. 

My problem is that my boyfriend makes comments all the time about me being unemployed because he doesn’t SEE me looking for work and I don’t always talk to him about it, so I think he thinks I’m being lazy or don’t care about my situation. If I complain about being bored, or struggling with money he says “then get a job” or “do something with your life”. If I’m going to be staying at his place he tells me to bring my laptop so I can be productive, as if I wouldn’t be if he didn’t remind me. He constantly dismisses any effort I’ve put in to finding one by acting as if I don’t even try and makes me feel ashamed of myself for not accomplishing more. I once told him that his comments frustrate me but he said that if I report to him what I’m applying to / what I’m doing every day to find a job then he wouldn’t say stuff like that. I don’t think I should report my daily progress to him like a child. I talk to him about job prospects when I feel like it might work out or I get an interview. I don’t need a micromanager to double check that I’m being a responsible person. Sometimes I just want to vent about it without being scolded and lectured.

945,"Throwaway acc

So, my good friend (15m) got a girlfriend (16f) about four months ago. From the start, every one of our friends gained an immediate dislike for her. She was very controlling and verbally abusive. She would shame him into inviting her with him wherever he went and wouldn’t allow him to go to any event with females there because she was worried he “would like them better than her and leave her”. She’d also threaten to break up with him if he didn’t buy her this or that. So she’s clearly not a very good partner for him, but he had been suffering from severe depression and she seemed to alleviate that, so we all let it continue. Earlier today, my friend texted me that they had been having sex the day before and the condom had broke. Apparently she’s been feeling weird since then and claims to want plan B. My friend has no money for it, since he had spent it all on her. He texted me to ask for $50 for the pills and honestly, I’m not sure whether or not I should pay him. I understand that if she is pregnant, that is very bad news for both him and her, especially at such a young age. I’m just skeptical that
1. It’s very unusual to feel any symptoms of pregnancy as early as the morning after, according to the Internet
2. He would give the money to her to buy them, and I’m concerned she’d just use the money for herself (if not actually pregnant”

946,"Hey, I'm in a really tough spot stuck between trying to help myself and not being able too...  


I'm a guy in his early 20s living in Florida. I don't have a car (there's not much nearby me that I can get too without a vehicle. Jobs/hangout spots), I don't have any irl friends, and I have horribly crippling anxiety with depression, and I don't think I've been actually diagnosed. I work a part time job that I hate, but nothing else nearby is hiring or pays nearly as well. I've been here for a year and a half. The schedule is somewhat flexible for me which really helps. I don't have health insurance, so I can't really see a doctor. I make just enough money to get by somewhat comfortably, but just that. I'm thinking I need to go college... I wanted to go to a trade school instead and pursue a career I wanted, but my life is not going that way right now. My anxiety is very very bad... Won't go into specifics, but it's hard enough for me to go to my part time job as it is, and I still call out every once in a while. Going to school and work at the same time would be way too much for me to handle. I don't know what to do or where to go from here, I know I need to make change but I just can't.

There are people whose lives are perfectly on track and they're not even 5 years old than me, and I'm here barely scraping by with a part time job with no real plans for the future. I've tried to help myself, I've tried taking advice from people like getting a hobby, but none of it has helped me. I go to really, really dark place sometimes... and I don't want it to end that way, but I don't want to institutionalize myself and ruin my life... I'm not even old enough to drink yet so I can't even use that as a crutch. I just really really need some help or direction or something because I just can't hack it.",18Feb2020,1

Why is it so hard to find a career that I enjoy. When I was young, I enjoyed computers a lot. but it seems that flame has dimmed down. I started to enjoy astronomy but I don't have the commitment to do astrophysics (this is the most intriguing field). I know this is a dumb question but I have no one else to ask. My friends have found their passion at a young age. Art, Music, etc. I have a lot of skills that I find fun but I get bored. Origami, Video editing, Photoshop (kinda), writing stories, etc. It could just be that I'm lazy which I'm willing to accept as an answer but I also find my self playing the same game for 8 years straight( A year ago I also got bored of it). I just don't understand in fact if it's not too much I've been looking around but can someone also suggest some fun careers?

&amp;#x200B;

As I stated before I enjoy story writing in fact, I am writing a novel right now, but it seems like I have to force my self to write it, although I'm in love with the plot and characters. I don't see Origami taking me anywhere, I just really liked how cool it looked, video editing is fun, but again I don't want it as a career. I enjoy gaming a lot, that's what I spend a lot of my free time doing, but most games are very expensive in my currency so I'm stuck playing old games, even the ones I love I find my self getting bored of quickly. Photoshop is meh ( no offense to anyone who loves this). Astronomy is a love-hate relationship. I love stars, astrophotography, theoretical thinking, planets ( in fact I wanted to sign up to be one of the first people to help colonize Mars, but I wouldn't finish in time to do it).

979,"So I have been waitressing at a local restaurant for about 5 months now. Of course like most jobs in the beginning everyone is nice and helps you (as they should) to learn the ropes and get the hang of everything. So this is where the issue comes into play. I have a general manager who runs this restaurant and she is a total butthole. I really think she is bi-polar and I am not trying to poke fun or joke around I seriously think she needs medication. After the first month or so of me working there she turned evil towards me. 
 
There was an instance around the time of Thanksgiving where she talked very rudely to me in front of my other coworkers and the customers. It was so bad that a few of my coworkers told the owners about it and of course we all had to have a meeting. Well things were good until about 2 weeks later and she started being rude to me all over again. She shows favoritism towards the other waitresses and I feel as though I get all the backlash and I’m used as a scapegoat. 

I actually had to have an office meeting with her today because she would not help me with something I asked her nicely to help with me. She basically told me to figure it out on my own. (She wouldn’t even look at me while I was talking to her...like I wasn’t important enough for her to talk to me directly). During this meeting I told her that I felt as though she did not like me because she always has an aggressive tone towards me all the time over silly things. And then she apologized (but it didn’t seem very sincere to me), but towards the end she tried to flip it around on me and say that when I told her we needed to talk I’m the one who had an aggressive tone! She even told me, “I’m not trying to flip this around and make it about you...” yet she literally was lol. 


I guess the reason I am posting this here to the adulting page is because I don’t know whether the more adult thing to do is stay and put up with her being ugly towards me or if leaving is also an adult thing to do. I am aware that sometimes the grass isn’t always greener on the other side, but maybe it might be a little more than here. 

Thanks to anyone who can give advice to me! :)",18Feb2020,1
980,"So long story short, I’ve been dealing with the aftermath of a break up that pretty much turned my life upside down. We lived together in Washington state pretty much  since we both graduated high school. I grew up (mostly) in Washington. I love that place more than I can even explain. But since the break up, I was forced to move back with my parents who live in Colorado. I have no friends or acquaintances here so besides my parents, I don’t really know anyone here. I don’t work, as I have been trying to figure out next steps and work on my mental health. I pretty much just hang out in my basement and cry (hot stuff, I know). Anyway, to say that I’ve been miserable is the understatement of  the century. 
I want to move back home to Washington where my friends are but the situation with my parents is kind of complex. We don’t see eye to eye about some things that are very important to me (namely, lgbt issues and being accepted for who I am); there’s some really bitter, horrible memories that come up whenever I see my dad. However, my dad is sick. He has been for my entire life but his illness combined with his age is really starting to take its toll on him. I don’t know how much longer he has left. My mom is amazing. She’s kind and sweet and cares about literally everyone. My dad is an asshole, and he takes it out on her. She has also been the sole caregiver for almost everyone in my family who had passed away. I don’t want to leave her to be emotionally abused and become the sole caretaker for her husband too. I think she needs help with it all.
I don’t think I can ever be happy here. I hate this place with such a passion and confronting my darkest memories everyday is really starting to take its toll on me. But I don’t know that I can leave now, knowing how much the situation with my dads illness has progressed. It’s like I’ve been disconnected with them for so long, now to reconnect and see what’s going on I just don’t know how to cope with it. I don’t know if I could live with myself for making my mom go through that alone or how I could live with myself if I didn’t try to fix my relationship with my dad. 
I guess what I’m asking for here is a little advice from someone who maybe has gone through a similar experience. I dunno this all just feels too big and I don’t know what to do anymore.",18Feb2020,1

After another few weeks a friend of her insulted me so I did the same but more subtle so this girl (X) was mad on me and we didn't speak to each other for few days, but then we started again. We had phone calls that lasted for over 5 hours (for real) and eventually she told me she likes me, she already knew I have a crush on her. We were supposed to meet irl but about 3 or 4 days ago she started trying to avoid it. We kept texting each other and calling each other everyday until today. I found out that she was lying to me that she stopped meeting her ex. She slept at his place a couple times and told me she was helping some old friends with something. Today I told her that I know she was lying to me and I asked for answers. She told me "" I didn't wanted to get you mad"". She told me to block her if I want, she's not ready yet to get in another relationship and other stuff like this. Then I asked her why the hell did she told me she liked me and her answer was somthing like "" I was starting to. I tought someday it could be something between us "". I told her I'll wait for her and her answer... "" I don't know if you have to. You'll meet someone else. I've hurt you and you deserve better"".

993,"So my friend I've known since we were like 10 years old was a hardline atheist who recently converted to christianity. Let me preface this by saying I don't have a problem with this; I go to church with my parents a few times a year such as Christmas and Easter mass. My problem is that he will not stop talking about it and all our conversations now lead back to God, the bible, his church, etc. It's changed him a lot to the point where I don't recognize him anymore and is kinda annoying. To put it in perspective how impassioned he is by christianity: he is turning down a six figure salary job offer in NYC straight out of college to go expand his church in a new region, and he is still going forward with this knowing that his atheist parents have threatened to disown him over this. This is how dedicated he is, so you can see how this bleeds over to a lot of his interactions with me.

Anyway, the last time we hung out we were having a normal conversation when suddenly he changed the subject about whether or not I was in touch with my faith and with God and he handed me a book about christian foundations which he said helped him convert. To be polite I said that I haven't really been in touch with my faith and that I would check it out and get back to him. Later he texted me saying that we should schedule to hangout the same time every week and each week I should read a new chapter and then we talk about the discussion questions in the book. I forgot to reply and I never said I was down for this to begin with but he texted me an hour or so later asking if we were still good to meet up and talk tomorrow.

Yeah... this dude is straight up assigning me homework and expecting me to meet with him every week for the rest of the semester like it's another class. I was thinking of just telling him the truth: that while I am spiritual, I do not have the time to meet with him every week and I don't enjoy spending time with him like this. But I'm not sure how I should break it to him. If anyone has any ideas, I would greatly appreciate it! I'm gonna meet him tomorrow and decide how to tell him.

997," 

I'm 16 years old(from Australia with Filipino descent) and I'm anxious about my overall future with my mum and future relationships with people. Throughout my childhood, I've seen extensive fighting between my parents over the course of 10 years, leading to their final separation when I was in grade 6. 

However, it's been a recurring pattern where my mum would have extensive conflict with a large number of friends and family(which is partially why we moved from our original town), usually leaving the relationships tattered and ended.

I have also experienced conflict with my mum across most of my life, where almost every occasion would include her unjustifiably yelling, insulting, swearing and hitting me(sometimes in public too). This has happened across most of my childhood and it's happened with most other people she's had conflict with(don't worry, I use all the blocks I learned from the martial arts training my dad put me in whenever she gets physical). I hate to say it, but she's put me through both emotional and physical abuse.

I've done a lot of self-reflection and opening up to friends recently and I've found that my mother has been responsible for most of the emotional suffering in my life, including my depression and low-self image. However, I'm in much more of a better place now as I've started fixing myself, getting my act together and regained my self-respect.

However, talking to my friends and self-reflecting has made me cynical about future prospects with my mother because of all the pain she has caused in the past and there's no doubt she would continue in the future.

Also, a few of months ago, I got into my first relationship with a girl, she's smart, kind, supportive, beautiful and has a great sense of humour. We're also very keen on both being in a long-distance/long term relationship with each other, as I'm moving to the US this year(because my mum has found a new relationship with a man in the US). I'm also content with the fact that relationships can go south, but given that this girl is fantastic, I'm fairly optimistic. 

However, I'm afraid that my mum could potentially spark conflict with the people I'm in relationships with and I will not allow her to hurt anyone else close to me because I've seen what she can do. It also doesn't help that the conflict with my dad and his side of the family has made her a little racist and prejudice against Italian-Australians, because that was their background. Guess what, my girlfriend also has Italian-Australian heritage. In general, I don't think my mum will be healthy on my future and I don't think reasoning with her is an option. 

I just want to live a good life, become a good father one day and be happy. It's kinda funny because I love cooking Italian food and it greatly smells up the kitchen and I think that secretly pisses my mum off. I’m not planning on telling her about my relationship anytime soon. It’s also funny because my girlfriend has Italian heritage. It's like a double F U in her face.

What do I do? I'm anxious that she could let all hell break loose if I try to cut my mum off from my life(guilt trip me as well for being a ‘good mother’). How do if handle her in the future?",18Feb2020,1

I, then get a text from her saying that she and her mother decided that since I'm moving there, she and I will get an apartment together.

I automatically was very opposed to this idea. I love my cousin to death, but I feel like she'd be the worst to live with, and here's why.

She is younger than I am, still in high school, and I'll be going into my third year of college when I transfer there. She's absolutely disgusting, every time I stay with her her room is a mess. I've found food that was left out for days, possibly weeks. Trash everywhere, dirty clothes always littering the floor. She even wears her dirty clothes, and rarely does laundry. She has a pitbull (believe me, I have nothing against pitbulls, they are an amazing breed) but I planned to get a cat while I was living on my own, and I am not sure how her dog and my cat would react to each other. She even recently told me that her boyfriend may be living with us too - without even asking me first!

There's so much more, I feel like I would end up cleaning up after her and her dog, I'd do the dishes, I'd be paying for most things.
There is so much more that I could go on about, but I feel like those reasons are enough for me to not want to live with her.

How do I go about telling her without ruining my relationship with her? She and my aunt are the types of people to become angry about this sort of thing. Any help would be amazing.",18Feb2020,1

I've taken care of her for about a year with my boyfriend.  Since I've taken care of her she has bitten me twice, both unprovoked. Once when j picked up a sock next to her and another when I placed my hand of my boyfriend's back while he was laying down  eating food. She is very protective and possesive of people and things which I think is the root of her aggression. She has bitten me at least 3 additional times before I started taking care of her, she's bitten children, and other family members and friends.

She will lunges after people across the street and after dogs and tried to bite my neighbor. Luckily it was just his shoe and he was not hurt. 

Dog training is incredibly expensive and I will try to save up money to pay for it. My boyfriend has told me that she is an indoor dog and I shouldn't take her for walks.

1024,I'm just going to retake the high school exam and apply to university for computer science. It feels like for years I've been living in a fog and weird mental state.

1025,"A bit of background: I have bought a block of ten lessons because I know I need to get over the fear and do it but even with the lessons paid for I still haven’t worked up the courage to actually take a lesson. I have drove before when I was about 19 but I only look around 5 lessons then. I got good feedback from my driving instructor but I moved from Ireland to England then and didn’t continue with my lessons.

I suffer from anxiety anyway but the thought of driving is beyond terrifying to me yet it’s something that I want so much. Has anyone felt similar and went on and got their license? Should I consider hypnosis if I can’t handle this alone?",18Feb2020,1

1027,"I’m on mobile so i’m sorry if this comes out weird. 
I’ve(19F) been with my boyfriend(25M), W, for 2 years and within that time we’ve broken up many times because he’s been unfaithful (this matters later). My boyfriend used to be in the military but recently got out and is now going to school 3,000 miles from me. We once lived together but since he’s moved we’re doing long distance. I recently lost my job back home so we thought it’d be a good time for me to come out and spend some time with him because the opportunity’s rare. A few weeks ago I was telling my best friend(19F), T, about the trip and she expressed her interest in also coming for a bit to get a vacation. He lives in one of the biggest cities in the country and we’re from a tiny town so it wasn’t weird Lol. His dad(53M) also lives in said city and in the past T and I have made jokes about how he is her type &amp; she thinks he’s handsome etc. Looking back now I should’ve taken it more seriously but at the time thought not much of it because his dad is very good looking and fit for his age, extremely charming, many people would find him to be handsome. Fast forward to her coming out here, and she’s very much interested in meeting his dad. I started to get a bit worried because T isn’t shy of older men or sugar daddy relationships. And his dad has quite a bit of money that is pretty evident when meeting him. The second to last day T is here my boyfriends dad takes T, my boyfriend, my boyfriends friend, and I out to show us around the city for a day. During this outing I noticed a bit of flirting between his dad and T but I mainly chalked it up to his dad being the smooth people person he is. It wasn’t until it came time to go to dinner that it kinda hit the fan for me. We arrive at the restaurant and T heads to the restroom while everyone else gets a table. W pulled me aside told me he wanted to go back to the house to walk the dogs and check on them because they had been alone for 6+ hours and I was like okay sure I’ll come with you and we planned on just ubering to the apartment and back to the restaurant. Once we got inside and we told his dad our plan his dad was like “No, no, we’ll all go!” very much not wanting to split up the group which complicated things even further. So everyone gets up to leave and T comes back from the restroom and I tell her the plan of going to the house and coming back and she starts tearing up. She was obviously extremely visibly upset so I try and ask her what she wants to do in private because after all she’s on vacation I want her to have fun out here. She basically tells me she’s been waiting all day to be able to connect with W’s dad and to finally get some time to really talk with him. I tell the rest of the group to go on without us and her and I will stay at the restaurant and wait. Apparently this was the wrong choice to have made because she got even more upset that she wasn’t spending that time with W’s dad and sat silent across from me until his dad arrived back. Once he arrived I chatted for a bit then excused myself to the restroom leaving just W’s dad and T at the table. I came back 5 mins later and W and his friend walk in at the same time. We all make our way back to the table and W’s dad excused himself and says he’s headed home for the night. We say our goodbyes and everyone heads back to the table and T is in a noticeably better mood. No one questions it and she and my boyfriends friend order a few more drinks so they’re both drunk as hell by the time we’re leaving. We get back to the apartment and everyone knocks. Next morning T tells me while I went to the bathroom at the restaurant last night W’s dad asked for her instagram and when we were otw home she drunk messaged him “you’re sexy”. I obviously was like oh fuck LMAO then she told me he messaged back reciprocating. That’s when I was like okay I can’t know anymore don’t tell me anything else. I didn’t even know what to say but I knew it was fucked up. I basically told W his dad asked for T’s ig and W said he sensed something going on between T and his dad as it was nothing new for his dad to be into a younger woman. He was furious about it. We drop T off at the airport and think nothing much of it until a few days later T tells me she’s been talking to his dad and he wants to start a life with her and she’s moving out to LA and he’s going to put her in an apartment and pay for her to get her hair done etc, etc. I immediately say yo this is fucked. That’s W’s dad, he has kids, you’re my best friend. Like wtf? I ask if he knows that I know and she says no. I ask if he’s going to tell W and she says he wants to tell him once she moves out here. She’s planning on coming back to visit him the 29th and he’s going to take her shopping. I tell her there’s absolutely no way I’m going to be able to keep this from W, I’m a TERRIBLE liar. She basically says “well think of this as karma for all the shit he’s put you through” I broke down 10 mins later and told W everything. I haven’t responded to her since and I am at a loss at this point as to what to say to her. W basically said if I don’t handle it he will and embarrass her and get his sister involved to confront his dad. I want to avoid this because the whole situation is embarrassing and she’s my friend. She genuinely thinks there is nothing wrong with the situation because they’re “both grown consenting adults”. She is my best friend of 10+ years and I don’t want to lose her but I also know that it’ll be messier if I don’t tell her I told W.",18Feb2020,1

So a year ago when I was 19 I was dumped. We had a bad post breakup argument. I said some horrible mean stuff to her and then blocked her. 

Days later i started to freak out over if I said something that could come off as threatening. 

So I started to panic and think she will get a restraining order. I drove myself INSANE.  

I decided enough was enough and ask a forum. So I posed as my ex gf and asked a question. In the question I did everything in the perspective as my ex gf. And I posed the question as if I made some horrible viscous threats. Like threats about raping or killing her siblings who are minor. Idk why I went to that extreme but I had anxiety that I may have said that

It was so dumb and so stupid. Cause I know I never threatened her. And I forgot I did this till I was cleaning my bookmarks on my laptop and saw it there. Apparently it’s even accessible by google.

1031,"This is hard for me to list out so please bear with me and I will try to give out as much as I can in the comments too.

My ex friend (obviously fake names) Tyler is an 18 yr old and a senior in high school. He's been in a relationship with a girl, Amanda, who's 14 yrs old and a freshmen. They've been together for about 3-4 months and Amanda has been wanting to break up with him since they got together. He used to be very kind and caring, always acting like the best of friends to her before they got together, but once they got together it's like a flip switched. He started to get very controlling and jealous. He would get incredibly upset when she talks to other guys (who she was already friends with). He would tell her not to hang out with them and tell her off. 

Not long after they got together Tyler started to yell at her. Tyler would call her names like ""bitch, slut, a whore"" he would tell Amanda she's worthless and whatnot causing her to have breakdowns in the middle of the street, crying and uncontrollable shaking. He would tell her to get away from her, to not ""fucking touch me"" which usually made her feel like shit. 

Tyler's cheated on her. Recently, he texted a mutual friend telling her he was touching himself to the thought of her, and she had to tell him to NOT send anything. He sent nudes to another mutual friend, involuntary on her part. Both of them wanted nothing sexual to do with him. Tyler's ex girlfriend  wanted to get back together with him and Amanda wanted to him to tell his ex girlfriend that they're togethe, but he never said anything and Amanda had to tell Tyler's ex. 

Now, all this has come straight from Amanda. This next part was hard for me to hear, but at a party they attended together Tyler told her to stay away from him and to not touch him at all. I don't remember how, but it escalated and they went outside where Tyler proceeds to yell at her which prompted some people to come outside and calm things down. Tyler started yelling even more to the point where he had to be held back away from Amanda. Amanda also told me that while answering the phone Tyler, as hard as he could punched her leg three times, twice while on the phone and once after. She had to pretend nothing was wrong. They broke up this Saturday but eventually got back together. She told Tyler everything and forced Tyler to call me out along with a friend of ours. Amanda blocked me but recently unblocked me yesterday. She told me everything that I just typed. Last night he was trying to get back together with her and he is under the impression that they are, but she can't just leave. 

Last night after trying to leave him. He was making some pretty rash decisions. He started cutting himself in an effort to make her stay and manipulate her. And it unfortunately worked. She doesn't want him to hurt himself, but she doesn't want to continue being in the relationship or being around him at all. This isn't the first time he's done it he's had two girlfriends beforehand sophomore and freshman year. Unfortunately, he was still very manipulative and abusive freshman year with his first girlfriend and I'm uncertain about the second one. But this time Amanda Wanted me to do something about it. I asked her and she said yes. Now what we want to do is go to an adult. But we aren't sure when. She wants to be Ready to tell an adult. But I feel like this will only get worse as time goes on and that he's only going to manipulate her even more. Our friend group Now is everything that he's done and we're all in agreement to do something about it. Unfortunately again he has a promising future In music and Amanda doesn't want him to lose the opportunity. 

I'm sorry. This is a long post but it's hard to try to condense it all down without leaving anything out or leaving any major details out. We don't know what to do right now. 

TL:DR : My friend has been in a focus relationship with a manipulative person for three months and wants to leave. She doesn't wanted to ruin his life after he's ruined hers.",18Feb2020,1
1032,"During some weekends and holidays I stay in a house with my brother or cousins and sometimes my cousin and her girlfriend. We will often do activities or go hiking together.

One time during the Christmas period I went to the bathroom during the night and heard my cousin and her girlfriend having sex in their room, it wasn't loud but I could hear them breathing and moaning. I felt really uncomfortable and strange, and I went back to my room as quickly as possible and put some music on to try to get back to sleep.

A few weekends after this they had been out at a party and when they returned I heard them having sex again, I sent a message to my cousin like 'Sorry this is awkward but when I went past your room I heard' and she apologized and said they will make sure they are quiet.

Another night when I was passing their room I heard it again. By this third time I was starting to get paranoid about it or think that I was mishearing, so I foolishly waited by their door for a minute or two so I could listen. They were definitely having sex and whispering to each other during it.

When I went back to my room I started touching myself, I was a mixture of curious, turned on and annoyed. Obviously that made the situation even worse and I can't stop thinking about it.

I know this is completely all my own personal problem. But I get scared to leave my room when they are around now in case I hear it again and I try to check for clues to see if they might be having sex or if they've already done it.

I keep telling myself that it's perfectly normal for them to have sex. It would be different if they were screaming and banging the wall but they aren't - they are doing it in privacy of their room and as quiet as they can. I only hear it because I'm being conscious of it, but I don't know how to go back to normal and forget all about this. I'm not homophobic, they are genuinely nice people that I get on with. I'm totally fine with their relationship, so it's not about that. It's just the sex thing.

I have to stay a few nights with them at the end of this week and I seriously am thinking of trying to avoid going just because of this.

I was talking to one of my other friends and they said that one of my friends in particular     seemed like they are looking down on me, like I am inferior to them. I’ve been thinking about this statement for a while and realized some things are odd. My friend is obsessed with guys (we are in high school anyways) she will date them back to back. She’s probably been through 7 boyfriends this past school semester. On this note. I will come over to her house and she will barely pay any attention to me whatsoever.
It has even gotten to a point where she had asked me to hide in her bedroom closet and pretend I’m not at her house just so she could FaceTime this guy she met and is currently dating.  Next thing, she will make fun of not only me, but my other friends as well. I have an interest that I am really passionate about and I try to talk about it to her. She tells me to “shut up about it”. I have stopped talking about it as much to her but she will make fun of me for it if I even bring it up once.  She will brag about her boyfriends and how she’s better than us because she has a boyfriend (they usually break up in 2 weeks). That was not only towards me but to my other close friend. 
She’s always doing stuff for compliments, she is starting to so drugs because she thinks it’s “cool”, she’s almost never not in a relationship, and puts me down for my interests.

1037,"Background info: 
my bf and I are going to move in together soon. The flat has been his and his mothers home for the last three decades and through some events MIL is retiring and is going to move in with her husband, so I can move in with my bf. We're both in our mid-late twenties and I'm a university student. 

I come from a non-functioning family constellation. I'm very independent and, if it matters, also in therapy because of the issues at home. Moving out means the world to my stress levels and grades! Because of the issues I had to face all my life I'm generally quite wary when somebody offers anything to me. Be it favours, affection or even money. 

MIL is a single mom. Bf is her only child and she crosses a lot of boundaries often, e.g. sneaking into his pitch black room in the morning to bring him coffee. We had a few talks and now she at least doesn't do it when I'm spending the night there. 
She also cooks dinner every evening and I find it overwhelming when she includes me, because I'm simply not used to anybody caring about preparing food for me. However, my therapist assured me that this is common for mothers and I'm simply not used to that kind of affection. 

MIL already payed for bf's and my new couch a few months ago. She earns well, but is retiring in a few weeks. Now she's offered to continue paying the rent until the end of the year to give us ""support"". The thing is, she also mentioned I would get a subtenant contract only by the end of the year. Bf has one atm. MIL will stay the main tenant, although she'll move out entirely in the near future. 

And while that's a generous offer and saves us a lot of money, I'm SO uncomfortable with that. That way I'll move there without a contract, without any paperwork, because she spoke to the landlord and made this decision for me. That neither sounds nor feels right. My bf is on her side because he has a very expensive hobby and would rather spend money on that than on rent. 
 
Bf is now mad at me because I didn't cheer when he told me about this but rather questioned the hidden agenda of his mother. He called me ungrateful and distrustful and apparently I always ruin good things with my attitude. Okay then. 

I'm pissed because MIL acts as if she's entitled to make those decisions for me. I would have spoken to the landlord myself, but MIL keeps her data away from me, e.g. ""I don't have time for that right now"", ""Mrs. Landlord won't know you, this is a sensitive topic, we can't call her so soon!"" Bf called the landlord once without MIL's knowledge and was very unhappy afterwards. 
Seems to me like she has a damn control problem. 
I'd rather live in my car than be dependant on MIL like that. Problem is, I've got pets. 

Am I really ungrateful? And what do I do now?",18Feb2020,1

1040,"So I live in the suburbs. Currently, the house across the street is getting rebuilt and there’s construction workers on the street daily. Today, when I got home from school, the two spaces in front of my house were taken up by an F-250. I pulled into the driveway (my stepmom parks there, so I can’t unless she’s home) and brought my things inside. Whenever the truck left, I backed out and very lightly tapped a car directly across from the driveway. There was MAYBE a scratch, but essentially no damage. 

I immediately turned around and parked, and the woman came out to go to work. She was in a hurry and didn’t notice anything. I feel awful, but I didn’t damage the car so I didn’t say anything or leave a note. She works at a restaurant down the road, so I’m hoping if she notices, she’ll think it was either someone at the restaurant or a construction worker/cement truck.

1046,"Hello, at the point of writing this I am shaking out of fear. It's about 20 minutes past midnight. I think I might actually be hallucinating and I can't relax. I was already in bed, getting ready to sleep and listening to some music. I think I even dozed off for a bit but then I woke up because I didn't turn the light off in my room. When I got up to do that, I saw wasps on the wall in my room. For the background info - I am terrified of wasps, it goes back to my early childhood when I was stung all over my face by wasps. So, without much though, I rushed out my room, slowly and without any sudden moves, grabbed a bathrobe for at least minimal protections against any stings and went back to deal with them. Upon my return, I found no trace of any wasps. Usually they make a really unpleasant sound too, which is in no way quiet, so that just seems unlikely for them to disappear. Add that to the fact that it's winter and the place where I live now never had a population of wasps or even any problem with that just makes me think - was that all in my head? I just can't stop shaking right now and I keep getting sensations that they are on my legs or on my forehead. I don't know how I'll be falling asleep tonight.

1057,"So my girlfriend and I broke up a couple months ago because of my strict mom who wouldn’t let me hangout with her on dates/movies and etc. We also broke up because she doesn’t like my friends as that we make fun of each other a lot and that occasionally involves poking fun at the other person’s partner. So all in all, a couple months later we’re still great friends and she started dating somebody else because she loves him and he’s able to supply him with what I couldn’t. (This isn’t her opinion but now she’s able to go on normal dates and hangout more often, and she likes his friends a little better). The problem is we still love each other. I still love her and so does she. She thinks when her bf goes to college (end of this year) they might be forced to end things there and we’ll pick up things again. She feels bad because she loves the both of us (only I know this) and as much as I like the other guy and as much as I love her being happy, I miss being the cause of that happiness. Could I get any advice of what to do? We wouldn’t be able to date for another year if I continued having feelings for her",18Feb2020,1
1058,"Context: A week ago, me and a few other students witnessed a teacher we care about suffer a seizure (they're okay- it was a 1 time ordeal). I called 911 until help arrived, etc. Now, one of the people who witnessed it and didn't even notice they had a seizure until a few minutes in, on the opposite side of the room, is saying that they're the ones that called 911 and helped save our teacher's life. The person is a regular liar and does whatever they can for attention- so do I confront them about this, or let it play out? They're getting hailed as a hero for it and trying to soak up as much attention as they can get from it and its irritating; everybody, including myself, loves our teacher, and those who do know that this person is lying are pissed, but nobody exactly knows what to do about this.

1059,"Ok, so this is a long one so sorry in advance. There's this guy whose mom is childhood best friends with my mom. I've known him for years, and he acts like a player and flirts with me all the time( I jokingly flirt back too) but is really nice and sweet. So we recently went to a get together with all of our moms' friends and him, his sister and I were just vibin in a room. The sisters makes some comment about how she's too skinny, and I'm like no ur not, at least you aren't fat like me. They both go nooo you're just thiccc af. He then goes out and the sister and I are talking. I drop my phone on her leg, and it bounces, so she's like see, I'm fat. I drop the phone on my leg, and it doesn't bounce cause I have really muscular legs. He comes back in and is like what are you talking about. We tell him and he's like oh lol. I feel the sisters thigh and my thigh to compare, she does the same, and he asks to do the same, I say yes. Then he's like, damn you make me feel conscious about my leg strength. I bet your ass is super muscular too I'm like ok feel it (this is all jokingly, the sister feels my butt too). Fast forward, we're all watching videos on his phone. The sister is sitting between us and I move her hair out of the way, she's like omg no don't touch my hair, and I'm like damn what's the problem. He agrees and touches both our hair and is like what's the big deal. I jokingly say don't grab my hair grab my tits instead. He's like can I actually, and I'm like, uhhh I guess?? so then he lightly touches my boob and is like my life is complete. I roll my eyes. Now fast forward a few hours. The party is over, its 2 am and I'm on my phone in my bed at home. He texts me sending me untitled goose game memes. I laugh and send some back. Eventually, the conversation becomes sexual, and he asks me what my bra size is, I tell him and ask him how big his dick is. He tells me, and asks if I wanna see. I'm a bit uneasy, but I go with it and I'm like sure I guess. He's like send me a pic of your boob first, but if you don't want to, that's ok, I promise I won't ss. I'm like ok and we exchange pics. He was so horny, and his dick was very hard. I was like wtfff. When he saw my pic he was like omg you're so beautiful, and I thought omg no one has ever said that to me before. He then texted me saying I hope you know that you are very pretty and I'm like thanks I guess. This all happened Sunday night/Monday morning. It is now Tuesday and he won't stop texting me, asking where am I, how am I, how he's thinking about me, telling me anecdotes about the dumb shit he did. He lives across from my school, so he takes a pic of it and says I see you. I'm like wtf is happening, cause we usually don't text much. Did he catch feels? Cause I now regret what happened If he did cause I don't wanna be more than friends. What should I do?",18Feb2020,1
1060,"This may sound hasty and poorly written, I’m posting this in multiple subreddits because I really need help. I’m a 16 year old male. To make a long story short, my family’s broke and they’ve been stealing my stuff behind my back to make more money, rather than getting a job. Sometimes they’ll steal stuff I’ve payed for with my own money. I know it’s them who’s selling it, because 

-	Things only go missing when my family is low on money

-	Only things that are worth money go missing. 

-	We live in the middle of nowhere, there’s nobody nearby to even steal my stuff. 

-	Whenever I confront my mom, she gets very defensive, avoids eye contact, and shows various other signs that she’s lying. 

-	We mysteriously “get paid” whenever this stuff goes missing. 

This has been going on for years now. I would be less angry if they just came clean and said “yes, I had to sell some stuff of yours to make ends meet” 
But they get more intrusive each time something goes missing, and now I’m losing items that are genuinely important to me. I’m losing things anywhere between video games, to books sets, to even full consoles and televisions. All of which they disregard with a simple shrug. 

Am I in the wrong? I find it utterly ridiculous how rude they’re being to me. My mother lashes out on me daily, blaming me for her problems and acting like I’m the one being immature whenever I’m upset. I’m never even rude or hostile, I confront her calmly and she ignores me, whenever I do get heated or annoyed THEN she insults me, says I’m impatient and immature. She ignores the good things I do me only sees the things she considers bad. They could easily find other, healthier ways of getting money WITHOUT stealing from me. None of the people in my house even have jobs, they leech off of other family members for money and steal stuff from me. Our only means of income is my uncle’s oil company. I’ve tried getting a job, but my mom won’t even let me get my permit, let alone my license. We live too far away for me to walk to a job. I doubt they’d drive me. Furthermore I have no social security card, insurance, or any of the identification I need to get a job. 

This is so preventable too, they never put the effort in to look for new jobs. Yet somehow it’s all my fault because I have basic needs. Am I being unreasonable for being upset?",18Feb2020,1

I like to look at people as I walk by their desk, so I can smile and say hi to them. And I see their eyes staring right at my crotch. Then, they’ll look up, they’ll see me looking at them, and then they look away quickly and act like I didn’t just see them staring at me. I don’t wear super tight clothes or anything revealing. It’s disgusting honestly, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I can just go up and say “Hey Joe, can you stop staring at my vag?” Any advice on how to deal without making things awkward?

1063,"Today I was told indirectly that I come off as bossy, abrasive, and even condescending to an undisclosed number of my peers. I wasn’t given names or any sort of examples of the behavior. My chosen field is very much collaborative so I definitely need to be able to work with other people well. In addition I honestly don’t want to upset people and consider myself a very friendly person. I legitimately don’t know what I’m doing wrong and am definitely not doing this intentionally. My family has always told me that as a very young child (pre first grade) was very precocious and had a tendency toward bossiness, and they warned me that no one would like me if I was that way. We moved states when I was in first grade and I was bullied pretty constantly until graduating high school. In addition to having depression and anxiety. I became a pretty reserved person. I have recently opened up a lot more and become more outgoing and I started being treated for the mental health issues. Now being told I could off that way I’m really worried. I want to do well professionally and I really desperately don’t want to chase away the friendships that I finally have. How do tell if I’m being that way?

After a few nights of this she called the cops and they watched M sit in his car for a while but said there was nothing they could do. M was physically abusive and has a concealed carry license so the police can’t do anything when an armed man with a violent history is sitting on the sidewalk outside K’s house apparently.

Well today it finally happened he was sitting outside her house and when K went to go inside and M kicked the fuck out of her bad knee that had previously had surgery and when she fell she hit her head and got a concussion. She ran back to her car and locked herself in and M locked himself in his car. Turns M always knew when K would be home because K’s bitch of a roommate L had been telling M.

1077,"Hello, I’m typically a lurker but need to reach out for advice. I don’t know if I’m the bad guy here for thinking the way I do or if there’s a legit problem and need to look for other career opportunities/voice my concerns.

Here’s the first issue: I work in a small human resource department. I’ve been here for about 1.5 years and never really thought of my organization of being a questionable place to work up until recently. Our secretary left last fall so me and the 3 other people in my department rotated shifts to help cover the front desk as we searched for a replacement. No problem. We hired a new generalist/secretary and now I’m the only one helping cover the front desk. I cover for 1/3 of my scheduled work hours and now everyone else is off the hook. I must mention that I typically cover Friday mornings for the 4 hours we are open and that has never bothered me. I asked my manager if I was being observed or put there to be monitored, like a “time out”, and she said, “no, your position has changed and will now be covering the front desk more often.” I have a problem with this as before we hired the new secretary/generalist, a precedent was established that we (the 4 eligible people) are all capable of covering the front desk but now it’s just me and the other guy. I don’t have an issue with covering, it’s that I never received an explanation why it’s just me helping and no one else. Also, the former secretary covered every day but Friday and now the generalist covers the front desk for 2/3 of his time while I cover the other 1/3.

Second issue: My manager has several children with another on the way this spring. She has only worked 2 of the 5 days during the week on-site for the past 3+ years. This was not a problem for me until recently when they started assigning me more projects/tasks without training, support or guidance. It is more difficult for me to try and call/instant message her at home than going to her office to talk things through. To my knowledge, no other managers in my organization have this privilege and I believe it is being detrimental to my performance at work. The thing is, she has worked for our VP for more than 10 years and they are very close.

I feel like bringing up either of these topics to the VP of HR would put me at risk for sounding misogynistic and/or losing my job (they eliminate a lot of positions). I do have a positive working relationship with the VP, I just don’t know how to word any of this as I get very flustered talking about these type of things.

Feel free to ask any and all additional questions to help clarify as I’m new to all of this.

Thanks in advance",18Feb2020,1
1078,"So for the majority of the last 4 years I have been supporting myself and my fiancé, we have never been in the position of ""swimming in cash"" but we have never been late on paying our bills, I've been paying off my debts for the last couple of years when I get some extra cash, along with monthly payments towards my student loans.

 I am now in a position that I am supporting not only myself and my fiance but our 10 month old little man, while she is a stay at home mom like she wanted. She ask me every couple weeks if she needs to get a job. I tell her ""no, we are doing okay."" She has decided that she would pick up a job when he turns one. She wants me to work days, and have been for the last couple months but in turn I lost the dollar difference and it shows. I want to get into a position that i do not have to pull orders as an order selector for more than i have to. There is always new positions opening up, mostly for nights + $1/nights in a freezer +$2. I'm willing to work as much as I need to start a nice savings and make sure he is taken care of and doesn't need to be in a day care and FORCE her to have to work. 


I believe we both have impulse buying, because we have had money saved but it gets spent on stuff we mostly want and not need, so she would like to get a job so she can have her own since now I have put restrictions on what I earn 


I'm needing to know if I should 

1. Talk her out of getting a job and staying at home with him. (I do not restrict her from doing anything, she can go anywhere at any time just with son obviously) 

2. Stick to days and in a low seniority position and pull orders for the next 3-4 years. (I work in a unionized warehouse, seniority rules it all. I am the lowest person on my shift meaning I will not get any jobs that will get me out of pulling orders for the average time of 3-4 YEARS already 1 year in) 

3. Try my luck and get a position on days? (Since seniority means everything positions on day shift go pretty high like 10+ years, nights is not as desirable and freezer isnt either also depends on what days you get off) 

Just a tidbit of info, I've spent most of the last year hating my job, and after a slip and fall last winter in some pain. I've recently started stretching and not in so much pain because of it and helpful videos to help any other issues I may be having with my body.

1082,"My ex had very big breasts so maybe it’s a mental thing. But for some reason, I never raised my standards. I never truly go after women I’m attracted to anymore.

For example, a good friend of mine from middle school has glowed up considerably. I respect women of all shapes, sizes and ethnicities.

But ever since my latest break up, I associate large breasted women to cheating and drama. Because that’s what I had to deal with regarding my ex. (Ex boyfriends having shit to say, being friends with disrespectful seedy men. Body shaming me when we’d fight.)

She threatened pregnancy and suicide on me both times I’ve tried to break up with her. We finally broke up and I feel free, however I’ve dramatically lowered my standards as though I’m not worthy of a beautiful woman again. (My ex was objectively beautiful but horrid personality). 

Now the friend I grew up with and I don’t talk anymore. We just disconnected. She has a little girl but she’s a single mom. She likes my pictures on Instagram every once and a while. Not consistently though. She’s developed quite well, but when I see her large breasts I’m overcome by two very different yet unusual emotions. Arousal of course but then it’s followed up by deep anxiety/depression. Like when I’d look at my ex’s “thirst traps” on Instagram. She’d have countless dudes trying to get her. She never even made an effort to make it clear that she was in a relationship. 

So this unusual anxiety ridden arousal has put me in a position to not only avoid the girl I like from middle school (single mom with daughter), but I avoid all beautiful women all together because I feel like I’d just be taken advantage of again. 

I’ve been kinda man whoring myself around with women I don’t consider very attractive. I’m concerned about my sex life because I’m at a point where I pursue women I don’t deem attractive and I avoid women I consider beautiful. It’s most likely because rejection from somebody you don’t consider attractive doesn’t hurt half as bad as rejection from a really beautiful, decent minded girl. 

How can I properly talk to women again?

How do I restore the confidence my ex ruined?

How do I stop sleeping around in order to avoid/neglect emotional damage?

I told him I only had sex with that guy but after that I definitely wasn’t doing it again. I asked him why he messaged me and he did not reply. He unmatched with me. 

I’m in college. The guy who I had sex with and the guy who messaged me are black and so am I. I’m afraid that he has somehow told every black guy here. I also like a guy that is in the same year as him and is also black. Im afraid if I approach him ever he will know I’m the girl who slept with his friend. I’m afraid that people will think I’m a slut when I’ve only ever slept with two people. I FEEL like a slut for letting myself be used like that. I regret it, I can’t change it, and it never leaves my mind. I can’t do my homework. I want to leave my school or and I’ve thought about killing myself (I definitely WILL NOT kill myself but it crosses my mind often) because I see no way out. 

Nothing else has happened besides the messages from that one guy. But I feel worthless, like I’ve ruined my whole image and my whole life. I don’t know what to do. I messaged the guy I slept with and asked why his friend texted me but he has unfriended me on Snapchat so he probably will never see it. I feel like scum and I don’t want to keep living like this. I’m afraid this will follow me and ruin things in my future somehow. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Thanks!!",18Feb2020,1

I want to be polite and say yes, but I also am not interested in her romantically. Should I just say yes to the coffee then make it clear that I don't have romantic interests should the situation arise? Or would it be too forward to say something like, ""I would love to grab coffee sometime!

They trash talk each other, although my mom tends to do this more than the father. Now, when i try to get my mom specifically to not vent to me and seek a professional because this hurts to hear, they ignore it.  In recent years,S my dad has stopped this and understands that it is an emotional train wreck to put me through when they both vent about one and the other. My mom on the other hand, will not take opinions, research, and claims she knows the best of everything for me. She is strongly Antivax, and claims i need 14 hours of sleep as a 15 year old. This has caused me to become a depressed, introverted person.

1093,"Hi, using a throw away as both me and my boyfriend are big reddit users

I have super bad social anxiety disorder, diagnosed ten years ago now, and I greatly suffer with social situations, to the point where I over compensate massively in conversations and I’m always nervous I’m talking too much. My past relationship was abusive, and this was something that was targeted a lot (e.g. I would be pushed around or humiliated in a group for talking too much) for years I’ve tried to convince myself that I’m not being annoying by having a conversation, I’m just talking like a normal person and it’s my anxiety and past trauma that is convincing me otherwise, and I managed to get back to a relatively good place, not panicking after every social interaction. 

This was until about half and hour ago. I was having dinner with my boyfriends mum (a massive source of anxiety as I’m constantly scared of her thinking I’m not good enough for her son) and afterwards I made a passing comment to my s/o that maybe i spoke too much in the conversation. He agreed. It hurt, but I appreciated the honesty. He went on to say that I tend to come across as ‘braggy’ despite me not meaning too and that I come across as trying way too hard, and maybe that’s why I have trouble making friends.

I had a total melt down, I had a massive panic attack, and couldn’t stop crying up until a couple minutes ago. He understandably got quite angry with me as he felt there was nothing he could do to help as everything he said seemed to make me spiral more, I tried to tell him I couldn’t help this reaction but I guess that anger was deserved as I panic a lot and I don’t blame him for getting sick of me. 

I feel like very fear about myself socially has just been confirmed, and I want to hide away and never talk to anyone ever again. How do I stop fucking up every social situation and friendship I have by being so annoying? Am I just doomed as a bad person that no one is ever going to like being around? Even my boyfriend is getting sick of my shit. I just don’t know what to do anymore, it seems like I can’t do anything right. I don’t even feel like I’m trying that hard in situations, but it comes across like I am. How the fuck do I talk to people like a normal person??",18Feb2020,1
1094,"I've always been the ""joker"" or carefree guy at work or wherever. I guess it's who I enjoy being? I do like to quite down and chill too but I suppose everyone percieves me as the totally outgoing guy which I can't deny. Though, what bothers me is that they have a knack of making fun of me basically bullying the shit out of me. Even if it's for fun it's clear that I'm the target for that so called ""fun"" most of the time. I have already cut a lot of people off because of this and tonight, I feel like I'm going to do it again. It's really unfair and I can't take that bullshit anymore. I'm not joyful and carefree so people can just do or say whatever the fuck they want to me. 

Also, I really hate messing with people. Especially in a consistent basis. So I do not do this to other people. 

I get the whole idea of standing up for yourself thing but for me, it's really not worth the hassle and drama. How do I basically stop being the target? What are some measures I can take to prevent this from happening?",18Feb2020,1
1095,"I became friends with a girl a few months ago. I'm interested in her, but I wouldn't say I have feelings for her or anything like that. She has a kid who is fucking awesome and who I love and have an awesome little friendship with. She's also seeing someone and I'm not staying in my area for very long, so I can't really get into anything with her...

I'm 26 and have always wanted to have a family when I grew up. I've never been in a particular rush to have a family before I'm financially ready, but on a mental level, I've been ready to have kids for probably 10 years (and I'm not just saying that, most of my family and friends would agree with me.)

I've hung out with this girl and her kid a couple of times now and it's just the most amazing thing and it makes me so happy to have such a great time with them, but there is a downside...

Every time we hang out, a few hours later I get on quite a downer for a day or two. I have a great tendency to overthink things and that's obviously happening here. But as well as that, I feel like hanging out with them is giving me a taste of that family life that I desperately want to have, which is amazing in the moment, but when it's passed, I feel down because it's over and the realisation that I don't have/can't have that life yet weighs quite heavily on me.

I don't want to stop hanging out with them (or just her), because I do enjoy the times we have together.

(But look at me, writing all this on Reddit...it clearly means more to me than I want to admit.)

It's just difficult to cope with the down sometimes. Writing these words help me process my thoughts and it's helpful to see it all written down. Feel free to add your thoughts or anything you think I can do to help. I just want to stop thinking about it so much now. It's tiring.",18Feb2020,1
1096,"Hi, weird one here, I started a rental agreement last year and it's due to expire in 2 weeks or so.
My agent has left the real estate so I'm guessing someone else is handling our property now - we were never told, we only figured out she left when we didn't receive emails and she wasn't listed as an agent on their website anymore.

Anyway, one month prior I sent an email stating the lease won't be renewed and that I am moving elsewhere with a different real estate.
I allowed 28 days in case they decided to pull any shit.

To now: 2 weeks before I move into the new property and 2 weeks til my current lease expires, I am told that I owe $600 or so as my lease expires on the 17th.

I checked my paper copy of the lease agreement and it states it ends on the 6th.
I contact the agent and tell them this and they tell me that I still need to pay - something about not staying the whole month or something very unclear.
I asked her to explain but she couldn't, she just said ""you get it, right?""

She said she'll send an email so now I am waiting for that.

This whole rental has been bullshit from the real estate not communicating with us clearly about inspections and due dates for payments and other info, and now they are trying to make us pay for something that we were never told about and it's not stated anywhere in our copy of the paperwork.

Has anyone ever had this issue before? I have paid rent each month on time and no damage to the property so I can't think of where this payment will be going!

Tl;dr: my real estate is trying to make me pay more than what's agreed to in the lease to move out. Based in AUSTRALIA 🇦🇺",18Feb2020,1
1097,"Hi guys. First post here.

I was recently given a new position on a new team at my work. I was really excited about it. Everyone was really welcoming at first.

Training happened and stuff started getting weird. My coworker doing the training refueed to answer my questions. She would roll her eyes, snap at me, and keep telling me to wait a minute. I figured it was me being sensitive, but I went to my supervisor with a question that couldn't wait and the girl stormed into the office and started cussing me out for no reason. 

She did this in front of our supervisor. Nothing was done. The girl flat out told me to my face she hated me and refused to train me because of that.  The supervisor apologized on her behalf, but the girl is now ignoring me per supervisor's instructions. She wasn't written up and they all told her it was okay.

Now, the whole team is icing me out. I'm not being given work, I'm the last to hear about anything, and they do petty crap like going out to lunch without me. 

My supervisor says not to take anything personally and let it blow over, but the nasty attitude is really getting to me and I am hating coming to work every day

Well, I don't know if this is the right place for this post but here goes. So, I am  from Portugal, 25 years old and the other day at the disco (clube/party) I exchanged a lot of looks with a 19 year old girl, she seemed to make a point of always trying to make eye contact with me, but at the same time she seemed shy. Until the next day I sent her a friend request and she accepted it immediately, other people who were with me also sent her but got no answer, so that's when I realized that in fact it was the looks for me. The problem is that I wanted to talk to her, but I left about a year and a half out of a 3-year relationship, and ""lost"" the skills to approach someone new, in other words, how am I going to talk to her? I didn't just want a ""hello everything"". I'm not much of a guy to chat like that on the net with girls, and since I was so long without being single, and then ""recovering"" from the relationship I lost my skills. I thought it was interesting, and I would like to get to know her better, but the question of age difference also leaves me a little behind, she may find it strange I don't know, because I don't look 25 I hope you can help me ahah thanks 😊",18Feb2020,2

I’m not big on romantic gestures, or physical affection.

1109,"A friend of mine (young adult) let's call her Jess moved back to her dad's home in London, about 8 months ago, she lives there with her dad, step mum and their child / her half sibling Dan who's about 9

She's not had the easiest time with step mum and step mum clearly has a vendetta against her and hasn't wanted her to live there and makes her life difficult by making mountains out of molehills. But worse than that she's recently said that her step mum is abusing her young half sibling Dan, hitting him. It's never enough abuse to leave a mark or injure but it happens frequently and unapologetically. The step mum also kicks the dad and frequently starts shouting matches with everyone and generally sounds miserable and unkind. The dad imo should be defending his kids but apparently doesn't do much other than comfort the youngest when he cries about it. Apparently he doesn't want her to leave him and hes worried she would get full custody of the abused child also and so he's enabling the step mum's behaviour. As they are the only ones in the house to witness the abuse it's not like the abuse can be reported and it not come back on my friend. I'm doing what I can to support and let her vent. Any suggestions about what she should do?

I kinda wanna suggest that she speak to her half sibling about the abuse and record it as evidence incase it's ever needed.. but I don't want to overstep because I cannot imagine what it's like being in her situation having never experienced a situation like this, and I'm also concerned for her becoming homeless if she as much as looks at her step mum the wrong way.

1114,"Hi.. 

So, I’ve just gotten an 8 week old Labrador retriever, I’ve had him for 5 days and I’ve had, essentially, a mental-breakdown, close to everyday. I’m 18 years old, never had the responsibility of owning a puppy. The reason I was so bent on getting a puppy was because I though it was help with my horrible depression and anxiety disorder — my hope was that it would help make me feel less lonely all the time. 5 days in and I’m constantly, uncontrollably and hysterically crying out of overwhelmingness and frustration. He has so many accidents in the house and I can’t leave the room for -1 second before he is crying, yelling and barking at the top of his lungs. I can’t even go pee. He sleeps in my bedroom, in his doggy bed... I’m lucky to get 3 hours of sleep. I want to start putting him in a crate while he sleeps, in the hopes of helping him sleep the whole night through without waking me up. I’d also like to be able to keep him in the crate when I have to leave the house for a little while.. but I put him in there for not even 1 minute, just to get him use to it, and he immediately starts barking and crying (I’ll try and post a video for you to see). I, so far, haven’t been able to leave the house, let alone leave him in a room, alone since I’ve gotten him. I’m so stressed and scared of this massive commitment I’ve just made. I don’t know what to do.. my family members have already become attached and I feel awful if I were to give him up and throw the towel in, already. They all work and have their own social lives and are unable to really help with my new puppy, other than spending an hour, at most, playing with him. I feel trapped and more alone than ever. I haven’t left the house since I’ve gotten him..
