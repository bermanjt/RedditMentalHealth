0,"So, I have been told multiple times from several instructors of my college program that I come off as aloof or careless in classroom settings, but I exceed very well in professional settings (with patients). I have been told this for a long time and I do not take offense to it, but I can’t seem to figure out how to stop presenting myself this way. Any advice?",22Apr2020,1
1,"My (22M) last 2 relationships ended very badly - 5 year reletionship ended because I was cheated on and then she left me for another guy entirely, then this girl I fell for very hardly said after about 7 months I was a rebound (I made the mistakes and ignored the red flags).

Anyway I've finally got myself to a place where I'm really happy being on my own and finally getting my mental health back on track but I've been speaking to this girl who since the start I always said I'm not ready for anything serious or any pressure to take it further. She was happy and we spoke as normal and saw each other a few times before lockdown. 

Recently she has said how she is looking for a relationship and speaking to other guys which doesn't really bother me as I know we are in different places in life and wouldn't hold her back but I also feel like it's made me realise I have some degree of feelings towards her, however I'm really not ready or not wanting a reletionship of any kind.

Is this normal? I always thought if I had feelings for someone I'd want to pursue something

Thank you for any advice!",22Apr2020,2
2,"Hi! I’m gonna be a sophomore in college next year and I could really use some advice!

To start off with: I have known all my friends in this group since freshman orientation, I try and do whatever I can and always be there for them! Never ask for any money or favors. They have currently been excluding me (tells me they do, literally tell me to my face that they hang out/talk to so and so with the intent in knowing i wasn’t invited), 

They have kind of used me for money (made me pay $20 for weed and I only got to smoke half a blunt, they also paid for part of it but they smoked it every night for over a month straight without inviting/saving some for me lol)

 once said we were going out to eat (Waffle House at 11pm on a Saturday) but then secretly drove to a parking lot to get high (i was inwardly terrified bc cops, also driving when high??), then after they smoked started to drive up a mountain while high ( I go to college in the mountains) and i had a panic attack and they eventually drove back to campus being upset with me

One friend apart of the group also said they would come to a concert but bailed on the night before when I bought them a $50 ticket, 

they talk down/exclude other people, have constant drama with each other (ex, two people have a crush on the same guy, guy gets into drama/fights, constant making out with each other and more drama ensues from that, etc)

However there have been 2 times where I felt kind of treated poorly and snapped at them about it (and later apologized) 

The first time was because one of the girls I was friends with in the group texted me at midnight and said “Jeremy ran away because he was sad because he thinks you don’t like him and I don’t know what to do” so i grabbed some of the stuff they had left from my dorm previously in the week and headed over there to find Jeremy and tell him I’m sorry and that we were friends and of course I liked him! But as soon as I got there I needed to be let in, cause I can’t get into another dorm without a specific key card so I asked if they could let me in and they told me it “wasn’t a good time right now” and I got really upset and angry cause it was 12 am and I was locked out?? It was 28 degree whether (below freezing) When I texted her I was gonna come over bc it sounded like an emergency? Anyways I ended up leaving feeling kind of used and worried.

The second time I snapped bc it was the last day before spring break and after spending the day prior helping my friend Zeke move to another dorm (lifting shelves, packing boxes, bc they didn’t get along with their roommate - also this is their 3rd time moving this year, I helped him move all 3 times previously) they all went out for a good bye dinner and they didn’t invite me :( after hours of helping zeke move when most of the people who were invited bailed on helping him move. But then I apologized to them for snapping cause It shouldn’t be the end of the world - and I had a test they day after to study for.



TLDR: I’m not a perfect friend, however while they have their ups i don’t know how happy i am being their friend. I wouldn’t have any other friends to hang out with either if I left. Sorry for such a long post.",22Apr2020,2
3,"I have recived all my decisions I got into almost every school I applied to ( coast guard academy, merchant marine academy, and recived a full ride to syracuse university with an Air force Rotc scholarship. I also got into every instate school and recived full coverage of tuition for nau.) Around my junior year of highschool I rember talking to my uncle, who was an engineer for Budweiser and spends his time flipping houses and managing his properties, I asked him how he managed to do so well for himself. He told me that it was a combination of hard work and intelligent investing. He told me to read the book rich dad poor dad  so I did. After reading that book my passion for finance and investing consumed me. I took a lot of my money and invested it into the stock market ( p.s I my money has grew 12%). My plan for life is to get a high paying job and continue investing my money. I hope to one day have enough money to buy a duplex and rent out the other half to establish cash flow. I also want to own a number of other rental properties. I realize that having a high paying job earlier in life will allow me to achieve my goals.

 I have always had an interest in serving, but am not sure how service will fit in with my life plan. No one in my family was in the millitary, but a very close family freind was in the air force and told me that it was one of the best experiences of his life and provided him with so many opportunities down the road. My parents are very irresponsible with money as such I have no college fund and my relationship with my parents is very rocky. Once I graduate they want me out of the house. I decided to apply to the millitary academies and rotc, because it will provide me with the many opportunities and help me pay for college and pursue a career i have been interested in. 

Truth be told I am hesitant to accept these offers. I realize that millitary service is a huge commitment and may not be right for me. I can imagine myself as an officer, but realize I will be giving up completly diffrent life I cant experience. I guess I want to know if the connections and training I will recive while serving could help me get a high paying job down the line. I am confused on how much money I will make once I commission as an engineer/officer. I belive that the leadership skills and technical education I will recive will help me become successful later on. Is joing the military a smart fincial move and do you think I should take the opportunities that I have been granted? Also will I still be able to pursue my interest in real estate while in the millitary?  

These are my options. ( I also want to say that I am grateful for all the opportunities I have recived)

1. Coast guard academy (their engineering is top teir and when I am serving in the coast guard the odds of me being serving near shore is higher than most of my other options)  after graduation I will serve 5 years active duty and 3 in the reserve.

2. Merchant marine academy ( they specialize in the maritime industry and graduates can choose to serve in the maritime industry or commission in any other branch of the millitary and some have even gone to become FBI agents or join the DHS. I am interested in the maritime industry, but am concerned about the current state of the maritime industry and I dont know how well I will respond to being on a boat for 6 months out of the year. The benefits is that graduates make anywhere from 80k to 100k and are guaranteed a job. I am leaning toward this option because I could make a lot of money out of college and still play an important role in maintaining the economic security of the u.s.) 

3. Syracuse or instate school with air force rotc ( I will recive room, board, a monthly stipend, and full tuition as well as have the opportunity to live a more civilian lifestyle.). If I went to syracuse I could do a 4+1 and get a degree in electrical engineering and MBA. 

4. I could go to NAU as a civilian where my tuition is covered but not room and board plus not as many opportunities to make connections and not as many opportunities. 

5. I could go to instate with rotc then transfer to embry riddle.",22Apr2020,1
4,"so i am f14 and before anyone says anything, i know im young ok. 

so this all happened last summer when i was still thirteen in a summer camp.
there was this caretaker who was 15 turning 16 who was compared to the people i know in my area very good looking. so as young teenagers do, i joked with a friend about having a crush on him, which eventually everyone knew of. him as well.

so at the end he gave me his number and a few days later he came over to my house and we watched a series. i felt weird and it ended with us kissing and i noticed me asking myself if this how its supposed to feel like.
he left at some point but for some reason we met again. at 1 oclock in my stareway. he did go under my underwear but i gently pushed his hands away..

then we met AGAIN. this time at his house. 
so it started with kissing and making out.
then everything happened so fast. 
i felt his fingers inside me.
i wanted to stop him but i couldnt say it.
btw he was 16 at that time..
he grabbed my hand and pulled it toward his intimite area and not wanting to be mean or idk what i was thinking i jerked him off. 
luckily, we were interupted by his mom coming home.

i went home crying, and feeling really bad for not being able to stop him. 
after that i told him that i wasnt ready and he sadly accepted it.
a few months later in the evening i went out with my dog when i met him jogging. he doesnt live far away from me. he stops and we talked and then he kissed me again. he pulled me onto a bank saying we should have sex roght now. i refused but he went like come on theres nobody here. i managed to say no and he eventually stopped.

now i panic everytime i see someone even remotely similar to him or just a jogging person.
what should i do? i dont really want to go to therapy

btw im from germany idk if all of that has anything to do with the age of consent here",22Apr2020,2

Hi! I'm pretty new to all of this but a friend of mine suggested I hope on here and look for some advice!

Any way, I am a 22 year old college student with NO CREDIT, or so I thought :|. A while ago I got approved for my first apartment and it was great but the landlord mentioned I needed a co-signer which was fine, I could ask my Mom to co-sign. But after looking through the application I clicked on the ""see your credit report"" link. I have been on this earth for 22 years and have NEVER applied for credit or for anything that would require me to need credit. When I opened the link my credit score was 448?! I was so confused because I know that to have somewhat good credit you need a score of at least 600. So I was baffled to say the least and I went to my Mom to ask her why my credit could have been this low, come to find out, when I was 7 years old my social security number was comprised? I guess whoever was using has and is still using it to this day. There were countless credit card applications and other ""fraudulent"" use that had been placed under my name.

As hard as this is to believe, this is my reality right now and I have no idea how I am going to apply to lease a car or even start to establish my credit. Unfortunately, my Mother doesn't want to help because she already agreed to co-sign for my apartment. I am very responsible with my money and have always paid my Mom for my parts of the bills ON TIME. I'm sad that my Mother is dropping this on me, and never thought to tell me earlier so I could fix this problem.

But all I can do is figure out how to fix this issue. Does anyone have any advice how to erase fraudulent use or to clear my name so I can build MY OWN credit?",22Apr2020,1

10,"Hi everyone, 

This is my first time posting on this forum so I created a throwaway account because I’m shy. 

So yesterday I discovered a purchase of $3000 had been made on an store account of mine through a confirmation email. Soon after, my email inbox came under fire from a DoS(?) attack. I’ve been getting 1000+ emails an hour for the past day. It’s very annoying and I’m assuming the person did this to cover their tracks. 

I reviewed my store account and found the shipping address for the items and a credit card/billing address I did not recognize at all. The name on the billing and shipping addresses was my own. I’m assuming whoever logged in as me was also using another person’s stolen credit card. The billing and shipping locations weren’t even close. I reported it to the store’s help desk and they said they’d cancel the order etc. I also filed a FTC complaint. 

Is there:

a) Anything else I should do? It makes me sad/angry to think someone would try to steal that amount of money from someone especially in a time like this. 

b) Anyway to stop these spam emails???

13,"I lost my passion somewhere during the middle of undergrad. I'm finishing up my first year of my masters right now. I'm assuming this semester is going to end ok, but even if it does I don't know if I'll continue, because I'm 0% interested in doing this for a living.

I've been depressed off/mostly on since I was 13/14(so about 10 years now), but that didn't always affect me. When I was younger, I read a lot, I studied things I was interested in outside of school, and I painted, drew, and knitted in my free time regardless of depression. Now I'll knit occasionally.

Lately I've started to be interested in things again. I want to regain my interest in learning a second language and am somewhat on my way there, but I can't really get myself to do anything. When I was in high school I'd study at least 2 hours a day, and I think the only reason I stopped is I reached a point where I couldn't do it alone since I didn't know anyone who spoke the language and my college didn't offer it (Korean). Now I'm interested in a different language and I know people who speak it, but I've only just begun to learn how to read it, despite being interested in it for closer to a year.

I also have interest in possibly doing school for something different since I'm fortunate enough to be debt free at the moment.

17,"TL;DR at the bottom

So long story short. 5 yrs ago, my family forced me to move to a new city that I ultimately hated. Not only did I hate the city, but my family became more abusive, to the point where I would cry myself to sleep constantly. I've been suicidal ever since I moved and my family never helped me.

But while in this new city, I met someone who, at the age of 20, would become my first best friend. We did everything together, talked everyday, and basically texted each other other until we both went to bed. She was the only person I had ever met that understood me. We went to church together to (that's where we met). We were basically inseparable.

I fell in love with her. I thought she was perfect, and even though I knew she would never love me romantically, I thought we'd be friends for a very very long time. We would always talk about how much we hated the city we lived in, and that we would move away and live together. 

But then one day she started avoiding me; leaving my texts on read, avoiding me at church, and making lame excuses as to why she couldn't hang out. She cut me out with no explanation, during another one of the hardest times in my life.

Once I realized that she no longer wanted me around, I basically broke. I distanced myself even further from everyone around me, I went back to feeling abandoned and unloved and my social anxiety sky rocketed. 

It took several months, almost a year, to completely forget about her. It came to a point where her abandonment didn't hurt me anymore and I was able to move on.

I finally moved away from that city. I didn't bother telling her because it's not like she would have noticed if I was gone, right? 

4 months later, I went to my old church (I was wanting to see someone there). Instead, my ex friend approached me. She asked me how I liked my new place, and called me out for moving without telling her. She tried to talk to me like things were normal, but I had nothing to say to her and wished she didn't notice me in the first place.

To make it hurt even more, another friend of mine had told me that my ex-friend didn't even notice I was gone until someone told her 3 months later. And my ex-friend said the reason she didn't ask me herself was because she didn't know how to text me. 

It's been a month since I last saw her, but now she's on my mind again. I can't stop thinking about her and it's driving me nuts. I need to get her out of my head, and permanently. Does anyone have ANY suggestions?

They also state that this does not cease when the flight disruptions are outside of the carrier’s control

On the other had. The CTA issued a statement advising airlines to offer only a 24 month voucher/airline credit. That’s pretty much it.

My tolerance levels have been slowly depleting the last couple of months and I blew up a bit. I said things I regret saying and the argument left with everyone leaving in a huff, with no real conclusion. 

I feel bad about how everything was said but not about what was said. My childhood was rough due to my parents constantly fighting and sometimes taking out their frustrations on me and my brother. I'm pretty sure I ended up with some form of trauma and I let my mom know this. She got defensive and starting yelling about things that really had no relevance to our primary argument before leaving. I'm in a weird stage of feeling both numb and too emotional right now. 

I've known for a while now that my emotional and mental state were getting worse the longer I stayed here. I had planned to move back to the states before the world went on lockdown. I had my tickets set up and everything was packed up. Idk how long I'll be staying here but I honestly don't think I can last much longer. Everytime my brother or mother try to talk to me, I shut down. It gets them even more agitated and I retreat even further into myself. Anytime I try to bring it up in a civil manner, my emotions get the best of me and I end up choking up and my mother would get visibly irritated with me as if I'm acting this way on purpose. I can't help it, so I just shut down even more so as to not come off as playing the victim.

I spent my savings on my tickets out of here (small island nation), so I can't spend what little I have left on online therapy, I can't move out, and I choke up every time I try to bring it up to fix things between me and my immediate family.

29,"I'm an adult and me and my father live separately. I live with my sister. The other day we had a family Zoom call. That day I happened to be at my partner's apartment. We had both self-isolated for 3 weeks, I ride my bike so public transportation isn't an issue, and he lives alone. I asked my sister if she was okay with it and she said yes. 

I did participate during the family Zoom call via mobile whereas my sister publicly declared to the family that she was lonely because it was Easter and she wanted them to stay on the call and hangout. (For the record, she doesn't remember most holidays unless it's on her Instagram feed and she's not very religious although I think she still calls herself a Christian. At the same time, she gets very ""depressed"" if she doesn't do something big to celebrate and holds me at fault if I don't make up some plan with her.)

Needless to say, her lonely woes prompted the family to ask where I was. And she told them I went to visit a friend. Now, my father wants to talk to me and it's pretty obvious it's about this. I feel like the role she played was immature on her part and that if she felt uncomfortable with me leaving the house then she should have said so initially, instead of telling the whole family.

But this isn't even the advice I'm looking for. I know my dad will try to down talk me because since I was a child if I made a mistake he will talk about it nonstop and pretty much outline how stupid I am. He'll clearly be mad that I visited anyone during the pandemic and he's not very subtle so he'll probably ask questions about the details of the visit. (He previously has asked why I'm on birth control, so he doesn't let personal matters stay personal.) It's giving me a lot of anxiety because I don't know how to approach the situation or what to say in response. He hasn't called just yet but keeps saying he wants to talk to me.

31,"I am used to speaking in person; so with this whole switch to online, I am afraid I'll sound too direct in my emails. Basically, what has happened is that due to errors when transferring transcripts and covid-19 delays, I am stuck taking just one class a semester for three semesters because of a missing pre-requisite. That would kill my aid and severely delay my graduation.

I was wondering if I should add some sort of ""I am sorry to bother you"" or a better way to introduce myself?

Here is my email below:

&gt;Dear Professor Doe:  
&gt;  
&gt;I hope all is going great. My name is John Doe, and I am a current computer science student here in Uni trying to enroll for your course. Unfortunately, due to misunderstandings when transferring over my transcripts and the Covid-19 delay, I was not awarded the required prerequisite and was placed in ABC XXXX. I saw in the course description that with the right permission I would be able to take them concurrently and was told to contact the professor of the course. I also certainly believe I am able to perform in this course and have strong prior knowledge.  
&gt;  
&gt;I would greatly appreciate your help with this matter as since I have all other classes fulfilled; not being able to take this course would leave me with only one course to take, thus cutting my aid and severely delaying my graduation date down the road since every course is a prerequisite of one another, especially BCD XXXX which is the main starting point. Thank you in advance for your time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Best regards,John Doe

We were aspiring to possibly make a band and record music together online. But as time passed and the two in the group grew closer i kept feeling more left out and uninterested when they were around. They have wanted me to open up more and when I do little by little so does the distance. Everytime i have a problem or issue they just manage to make me feel worse and even add stress. Bc one acts like theres a easy solution and that i will be okay and the other remains silent, idle, and half assed. I even took a week away from them only to come back and still almost immediately feel like I dont belong and not needed. While the stress waa gone during the week alone I felt very depressed and lost of interest of what i usually do. I rly dont have friends and it was my dream to make music with others but it rly feels down the drain. If i leave how will pick myself up? Where do i go or look?

33,"Let me begin by saying he is a good friend, I’ve known him for a long time and I love him like a brother. However, he really does have some characteristics that disappoint me and I forever wish would change...

I’ve always considered him to be rather on the selfish side. He’s always took advantage of a situation or doesn’t make an effort unless it benefits him somehow. Me personally, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and help out where I can without thinking of what I’m going to gain in return. This is where we clash and it upsets me when I can’t get my point of view across.

I can give you plenty of examples where I’ve gone to a lot of effort, financially or in committed time to help my friend. And there have been times I’ve expected a favour in return and it hasn’t materialised in quite the same way.

My friend is self employed and due to the COVID-19 lockdown, he is currently unable to work. A lot of his income is made from sub contracting and he pays 20% Construction Industry Scheme Tax (CIS).

He has several thousands of pounds saved but currently no new income. As a result, he’s asked me to dedicate some of my time to claim universal credit online on his behalf. He’s not very good on computers and asked me to submit the claim for him. It took me a few hours to go through all the questions and get all the information. The benefit he’s entitled to is based on his current finances.
 
I came to learn about his financial situation and he does have enough money to survive, he has been granted a mortgage holiday and council tax holiday. It’s helped him out a lot and it’s good companies are doing this to ease the burden on self employed people.

My friend is entitled Universal Credit benefit and that is fair to acknowledge.

My friend lives with his girlfriend. He owns the house, she pays some money towards food and general bills. It’s never been a lot of money but now he’s out of work, he’s asked her to pay more. He’s asked her to pay for the bills he hasn’t had a deferral on, like food, gas and electric. I completely understand the logic here but can’t ignore the fact he has several thousand of pounds saved in his bank.

You may know that the government have confirmed they will pay 80% of self employed peoples wages whilst they are out of work due to COVID. This means my friend will get most of his income for staying at home and he is fully well entitled to it given the situation. I understand this payment is separate to the Universal Credit scheme he’s claiming money from.

What I am mostly bothered about it this...

I mentioned earlier my friend is a sub contractor and pays 20% tax. Each financial year, he submits a claim to get a chunk of that tax back through working expenses. What I do know is he makes claims which don’t always strictly come under business expenses, they do include personal purchase or allowances he’s had credits elsewhere. This is probably common practice with most CIS people.

My friend got a tax refund a couple of days after I helped him submit his Universal Credit Benefit claim. It’s a few thousand pounds.

I said that tax refund should be declared as the Universal Credit agreement said any changes to circumstances including new payments must be recorded. It will obviously reduce his benefits and so he said he won’t declare it, meaning he’s falsely claiming he has less money in order to get more money from the tax payer. Basically it’s benefit fraud.

All things considering, I thought the right thing to do was to submit the additional income to the claim. My friend didn’t want me to do that and was furious when I did, and has since threw some insults, said he’s told other friends and I’m out of order for doing that and has now stopped talking to me.

I do feel bad for declaring his additional income knowing it would reduce his benefit. But I felt it was the right thing to do. This virus has damaged the economy massively and acting greedy claiming benefits you’re not entitled to seems very wrong. I am upset my friend has reacted the way he has.",22Apr2020,1

36,"I (19F) just finished my first year at University of Toronto. The whole self isolation thing has given me a lot of time to think about my current situation in regards to my schooling. 

I don't like most of the people who I go to school with. Everyone at the University of Toronto is very pretentious, and it really rubs me the wrong way sometimes. I feel like besides my 4 closest friends, I'd much rather stay in my dorm and live seperately from every one, avoid parties and talking to people that I don't have to. Halfway through this semester I had a breakdown on the phone with my boyfriend and explained to him how I just hated everything about the place, and that university to some was the best 4 years of their life, and my experience was nowhere near that. 

At this point I feel like I would rather quit school, get a full-time job and make enough money to move out and be financially independent of my parents, and pursue my dream to write a novel. But on the other hand I still want to finish school and apply to law school.

37,"Years ago now, I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and severe depression after a small series of unfortunate events took place in a very short amount of time. I essentially broke completely. I fear that I am reaching a point of no return, but i just cannot get my mind right.

I have gone to a therapist for over 2 years, twice per month. It never really helped, it was just nice to have someone to talk too. I have no real friends anymore, the last ones I had are partly why I feel so broken. I don't really have much family left either. The family I still have live a long distance away and we've never been very close.

I've tried two different types of prescriptions from my doctor. I noticed no change at all. If anything it made me feel worse, I just thought ""Wow I'm so broken not even this can help?""

I am now just in a bad spot where I feel like I've exhausted my options and I have no hope for ever repairing my shattered mind. I am not suicidal, as that is not something I am capable of, however I do not value my life. I do believe that my inaction will cause me an early death, and I sometimes welcome the idea of it. I've already had health issues, financial issues, and legal issues that arose just because I've essentially spent the last few years just laying in bed and going to work. 

Are there more aggressive options I have? I need to get better. I don't want to continue this way. Rereading this I know it may not sound serious, but I have a habit of hiding how bad things are.

43,"(Please advice yourself. This post contains graphic and explicit materials that no man or woman should ever read.)

You can call me Mark. I finished high school a couple of years ago, and I skipped out on college so I just live with my parents now. I have one younger sister that I live with who is 19 now, also not in college, and a father who still works stocks and is usually out of town all the time, so it's just basically me and her. Anyways, my issue is, me and my sister are having a more complicated relationship than any brother or sister should have. It started a few months ago, maybe at the end of 2019 sometime December, when I first started noticing how my sister acts towards me. When i'm around, she always dresses less than ""clothed."" Sometimes, she just doesn't wear panties, or just doesn't wear a shirt. This has never been an issue to me, as I just brushed it off, but she really acts sexual to me. This was back in December, mind you. Anyways, my father was out in India at the time when the first milestone happened. Even before she started advancing on me, I've always thought of her as excessively beautiful. In my teenage years, I couldn't stop looking at her, peeking in her room sometimes and, when she was gone, stalking around, feeling her clothes, things like that. In December, she made her first move towards me. I was playing Xbox on the couch at night one day and I saw her leave her room. She walked towards me and sat down next to me, laying half of her on me. I was instantly aroused, as I would crave any attention she would give me. She shifted positions and got really close to me, eventually putting her thigh on my lap. I had no disagreements with this as I was having an amazing time, her skin on mine, so I let her just sit there while I played.  


To spare you the details, more things led to another and then we shortly kissed, then again longer, like I was making out with anybody else. We had both liked it and one thing led to another and things got really heavy. He had full blown sex on that couch. After that, we fuck about 4 times per week. Every week. I use a condom when I do, and now, with my Father permanently stuck out during the quarantine, it happens even more often. Personally, I feel like i'm in heaven. She absolutely amazing and I cant get enough of it.

But i've noticed that this is a problem, this is something to look at. What can I do? Why do I like this? I know the right thing to do is to end it, but the pleasure, the relief, I don't know if I can. I need to know how crazy am I? How much is wrong with me?

Yesterday I went to my cousins house and took family photos of them. I lied to my roommates about where I was going because I knew they would “freak out”
I ended up staying the night and it was a good change of scenery. They have been self quarantined from the beginning and have not been going out and socializing with others (only for essentials)

My other roommate B has been working at a gas station in the bakery handing out cups to customers with gloves on but no masks for the past 3 weeks. This week they are getting masks to wear as a further precaution. 

Roommate C just moved in a month ago due to issues at home and abuse from family. (She is 20 and filed for a restraining order) and also works as CNA with roommate A

Roommate A said that I must reimburse roommate C since she can’t work for two weeks, because I left the house to visit my family in whom are taking precautions and practicing social distancing as well. Only leaving the house to get groceries. 

Roommate A says if I do not leave the house and stay with family then they will be unable to work for 2 weeks to prevent risk of infection. 

I said I would stay in my room only using the restroom and kitchen with clean hands.
Roommate A says whole body is a carrier, this is true, but Does roommate B immediately change clothes when she gets home from work? 
No, she doesn’t. 

I’m not sure what to do.
if I stay I “have” to reimburse Roommate C- 
however, I am NOT working and have only left the house to see my family who has also not left the house or has shown any symptoms.

While I understand their fears I feel like it is very radical to assume they cannot go to work for two weeks, when they have been going to work after interacting with roommate B when she gets home from work after talking to people all day. (Her body is a carrier)

They cannot legally kick me out either. And they are lifting the restrictions.

- background

I live on Long Island with my parents and work in NYC. yes, the commute is fucking terrible lol. I'm turning 28 soon and the only form of moving out I've ever done is dorm in college for about 2 yrs total. before and after college graduation, I'd been broke af. so having my parents' place available to me has been a huge support.

and I took the job in NYC bc it's an arts job and there's a lot more opportunity there in the arts (my current career of choice). been there just about 2 yrs now. I just draw and paint right now but I'm not sure what work I will be doing in the future yet

living at home has helped me save money I def didn't have before. So I think I'm ready to move now. I'd still take a pretty big hit financially, but I think I'd rather that than stay another year with my parents. 

Living at home hasn't been a walk in the park. It's usually up to my dad how/where we live, and he doesn't earn much from his job. so I've had to live pretty cramped with family (I once shared a small bedroom with both my brothers). Over the years I've also slowly accepted that he eventually doesn't even want to live here lol my parents are from the Dominican Republic, and my dad has shown strong interest in moving back. mom will prob have to follow even tho she has separation anxiety with me and my brothers. So, hauling his almost 30 yr old son around with him here in NY was probably something he thought he would be done with at this point lol. We've moved around here a few times.

Right now, I stay with them and my younger brother in an apartment/house my dad rents and I have a tiny room to myself. I help a little with the rent. the walls are paper thin, so not much privacy (definitely can't bring any love interests home lol). but most importantly, I don't have enough space here to work on my artwork, which has definitely slowed me down professionally. I have a growing need to store artwork, and to spread myself out further to create what I want.


- why the trouble moving


I'm not that well into a career yet, so this has me worried. I don't earn a lot, and I dont know what I will be doing a year from now. I def plan on staying employed, but I am afraid that making enough money to stay afloat will start to take away too much time and energy from me that I could be using to further myself professionally. I have looked around a bit and seen places I can probably afford with just my current income, but it's usually just a small bedroom. that's how it is here in the NYC area which is where I'm looking
 
I also feel guilty that I will be moving on to a new beginning and leaving my parents and my little brother behind. I come from a low income family and am used to seeing us all benefit from a big change like that together. 

that being mentioned, I'm also afraid that sometime after I move out, I will need to move back with them for any reason. does that happen with most people? I feel like me moving out is a step that would mean I'm ready to put a roof over my own head and break away forever, and they should just worry about themselves. Id love to be less of a burden for them forever, but things could happen. 

lastly, my mom is not very accepting of me moving out. I kid you not, about a year and a halfish ago I started apartment hunting in NYC for the first time. I even went to see a place because a coworker was looking for a roommate. I told my mom about it, and at one point she started crying! she started talking about how this will just further break the family apart, and I was just like ughhhhghggf

53,"Gonna try and be as brief as I can. 

I’m in my mid twenties. My roommate also in his mid twenties is my best friend of 5 years. We have lived together for 4 years now. 3 years with roommates, one with just us two. 

He is a great person. I know this. We have had each other’s back for years. We really don’t have many other friends. Mainly the two of us. And I know he tries to be there for me when he can. 

He is more extroverted. People naturally like him and gravitate towards him because he can socialize very easily. They find him hilarious and he doesn’t have to try hard, everyone he meets seems to be immediately cool with him. 

Doesn’t bother me.

I’m an omnivert but I lean a little more towards introverted. I don’t have a problem talking to people or engaging in conversation. Except people I talk to generally don’t seem to be as into the conversation as they would with him. 

Doesn’t bother me. 
We’re different there. 

He is very lucky, a lot of the time. I am the exact opposite. Life seems to work out in his favor the majority of the time. I don’t keep track or want to but he gets lucky with so many things so many times it’s hard not to notice after a while. And it’s hard when I notice it because the exact opposite happens to me. Frequently. The majority of my time it’s things beyond my control. 

Ok

He has a very hard time dealing with or expressing emotions. I do not. I am also very good at talking to others and listening, him, not so much. Not nearly at all. 

We run a tiny social media group together in which we post content. All original. All different types. In the beginning, I had gotten him into the idea of it. Supposed to be just for fun.

Until it wasn’t anymore. 
He started saving up money and buying equipment for production. Spending a majority of his waking hours just getting high, and looking up prices and making purchases. And having everything line up perfectly to make it happen. Good for him. 

He doesn’t go to college. I do. 
He doesn’t have a gf. I do. 
He didn’t have to work himself up from debt. I did. 

I can’t keep up anymore. I couldn’t even keep up in the beginning. I can edit in final cut just as good, I can edit in photoshop just as good, produce mix, and master audio, do graphic design, draw and write all at a much higher skill level. But I can’t buy equipment like that. I don’t have nearly as much time to dedicate to learning about all of it, or getting a feel for it. 

I spent almost 2 years averaging 4 hours of sleep a night just to try and be on the same level while also trying to achieve my goals. But nothing ever worked. And I got burnt out frequently and developed a sleep disorder as a result. But my efforts went unnoticed because he was too busy. 

He rarely schedules or plans shoots that aren’t entirely his idea. Doesn’t put much effort in if they aren’t his also. He always says “well things can’t be 50/50” or “If I have an idea I’m gonna go for it”. Not entirely wrong, but not right at the same time. I can pitch ideas all I want, but not to much reception. Whenever I’m upset or mad about things unrelated to the social media group, I will try and talk to him.

Majority of the responses: “I don’t know man”. 

And yet when he’s upset I spend tons of time being a good friend and sitting there trying to talk it out. 

I work hard for what I do.
But I’m sitting here. 
Behind on school.
Still producing amateur mixes.
Still haven’t saved up enough for a nice camera, or some audio equipment. 
Still trying to be a good friend and put all that aside. 

Idk if I can anymore. I hate to admit it but I’m jealous. I’m jealous and I’m pissed off that I’m on the shit end of the stick after working so hard towards everything.

I’m pissed off that I do a better job listening and being there for him and I get shit responses from a guy who doesn’t think twice about me. About anything. And still is loved by everyone. And still has success just blooming for him everywhere he goes for the minimal effort he puts in. 

It’s like it’s ok for him not to care about any of the negative and be 100% positive and have life just say “oh ok well I guess you’ll be the lucky one then”. 

I love him as a friend and I don’t want to lose him. But it’s fucking infuriating to see his success and my failure. I hate that. I absolutely hate that about me. But I have to be honest with myself. 
 
Idk what to do. Whether I’m losing my mind. Whether I need to move out. Whether I need to separate. Whether he’s a bad friend or not. Whether I’m a bad friend or not. Whether he cares or not. Nothing in life is fair, but I’m not going to live in someone’s shadow any longer.

I feel like i'm in love with her. We have so much in common and she always makes me laugh. We used to hang out every single day at her house and smoke and chill. It was always fun times. Up until recently where as I am no longer living near her. I moved about 2 hours away from her so it is difficult to make time to see her now. We still have an amazing relationship and she is single and looking for someone, but I dont know how to make my move because we've been friends for so long. I'm not sure if I should just stay friends with her so I dont risk our entire relationship as is. Or If I should just shoot my shot and risk her dropping me as a friend. We are really good friends and she tells me almost everything but, I dont know if it would be right to tell her I like her and want a relationship. I feel like I could really be good for her because i've known her for so long and see her with her ex's and I always warned her about them probably not being for her. Every ex she dated when I knew her turned out to be scummy or cheated. Its funny because I sound like a total simp' and I ain't about that. What should I do here people of reddit.",22Apr2020,2

57,"I'm a 27 year old female and I feel extremely bored with life. Nothing gets me excited anymore. I hate that I feel this way. I'm financially stable and independent,  have a really nice boyfriend and a close friend group, and get along with my family. I feel like I should be grateful and happy, but my life just feels kind of numb. Very very rarely do I get excited about anything, I just feel like I'm going through the motions.

I think I need a career change, I've been doing sales for about 6 years and it used to be exciting but now it's just mind numbing for me. The only problem is, I cant find a career path I would like to pursue. I'm not opposed to going to college again if I can find something I can get excited about, but I've gone to job fairs and done tons of online research on different careers but can't find anything I feel passionate about pursuing enough to take on college debt to go after it.

58,"I’ve been wanting to live in Tokyo since fourth grade but my parents have always mocked me for it despite it being my biggest dream for 7 years. I am now in 11th grade, junior year for the Americans. I studied Japanese for a couple years but then I dropped it since the teacher’s house was in the other side of the city and my parents are rather busy with their jobs. Now, my dad is a doctor and wants me to be one too. He’s a director here in my country and makes good money. So if I do become a doctor here, my job would be secure. I would like to become a surgeon and I’m actually one of the best students in my year. I like doing good, doing good makes me happy. I used to be a volunteer at a down syndrome center and will go back again as soon as this pandemic is over, I’ve participated in many events in order to help people etc. I’ve been in the OR many times and I’ve enjoyed it a lot. Yet, there is still something that tells me that I would never be completely happy as a doctor. If I choose this career path, then there’d be more chances of me going to Tokyo. I could get a scholarship or I could go there as a transfer student after I finish the first year of university in my country. Doctors in Tokyo make a lot of money too. The average minimum salary of a doctor in Tokyo is 1,210,000¥ and the maximum average salary is 4,560,000¥ per month. If I study medicine I’d like to do it at the University of Tokyo which isn’t expensive at all but has a very very low acceptance rate and I’m not sure I could get accepted. I may be a great student at my school but I feel too dumb to be competing against Japanese students that have studied for years in preparation to get into this school or are probably cram school students. I’m also not fluent in any way in Japanese and don’t think I will be, even if I study it everyday for a year. But I’ve promised myself that I will go live in Tokyo when I turn 18 and I really can’t break that promise. Before I prove my parents that they were right, I’d be disappointing myself. I know that the University of Tokyo isn’t the only medical school there is in Tokyo but the other ones I do not like at all. 
On the other hand, I love love love fashion. I’ve been wanting to be a fashion designer since forever, though it’s never been that big of a dream as Tokyo has. But I’m not a very creative person anymore. I used to be as a kid but then depression happened and it took my creativity away. Or maybe I think like this because of the environment that I’m in. Despite this I think I could make it in the fashion industry. I could be a stylist too if not a fashion designer. Or I could work in a fashion magazine. I feel like working in this industry would make me very happy. There are two problems though. First, that there are no good fashion colleges in Tokyo. And I really NEED to live in Tokyo as a college student. I have to. I cannot let myself down. I really need to clarify that I’m not a weeb. I watched anime in fifth grade for a while but that was it. Second problem is that my parents do not support this at all. Like at all. They’re very much against it because they think I’d have no future and probably won’t finance me to study fashion either. There is only one university in my country that has a fashion major but it’s just bad and it’s the reason why my parents think I’d have no future. The students that’ve studied there have all ended up as underpaid seamstresses. So to study fashion I would have to live somewhere else. I really like Parsons School Of Design in New York City and I am going to apply there as well. Or I could go to Paris since I can speak French as well. Though, these options are a bit expensive. I’m not sure what to do. I know my parents could handle it but I don’t really want to be a burden to them, especially knowing that this isn’t what they’d want for me. But New York and Paris are not Tokyo. Say, I am an exceptional human and get accepted into both schools, which one should I pick? I’ve been stuck for years now and literally no one that I know can help me. I don’t want any “follow your heart” advice since I have myself to tell me that everyday haha. My heart is a bit confused right now. I hope someone will read this, I know it’s a bit long. Please give me your thoughts on this. There are pros and cons to each option and I need someone else who has no relation to me to point out which one I should go with.",22Apr2020,1

63,"  
Edit: This is in North Carolina, US

I frequently see my neighbor treat her mentally disabled son in a way that looks abusive. My porch faces their porch, and I see the son sweeping outside for hours at a time every day for months. I have heard his mom yell at him to ""get to sweeping like he has some sense"". He seems jumpy and scared when she comes outside, and if she is sitting on the porch while he is out there, she is as far away from him as possible. Today I saw her throwing something on him angrily (maybe water or some kind of liquid) through my window.

I can't hear much of what she says to him because of the distance between our porches, and I understand that I may just not have the full picture of what is going on, but it looks and feels like a very dark home and experience to be living in. I would like to do something to help but I am not sure what will. If I call child protective services, there is a potential that nothing happens and she just becomes meaner/more abusive towards him. The boy doesn't really look up or engage with his surroundings so asking him if he is ok is not really in the cards.

Is there anything that can be done to help that does not put the boy in more potential harm?",22Apr2020,1
64,"
Elementary school was fucking awful. I was bullied from second through sixth grade, getting worse as time went on. More and more of my peers got involved in it, to the point where I had only one friend my age. My parents fought for me for years, but the teachers and other staff at the school rarely intervened. The only time any of the bullies faced consequences beyond half heartedly being asked to play nice was one of the few times I successfully defended myself - and I fucking got suspended too. Things got so bad to where I went from being a straight A student to failing half my classes. 

There are two adults in particular who made things worse - a teacher and an assistant principal. Neither of them even pretended to do the bare minimum to help me - they flat out didn't care. The teacher defended the bullies to me, making excuses for them, and literally asking ""Well what do you want me to do about it?"" The assistant principal was mean and hurtful anytime I ended up in her office. She once told me I was the common denominator and threatened punishments for the rest of the year if she ever had to see me again. In my opinion, neither of them should have been allowed to work with children again, but both are retired now.

Going to school for years while fearing for my physical and emotional safety, as well as the prolonged social isolation, has left me pretty fucked up, it took me years for my social development and my grades to get back on track once I got out of that situation, and I've dealt with social anxiety for pretty much my whole life since then. Despite going to therapy for most of my adult life, I've never really been able to make any dent in my social anxiety symptoms since high school. 

Whenever I think about the way those two treated me, when they should have been making sure I was safe, I just feel angry and hurt and powerless. I want to reach out and tell them all this. I want them to at least hear that their deliberate inaction was fucked up, and I want them to be aware of the damage they caused. And honestly, I also want to tell them in no uncertain terms that I don't believe they should have ever been allowed to work with children again. I wouldn't be surprised if other kids went through the same experience because of them, so I guess at least one of our voices would be heard. 

I realize I may get no response if I were to reach out , and I realize that they may even deny it. I'm not sure how I would feel about a flat out rejection of what I have to say, but I know for sure any apology I might get from them is absolutely worthless to me. I just want the idea that they chose to allow abject suffering when intervening would have cost them literally nothing, to cross their conscious minds, even for a moment

So I guess my question here is, is this a crazy idea? I've never contacted anyone for anything like this before. Should I be careful of anything in particular? ",22Apr2020,1

I've spoken to career  advisers without much luck. I tried pursuing a Web Design certificate at  my CC, only to drop out of it and change to Associate in General  Studies since I already was close to finishing that. Obviously I can't  live like this and depend on my parents like this forever. They are kind  enough to help me with rent while I cover my groceries and utilities.  I've tried doing research on what jobs to pursue. Problem is I have  extreme social anxiety and my family thinks I have aspergers, as social  interaction is very hard for me. I've improved by forcing myself outside of my comfort zone but not at the rate a  normal 24 y/o should. So a lot of jobs just sort of throw me off if they require extensive communication..

My  biggest interest lies in History, but the only real careers a History  degree seems to lead to is teaching, and that is absolutely not what I  want to do, so I feel like a History degree would be fruitless.

87,"tw for drugs/sexual assault(??)

i’ll explain what happened in as few words as possible but that might be difficult so i apologize if this is super long/convoluted 

i’m 19f. on sunday night around 12am i was tripping on dxm (cough medicine, for those unfamiliar it makes you very dumb/dissociate/hallucinate) when my friend (19f, we’ll call her A) texted me and said that her and her friend (~19m) could come pick me up and we could hang out at a hotel room that he had gotten. sober me would definitely not agree to that, especially given the quarantine, but i was off my ass and i hadn’t hung out with anyone in around a year and was mostly just excited to get invited somewhere (and very high in case i haven’t stressed that enough). i managed to stumble out of my house (dxm makes it difficult to walk, as well as physically difficult to speak out loud), they picked me up, and they drove me to the hotel.

i smoked some weed and that + the dxm kicked in HARD. i was full on dissociated and hallucinating, i couldn’t differentiate my hallucinations and real life. the three of us were just sitting on the bed, A in the middle, when she asked me if i wanted to make out with her. i was so fucked up that i didn’t even realize that the guy was also on the bed with us. i just went with it and after a few minutes of her sticking her tongue down my throat she tried pulling my shirt up. i could barely speak but i remember motioning for her to stop. this part is blurry, but she eventually lifted my shirt up and she began sucking on my nipples which was strange. then she tried to take my pants off. even through my inebriation my body dysmorphic managed to mumble out “i can’t”. she kept trying but i kept saying i couldn’t. she then asked if she could finger me when my pants on, and i just went with it. i remember being completely dissociated at this point, it felt like i was watching myself like i was watching a movie. i don’t believe i tried to stop her from fingering me, but considering there was a guy who’s name i don’t even know right next to us and i was completely out of it, sober me would’ve NEVER agreed to that. the last time i laid a finger on someone was january 2017. i’m extremely shy especially when it comes to sexual stuff so i’m very upset that this happened. 

we eventually stopped and about an hour later the guy drove us back to A’s house. we just hung out for an hour or two and i was slightly more sentient, but still tripping and still having plenty of difficulty thinking/speaking. around 4am, we were laying on her bed when she asked to kiss again. i really didn’t want to (jesus is she an awful kisser) but i am very bad at saying no so i figured i would just power through it. we made out for a little and she tried convincing me to take my clothes off. she was doing this bad porn-acting sort of dirty talking. it was so gross and awkward it keeps replaying in my head. i didn’t know people actually spoke like that during sex jfc. anyways she spent a /really/ long time trying to convince me to take my pants off. all i could bring myself to say was “i can’t”. she eventually gave up. she just proceeded to rub my nipples as if she was trying to make me orgasm through them? and that went on for way too long. i think she eventually got the message that i wanted to stop and we went back to just laying on her bed. she fell asleep and i snuck out of her house at around 4:30 am. i was sitting on her driveway, in the cold, still tripping, with my phone on 1%. i called my younger sister until she woke up and frantically texted her the address and was like “hey i’m stuck if you feel like it can you come get me”. she did, god bless her. 

the point of me making this post is that i’m really worried i might have an std. A hooks up with a Lot of guys, pretty much all of which are 20-something year old drug addicts. i’m not sexually active/generally afraid of sex so i really know nothing about stds. could i get something serious from open-mouth kissing/being fingered? i’m not able to get tested until the pandemic is over whereas i can’t drive/live with my parents so i couldn’t just sneak out into the city to planned parenthood. i absolutely don’t want to tell my parents what happened so would it be expensive to get a test without using their insurance? will i be ok to wait until the quarantine is over? im just kind of freaking out and really upset that this happened, any advice would be really really appreciated since i’m not sure how to feel or what to do",22Apr2020,1
88,Okay so I recently bought a green dot card and I’m a minor thinking that I could just use it like a regular gift card.. I looked at it after I bought it and put 100 dollars on it and noticed that it said shit about fees so I called the place where I got it from and they said no refund so I then called the number on the back of the card and I couldn’t get through to a live person?? It just keeps sending me to a place to register the card ( I haven’t registered it) then again i have tried to register it but I really don’t wanna put my social in or anything.. this is a mess and any help would be appreciated thanks :(,22Apr2020,1

93,"Hey there, so there's this account on instagram which is getting popular in my country. It's about laughing of the higher classes of my country (Chile), they have been posting stuff in a very rejective way to all who belongs to this sector. It doesn't sound that bad, however there are a lot of post where they take real people images and make laugh only because of their ""privileges"" and their ""exotic"" looks. I've seen thousands of comments saying they are complete scumbags, that they had the easiest life while physically insulting them. My concern is that there is a huge amount of people supporting it, and some take it real serious in a point where they think it's ok to insult them, that they deserve it. Personally, this kind of behaviour frustrates me, it makes me feel sad  how much anger people has on other only because of privileges, and no one seems to be against it. What are your thoughts of this? Is it okay? The page has over 90k followers",22Apr2020,1
94,"Hi! This is gonna be long so bare with me

We've been friends for over 2 years. I met him my freshman year of college (I'm currently a junior) and it was clear he was interested in me from the beginning. Long story short, we talked for awhile, eventually kissed (thats the furthest we've gone) and I eventually asked him what his intentions were. He said he didn't want a relationship at the time and we left off on good terms and stayed as good friends. Sophomore year came along and we still stayed as friends and he would ask to hang out here and there but we never did anything physical or anything.

Summer entering this school year, things changed completely. We began to talk a lot through Snap, he would tag me on things on Facebook. Immediately when classes started in August, he asked me to hang out which then became a consistent thing throughout the year. From August to March, he did a lot of things for me such as: asked to hangout a lot more often, always pay for my coffee several times, always try to hold my hand when we hung out, bought me wine, cooked for me (even bought me a steak because I specifically asked for one), asked to hang out in the city and Facetime over winter break. We were at two parties together this year and he stayed by my side the whole time which was unusual because the past two years he would be hooking up with other girls. At one of those parties, I was dancing close with another guy and I knew he got jealous but just didn't say anything.

Anyways, he also remembered my birthday and bought me a bottle of wine after I jokingly asked for one. At my party, I got really drunk and was apparently flirting with his friends and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.
Fast forward to March, our school required all of us to leave because of COVID19. The day before we all left, he asked to hangout with me because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, he pays and holds my hand. Eventually, we go back to my room and we talk for a bit. Eventually, he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I say I'm not good at this physical stuff (By physical I mean like kissing/making out - i have no experience) and he ensures me its fine. I say I'm only comfortable with just the cheek and he just kisses me on the cheek and kind of just makes out with my neck. We then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he's coming too. I dance with my guy friends and then later, I see him hooking up (making out) with another girl. I then got kind of pissed so I find another guy where I eventually sit on his lap and I knew he saw it.

I know I should’ve asked what his intentions were but I feel like he should be the one making it clear if his intentions from freshman year changed — not me. I'm not sure if I should reach out because I don't know if he still has feelings for me or if he even thinks about everything that has happened. We’ve barely talked since all of this happened (it’s been around a month) and we’ve always kept in contact since freshman year except now

I like him but I’m confused if he just wanted to hooked up or something more

tl;dr: I don't know if this guy just wanted to hookup with me or something more.",22Apr2020,1
95,"So you will understand a bit about where I'm talking about: Outside my apartment, there is a smallish porch area that connects mine and my closest neighbor's doors to the sidewalk. As well as a small plot of grass, our ""yards"" if you will. After the sidewalk there is a grill, picnic table and a trashcan not even 3 feet away from the table and maybe 5-6 feet from the grill.

Very recently, it seems I either have new neighbors or some just decided to start acting lazy. I got a puppy about a month ago and when I got her, there was not any litter outside of some cigarette butts from the local teen rebels... as of, maybe the past week or 2 though there has been litter here and there. Today however there was wadded up, wet looking napkins or tissues everywhere like maybe 10 of them or more not only around the picnic table but also in our ""yard"", neighbor's ""yard"" I believe and on the sidewalk even. There is also candy wrappers and chocolate wrappers as well as bits of the candy and left over food. Not only under the table but also next to the trash can as if they were missed shots of people throwing their food at it... Other than that there has also been water bottles half full and empty scattered around. It has infuriated me because my dog can't eat the candy and food they are dropping. Not that I'd let her eat random littered food of course I wouldn't. But she especially can't eat this random junk during a pandemic. She is a puppy and doesn't know better. Covid-19 is spread through animals too... Also there is the point that it's just rude to litter all over the place when you're living so closely with other people. When I asked for family and friend's advice I was told to confront my neighbors first if I see them and explain that I'm training a new puppy and it's hard with litter everywhere, but some friends thought it would be better to submit a report to our office or the police. When I asked my family about it they said that's how you worsen the situation while others, as well as my myself honestly, worry that I could accuse the wrong people and start more problems. So, this brings me here to get more opinions and thoughts. 

TLDR; My seemingly new neighbors are littering everywhere outside of my apartment. Should I submit a report to my complex's office, the police or confront my neighbors first and ask them to stop? (Don't know who is littering exactly and we don't have a facebook group page...)

P.S. I also hate littering in general, it's illegal for a reason. I live right next to the ocean too.",22Apr2020,1
96,"Okay, so this is a bit long. I'm sorry but I really needed to vent because I have anxiety and things like this weigh heavily on my mind. Advice or just support would be really helpful.

So about a month ago (before quarantine) I decided to post on r/rateme, because I was genuinely interested and wanted to know how I could maybe work on making my appearance better. I'm in my first year of college and have really become more conscious of this kind of thing. I got a lot of feedback, mostly good but definitely some bad as well, which didn't bother me a whole lot because I was aware that's what I was asking for. And I have to admit, as sad as it sounds, I enjoyed getting the attention, but I usually get nervous after having a post up for a while so I deleted it eventually.

So since I've been home more often I haven't worn my glasses much (which was a common negative point), I've been practicing makeup, and I dyed my hair. I've taken more pictures of myself that I felt pretty confident about. I was curious to see if people would rate me differently, so I wanted to post an ""update"" rate me (but I didn't say anything about it being an update or having a previous post, because I had deleted it and it probably would've been confusing). Things were going pretty well just like the first time, but then I got a comment that went something like ""I would rate you a solid 1/10 due to your poor intellect. You posted on here a few days ago, and got tons of feedback. How many posts do you need to make? You're not getting prettier, only uglier. Only simps are falling for this. Here's the link to your other one since this is a REPOST."" 

...And they provided a link to my deleted post. This person was apparently notorious on the sub for being a harsh rater, but honestly, my stomach just dropped. I'm not that kind of person at all and I didn't mean to come across that way, but I suddenly immediately regretted ever posting anything (and it was a month ago, not a few days). And then I made even more mistakes. I panicked and deleted my Reddit account because I couldn't stand the idea of having a stigma attached to me now. However, I did it so hastily that I didn't think to delete my post first, and I realized it was still there afterward. And now people could see that I deleted my account right after that comment. Someone else added a comment that said ""And u/... has left the building lol"" which basically just rubbed salt into the wound. I was so damn embarrassed by this point. I could only imagine how horrible it all looked.

I decided to message the mods on a new account to explain and ask that they remove the post, and I was met with a rather condescending reply. But it did get removed automatically because the associated account was deleted. I messaged the mods of the other sub I had a picture in but haven't gotten a reply yet. I'm just trying to erase myself from internet existence at this point.

I KNOW THAT I'M DUMB AND I DID REALLY DUMB THINGS. Multiple dumb things, in succession. It's my fault for wanting attention in the first place, but I never imagined I would be met with a response like this. I mean, I figured, other people do this kind of thing too, right? I just still feel so anxious about all of it. I promise that I've learned my lesson about internet posting. I experimented, and it went wrong, and I learned. I just need help erasing this feeling I have about the whole situation. It's been bothering me for a few days now. 😔",22Apr2020,1

101,"Hi Reddit. First time poster and the story is complicated so Ill try to be as clear as possible. 

For context: My inlaws had two kids; John (30M) and Blake (27M, also my husband). Ever since they were born, my in laws have put all of their focus on them. They never had friends or other family where they live, so their only social interactions have been with their kids.

John lives about 2 hours away from them. When he left, his parents were sad, but Blake was still around and they still visited him frequently. This was several years ago and theyve since adjusted. Blake and I lived within twenty minutes of them until two months ago when I got a job offer in a different state. We now are 7 hours from them. 

At first, I thought his mom was just depressed that all of her kids were 'out of the nest'. I was very wrong. We started noticing that Blakes mom would act very sad/uninterested every time we talked to her on the phone. Then she started calling Blake every day with oddly specific tech questions. For instance, she started asking him about how bluetooth works and if you can use it to hack someone elses phone. We thought this was strange, but thought nothing of it. 

Things hit the fan two nights ago. Blakes mom calls me, sobbing, asking to speak to her son. When they talk, she tells him that she thinks his dad (her husband) is cheating on her. When Blake asks why she thinks that, she goes into the spiel about the cookies in his phone being for websites that she doesn't understand, and thinks that hes using secret internet connections to send lewd pictures to other woman but she just cant prove it. 

She also mentions that shes noticed a teenage girl that keeps walking past their house evey day wearing gym clothes. She immeaditely associates this girl with being his 'mistress' and goes outside to comfront her. MIL asks her if shes been sleeping with her husband. The girl is taken back by this (obviously) and tells her no. My MIL thinks that she 'acted strange because she knew she was caught trying to meet up with husband'

We try to talk to her and offer valid reasons as to why this girl would be walking around the front of her house (shes exercising) and tried to explain how cookies work. But shes not having it. For days now she is non stop sobbing and convinced that he is cheating. 

Now, I know we cant be 100% certain, but to out knowledge, he hasnt cheated on her or even thought of it. Hes also definitely not tech savvy enough to do these work arounds to send private messages. To top it all off, his only cell phone is a work phone that is constantly monitored; if he was using it for those purposes, he would surely be fired. 

Today we called her. She was crying because she caught more ""evidence"". She was looking at available wifi connections on his phone and saw one she didnt recognize. She believes its the 'other woman's wifi that they connect to in secret'. We tried to explain to her that the wifi she was concerned about was password protected, and his phone does not automatically connect to it and therefore he doesnt have access to it. She was not convinced and just sobbed and sobbed. 

We are at a loss. Blake and I have been discussing options as far as what to do. I suggested we drive up to their house this weekend. I suggested that maybe he can go tomorrow (he doesnt have a job so he can come and go as he pleases). But we dont even know if that will help because eventually, we will have to leave them alone again. Today she didnt eat or drink anything. I dont know what to do. Any advice? :(",22Apr2020,1

106,"I (15M) am in French 2 and don’t think I can make it through French 3 due to my teacher. 

Basically, I’m not the best at French, and my teacher knows that. Sometimes when I answer a question and it’s wrong the teacher freaks out and gets mad. He’ll make a comment that seems fine to everyone else in the class, but comes off as harsh to me. It happens. All. The. Time. It’s gotten to the point that I dread going to class everyday and I sweat like crazy. 

Sometimes he’ll make a small comment and I’ll understand what I got wrong, fix it, and he’ll be like “see, you can do this, you just aren’t tying your hardest,” but in reality I was trying my hardest that I could. I understand that he wants the best for me and to understand my mistakes, but it comes off as harsh. And since it’s so often (almost everyday) it started to hurt me, I started to study, but even then sometimes I was genuinely confused in class. A few times after I got something wrong he would go on a rant about how people should try their hardest and that’s how people progress and get somewhere in life for 5-10 minutes long.

My wife is like a mother to her niece, and loves her dearly as a mother would. She confided in me that the niece has sent a nude while in high school to her boyfriend and his family found it and there was much talk between the families cleaning it up. That was several years ago, and by some research, it looks like the timing might be right for when the photo hit the internet. I haven't seen this bathroom before, but I know she had her own in her mothers house. It looks like her, it seems right for how long this image has been on the internet, and could be her own bathroom. If this is that picture, it is classified as child porn because she was 16\~17 at the time.

I don't want this coming back to bite me, and I am just trying to do the right thing in this situation. Do I leave well enough alone and do nothing?

114,"My girlfriend and I are graduating from college next month (yay) and are looking to move from Arizona to Oregon immediately following graduation.

After looking at a ton of apartments, we finally found this great complex that would be awesome for us. The only problem is that, in order to cover the 3x rent requirement, they only accept offer letters. I don’t have one yet, and my girlfriend’s income is close to covering it by itself but we’d still need an offer letter from me. I offered them pay stubs from my job here and previous income and all that, but they only accept offer letters. Other complexes in that area have said the same thing, which is not the case in AZ but I digress.

So of course I’ve been feverishly applying to jobs, and I’ve gotten several calls back. But with the job market as it is, it doesn’t seem like many people want to hire someone a month from now because no one knows what’ll happen with COVID. They keep telling me to call them back once I’m in the Oregon area and we’ll figure something out.

This is certainly useful in a lot of ways, as an applied artist having teaching as an option is always helpful, especially because people burn out in the advertising industry when they get older. However, if they were not offering, I probably would not have pursued the MFA. It's not something I am doing because I am passionate and WANT to teach, I am doing it because I recognize the privilege and usefulness of the free safety net. I have a niche skillset in a specific type of graphic design that is lucrative, and I had an easy time entering the workforce. In some ways, I think that taking my parents money keeps me financially dependent on them, and allows them to have control over my decisions. I appreciate that they care and provide for me, but in many ways it prevents me from being an independent adult when I have proven fully capable of that.

My family disapproves of me going to New York to shelter with my boyfriend, so we compromised to spend a month in an apartment here in Atlanta before returning there for the summer. But now that Governor Kemp has vowed to open businesses starting this week, I'm having trouble reconciling that us staying here is worth the extra money, as it doesn't seem to be any more safe. I see him as a potential long long term partner, he is supportive and wonderful and I deeply want to invest in our relationship. If I weren't living at home, I'd probably have already driven to be with him. I'm confident in my ability to split rent by taking on some freelance work, and not depend on my parents financially for that.

Is going to New York riskier for my health than staying in Atlanta? Or am I just submitting to control because my parents are forcing me to stay financially supported by them? Any thoughts would be helpful.",22Apr2020,1

anyway for the past few days, everytime I pee, it's been really sore, like a sensation thats really uncomfortable, and unfortunately, I need to be a lot more often as well.

I'm thinking I may have some sort of UTI, which I dont know to much about but know it needs to be treated with antibiotics of some sort has it's a bacterial infection.

Heres the problem:
I'm a fourteen year old girl, and as embarrassing as it is to say this, I'm really uncomfortable with the idea of asking my mam to take me to the docter, we never tall about any vaginal health stuff and the thought of it makes me want to die. we just arent like that. but i feel like I gotta do it somehow, and I dont have the money to pay for a visit to the GP, and even if I did it would be near impossible to hide it from my parents.

so I'm asking, how to I talk to someone about this? my plan was to give it a couple more days and hope it passes on its own, but if that doesn't work them idk what I'll do, and I dont want it to get worse.",22Apr2020,1

123,"So I lived with a good friend and his girlfriend for about a year, during which time I was more or less single.  Also I'm a guy.  Initially I had a hard time dealing with his gf - I liked her, but living with someone is obviously a different story.  
Fast forward to the end of that year, and I feel like I've entered a parallel universe.  Everything my friend's girlfriend does has started to have a double meaning to me.  It feels like there's this other reality where we are the ones in love, not her and my friend.  But as far as the reality that concerns everyone else, nothing had changed.  
I felt like I was losing my mind.  I broke down mid conversation with her at one point and told her that I had feelings I didn't feel good about, and talked to my friend shortly after.  Neither were particularly upset at me.
At least a year has passed.  Me and my friend (the guy) are like nothing ever happened.  I still find myself under this delusion whenever I'm around his girlfriend though.

What is going on?  Where do I have to look inside myself to find where this is coming from?  I've been jealous of my friend before, but in this case it's not like I'm compelled to have what he has.  I just literally believe me and his girlfriend are in love, despite this certainly not being the case.",22Apr2020,1
124,"First of all the woman I’m talking about is probably in her early 70s (never told me her age) 

Now I’ve know her (from now on I’ll be referring to her as c) for 2 years and she has been an amazing friend. C taught me how to drive a golf cart, play piano, cook, garden, crochet, play golf, and a ton of other things that have really shaped the person I am today. 

But I moved out of my home and to a new place (around 10 minutes away) last November and I had C’s phone so we could keep in contact and we texted a little but with school (8th grade) and such it’s been difficult, not to mention my parents don’t like her so I never can visit her. 

Now with this corona virus happening I’m worried and shot her a text mid day yesterday and she hasn’t read or responded to it. I thought this was normal since she spends nearly all day in her giant back garden, so I shot her another text this morning when I thought she would be having breakfast, and still tonight no response.

I’ve been having a small panic attack thinking on what could of happened to her and I’m scared that she may have passed away or something in the few months I’ve not spoken to her.

I’m really scared and need some advice on what to do, I don’t want to go crazy with texts and am thinking on calling her but still how do I deal with the aftermath if I find out she’s not ok?",22Apr2020,1

128,"Hi guys, so a little back story my life for the the past few years have been nothing but work. I worked 7 days a week 14+ hrs a day. My schedule was working month straight than getting 4-5 days off and repeat. 
In the beginning I had no reason to work it was more of a pass time while getting money. I blew it all on stupid thing to justify that I was “salve” to the system. But than I meet a wonderful lady and my world started to get colorful a year later I had my first child.
While I look back I can’t seem to find happiness Yea I had the occasional smile or even laughter but I can’t seem to remember any of it. The worst part is I even forgot how I felt when my daughter was born. I look at the pictures and I see myself smiling but I can’t recall. 
Some times I get this attacks where I’m twitching and my heart/ chest hurts with a head ace that lasts a while. 
Has anyone felt like this? What did you do to help this empty numb feeling. 

Thank you.",22Apr2020,1

133,"By all accounts I’ve had a pretty normal life, a stable childhood, my parents have been good to me, I have a lot of things going for me, got lots of things provides for and I was generally born lucky in comparison to many other people. I’m studying at a good school. Good stuff. 

However I can’t shake the feeling that I’m somehow broken or there’s something wrong with me. It is something that has followed me all my life. I feel very much different from other people. I feel like I’m not really here and I question reality all the time. Nothing feels real to me. Life is so bizarre to me and I generally can’t see good things in it or make sense of it. It seems like there’s something about life and this world that I can’t figure out. Humans are crazy to me and sometimes I think I might be crazy myself. I often feel like I’m just observing the world from inside a human but I’m distinctly not human. It’s scary at times. It’s like ego death. My life feels like a story I’m just watching unfold. I look at the world and see the human story playing out there and I realize I mean nothing to it. I’m a narrator that has no part in the story. 

I’ve taken meds for depression in the past. I’ve questioned whether or not I have Aspergers, I’ve pursued every explanation I can come up with to try to explain me. Or just figure out what the hell is wrong with me. Why everybody seems to get something that I don’t. People are happy and I can’t understand what there is to really be happy about.

I’m incredibly depressed now because I don’t see what everyone is living for. I got to this conclusion through philosophy and history and just thinking a lot. Just logically I can’t see why people go on. I’m not suicidal but I just don’t see the point. I have little more than an obligation to my loved ones to stay here.

I don’t know what the point of this post is. Thanks for reading if you got here.",22Apr2020,1
134,"i’ll be vague as possible and leaving out specifics because the other person involved uses reddit- i work in a creative field and started talking to someone also in that field a couple months ago. we were getting along only talked online but we both had good ideas and wanted to collaborate on a project. in the past few months my business has been growing quickly and so i’ve been able to really put out more content and make it more my style and experiment with different types of things. i thought it was going really well then out of nowhere this person basically accused me of copying them. i was really surprised and am definitely the type of person who hates when people are mad at them even when i don’t do anything wrong, i can get defensive, and it just upsets me. i talked to them really calmly and just basically said i’m sorry you feel that way but i’m not copying you. we talked about it and i just held my ground that nope i don’t copy you. i never apologized because i felt i didn’t need to, except for saying i’m sorry you feel that way. funny thing is i just talked to my therapist a couple days before this about similar situations like this, and even before this i was feeling really self conscious about how i speak to other people and having relationships and friendships because i had different experiences than a lot of other people growing up and am not very good at dealing with people, like i stated before. well we ended on a “good” note and the person calmed down but also said sorry they were high, paranoid, and “crazy”. i reallyyyy didn’t appreciate that. but we ended okay anyways, then didn’t talk for a couple days and now they’ve unfollowed me? did i do something wrong? was i supposed to apologize? i don’t know. i hate feeling like someone hates me. our friendship is probably over and that’s okay but i would atleast like it to end okay? i’m conflicted because from my perspective i didn’t do what they accused me of so why would i apologize but from their perspective i feel like i came off sketchy because of my lack of knowledge of dealing with other people. was i wrong and how could i have made it better? i’m probably leaving out a lot because it’s a long story but that’s the basics.",22Apr2020,1

136,I'm older (34f) and all of my friends have moved away or just moved on with life and I'm so unbearably lonely. I miss having friends and I don't know how to make them at this age. Most people my age don't really make the effort as they already have their own friends they are invested in. Also most women my age are obsessed with their husbands and children. Men always end up trying to have sex with me or treating me like a fleshlight and get angry if I don't want that. And I just don't even know how to meet up with people who like the same things as me. I just feel lost. I think being isolated inside is making it worse. How should I go about making friends? It seems so much harder now.,22Apr2020,1
137,"The title really says it all. 
I don’t know how to say no without shit-canning our friendship because she tends to take ‘no’ personally and she’s not in the best place, emotionally.  I am very conflicted about it because we had been very close for over a decade, but when her marriage fell apart she withdrew for a few years.  I understood she needed her space and was ok with that. Even though I tried to stay on top of checking in on her (we were living in different states at the time) she never really came back round and I think it was because she felt like abandoned her. Since we haven’t been particularly close these last few years I feel as though she’s only making an effort to be friendly now so that I’ll agree to do this for her. She’s made sure to take her ex to task and blame him for everything any time we’ve talked in the last few months, and even though he was a garbage husband and a lame dad, she was complicit in the breakdown of the marriage. It feels like she’s been setting the stage so that when she asked me I would just say yes, due to the information overload. She has been keeping things from me(which is her right) and not telling the whole story in certain instances, which has made it very difficult to take her word for it when she does come to me with a complaint. It’s all sort of compacted and come to a head in the last few days because she asked me to become involved legally and I told her I had to think about it even though my immediate reaction was to say no. I am conflicted because I want to be there for her in her time of need but I don’t think her reasoning for going to court is valid. 

Sorry this is all over the place, I’m just a mess right now.",22Apr2020,1

I by far am ashamed of myself for cheating on my girlfriend as much as I have but it's for good reason. She won't have sex with me, I have talked to her about and she's not ready and is ashamed of her body. I DONT CARE! And she seems to think I'm gonna just get up and run away if I see her naked. I won't. But anyway, I since the beginning of our relationship have proceeded to do lot of stuff with other girls in the school. I mean she's even found out before and she just assumed they were lying! I mean damn. I do like her, but I'm a growing man I need pussy and if she doesn't start giving it to me I think I'm going to break up with her. I think this sounds like a huge dick move but I just feel bad. I think I should break up with her anyway. We've been through a lot but one of the main reasons I started dating her in the first place was because she was also pretty well known amongst the people in the school, like popular, and I was and am to I thought us being together would be good. But I'm sorry but I enjoy cheating on her. And it's wrong it is so wrong but the person u have cheated on her with since the beginning is someone I have feeling for as well. Im in a huge triangle, I can not get with the one I'm sneaking with because everyone will judge me. I know it. There's nothing wrong with her, she's pretty shes got a body. She's just not popular, she hangs out with people that graduated 3 years ago, and she goes to there stupid parties and hangs out with the potheads. She would get me teared up if I dated her. My social life would honestly be torn tf up and the only reason I know this is because I live in a tiny tiny Town, our town is so small I think there's 500 of us. Any little thing that happens, someone finds out about it and someone's gonna find out about her and I and I'm gonna fucking flip. I'm not ashamed of her. I am. But I'm not, I like her a lot and I have told her after highschool I will leave Claire for her. No big deal. I like her over my girlfriend now.

143,"As the title states my girlfriend and I of two years were dating and she decided to stop taking birth control and not tell me. But there's many factors involved. I am American and she is Phillipino and we met in a middle Eastern country we both worked in as I used to work there.

Basically her and I were together and in February I was switching jobs so I went out of the country for most of Feb. She had her period earlier in Feb and decided not to take her birth control. I returned back later than month and we argued and didn't talk for a week and some change. Finally in March we had sex and then later that month she told me she missed her period. I, of course puzzled asked how that's possible and she said she stopped taking her birth control.

I ended up going back to the States cause I had already quit my job and she also decided to go back to Philllipines. She then asked me to buy her a house and give her $800/month in support. That's more money than she was making overseas in our country as we worked in the middle East.

 I'm very angry about the deception but here's the major twist in all of this. I spoke to a lawyer and he stated that she cannot take me to the court for child support since she's not in the US. Only a parent residing in the States, with the child can collect child support from another parent.

Hence, I have the option to walk away scot free legally and she cannot force me to take a DNA test. I'm very angry at her deception as well as her attempting to tell me that if we don't get married I can never see the child.

I'm almost tempted to walk away from this entire thing but then again I know it isn't the child's fault. The only way the child can become a citizen is if I were to initiate the process willingly. Hence unlike everyone else in this situation, everything is optional. However, by that same token I have almost no rights for her to let me see the child and any agreements made cannot be enforced since I will not be in Philippines so she can just withdraw the child out of my life. There is no reciprocal agreement for child support with Philllipines and the US.

146,"To make a long story short, in fourth grade I met this guy around my age. We became fast friends, and all was well, except that he would make sexual comments, our conversations would sometimes turn sexual. He mentioned that he had been abused, tied up and forced to do things by his biological parents. I don't know if any of what he told me was true, but I do know that he was screwed up. He got into fights in school, lashed out, and self harmed. I have some repressed memories of things he did and said to me, but all I really recall is the one time I tried breaking up a fight involving him, and he punched me in the p\*ssy. Straight-up. I limped away out of shock and terror. I *think* he laid hands on me before that, but it's been repressed for so long that I can't pick an incident out.

Fast-forward, and our teachers are required to give us basic sex education. Some of the previous conversations I had with this guy suddenly clicked, and it made me feel horrible and disgusted with myself. I pushed him away, everyone, and cut myself off. I fell into severe depression and I have body dysmorphic disorder as a result. I sometimes have weird nightmares that have sexual themes and they remind me of him, of what happened. I have a distrust for male figures in my life, no matter how close they are to me.

Today I found him online. I have pictures to compare with. I even know his full name, and I have no doubts that it's him. The question is... do I try and DM him? Do I get closure and talk about it with him? I'm so confused and scared. I just think that maybe it could help my depression now, at 17 years old, and maybe give me an answer for what happened. I want to know how his life has been for the past 7 years. I want him to know that I'm hurt.",22Apr2020,1

We connected very quickly when we first met at work and they were very easy to talk with. We became very close and I was happy to have them in my life. 
But they’ve revealed some very toxic behaviors and ways of thinking. I’m honestly scared what this person would say/do if I try to say I don’t want to be friends anymore. They’ve said things to me like “it’s important to have dirt on everyone, just in case they ever wrong you” and “just so you know, I do go through your Twitter account to see what you like.” That just doesn’t seem normal to me. 
There have been other red flags throughout the course of our friendship. They often ask me for advice, gets mad at the advice I give, and then gets upset when something goes wrong after not listening to what I have to say. They post things on social media about not respecting anyone and wishing people were dead.

149,"So, I’m a substance abuse counselor for an inpatient substance abuse counseling facility. I’m considered essential, but my unit may be about to close down. Several months ago, we were placed under investigation about false claims made by a client, when it was found our previous Director had not given us some vital information regarding corrective actions given to our unit following the death of an infant. She took a different position, never informed us of the changes, and so, those of us left on the unit didn’t enact the changes. As a result, we were placed on an admissions freeze until a plan of correction could be agreed upon.

Since this freeze, we have dwindled down to 4 clients. We can hold up to 18. On Friday, our Deputy Regional Director (who happens to be the former director that didn’t inform us of the necessary changes) is going to have a meeting with us regarding what will happen with our severely under-census unit.

I’m fairly certain the meeting is being held to close down my unit, putting me out of a job and very necessary health insurance. What do I do to proceed if I lose my job on Friday?",22Apr2020,1
150,"What’s the point?

What is the point of continuing to survive if you don’t see life going anywhere. I had ideas for the future, but they no longer seem reachable. And by reachable I mean like there’s no way I’ll live that long to achieve them. Just in my mind their all blurry, because I know inside that I won’t last that long. 

I have no more motivation from anyone or anything. Life is just a burden, and I’m just waiting for an accident to happen. 

My mental state is going crazy, I’m too young to get help, but my parents don’t care.

I had a therapist, but I realized that they are not what I need.

I’m too much of a cowardly introvert to seek help without the knowledge of my parents.

It seems like this is it for me, because life has just stopped. 

I have now gotten memory loss so I don’t remember anything from my past. And a wall in my brain prevents me from imagining my future. 

I’m just stuck in a limbo.

What is the point?

I would really love some advice",22Apr2020,1
151,"Like the title, I recently got a new job. It started in March, did the week long training, then during the weekend, I got sick. Work was very worried about Coronavirus, so I was told 2 weeks, then come back. I just had a bad case of influenza and strep throat, so all cool. Called my boss, and he said no more outside training (I still had 3 in field training days). So I asked if I'm unemployed or furloughed. Changed his tune *very* quickly, new start date of Tuesday.

I work for 2 weeks, then this week, got sick again. Food poisoning. Doctor said 2 days, then I'm fine. A few hours ago, I had a back spasm that left me hunched over like Quasimodo. The pain is insane and its not the first time its happened. I had to take muscle relaxers for 3 days to get it under control. I really want and need to keep this job. Any advice on how to handle this?

154,"Disclaimer: I am trying to not include any vulgar or anything that will remotely be thought of as 'offensive' or violating the rules of this subreddit by the moderators. My apologies if I sound robotic its my first time posting here and I really don't want to get flagged :)

Hi everyone! I am making this on a throwaway account. 

A little backstory. My high school is full of drama and there have been constant instances of someone being bullied, no matter what grade they are in. Not really different than any other high school. This being my senior year, I was so excited to leave all of this juvenile garbage behind. There are many cliques in my school and often there is a lot of bullying between these cliques. The teachers are completely oblivious and the principals and other admin. are least concerned about it. Every now and then we get some talk about why bullying is bad but no action is really taken so a lot of people have just stopped reporting it out of fear the problem gets worse or if they are labelled as a 'snitch.'

Because of the ongoing viral issue in the world right now, we all have been out of school for a while and naturally, it is starting to get to some people. People, specifically one group of girls who think that everyone LOVES them, from the senior year are making Instagram (ig) accounts to pass the time. No harm done. They made one for graduation sweaters and they made one to know which person is going to what post-secondary etc. However yesterday, 'someone' (probably one of the girls in that group) made an account to post anonymous confessions that the seniors have about each other from a third-party app. (I know this is me speculating but within 2 days, 3 different accounts are created regarding the students in the high school. The graduation sweater and the post-secondary account are both created by the same person, so I assumed that the confessions account is also made by them. Also, these girls LIVE for gossip or to just get dirt on anyone to talk smack about them). 

Nobody really cared, most of the confessions at the beginning were people saying who they find attractive etc. and the confessions were friends trolling their friends. No big deal. However, almost overnight the account got really popular and now they are posting confessions have become a lot more sexual. I know this is super common amongst teenagers. The confessions continued, some of them are homophobic and some of them are starting to target teachers accusing them of being sexist and being privileged, and not giving fair grades because of superiority complexes etc. One teacher who has had mental health issues in the past (they have told my class this) has also been brought up in one of the confessions and the confession shocked me because of how vulgar and confrontational it was. (It was about the teacher's private life, something that the teacher is really uncomfortable sharing in the first place, hence I'm assuming the student they told is someone who they trusted or someone they attempted to sympathize with regarding personal problems. The teacher comes across as someone who is very easy to talk to).

A lot of the other confessions are about teenage 'activities' and fortunately, no names have been named (yet). However, I'm afraid that when someone's name does eventually get brought up, the person running the ig account will have no shame in posting it publicly for everyone to see. I have friends who have done 'stuff' but that is nobody's business except theirs and who they choose to tell. I don't think its fair (its not even consensual) if stuff like that is publicly aired out for everyone to see. 

I want to tell one of my science teachers about it because a) they have dealt with problems like this before and b) they are always checking up on us during this difficult time via email and they genuinely care about the students. I'm hoping that if they, a teacher, brings up this issue, it will be taken seriously by the admin. in my school. I want action to be taken and I don't want anyone to get hurt or feel offended by any of the confessions posted. I am also conflicted because what if no action is taken especially with us literally having a very slim chance of going back to school for this year. 

Is this a good idea? One friend of mine I talked to about this said that I should learn how to take a joke and this is 'just for laughs' and 'it is not that serious.' I think it kind of is serious, especially since this is a really crappy way to end off senior year. I'm really conflicted and I hope I can gain some insight by posting this.",22Apr2020,1

Our flatmate decided to lockdown at her partner’s place. Fine.

Our rent, power and internet bill is split between the four of us.

Today she announced she wouldn’t be paying internet or power because she isn’t here using it (will still pay normal rent). She hasn’t been here for a number of weeks, all her stuff is still here.

Our internet is fixed - we pay the same amount no matter how much we use.

Our power has a base fee, plus what we use.

We agree our flatmate shouldn’t have to pay for power she isn’t using, but think she should pay the base fee and her portion of the internet fee given that is also fixed.

If she didn’t want to pay for these things, it would have been smart to inform us before she left - she didn’t.

160,"Hello, I've made a post on here already on dealing with my alcoholic father. I am currently a 19 year old college student living with my parents. For the past three years my home life has been rough due to my dads alcoholism and over all being a shitty guy. My parents are constantly screaming at each other, etc. 

Yesterday my father was arrested for driving under the influence. Although I wasnt shocked he got a DUI, it was still really hard to process and has plummeted my mental health. My mom and I have already had to pay $800 due to the car being impounded/towed.  My dad hasn't take any responsibility and has little care. My mom and I cry endless nights not knowing what to do. 

After years of him being a shitty guy, this has been the last straw. All the shit that has gone down has truly fucked me up. Its pushed me into a really dark place. My mom hasn't kicked him out only because he has no where to go and would die fairly easy from withdrawal. We both hate him to the core but have that small empathy holding us [back.](https://back.At) At this point I dont know what to do. I want him gone but I would feel bad letting him die in the streets. My mom needs a divorce asap but we both have little money and no clue where to even start. Especially due to the epidemic, I feel hopeless and stuck in the hell that is being around him.

161,"To make a long story short, in fourth grade I met this guy around my age. We became fast friends, and all was well, except that he would make sexual comments, our conversations would sometimes turn sexual. He mentioned that he had been abused, tied up and forced to do things by his biological parents. I don't know if any of what he told me was true, but I do know that he was screwed up. He got into fights in school, lashed out, and self harmed. I have some repressed memories of things he did and said to me, but all I really recall is the one time I tried breaking up a fight involving him, and he punched me in the p\*ssy. Straight-up. I limped away out of shock and terror. I *think* he laid hands on me before that, but it's been repressed for so long that I can't pick an incident out. I remember he had rough hands... but that's it.

Fast-forward, and our teachers are required to give us basic sex education. Some of the previous conversations I had with this guy suddenly clicked, and it made me feel horrible and disgusted with myself. I pushed him away, everyone, and cut myself off. I fell into severe depression and I have body dysmorphic disorder as a result. I sometimes have weird nightmares that have sexual themes and they remind me of him, of what happened. I have a distrust for male figures in my life, no matter how close they are to me.

Today I found him online. I have pictures to compare with. I even know his full name, and I have no doubts that it's him. The question is... do I try and DM him? Do I get closure and talk about it with him? I'm so confused and scared. I just think that maybe it could help my depression now, at 17 years old, and maybe give me an answer for what happened. I want to know how his life has been for the past 7 years. I want him to know that I'm hurt.",22Apr2020,1

I'm 19. I have a baby with me (5 months old). I also have my boyfriend with me and he is 21 
I dont want to get comments about how young I am and how I made a mistake etc etc it's only going to make me more upset and less helpful. 

I currently live with my parents and little sister and boyfriend with the baby. I work at a family friend owned restaurant that pays little but it is still enough for me and the baby and gas for the car that my dad handed down to me that's also paid off (super thankful) 
Boyfriend lost his job because of this pandemic and is on the search for any hiring jobs and tried to do unemployment but the site and phone calls aren't working. I have a high school diploma and my boyfriend doesnt have a GED or diploma. 
This household is very stressful for me. Everyone is lazy, house is always dirty and I'm so OCD about that. First thing after work I go straight to first everyone's mess.... My parents are divorced, dad owns the house and has full custody over my little sister aafter the messy cases we had.. mom wasn't allowed to see us unsupervised but my mom is a fucking leech and the devil. Takes a lot of pills and is just a messy person and nobody can do anything because we are also too nice and still love her... shes broken too many laws. The only person who really works at this home is just me and my dad. So you can see why I hate being here... my family really made me want to commit suicide more than anything.

My hobby is playing video games.

172,"So this year I started becoming closer to a colleague of mine at uni and all was well except for my mental state. I forgot why I was at uni and what my purpose and passion was(complicated long story but short version is my uni sucks ass and I lost all meaning of why I go there) so I started searching for meaning elsewhere. By trying to make friends and trying to talk to people who understand me. Huge mistake because where I live, people at uni put barriers and limits to everything. Their friendships are very superficial and I didn't know that that was the norm. Anyway..

I always liked this guy. He's funny, he's smart and he's nice to me and was nice to me even when everyone was ignoring me socially. You could say it's because he wanted to use me to an extent (I get good scores and people here do that to anyone who gets good scores) but I didn't mind because he was upfront if he wanted something and did it with respect.

I started to get to know him better this year as I found out one of his friends(who's a horrible person) would tell him every detail of my life she knew(I trusted her with some stuff but nothing too serious) and he would come and talk to me about it and try to talk to me for a long time and drag on conversations with me.

I always had this feeling he was maybe using me but I ignored it and told myself to not mess up yet another friendship. And I did lol... My self entitlement just couldn't let small shit go. I would get mad if he ignored me or one day I told him I wanted to sit down and chat with him and he said he'd be back so we can study and I said okay even tho I didn't wanna study. I made a joke about how he was going to escape and not come back. I waited for an hour then went and found him with his other friends studying with them so tbh I was kind of mad and felt like I was being used and he just tolerated me so he can get what he wants from me.

Also his female friend from earlier would tell me things he'd say to her and it was weird. He treated her so differently than how he treated me. Another person who is related to him asked me why I liked him and told me I'm going to find out he's trash so I need to stop hanging out with him so much.

Honestly I just got angry in the end. I didn't wanna stay his friend anymore. All these thoughts were plaguing my head. Why is he friends with toxic people? Why is he different with me and another person in front of others? What does he want from me? So the day before unis shut down for lockdown I just ignored him on purpose and he sensed that and never texted me or hung out with me again.

My issue is that I keep dreaming about him. I feel guilty for what I did. He was nice to me but so many things weren't adding up. And many people were telling me he isn't a good person. I just snapped and said fuck him and fuck anyone else who isn't truly my friend. But I can't stop having dreams about us laughing or chatting or fighting or whatever else..it's been a month of this shit and I want it to end because it's annoying and distracting.

Say for example getting ready for my boyfriend to visit...he works multiple jobs and he has other responsibilities so he can't always let me know in advance when he's coming over.

I have to ensure I've food in the house but have to go shopping the day before he visits as if I go on the day he visits I don't have enough time to bathe (I'd be sweaty as it's a long walk). Except to go shopping I have to have clean hair so I've got to time it so I can wash my hair the night before I go shopping in order to avoid over-washing my hair. I then also have to do housework, in particular things like my changing bedding so it's fresh or changing the cats litter trays have to be done on the day before he comes over. 

I also feel like I've impossible standards, I'm poor so don't live in the nicest home...it's okay, it's always clean and well presented, but I put a lot of pressure on myself to try to make it look at good as possible as in my head I think it should look like a show home. In the mean time my boyfriends home isn't much different to mine but he doesn't put nearly as much effort into making it look nice, dishes are rarely done and doesn't vacuum...I'm fine with this, but it makes me wonder why the hell I kill myself trying to make my home look like a show home when he's hardly got tip top standards. Frankly same comparison can be made in how much effort I put into my grooming and clothing verses effort he makes on his looks. I don't need to be so highly strung or high maintenance!

Him visiting could mean a few days of my trying to time shopping, housework, and personal grooming so everything is perfect - which means I'm running around like a headless chicken, and if I don't know when exactly he's visiting I end up stressed. 

**Note : it's not just about my boyfriend visiting**, it's not about asking him to give me more of a heads-up (he can't anyway), this is just one example of how my being a 'type a' person stresses me out, I'd just love to be as laid back and casual as my partner.",22Apr2020,1

I had good intentions and paved the road to hell with them. Things weren't good with us, but I tried because I owed them and I loved them as a friend. I still do. See, aren't I the good guy. Poor me, trapping myself in a loveless marriage so I could do the right thing. Poor poor me.

So then I realized I was trans (ftm) and they freaked the ever-living fuck out. At the time, I had just made this friend \[25NB\] online. And I turned to them and they helped keep me sane and supported me. They were everything I was missing in that relationship with my spouse. My spouse and I never had much in common. Oh, poor me. My friend had all these qualities...kind, attentive, smart, educated, witty, had never screamed at me for 30 hours about how I couldn't be trans, was also a writer who was interested in my work, liked things other than playing WoW, I could have actual conversations with them. They listened, they wanted me around, as much as you can be around in online friendship. We talked every day, shared a lot.

After a few months, I got a crush on them. Yep, creepy old guy, in addition to cheating bastard! I'm awesome. I figured it would go away. Those things happened. It didn't. Even now, after everything, I'm in love with them, unfortunately. I figured there was no way they'd reciprocate, so I didn't say anything for a long time. When I finally did, they, of course, did not have those feelings for me and it probably has destroyed the friendship but we'll see. I confessed a month after my ex broke it off with me because they believed we would be better off as friends. They are correct. We should only have ever been friends. They're thriving now that they're free of me.

TL;DR - Caught feelings for a friend while still married. Was that cheating? Was that emotional infidelity? I think it was. I didn't mean to fall for my friend but I did.

There's a bonus round, if anyone wants to play, regarding my friend. But it's even more complicated and I don't even know anything anymore.

See, they're a flirt. And I'm an idiot. A bit before confessing how I felt, I finally asked a friend about this, because it was getting really painful. And he asked if I thought that my friend had feelings too. I said no, of course they didn't. They wouldn't. This is me we're talking about here, you know. I look like a cave troll. Well, after I talked about it more, shared some chat logs, they were like ""Ok, dude, that's called flirting. They're flirting with you. A lot. I'm pretty sure they're into you."" I, as a certified moron, didn't register it as flirting. I registered it as ""That could be read as flirting, perhaps, if it was towards someone other than me. Unsure of how to respond. Ignore."" And so it went. But, despite appearances, they were not interested in me in the slightest. I knew that. I never really believed they were even if my friends did. I knew better.

But, damn if they weren't flirty, in retrospect. And even now, trying to figure out if friendship is possible, it's the most passionate platonic relationship ever. It's as though everything is there except them having romantic feelings. It's honestly a complete mindfuck, how it can look like something but be nothing. However, they absolutely and unequivocally do not have any romantic feelings towards me no matter how it looks and I have to just live with that. They've said they're like this with all their friends and had thought we had a perfectly platonic friendship that had no potential for either of us developing feelings, so it was ok for them to act so flirtatiously. In a platonic friendship, they see that as merely friendly banter. I don't know if I bantered back. My response to flirting is freeze and get all awkward and try to act normal.

So, what the hell? Are British people like this? Is it cultural? I will never understand people and honestly my default assumption no one would be interested in me and anyone that seems like they might be is clearly a misinterpretation really is the only safe tack to take ever. I don't know when I'll get over my friend. My heart is stubborn that way and it takes me a while. Oh, I know, I'm a disgusting hypocrite, because I fell for this person while still with my now-ex and I have the gall to talk about loyalty. But, when and if I can move on from them, I honestly don't think I should even attempt to date because I don't know how anything works. I do know if I ever get feelings for literally anyone ever, I will ghost them because I'm not doing this again.",22Apr2020,1

185,"I fell out with a friend I met about 4 years ago. We called each other best friends. But heres why we fell out ( this was around June last year).....We both were in a group chat with a boy we were friends with back. So one day I said “this group chat lame” at that moment I felt like they were getting offended. I said “y’all just ain’t funny”. Thats when she was like “every conversation ain’t gotta be funny” After that I said ok , bye. Then a few days later she posted a pic saying she never had a genuine friend and she wish she find a best friend that likes to do the same thing she does. I asked her who she was talking about. I guess she felt offended by that too because everything she said came off aggressively. All I did was ask who she was talking about because I thought we were still friends. She said “ i think u like arguing what ever it is lame asf. Mfs do shit to you and you try to take it out on people you supposedly fuck with. “ So on and so we were going back and forth. At that point I just knew we weren’t gonna be friends anymore. She kept expecting the worst and twisting everything I say around to make it seen like Im mad about what she posted. So I said, your insecurities are gonna keep you from having healthy relationships. I really felt strong about it thought. She thinks everyone is out to get her. After a while it was like we couldn’t even joke around with her anymore. She even said Im always negative. I don’t think I am though. We both crack jokes on each other. What friend ship doesn’t. After that I was just like bye and she kinda made it clear that she didn’t want to be friends anymore but in a sarcastic way. But anyways..... I wanted to try to build our friendship back up despite what we both said about each other I think we were good friends. Do you think this friend ship is worth fighting for ?",22Apr2020,1
186,"This may be a bit long so bear with me please. I am a junior in a Louisiana college and I’m taking a required 101 class (we’ll say it’s geology) that ranges from freshmen to seniors. We will call the professor Karen. Due to the pandemic, we are all switched to online classes. Today (April 21 2020) we had our third exam in her class. She gave us 20 minutes to answer 20 multiple choice questions and we were not allowed to go back and review or change our answers. There were two parts to the test; if you did not make at least an 80% on part one of the test you were not allowed to do part 2. This specific exam covered 7 chapters of lectures that were 45minutes -1 hour in length. We had more time (30m) to cover 20 questions in our last online exam and Karen was even emailed about making the exam longer, which she said she would take into consideration. Majority of us failed or close-to-failed- the exam. And as a side note, we were still in class for the review of the previous exam, but when we showed up she told us to leave and watch the videos as she was not going to teach the class”.

A good amount of our class had emailed her to tell her we thought it was unfair to set these kinds of conditions when they were not the conditions previously. I sent her an email voicing my complaints and she responded that the university advised one minute per question and passively aggressively said “one minute per question is adequate time if you are prepared.” She also said she would consider what I told her for the next exam. She was passive aggressive to other students who emailed her the same thing. She sent another email to the whole class that if we had above a 70% overall, we were allowed to skip the final and the assignments it comes with. Given that the class average is probably around a D, it would only benefit the minority of the class

I decided to send a mass email through Moodle to other students and start a GroupMe and made sure to exclude Karen. Around 40 other students joined and we all made the same complaints. We all decided to email the Dean to file a complaint with him. Eventually the GroupMe turned into banter and complaining about Karen, making jokes at her expense and wished ill-will onto her, in a non-threating, non-serious way. The way you would joke about a teacher who screwed us over during a global pandemic. 

Here’s where it gets interesting, it turns out we had a rat in the GroupMe. Someone must have emailed her screenshots of our private conversation as Karen sent out the email I attached below. 

My question isn’t about the exam, or us emailing the dean or anything to that regard. We are all firmly grounded that this exam was unfair so I don’t think our opinion will change about that. I want to know if our right to free speech was violated. We did not invite her into our group and we moved the conversation to a different non-academic platform. We also never used her name specifically, so the comment could be about anyone. If she tries to use our groupme against us with the dean, would she have any leverage?",22Apr2020,1

190,"So quick summary of me. Im 20 (21 later this year) and i have a loving girlfriend of almost 2 years at this point. I love her dearly, she's helped me through my worst times thus far. But this is where i'm being troubled and why i turned here for help. I can't seem to get over my ex from my junior year of high school. (i was class of 2017 btw) We dated for only about 2 months but I had been crushing on her basically since freshman year. I think the only reason she got with me is because she felt bad for me for having had that crush on her for so long, idk. Anyways after we had broken up i was obviously heart broken for a while and it didn't help that the break up didn't phase her at all. Within the next few days she was seemingly talking to one of our friends, and after graduation I found out that she had slept with one of the younger substitute teachers at the school. Looking back now it might be obvious that she maybe was just on of those people that was always off and on with relationships and I just didn't see it at the time. Anyways, after that she moved to a different school senior year and I just couldn't forget about her. During her senior year at another school she got a new boyfriend that she dated for about a year i think. She would always talk to me about him and while it hurt me, I didn't want to just ignore her. Believe me, it hurt like hell. Anyways, we both kept up with each other throughout senior year to keep acquaintance, however after a while we just parted ways. She knew how insecure about myself I was and what my inner problems were and how to help me. I only got worse after we had split. Maybe its as simple as me getting attached to easily or me being obsessive and needing to be told so. As for my current girlfriend I've talked with her about it and it obviously didn't go well, but she understood where I was coming from. I don't know what I need but I just want to be able to get my ex out of my mind. I wanna say about 2 or 3 times a month she comes into my mind and she's all i can think about for a while and I hate it because all it does is remind me of my past and how I let one girl ruin my whole perspective of myself as a man.

191,"I am 20 years old and a college student and I have a part time job at a grocery store. I was on educational leave  from my job for the winter because I had a particularly heavy course load and I planned on returning to work at the beginning of May. Well, now with the global pandemic and all, I'm not sure I want to do that.

I am currently living with my parents who are both essential workers but they see far less people in a day than I would at the grocery store. I worried sick that if I go back to work I will end up getting my whole family sick and someone could die. I really, REALLY do not want that to happen. 

Here's the problem - I really need money for the fall. My University is far from my house and I live on campus while attending. Next year I planned on getting an apartment with some friends so obviously I'd need money for food and rent and other expenses. I can pay for a fairly good chunk of a year's rent where my friends and I want to live with what I have saved right now, but it would be a stretch to live on that.

My parents have offered to help me pay some of the expenses in the fall and say they understand why I wouldn't want to work right now. I feel really conflicted. Is it selfish of me to not work this summer? I feel bad still taking my parents' money when I have the means to make money myself.

201,"A couple of weeks ago I learned about ADHD, or more like what it actually is. I always assumed it meant that you were hyperactive and were looking for attention (which it isn’t. At all.). After reading a comment from a person with ADHD I realized that I had similar/ almost the same experiences throughout my whole life. So I started to read different sources and experiences from persons with ADHD and realized I could really relate to most of them, and that for example they could be the reason for my “laziness” during school (never doing homework; never studying; never meeting deadlines and when I did, I did the task in the night before). 
Now I really want to know whether I actually do have ADHD, as I don’t want to be self-diagnosed and just push my problems onto the “fake illness” which wouldn’t benefit me at all, and just pretend that all my problems aren’t my fault. I went to the doctor on Monday but I didn’t really address my suspicion and just started to talk about some of my problems. He assumed that my problems were based on a difficult situation I am in (which is another story) and Corona. When I said that I really had trouble getting to work, he said that everybody does and that that is normal, that even he does and I should learn to organize myself. I tried to talk about how organizing myself was always a problem since my childhood, but that went nowhere. 

I have another appointment for next week, but I don’t know whether I should address my suspicion, because I don’t know how, and I don’t want to say “I think I have ADHD because I read it on the Internet”. I am also scared that I don’t have ADHD at all, and just hold onto this self-diagnosis to make myself feel better and will sound stupid and maybe even sound like I am just pretending to feel bad or that afterwards I imitate the symptoms of ADHD so he diagnoses me with it. And what if he doesn’t really know ADHD or thinks it has to involve hyperactivity, as I don’t really think I am hyperactive? Or am I just focusing too much on this one illness and I “want” to have it even If I don’t actually do? Am I just hurting myself by looking for the affirmation of my self-diagnosis that I won’t accept anything else?

204,"Hi, I’m mid-30’s guy and for the last six years, I’ve been working towards landing a job as a tv writer and I’m a big believer in the the adage “write what you know”, pulls ideas from your life experiences, etc. It’s been a difficult journey and the biggest reason (besides actually landing a tv writing gig) is dealing with the overwhelming fear and guilt I feel when I write about negative childhood experiences. 

(Quick background, free free to skip) I was raised in a low-middle income family in a suburb sheltered, super-religious, and home schooled. I recognize and acknowledge how lucky I was to have a loving family with opportunity, but like other people, I had my share of trauma. I want to write about these experiences and use them not only for a career but also for potential catharsis or closure. And now I can’t get over this guilt of possibly painting family members in a bad light. 

My mom is aware of my writing block and reinforced it by begging me to never write anything negative about our family. I know I shouldn’t let that obstruct my life, but I can’t stop thinking about it.

My older brother is the same way. He was a horrible bully for most of my childhood, behavior exasperated by my mom and enabled by my father. Fast forward to adulthood, he and I rarely talk.  He does tell me he’s sorry for his past behavior and asks me to never write about what he did to me.  

TL;DR
I’m trying to be the best tv writer I can. Should I care about possibly offending family (and possibly friends) by writing about past trauma they caused?

214,"I'm sorry if this isn't the place to do this, but I just needed some place to go. Today, my boyfriend and I broke up after 5 years of being together. We both have awful mental health issues. I have depression, anxiety, and I'm just extremely insecure. He has extreme depression and due to past emotional trauma and abandonment, he shuts down/isolates himself a lot. We've been realizing that we have hurt each other extremely. We genuinely did try to work this out and talk it out. It was working out and we were finally hearing each other. We were happy for a period, but I think about a month ago we realized that we hadn't grown as much as individuals. 

I've had this issue where I don't ever feel like I'm worth enough, so I'll try to communicate with him about it. It never goes right because.. a rational person doesn't think these thoughts. I have these moments where I doubt everything and just start to cry because I can't explain why. It sometimes turns on randomly and I'll suddenly think everyone hates me and that I'm better off dead. It could last hours to days. This affects the relationship, a lot. I'll ask him if he still loves me, if he still is happy with me, if he only loves me, etc. He told me he wanted me to talk these feelings out with him, but I was going about it wrong because I kept asking him these shitty questions and it felt like I was spitting on his love for me. He also had this issue where he would shut down because he needs the time to just be alone and try to stand up on his own. He won't tell me when it happens, he'll just go. He wouldn't tell me how he was feeling, wouldn't text me for days and I'd worry like crazy and it'd make my insecurities spiral even more. He also sometimes lashed out on me (never got physical). Besides those two main big issues, we were compatible and we loved spending time together and had similar interests. 

Today, he initiated a conversation about breaking up after a conversation we had. He really wrestled with the idea of breaking up and I could tell it was hurting him. He told me ""I think we should end it"" and I understood. He said that he needed to put himself first. I said he was right and that I also needed to grow as a person. We both decided to end it after saying I love you to each other and saying that we will always hold out this love for each other, but maybe we can be friends one day. 

I don't know how to cope with this. I understand why it had to happen. I understand that we were both hurting and that our mental issues + what we chose to do to deal with the issues were dragging the relationship down and each other. This is my first relationship, so I'm quite naive. I thought that if two people loved each other, they could work it out. It's so weird to me after 5 years and not being able to talk to him anymore for the time being. It's so weird because it feels like he's died, even though he's fully there, alive. I had all these hopes and dreams with him and we had these big, big plans before lockdown happened where we would go on road trips together and do everything we've ever wanted to do. I was telling him about how I'm finishing up a gift for him. It's so weird to me because we didn't end in a screaming match where we yelled ""I hate you"". We still told each other we loved each other. It's so weird, none of us cheated, none of us did anything besides unintentionally hurt each other with the baggage we had. I don't know how to move on and get over him. He really was a good, respectful boyfriend. I can't move on by spitting disrespect on his name or by erasing his memory because he was 5 years of my life that I will always look back on happily. I just don't know how to not feel so much pain because this person who I love dearly will never be with me again. 

TLDR: Boyfriend and I of 5 years were unintentionally hurting each other due to our mental baggage. He initiated a conversation about breaking up, saying he needed to put himself first and that we both need to work on ourselves. I agreed with him entirely and told him that I know I need to do some growing. We broke up in the most respectful, bittersweet way and we said that we still loved each other, but that this wasn't going to work out. The breakup wasn't a screaming match. It wasn't due to cheating or that we fell out of love. I don't know how to not feel so much pain knowing that this person I love and hold so dearly to me will never be with me again. I will never get to make memories with this person again or be by his side to see his accomplishments.

How do I grow from this? How can I grow as a person and try to not let my mental baggage define me? How can I be happy again? How can I feel like ""myself"" after 5 years with this guy who has changed my life for the better?  Is it smart to be friends with him again once we have both healed?",22Apr2020,1
215,"1, 2, 3, 4 = racist friends
Z and Q = friends that fought with me
Me = me

I have two friends who I will not give an information about, because I am afraid they’ll find this. I’ll call them 1 and 2.

1 and 2 have had racist incidents in the past. They got caught spouting the n-word and other unsavory phrases. They did this with their ex-partners, but they were the ones that got caught. When they got caught they cried and apologized profusely.

That’s the only time they got caught. I’ve tried to fight against them.

Along with 3 and 4 (more friends), they told us that the n-word was ‘just a word’ and that they should be allowed to say it. The groupchat we were in even had a racist name, something about black people, I think. They weren’t only racist to black people, but it was common.

Z, Q, and I told them that they were racist, straight up, and they removed us from the chat. ‘If you don’t like it, then just leave, pussy’

I am currently in a groupchat with 1 and 2 and a few other unnamed friends. Groupchat doesn’t have a racist name this time, fortunately.

Recently they started it again. 
‘omg the colored make such big deals of stuff that doesn’t even matter’
‘there’s so many shows just about blacks’
‘we don’t chain you up and whip you for agriculture anymore, get over it’

I am a bit hesitant to share even what they said, some of it is atrocious and suspiciously specific. I think they also use Reddit, so if they’re seeing this, hi.
 
I’m also led to believe that my best friend is sympathizing with them. They said that it’s just a word as well. I got so mad I deleted the conversation, but I wish I had screenshotted it.

I have begun to doubt myself, if they really are racist... Reddit, are my friends racist? If they are, what should I do?",22Apr2020,1
216,"Hello people. I've been recently violently robbed by a large group of people near my job while returning home, all of them armed and using a vehicle. 

Today I've been doing all the paperwork to recover my documents and I've lost a laptop and a phone, but that's just material stuff. Fortunatedly I wasn't harmed. I've left a report with the police but the chances of them doing anything are very slim. 

What I'm dealing right now is with an intense fear of going back to work. It's a very bad neighbourhood given that I work directly with the production line and the factory is in this bad neighbourhood where there are many other factories, and a lot of people have been losing jobs due to the recent virus outbreak, and I travel via public transport. I feel very afraid.

Do you have any experience with this kind of situation and do you know how to deal with these intense fears?

Thank you very much.I appreciate it a lot.",22Apr2020,1
217,"I never really cared for school in general. I truly believe that you can be successful without a degree or good grades in high school. Even with this belief I still want to go to college to have a set career that I can grow off of rather than starting with nothing. Over this last school year, I was doing well. Not great grades but still passing. I had a job money and a car. Long story short my heart was destroyed. As you would guess my motivation to do anything completely went away. My grades severely dropped from the A's and B's I had at the time and continued to get worse. I have gotten over the lost relationship but my grades didn't get better. I was still passing before COVID but I am unsure now. My goal was to just do well in the last quarter so that I could get the year over with. Classes got harder and I just don't do well with classes in an online setting. I never get the work done. 

  
I think I'm going to fail Junior year. This is not what I'm concerned about though. I know that I will still graduate at the same time and not have an extra year of high school. I can still go to community college which was my goal in the first place. My issue is that now because of my grades my mom isn't going to help with car insurance even if I still pay for my part. I don't have money because I got in a minor crash that I had to pay off (didn't affect my insurance)   
My dad is not wealthy and spends all of his time with a gf that sucks more money out of him because she's 35 and more broke than me. My mom loves to make every situation a thousand times bigger of a deal than it actually is and would rather fight my dad in court and spend tens of thousands of dollars and the money saved for me to go to college on a lawyer rather than help me.   
I'm a very extroverted person I hate being home alone all the time. I have to have a friend with me or go out every other day. Which I still do but just with significantly fewer people and people I know haven't left their house as well. My problem is that if my car isn't insured it makes it ten times harder for me to get a job and pay for things like the car or just to be able to hang with people. I also won't be able to hang with friends and be stuck at home with my dad and do nothing while my dad's time is spent arguing with his girlfriend. Moving to my mom's isn't any better.   
My dad genuinely can't afford it even if I pay part of it but my mom even with this pandemic definitely can. It's not her money it's money from child support and just having access to money because I'm part of this side of the family. As you know my mom can't make deals and loves to blow everything out of proportion.

  
Over the next few years, my goal was to build as much passive income as possible in as many ways as possible. Without a car, I can't have a stable well paying job (if that exists after this pandemic) to be able to have money and make more money with it. I'm also going to save 75% of my income as well.  
I feel that I will be severely held back for many years without being able to drive.   
I don't know what to do.",22Apr2020,1

219,"I graduated back in December 2019, my 6 month grace period has been extended by COVID-19, so I will not \*have\* to make my first student loan repayment until November 28th 2020. I owe around $33.7k between 8 different loans, and I want to begin repayment before I am required to. I know nothing about this, and my parents try to help but i'm not sure they can, they didn't go to college and tend to just give advice they read on the first google result they find. I feel bad talking to them about it because I know they would like to help me out, but my mom was just diagnosed with cancer under a month ago and have a lot of medical bills now.

My loans range from 2.5k to 7k in pricing and interest is all over the place. People like Dave Ramsey suggest to start with the smaller loans, and ""snowball""...but would it really be more beneficial to pay off two of the smallest loans (\~$2,500 with 4.29% interest rate) or go hard with as much as I can at the biggest one ($7,492 with 5.05%) before the interest rate kicks back in on 11/28/20.

I already know I won't be able to pay as much as I'd like to, but i'm hoping to at least put 5k into them before November. This could either totally pay off the two smallest with average interest rate or make a huge chunk in the biggest with highest interest rate. 

Thanks for any advice!",22Apr2020,1
220,"So as stated, I need help deciding what to do next year. I am currently a senior in high school, and I’m committed to a school that I’m very happy with next year. Unfortunately, covid came around at a pretty bad time for me. A lot of colleges are starting to plan for doing online classes next year, and I’m afraid that I’m gonna be stuck doing this. I hate online classes. My high school transitioned to them, and I just can’t motivate myself to do work, and I’d hate for that to happen next year too. The other option for me is take a gap year. I’d rather not do this, but in my mind it’s better than online classes. I’ve even gotten a plan for what I’d like to do.

221,"I'm a 38 f I have a 12 y/o child, before the Covid 19 and all that crazy stuff I got a roommate to be able to afford my house payment and other stuff since I didn't get paid a lot, I work from home so I made that trade of not making much money  but I  get to stay at home since last year, now the guy is good roommate  he has his issues as anyone, he is not currently working he claims to have enough to live comfortably for a couple of months. He has being paying his rent. 

The thing is that it makes me terribly uncomfortable the fact he will go out by himself to buy his stuff and does not use a face mask or clean the stuff he brings home from the stores.  When he goes out he uses public transportation, I have a car I have offered to drive him to the store, I gave him a face mask I have gave him disinfecting wipes, I haven't seen him using them.

I believe he just wants to go out because he feels bored.  I get it he is not antisocial like me so being at home all day must be hard, but at the same time I have to worry about myself and my kid, even if you don't believe it, this is not something I can afford to risk if is true or not since I don't have the money to pay for good medical attention if one of us get sick and if he gets sick I  really won't be able to help him.  
He is a grown ass man so I understand I'm not able to tell him to stay home or to make sure he doesn't bring the disease just because he won't order his groceries for delivery like I do. Also he will not accept my help because I usually go to the store early in the morning when no one is there.

222,"So when I was 18, I was nervous a out what college has in store for me. I gained weight due to stress eating and antidepressants, experienced people having heated arguments over religion and politics, heard of people being murdered, raped, frauded, etc.

It was absolutely horrific for me. Fortunately, I pulled through but being in the adult world on my own own is brutal. Currently living in an apartment by myself and have been a shut in mostly due to COVID and this nightmare has been a brutal test. I've been thinking about God again for the first time in years but I'm worried about the reprecussions. I met so many people who were passive aggressive towards Christians on my college campus and accused then of spewing hate speech and psuedoscience.

I honestly don't feel comfortable mentioning my faith to others out of fear of being ghosted. I actually met people who gave me the silence treatment for talking about Christian faith in a positive light. It's as if these people think religion is a poison. I'm not here to proselytize and I do know that whether to become re-commited to the Christian faith is ultimately a personal choice.

228,"So prior to the coronavirus beginning through a series of unfortunate events I (23f) ran out of money for school and moved in with my american aunt (40s f) about 7 months ago. (I’m Canadian, but a dual citizen, so I moved to America to live with her and save money working there). 

Some (too much) back story: 

I’ve never had an ideal relationship with any of my 3 parents. My dad is nice, but he and my mom split up with a nasty divorce when I was 1 and his style of parenting is extremely hands off and mostly just in the form of giving me things that he thinks will piss my mom off. I’ve never lived with him, I used to just visit him in the summer as a kid and even then my aforementioned aunt/older half brother (30s m), would do most of the watching me if we weren’t doing fun actives. I grew up living with my mom, step dad, and younger half brother (15m) in Canada. Every time I’m living with my mom and step dad (who I’ll refer to from now on as my parents) it’s been kind of rocky. Despite being a relatively good kid in high school (I got straight As, and only went to the occasional party, never did drugs or anything crazy, was the president of 2 clubs, had a job, and was in a bunch of extracurriculars - in retrospect an exhausting amount of things), my parents treated me as the “bad seed”. I constantly got kicked out for normal teenage things like talking back or slamming my door, and would frequently couch surf at friend’s places, or stay with my maternal aunt. Meanwhile my younger brother was never really given any rules, frequently taken on family vacations (to Europe, Disney world, etc.) while I was left at home, and despite all this extra love and affection he unfortunately developed a bit of a drug problem, on top of some mental health issues, that involve him frequently trashing my parents house, the cops having to be called several times, etc. I don’t hold it against him at all, in fact I’m worried about him but there’s not much I can do especially since I’m not here often, or for long if I can avoid it. It’s also totally not his fault that my parents prefer him over me, and when he’s his normal self we’re actually pretty close. Despite this they still consider me the “problem child”. With me my step dad is quick to anger and while he’s not physical will frequently yell and threaten to destroy my stuff. My mom can be very controlling and will nitpick everything and insist I grovel at her feet for the privilege of living there, even when it was something as small as 3 months in the summer between university semesters, or now being stuck here because of a pandemic. They originally kicked me out at 18 and I was forced to move to the same city as my dad in the states, who I assumed would take me in and let me finish high school there (I was born in January so I would’ve graduated 6 months after turning 18.) instead he helped me find an apartment he co-signed for and a job. After 10 months my mom felt bad and helped me move home to finish high school, which I then had to do by cramming a year into like 3 months. Since then I’ve kind of had to bounce back and forth between school and living at home during the summer since I’m paying for everything myself and I go to school in an expensive city. When my mom got a job that started paying more money my “expected parental contribution” on my student loans went up to a level I could no longer cover and I had to leave school for awhile to save up extra money. I spent a few months living with my parents who immediately slipped back into their controlling ways, so I moved to America to move in with my aunt in a bigger city with more options for jobs and a lower cost of living. That’s been good so far and I was originally hoping to be able to go back to school in September, or possibly January at the latest. 

However my aunt lives in a state that hasn’t handled the coronavirus pandemic very well and my mom and I get along pretty well from a distance so she convinced me to come home at the end of March to wait out the pandemic in Canada where there’s fewer cases and I have free health care. I had my hesitations but she insisted it would be fine.  While I decided to buy a car when living in the states, I flew home instead of driving as it would’ve been 3-4 days of driving through states with serious outbreaks and it seemed unsafe and expensive. I also took all my belongings when I moved to the states, and I mostly live on my own there as my aunt travels for work and is only home 1-2 weeks out of the month. She’s also single and has no kids so it’s just the two of us in the space. Between that and university I’ve gotten used to being independent and not having to walk on egg shells around everyone or seek permission for everything I do. Now I’m trapped at my parents house during a pandemic, I’ve been here for a month, their third car broke down earlier this week so I can’t get necessities without borrowing one of their cars or getting them to take me and they’ll only do that when I’m “behaving”.  the first 2 weeks I was self isolated in the basement with a bunch of frozen meals and sandwiches and stuff, and the third week they hadn’t seen me in 6 months so it was fine. But now it’s been  getting pretty bad. My mom comes into my room and goes through my stuff when I’m in another room, and gets mad at me for having things she doesn’t like. They try to control what I eat and when, and judge me when I don’t listen. Their third car broke down earlier this week so now if I need to go get necessities I have to go with them or get special permission to borrow one of their cars that they won’t give. My room is in the basement, and whenever I come upstairs they get annoyed with me immediately. The first question when I reach the top of the stairs is generally “what are you doing here?”. When my mom is annoyed with me my step dad decides to take it personally and will yell at me if I even breathe the wrong way. I have a mini fridge and microwave from my dorm in my bedroom but right now that’s just juice and milk so if I don’t go upstairs or out to buy food I can’t eat. None of these things apply to my younger brother, who is allowed to come and go as he pleases between our place and his girlfriend’s and the store. He can yell and destroy the house and threaten people and break things but he still doesn’t get in trouble. And yet despite being 7 years older than him I’m treated like more of a child and it’s suffocating. I can’t think of a good way to deal with any of this or express to them that I just want to be treated like an adult and I need to go get more lactose free milk or I’m going to have a really terrible time locked in the basement. This is all also making my anxiety worse. Asking my maternal aunt for help is no longer an option since, unfortunately, she passed away last year. I could theoretically fly back to my aunt’s in America but the outbreak has been really bad there and on top of that insane people have been protesting in the streets so it doesn’t seem like a safe environment. Plus that would be more than half the money in my bank account and I’m unemployed since I was supposed to start a new job that got shut down due to the pandemic and cancelled all new hires. 

I just don’t know how to deal with my parents or express to them that I need to be treated like an adult and there are some necessities I just need to get. (Uber/Lyft isn’t an option because this is a smaller more rural area and isn’t available here, same with postmates, instacart, and similar things.) not
To mention it’s probably mentally unhealthy and physically for me to be trapped like this for months (considering I haven’t been eating until after my mom goes to bed at like 2am). 

Any advice on how to address this with them, or deal with it in any way possible is greatly appreciated. (And wow this post is way too long).",22Apr2020,1
229," 

I am 17 years old, and about a year ago I broke my phone and was unable to access anything on it at all because the screen was so badly damaged. I showed my dad, and he agreed to get me a new phone, so I gave him the old one to throw away or whatever. A few days later he presented me with a new phone and told me that he was able to get all my old pictures off of the old one since he could still plug the old phone into his computer. This made me nervous because I had naked photos and videos of me and my ex-girlfriend having sex on there. Anyway, a few weeks later i decided to go on his computer when he wasn't around and in his timeline I discovered what I feared... he had been viewing all of her pictures and videos. I could not actually see the pictures or the videos but the file names were the same as what I had in my phone such as, ""screenshot\_1127732.jpg."" I clicked on to one of the pictures, but I got an error message as if the picture did not exist on his computer. I realized it was like this for every picture and video. I could only see the name of the picture or video file. After looking into it I discovered this was because he put all of the pictures and videos on to an encrypted drive. Great! So I cant get to where these pictures are because they are encrypted so all I can do is match up the file names to the names on my phone to see what pictures and videos he was looking at. I had no idea what to do and I really did not want to bring it up to my dad even though I was so disgusted. After some consideration I decided I would shove this secret somewhere deep and try not to think about it. Fast forward a few months and I decided to look on his computer yet again. This time I discovered something that really freaked me out. When I saw the file names of the pictures, they did not belong to anything on my phone, but my computer! Why the hell was he on my computer, and why did he take photos from there? This made me very paranoid and from that point on I never had my computer signed in unless I was there, and I changed my password. Something else I discovered was he had pictures from my email that I sent to myself a very long time ago. I know this because I had deleted them from my phone ages ago and the only place where they still existed were in my ""sent"" box to myself in gmail. ONE MORE THING! I ALSO discovered that he has pictures of my current girlfriend that I was not with at the time I broke my phone. I have no idea how he got this since I now keep all pictures of my girlfriend inside of a vault on my phone.

That last event was months ago, and every once and awhile I check and see he still views these things frequently. I have a few questions and a few points to make. First, yes my ex and current girlfriend were and are under 18. I know this is wrong and my only defense is I am also underage and they were my partner so I just don't see it as a bad thing. My father on the other hand is a grown adult and has these things.. gross.. Also, why the hell would he wanna watch a video of his son having sex with any girl?? All of this has been eating me alive this past year, and I really have no idea what to do. I am too scared and embarrassed to say anything to him so I am posting this here to at least get this off my chest. I also should mention that I am not surprised that he managed to get these pictures from me despite my attempts to hide them since he works for the government doing cyber security and is quite tech savvy. Kind of ironic that he works for the government to protect people from things such as this or any kind of privacy invasions yet he does so himself.

We all care for her as a great friend, and I hate to see her struggle like this. I'm not an expert, only a kid as well, and I don't know how to help.

233,"Should I apologize for gossiping?

I haven’t been my best self since I moved to a new school. I didn’t have friends and I changed myself a lot to fit in with the one group that barely accepted me. 

This particular group is very gossipy and negative. A lot of group activity is just talking about other people which is something I would’ve condemned before but just went with because I perceived that I was in no position to deny it.

This isn’t their fault, it’s definitely mine for not sticking to my own morals. I rely too much on validation through friendships. Recently they let me know that the changes I made have not been enough and I still make decisions they dislike. I apologized, and since have distanced myself and am working on being a better person and developing an individual and respectable personality again.

However, I do hold guilt looking back on how much I compromised my own morals. I gossiped about people and I am trying to decide whether I should apologize to the people that were subjects of the gossip/teasing. I never spoke about them to anyone else at school because I actually like their personalities, but my friends didn’t. They don’t know I did, and probably would never know because that group is so closed off from the rest of the school. I hold personal guilt though and I would love to actually know these people because they are morally good leaders on campus.

TLDR: I gossiped about people so my friends would like me, those people don’t know but I feel guilty now that I’m growing. Should I apologize or will it make things worse?",22Apr2020,1
235,"Hey guys. I'm posting this on a throwaway account I made specifically for this post. Genuinely, I can't say I'm looking for advice per-say, but rather am using this as an opportunity to vent out some of my accumulated and pent up frustration, guilt, and shame over the course of the last \~20 months.

I'm a 21 year old guy, former college student at a respectable University. In the fall of 2018, I began my Junior year living off campus in a stand-alone apartment with two random college guys I had never met before the beginning of the semester. At this point in my life, I was (I can say this with confidence) the happiest I had been in my life up until that point. Having struggled with mental health issues my entire life (anxiety, depression, ADHD), I was at a point where I was doing great in college academically (received a 3.8 GPA my Sophomore year), managing my mental health very well, eating extremely healthy, working out 5x/week, and optimistic about the future.

My relationship with my roommates was cordial and friendly. Although we never really became ""friends"" by any means, I never had any problems with who I lived with. I cleaned the common area frequently, never invited anyone over that they didn't know, did no drugs in the house whatsoever, and let my roommates borrow any of my personal belongings whenever they needed. In confidence, I (in retrospect, very naively) informed my roommates of a collection of RC's (research chemical) psychedelics that I had at the time solely for personal use (LSD analogues). They seemed cool with me having this modest collection, so I thought nothing of it. Big mistake.

Fast forward to September 2018. Around noon one day, I had come back from class to make lunch before going back to campus for an afternoon class. After making lunch, I went up to my room to prepare my school work and notes, as usual. Uncharacteristically, I heard a knock on my bedroom door, so I went to answer it. Upon opening the door, I was greeted by two police officers who told me to drop everything I was doing and to go downstairs with them. When I made it downstairs behind the two police officers, I saw both of my roommates sitting together on our couch in the common area. The cops informed us that a ""disturbance complaint"" had been made against us for loud music and the smell of marijuana coming from our apartment (both of which weren't true because none of us smoked weed and none of us played music loudly). When I commented that none of those things were true, the officers proceeded to tell me that they also got a report that drugs were being sold out of our apartment (again, another false statement because none of us sold drugs). They proceeded to legally search our common area after receiving consent from us and found my collection of psychedelic research chemicals. Out of fear, naiveness, and for the sake of my roommates, I admitted that the substances in question were mine (big mistake). Afterwards, they proceeded to interrogate me for about an hour, left with the substances, and came back 30 minutes later, this time with four police cars and the Gang Unit for further questioning. Suffice to say, this has been and continues to this day to easily be by far the worst day of my life. Not only am I 99.99% certain that my own roommates called the police on me, they did so for no reason whatsoever other than to ruin my life from what I can gather. This has been unimaginably troubling for me to come to terms with, and honestly, I don't think I ever will be able to fully understand why they did what they did. After this jarring event, I immediately called my parents to let them know what transpired, and we immediately hired a very highly rated local criminal defense attorney.

Like I said earlier, the drugs were taken from the scene and no arrest was made. Despite this, my parents withdrew me from my University, I moved back home, and from that point onward, I did voluntary drug testing paid for out of pocket 1-2x/week along with voluntary community service. All of these activities were documented and sent to my attorney in hopes that if my case were to ever be picked up, I would have a record of clean living and proof that I was actually a good kid who had made a foolish mistake.

Fast forward again to October 2019 (13 months after the incident with the police), my attorney informs me that the RC's had finally been tested at the Crime Lab and came back positive for analogues of LSD. I was charged with a Third Degree Felony: Possession of a Controlled Substance Penalty Group 1A: 20-80 Abuse Units, and a warrant for my arrest was issued in the county my college was in. The day the warrant was issued, I immediately turned myself in, only to spend two months in jail due to the fact that my parents and none of my family members were willing to pay my bond. They insisted that being in jail was best for me, to learn my lesson, and to never want to get in legal trouble again. After two months in jail, I was finally bonded out after my attorney got into contact with my parents and told them that he believed me sitting in jail any longer than I already had would not serve to improve the odds of me receiving a favorable outcome in my case.

&amp;#x200B;

With all of that said, I hate myself. I hate the position I'm in, I hate the fact that my record is forever tainted with a felony charge. Ever since September 2018, I've found myself slipping down a dangerous path of self-destruction. Since that time, I've gone from a happy, optimistic college student to a depressed, scared, and frankly unhappy drug abuser. In the latter part of 2019, I was abusing cocaine and opiates, two drugs I never in my wildest dreams would've ever touched had this situation never transpired. Upon bonding out of jail, I was swiftly kicked out of my parents' house after refusing to go across the country like they wished for rehab, and I lived with a random girl I had met on Tinder until March. My drug use continued at this point, and I could barely manage to do much more than work, sleep, and get high to cope with the pain I'm feeling. 

Currently, my legal case is still open. Despite all the efforts I made to show the legal/court system that I wasn't a bad kid and that I had simply made a mistake that I deeply regret, my attorney has been telling me since October 2019 that the DA in charge of my file is unwilling to negotiate a plea in which my charge gets reduced. The DA is adamant on convicting me of this third degree felony, and despite my attorney's best efforts, he's telling me to prepare for no charge reduction and felony probation come the end of April. My relationship with my attorney is terrible, with him calling me narcissistic, arrogant, and foolish whenever I try and reach out to him via email to plead with him to work as hard as possible for me to receive the best outcome I possibly can, to avoid a felony conviction, to have a chance at a successful future.

I'm sure I've missed some details, and I'd like to apologize in advance for any incoherency/sloppiness there may be in this post. I typed this out quickly to get this situation off my chest and to see what my fellow Redditors have to say about the situation I'm currently in. Am I crazy to be upset at myself? Am I crazy to feel betrayed by the legal system, neglected, thrown to the wolves? Is it safe to say that it's extremely unfortunate that for the last 7 months, the DA has refused to show me any leniency whatsoever for my charge, having never been in trouble with the law up until this point in my life (I've never even gotten a speeding ticket or parking citation!).

If you've made it this far, I want to say thank you for reading my rant. I love you all, and I hope you all stay safe during these Corona times! God bless and much love &lt;3",22Apr2020,1

Now my only friend is this girl that I liked, we would hang out on the bus and have a ton a fun. Then a old friend of mine came and started dating her and now I’m alone, no one to talk to, no one who cares. And even though I’m a kid, I want to die. All of my “friends” would be happy most likely my family too. And I thought fighting depression was hard before but now no one cares and anxiety, depression and anger just keeps on drowning me with none to help or care, and I can’t tell my parents.

3 - If I seem like an asshole for putting this situation in the public eye, I’m sorry, but my main concern is making sure she’s okay and will stay okay

Alright,
I met my girlfriend in 2018 and we started dating in November. During that time, she opened up to me about her depression (un-diagnosed, I don’t think she ever went to a doctor about this) and she’s been having a terrible home life.
Today, she messaged me saying that she was considered suicide or fleeing from her home because she reacted violently to family when they were screaming and pushing at her, which ended with the family member being hospitalized.
Both her and I are scared, but she’s not in the right state of mind to react to this properly, and neither am I. 
She’s had issues with suicidal thoughts previously.

With all that in mind, what’s the appropriate subreddit to ask for advice on this?",22Apr2020,1
241,"My mother has always ruined my life and won’t stop.

So I’m 19 and I live at home. My mother hates me. I dropped out of college because it was too expensive. I have a “girlfriend” but I can’t reveal that. I hate my life. Please help.

So let’s start at the beginning. (Sorry for grammar I’m on mobile) I have had a dark and happy childhood. Some were good and some where bad. At 16 I was accused of raping a girl (I didn’t) even though she had no proof and was just mad I had told her I didn’t want to date as she just wasn’t my type. Super nice girl just not what I was looking for at the time. She never went to the cops and even admitted last year it never happened. That wasn’t enough to clear my name though. The damage was already done. I had lost friends and even my own mother didn’t believe me. No matter what I do it’s never enough. She has told me multiple times that she wishes she never had me and has beat me multiple times. (Once she beat me for missing the bus for school even though I was 8 and was feeding the dog.) Anytime I try to tell anyone they always don’t believe me because my mom just seems like the nicest lady ever. Yeah sure. She has forced me into many situations that I would never do like defending her to other family members and even making me publicly admit to actually loving her even though it’s clear I don’t. My father just tolerates her and to be honest I wouldn’t blame him if he wanted a divorce. She constantly posts religious things on Facebook and makes everyone feel bad for her. She is the reason I have a problem with church. (not an atheist but I just have a problem with fake Christians which she definitely is.)

Fast forward to when I was 18 and I ended up getting a girlfriend. She didn’t go to my school but she was amazing anyway. I soon find out that my mom was sneaking into my room and texting her pretending to be me while I was asleep. Soon after we broke up because of her parents and still stayed in contact but the think with my mother was a pure betrayal. Now my ex and I still talk but she has been abused all her life by her parents and I am trying to help her but I have to keep it quiet or my mother will find a way to ruin it. I want to ask my ex out again but she has said she isn’t ready to date any but is open to the idea in the future and actually seems excited.

When I was applying to colleges of course my mom had her idea of where she wanted me to go. She decided to personally oversee everything and made sure I went there. (Not gonna day where but it was out of state) she then forced me into a bunch of programs to help pay for it like rotc and other organizations that I didn’t want to do. I have full respect for the military but this rotc program was guys playing at war and not preparing you for anything and was just not a good program. My parents did offer to pay for a portion of my tuition but I soon found out that they were going to stop paying 2 years in. I found this out after my first semester and subsequently had to drop out because of the cost and the fact that I just didn’t want to be there.

Fast forward to now I am 19 and I live at home and it’s hell. I hate it here. My only escape is fishing with some friends and the shop I have outside. (I am a blacksmith and have built a shop and name for myself by myself with my own money and no help) I am constantly treated like a child and I am always yelled at and abused for something. I can’t go to the police because my mother will get out of it (she has done it before after I was seen with marks on my arm and back in school). I don’t know what to do.

Sorry this is probably going to be unorganized and also I’m on mobile (I guess the formatting is weird on mobile?) 


I am a really anxious person by nature. I find it hard to ever completely relax a Nd I always have tension in my body. I’ve always been pretty sensitive but sometimes it’s worse than other times. I react poorly in a lot of circumstances because if I’m stressed out or upset I tend to just cry and then while I’m crying I overthink everything. 

About 2 months ago one of my close friends ghosted me. I’ve been a lot more irritable and on edge since then and I think now I’m pushing my (20f) boyfriend (21m) away. I get frustrated easily when I can’t figure something out or if something isn’t going very well for me and I can tell it puts him on edge. I feel like I can’t try anything new because when I’m not immediately good at it I get frustrated and defensive. None of this is anyone’s fault but my own and I don’t know how to help it. I literally don’t know how to relax and I feel like I only know how to do things if they’re laid out for me or if it’s a very specific short term goal. 

I’ve wanted to try therapy for a while but I don’t know how I could afford it and also with everything being shut down I don’t even know how I would find a therapist if I could somehow afford it. I live with my boyfriend so we split rent but I’m paying for my school so I don’t have much to spare. In the past, I have been on several different anti anxiety medications but I never liked them because they always just made me so sleepy and they weren’t paired with any sort of therapy or exercise routine. 

I also have a hard time maintaining a routine like exercise or keeping a journal to help manage my feelings. I feel like those are the only things I know how to do that may potentially help me but I just can’t seem to stick with it for more than a week or two. 

What can I do? I feel like I’m emotionally immature and can’t handle my feelings and it’s causing me to put stress on the people who care about me.",22Apr2020,1

This all started around 6-7 years ago when I watched the movie The Truman Show. For those of you who haven’t seen it, SPOILER, his whole life is a tv show and he had no idea. I started to worry that my life was a tv show and that people were watching me. I’d feel paranoid when using the bathroom or doing something embarrassing like picking my nose. At some point I decided well maybe the people who are watching me are people that I admire or like. So I would try and always act cool and smart just in case someone was watching. At another point in time, when I was older, I decided that logically my life probably isn’t a tv show. Yet I still liked the idea of people watching me. So at some point I convinced myself that there were cameras or something in my eyes and that people could see everything I see. On top of this I would narrate what the people who are watching me are saying. I still do this now as an adult. Maybe I’ll be doing my homework and I’ll start thinking about someone watching me and then talking about how smart I am for doing the homework correctly.

I was wondering if you guys have any ideas of good graduation presents/surprises that I can do during quarantine. (We live together btw so it doesn't have to be remote)

Some notes about him:

* He loves nerdy things like games, anime, spongebob memes, etc

* He likes my baking/cooking, but it's pretty common for me to make stuff for him so I dont think it would be a huge surprise

* We go to different schools so I'm not close to his friends; I would feel a little weird coordinating stuff with his friends, though if I find a really great idea that requires coordination I guess I could push myself to do it lol

249,"My (F23) boyfriend (M24) and I have been together over two years. I'm finishing university in about a month and we've always planned to move to a larger city once I graduate. The second part of that plan was to begin a lease with his best friend and his girlfriend. They've been like brothers since elementary but best friend has been living in goal city since for quite a few years so I never got to know him very well. I was fully prepared to cope with living with these near strangers since my boyfriend spoke so highly of them. 

A few months ago, life took a terrible turn for the best friend when his girlfriend got into heavy drugs and became extremely abusive both physically and mentally. After a particularly bad night two months ago, best friend was driven by his friend to our home two hours away. It was decided that he would stay with us until the planned move and ex girlfriend was certainly not invited. He's been sleeping on the couch, his stuff occupying a corner of the living room, and relying on us for rides. No big deal on all of that because it is was it is and honestly, I'm just glad he was able to get a temporary job with the Covid-19 situation going on. 

Problems are arising because I don't think I like the best friend. For starters, he complains *constantly;* there's always something bothering him. Physical maladies, hates the government, our dog is spoiled (she's precious, just an attention whore), and the list goes on. So I'm left looking for redeeming qualities but while he's not a slob he certainly doesn't clean nor is he particularly easy to hang out with. What I'm getting at here is that he isn't the worst - just not appealing. The toxic icing on the situation is that we suspect he's still talking to his ex since he's constantly on his phone and we hear him talking outside. We've cleared stated that she isn't to be part of his future if he's to be part of ours but haven't confronted him about the suspicions. My boyfriend insists that this isn't his best friend as he will be once he recovers from the recent trauma. He may be right. I did like the guy pretty well during our handful of visits through the years.

We've been approved for an apartment, put down a holding fee, and have a move-in date but I'm left unsure if I want to take this step with the best friend. The day looms ever nearer but until the day of there is still time to change plans, but the thorn is that best friend doesn't really have anyone else. He has a small family and those who aren't awful (my boyfriend has told me the stories from their childhood) are elderly or sickly so they aren't in a position to take him in.  

Perhaps I'm being obtuse, unsympathetic, impatient, or simply a worrier. If worse comes to worse and he does go back to her or I become fed up and want to kick him out, then we can downsize to a smaller unit (it's $200 to transfer but doesn't break the lease). So the only thing I'm losing by following through is time spent irritated and the heavy inconvenience of an additional move. On the flip side, we're potentially gaining the knowledge that we pulled his best friend out of an otherwise hopeless situation and who would ever know if we could have all been fine living together. I also know for certain that my boyfriend would be extremely put out if I kicked his best friend to the curb with nothing but irritation and suspicions as my reasons. However... there is a lot of irritation and suspicions weighing my mind.

Now I am a huge motorbike fan. I think those large cruiser motorbikes look pretty badass. Anyways, one day as we went to the cafe halfway through our daily walk we passed by the coolest looking motorbike I had ever seen at the entrance of the bakery. The rider was still on the bike. He had entire leather biking attire. He also had his helmet on. His cruiser bike was silver with blue on the sides. The way it shined in the sun made it look extra cool, and I couldn't help but look. Then we went into the cafe as normal and got our drinks to go. We left afterwards and as we were walking out again I looked at the bike and saw that the rider was adjusting his gloves. He looked so awesome and it kinda made me want to eventually get a motorbike.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister and I continued to walk along the footpath of the busy road, with me being on the side closest to the road. We saw the same motorbike we had seen earlier pass us. Again I couldn't help but look because the way it shone in the sun made it look really nice. After it passed, I forgot about it. Then, a few minutes later, the motorbike passed us again. This time it was driving in the opposite direction and the biker was staring back at me. Anyways, since he was coming in the opposite direction he was soon out of sight and out of mind. Until he once again drove in the opposite direction to the previous time and came passed us, again staring in our direction. When this happened, however, I started to question it a bit and so when he drove again past us only to drive back in the opposite direction a couple more times I was a bit shaken. So my sister and I turned to walk in a quieter street that came off the main road. It was quite a windy street since it had lots of curves on the road. My sister and I kept walking and a few minutes later the motorbiker turned into the street and drove past us. This time, he literally came to a stop in the middle of the street and stared at me. I felt quite uncomfortable and looked to my sister who now appeared uncomfortable also and was staring at the ground. I don't know what possessed me to then stare back at this motorbike but I did. It was us staring at each other for like a whole minute, with him moving walking distance beside us on the road. Eventually, he drove off and we didn't see him again. After he left I tried talking to my sister about that experience. She just shrugged it off so I forgot all about it.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time I was a senior in high school and since I'm from a country that experiences winter in July, I had school a couple of days later. As I was walking home that day, I noticed a strange early 2000's green car (sorry I'm bad at car models but it was a Toyota) kept doing what that motorbike did. It would pass me from behind and then minutes later, it would come back and pass me in the opposite direction. It did this so many times I didn't even count. But what I remember is that there were two dudes in the car.

&amp;#x200B;

One had blonde hair and looked in his thirties. This guy was the driver. One had darker-whitish hair and maybe looked in his fifties. I turned into the small cul-de-sac that was where my home was when the green car came into the cal-de-sac and drove past me back out of the cal-de-sac. The blonde hair man was pointing at me as the car passed me. I found it strange since the car began driving past me shortly as I left my school premises. I went into my home and locked the door and after that experience, my sister and I did not go for our daily walk that day.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day as I was walking to school I saw the same green car parked on the street coming out of the cul-de-sac with the same blonde guy in it. He was wearing a hoodie. At that moment I thought that it just must be a neighbour and I walked past the car and looked at the guy in the driver's seat. He was staring so intently at me. I don't know how to describe that stare. His eyes looked so happy yet he wasn't smiling. He wasn't even blinking and had his head turned to stare at me. I just walked past. But the same thing happened again. The green car would drive past me from the back and then minutes later it would drive past in the opposite direction. Again, it did this a few more times. Then I reached school.

&amp;#x200B;

When the day ended the same thing with a car passing me and then turning around to pass me again a few minutes later happened. But this time it was in anew car. This car was identical to the green car (early 2000's model) but this time it was red. I thought I was losing my mind and just said to myself that there wouldn't be two different cars following me. It just didn't make sense because they were driving the same way as the motorbike and the green car and it was the same blonde guy driving it. When I went home I told my mum but she said I was just making it up and that no two cars would be following me.

&amp;#x200B;

I also told my sister but again she said it was just my mind playing tricks on me. I believed them because why would someone waste so much money on gas on this, and how much time did people have on their hands anyway? And besides, there would be no reason to this. So I ignored it and my sister and I continued our daily walks.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later I was walking back from school quite late because I had a tutorial. As I was walking back I turned into our cul-de-sac and a very expensive sports Audi that had matte black stripes drove past me and stopped in front of me and began to toot. It drove past out of the cal-de-sac. I found this weird as there were only four houses in that cal-de-sac and nobody I know owns an Audi. Anyways, it must have just been someone visiting them or it could have just been someone using the cul-de-sac to make a u-turn.

&amp;#x200B;

After the Audi incident, the same blue striped cruiser motorbike would drive past me as I went home from school and turn around to pass me again a few minutes later. Again, it would do this so many times.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw that motorbike do this on many occasions over a 4-5 month period. It was the same rider with leather attire and he wouldn't pick up anyone from school. He'd just slow down and stare at me as he drove past me and he would also rev his engine near me.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw the red and green cars a lot in the weeks that followed. They would always do the same thing of driving past me. A few times I would look at the car to see who was driving and it would always be the same blonde guy. But once logic kicked in, I stopped looking at the car because I didn't suspect them of anything.

&amp;#x200B;

But I remember seeing either the green car or red car whenever my sister would go for walks or whenever I'd walk to school. Eventually, the same cars would begin to park at a point of the cul-de-sac where my house (and specifically my room) was visible. I have a study desk in front of my window so I was able to see the same green car (or red car on alternative days) would be parked in front with someone sitting inside at the driver's seat, but not coming out. Again, I refused to believe that someone was doing this on purpose. This had to be some neighbour, etc because just why?

&amp;#x200B;

This happened for months. I just learned to ignore it every time I would see the cars and had in my mind it's just a neighbour. One day, long after my sister had left, I was out for a walk with a boy I had a massive crush on at the time. We went to the cafe, got a bite to eat, then after decided to head to the local small library to study. We went to the library and spent some time there. There weren't many people there at the time. We were sitting on a desk facing the door. My crush was reading a textbook and I was staring at the entrance when an angry-looking man stormed in. He didn't look at me but he was glaring at my crush in a scary way. His face was red and I kid you not his eyes looked like they were about to bulge out of his head. He wore dad jeans and had a faded t-shirt tucked in and he was wearing a baseball cap. Anyways he walked slightly past the desk we were sitting at and then stormed back out. He looked familiar. I remembered where I had seen him from: he was the second guy with dark-whitish hair in the green car I had seen a few months earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later my crush and I decided to go back to the library to study. We were sitting at the same desk and this time there were a bunch of newspapers that were piled on top of the desk. They had come from the newspaper stand literally a few feet away. Anyways, so my crush and I were discussing some exam questions when this dude with a beer gut, glasses and in his fifties came to our desk and leaned over my crush to grab the newspapers. He also looked so pissed and my crush looked so shocked because where I'm from, people are friendly, and would usually politely ask you to pass the newspapers. The guy then took the third seat at the desk and pulled it two feet away from us and sat down, facing us, to read the newspaper. Mind you this guy was also wearing an orange high-vis vest.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, my crush and I decided to take a break from studying and go for a walk. We walked all over town until we reached a lesser-known walking track. When we reached the entrance of the walking track we saw a black pick up truck parked with the same orange high-vis guy sitting in it. We just walked past it and once we spent some time walking to the end of the track as we left the exit of the walking track we saw the same black pickup truck with the same guy in the high-vis jacket in it. He was looking at us. By this time it had gotten late and we decided to head home.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time I had signed up for more after school tutorials. My crush and I would go to these together and sometimes we would be the last two students to leave school. Since we lived on opposite sides of the town we would say bye at the school gates. Anyways, after these tutorials, I would notice that there was a separate red car that would always cut me off walking or beep at me and drive off in an angry way. It was literal road rage but I wasn't in a car and I hadn't done anything wrong. Now, this is the bit that is spooky: the driver was always the same blonde guy. This time I told my parents and they got worried and began to pick me up from school most days and on the days when they couldn't pick me up, they told me to take a picture of the car next time I saw it. I didn't see it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you during this time I was still seeing that early 2000's model green car. I began to notice (from my view of the cal-de sac- in my room) that on most days on the week at 4 pm the car would park in front of our house and the two guys I had first seen in the green car would come out and make a walking loop around our cul-de-sac, not stop anywhere and head back into their car. Every time they would walk past the part of the cal-de-sac where you could see my room, the guy with the blonde hair would always stare in the direction of my window.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I thought I was losing my mind. I told everyone but because they would drive so many different cars and there were was more than one guy I would see I understood how outlandish my story seems. Heck, if someone had told me this I wouldn't have believed them and would have chalked it up simply to a hyperactive imagination.

&amp;#x200B;

One day my dad had gone out of town for a business trip. So it was just my mum and me at home for the night. That night I had fallen asleep with my lamp still on and (stupidly) my curtain was not closed all the way.

&amp;#x200B;

At around 4:00 a.m. I woke up to the sound of tapping coming from my window. I woke up but thought I was dreaming. I sat up and listened to it. Then I heard three knocks and stood like a dumb deer in headlights. I didn't believe what I had just heard. Then I heard three more knocks coming from outside of my window. I freaked out at this point and rushed out of my room to tell my mum. It took a while to get her out of bed and she said I was just dreaming. She checked, but there was nobody. But I know what I heard. I was wide awake and sitting up. Again, it must have just been my imagination.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I would see this blond guy everywhere and he would always be staring at me in the same intent way. He looked so happy yet he was not smiling and his eyes were unblinking. It was freaky.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I moved town for university and I didn't see anything else. I moved a two-hour drive away and thought that was the end of that and it was. While I was out of town there was nothing. Also, as soon as I came back home for my semester breaks there would be no activity. But as soon as I visited the local grocery, or went for one of my walks around town the activity with the green car would start again. One time I was catching up with a female friend from high school during one of the semester breaks and we decided to go for a walk to a local track. As we left the track we were cut off by that same black pickup truck and we were nearly run over. The truck sped off but I saw that the driver was that blonde dude.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, in 2019 there was no activity. Even when I worked during the holidays at one of the busiest places in town I didn't see anything.

&amp;#x200B;

But recently about 1 and a half months ago I came back home due to quarantine. The activities started up again with the green car and the blonde guy being everywhere and I even see him on my daily walks at the walking track.

&amp;#x200B;

I've told a lot of people but I have no proof and even if I did take pictures I end up looking like a crazy person because there is more than one car and you look like a paranoid person taking a photograph of them on. I don't know what to do. I feel likeI'm just being paranoid and imagining all of this. Why would someone do this? They wouldn't and so I'm constantly questioning if this is all in my head.

253,"Hey all you cool cats and kittens, 

I have a question I figured some of you might be able to offer some advice on. I live in a small town and there has been some very sketchy suspicious activity. I dont want to go into it too much just for safety, but as someone who has been exploited, I have some major concerns and I see red flags for sexual exploitation of youth. At the very least, there's teen drinking and driving. (Not verified, but given the situation I have no doubt) 

I called the police in the major city near us and they did take it seriously and let us know that activity is very suspicious and there arw tons of drinking and driving incidents in our are. They couldn't help but gave us the number for the Sherriff's department. We called and gave the same information, or tried to. The operator cut my partner off and was belittling towards him. I asked to see the phone and politely told her my background, my concerns regarding the older man and youth... and she was condescending towards me as well. I am really worried about these teens. Can anyone offer some advice?",22Apr2020,1
254,"This is kind of some first world problem bullshit and I honestly feel kind of dumb for getting sad over it, but long story short there’s this girl that I have developed pretty strong feelings for. We play video games together all the time and we just match each others energy and have almost frighteningly similar interests. The only issue is that I live in Washington and she lives in California. I don’t know if she reciprocates these feeling, but my gut says that she does. She works really hard on her college business classes and a long distance relationship would definitely get in the way of that plus she’s also dealing with mental health issues that she’s currently recovering from. I’ve decided to not act on my feelings because a long distance relationship is unpractical and I think would cause her more harm than good. Is there anyway that you can just make yourself stop having feelings for someone because the idea of not being able to be with someone that I really care about is dragging me a down a little bit and I don’t want to relapse into my old routine of smoking weed anytime a slight problem occurs in my life.",22Apr2020,1
255,"The past couple of weeks my dad has been extremely different. Granted we were never really close to begin with but we had regular conversations since we live in the same house. He is way closer with my older brother since they share the same passion for a sport, but my dad and I always had something to talk about. When he first started getting distant, it was only with me. So, I decided to start watching a tv show he loved, hoping that us watching it together would get us to form a closer relationship. This plan failed because he couldnt watch more than one episode with me without wanting to leave. Now, it's more than me that's hes become distant. For example, tonight at dinner he was extremely quiet. This is very abnormal since he likes to talk to us about his day while he eats. But today, he only said one word which was yes. The only reason he said yes was because I asked him if he was ok. 
It feels like nowadays, he only seems to talk to his family if hes criticizing something we do. After dinner today, after not even saying hello after he comes home from work, he then starts talking about how he hates the way I say things. (I think I said I hate some type of class). And then didnt talk to me for the rest of the night.
Hes constantly criticizing and yelling at my mom and I rarely ever hear him say anything positive on what shes done, only negative which hurts because my mom is such a kind person and tries her best. She truly walks on eggshells around him and is always saying something along the lines of ""do this before you father gets home, dont wanna upset him""
He also yells at my mom for the most small mistakes. Like if she leaves the dishwasher door open and he almost trips, he screams at her or calls her a name. It's really hard to hear that but whenever I try to bring this up to my mom, she tells me shes had a conversation with him and that hes trying his best. I feel that she mostly just makes excuses for him rather than let him take responsibility. 
I constantly feel as though hes getting more distant and weird and I sometimes stay up at night and cry, thinking of all the things hes said to me that day. Most of the days, all it is, is criticisms. 
I'm wondering if theres anything I can do to maybe help him get back on track or at least get back to his normal self. I dont know his mental health history but maybe this difference in behaviour has something to do with that? Thanks for reading xo",22Apr2020,1

257,"16f

My best friend's dad who has been abusing her whole life disowned her a while ago. It just hit her that he actually disowned her and she's not taking it well. He was heavily physically and mentally abusive her whole life, and after she came out as gay he was even more mentally abusive (he couldn't physically do anything because she and her mom had moved out by then). It was getting to the point where she was scared he was genuinely going to try and arrange a marriage for her, and I honestly believed he would have. And not gonna lie I'm almost certain he's involved in some drug businesses, just based off sketchy stories she's told me.

I don't know how to comfort her because I know in the long term it will be good for but I will sound like an asshole if I say that to her. The only sad thing is he just had a baby with his new partner and I know she wants to be involved in the baby's life.

The weird thing is, I have a great body (abs, toned, broad shoulders, etc) and I get a decent amount of attention from great looking girls. I just still think of my body as it was back then. When I look in a mirror at myself I do realize my attractiveness for that moment, but when I’m not, my view goes right back to seeing myself as unattractive in my head.

265,"Hey guys, I come here to ask for your advice.

Me (M 18) have always been someone you can rely on, or at least I like to think so. Usually I have people come to me and open up about how they feel about something and ask for advice or maybe to just let it out, I really respect people's privacy and if they entrust something important to me then I'll keep it shut, it's not like I could do something with it anyways even if I tried to since I would have no one to tell since I'm more of a side character rather than someone  popular.

Now the issue I have is, I feel like being a good listener has hurt more than anything else but I don't mind since at the end of the day I'm helping someone let some weight off, it's just I wish I could let that weight off too if you know what I mean.

What made me realize this was my friend, who I've had a crush on for almost to years and haven't told her how I felt until about a month ago. Point is when I told her she had revealed to me a week before that she was doing long distance with a guy thousands of Miles away that she met online, this of course had me feeling devastated because damn, it kinda sucks you know? Anyways they broke up and my dumbass thought it be fine to let it out a week after... She was still into him and I fell back into a spiral of sadness, but that's pretty normal and all, what I find weird is how a couple of days later she asks me if I still like her because she only saw me as a friend, to which I replied ""I cannot stop liking you from one day to the other, I understand you see me as a friend and all but for the first time I let my feelings out, I'm trying to stop liking you but it's not as simple as that"", she understands and all and then brings up the guy and starts telling me about how they're back and how everything is better than before, and I just sat through it and heard through it all while trying to show my lack of interest or waiting for her to realize that it wasn't nice what she was doing. I spoke with my friend about it since I was pretty confused about what went on during that conversation he agreed that it wasn't polite of her to have that conversation with me, but I feel like she had no one else to tell.

Fast forward to today and she tells me that they broke up for good and there is no way of them coming back. Tonight she asked me if she could call me to tell me about this prank she did I won't go into detail but it's sort of nsfw so she didn't want to type it, in the end she ended up talking more about him than  the prank itself while I was there listening, of course I didn't say things like ""You are truly something"" to see if she would realise what she was saying, in the end she didn't... I feel like she acts like nothing happened on purpose, but I'm not sure, and well... it hurts, having the person you like tell you about how they miss someone or telling you about the relationship they had with their special other hurts.

267,"So I'm starting to think I'm the most introverted person on the entire planet. I'll talk to people when I see them in person but I **hate** online communication. I just don't want to have to speak to anyone on the phone ever.

Like, *ever*.

Recently, though, there's a girl who has suddenly decided that we're going to be best friends. She's latched on to me and is messaging me every other day. She recently upgraded to calling and so we talked for hours because I couldn't figure out how to politely end the conversation and she couldn't take any of the hints that I wanted to stop the conversation. I literally said things like ""I'm going to have to get back to studying now so I need to leave,"" and she would say things like, ""oh just one more thing!"" and I never felt comfortable just ending the call because she straight up told me she was depressed and honestly feeling hopeless about life. Like, look I'm not a monster I'm just an introvert.

It's only been a few days though and she's already contacted me asking when we can talk on the phone again.

Again? Again?? I can't do this. I don't really know this girl (she's not in my class; she knows me because I'm in a leadership position of a school club so she gets emails from me about club-related things every once in a while), and I just don't have hours to spend talking to her. Furthermore, I just don't want to.

I haven't had an hour-long phone conversation since elementary school. I hate them. I want to nip this in the bud before she starts thinking we're close or something (might be too late for that), but I don't know how to politely respond to her and be like hey actually we're never going to do this again.

Because I don't even want to do this once in a while with her. I would not at all be disappointed if she never spoke to me again in my entire life. Not because she's a terrible person. Maybe I'm the terrible person--I just don't care about her at all.

269,"School ends in a month, I keep putting off leaving (I said I was going to leave a month ago but decided to stay to the end of finals week). The dorms are going to kick me out at that point and I will have to find a place/pay rent. I'm dating someone here and we've just been hanging out and it's been really nice. I have money for ~4 months easily (so until October), probably more (I'm still getting paid for my job).

I've never had a great relationship with my parents. My dad was a workaholic (but nice when he was around), and my parents argue a lot. My Mom and I fought constantly but a lot of it was her taking her feelings out on me - she would scream for hours, bitch slap me awake in the morning when she was mad, follow me under the bed when I hid as a kid. But on the other hand, 95% of time she was encouraging, affectionate, and generous - if you met her during those times you would think she was the perfect mom. Things got way worse as I became a teenager, but around the time I was going to move out she started being nice because she realized I would never visit otherwise. Since then we've been fine around each other, we just never talk about bad things in the past. I still have a lot of resentment for her but I'm not really scared of her, and I do want to know my parents and spend time with them as an adult. Their relationship seems to have gotten better too.

If I go home, it's a long drive + I have to quarantine alone in a friend's apartment for a couple weeks. My parents are both home because of the quarantine but my Mom still works. I guess I'm just worried that living with them for a long time will make us revert to the old family dynamic - except even worse this time because my temperamental father won't be able escape the house. My mom is very controlling even when she tries not to be and I think it will cause the same rebellious teen/strict parent dynamic we used to have, which is not the version of myself I want. Basically, it seems like a tenuous way to spend what could be up to 2 years in close quarters. She also didn't seem very pleased that I'm coming home.

If this does last for 2 years, I probably won't be able to work much (I expect ~10 hours/week at my current job next fall). All my friends have left except my boyfriend. School is still on for next semester but I'm guessing it will be online. There's also the possibility I'll break up with bf (not planning on it, but you know). Any thoughts on this?

270,"Hi! I play golf because of school. I met this guy there from another school and stupidly gave him my number when he asked. He turned out to be... odd, to say the least.

I think he very clearly has a crush on me. He constantly talks about his past crushes and seemed panicked when I said I had a crush on a girl. I said I was bi- he seemed to relax. He also once asked me if I had a crush on him which he though because “I always replied to his texts quickly”. Since then I’ve always been sure to wait at least ten minutes to reply, which I agree is a bit rude, but I really don’t want to have a conversation with him.

One thing that really gets on my nerves is the references. He is a dedicated musical nerd (and yet doesn’t actually know that much about Hamilton). He makes obscure references at random and randomly texts song lyrics. He sent me this one terrifying message about death and love and following someone (I don’t know the exact quote, but if asked I will try to find it) and I genuinely had to look up the first sentence on google to find out what the heck was going on and should I call the cops.

I have replied with very short answers: “yes”, “no”, “k”, “awesome possum”. I have always provided excuses for not calling him. He’s getting mad, and I’m genuinely a little scared.

271,"I've been going through a lot of stuff mentally for a while and have been thinking sincerely about changing my name. There's a few reasons I want to do this: it would give me an opportunity to reinvent myself, in a sense, and help me distance myself from the family I want to get away from, and I dislike my given name to the point where I can't even say it in my head. The biggest reason, though, is that I've had a lot of conflicts about my gender identity and would prefer a neutral or ambiguous name.
The name I like the most is Boethiah, but it comes from a Skyrim character. They're one of my favorite characters and are also genderless, which is why I find it to be ideal. If worse comes to worst, I could easily shorten it to Boe, but I'm still very anxious about the commitment.

I tell her what he does but it's ultimately her choice if she wants to be his friend. This is basically where this begins.

Recently, i told another friend who could be an impartial overseer who could judge whether I was right or wrong. He wanted to see what Bob had to say (fake name for obvious reasons.) My friend told me what Bob said and told me not to tell anyone. I read through the screenshots he sent. I was horrified that he was lying about my girlfriend in the texts. It wasn't anything super bad but he was lying to gain an advantage over me. He said she dumped me cause i was a jerk and now admits she likes him. I was scared that she actually said this and if it was a lie, she deserved to know what he said about her. I asked her and she was pissed at Bob for lying about her. She unfriended him and he immediately went to my friend, seething about telling someone what he said while also trying to defend himself with my girlfriend, while also yelling at me.

Because of this he has started turning into a whole different person in a matter of a month. He has started adopting RADICAL views. He has turned into a raging white supremacist, racist, sexist. Lately he has been playing games instead of doing online school. My parents are essential workers and still work full time. They tell him to sleep and wake up and try to parent as best they can but he doesn’t listen and has started threatening us, making fun of us, and swearing at us. Tonight, he stayed up until midnight to play video games. I told him to sleep nicely. He then starts telling me that he promises if I don’t kill myself he will kill my whole family or himself. Then proceeds to call me a fucking bitch, a fat whore who needs to die, and about every other name you can think of. My mom who has to wake up in a few hours for work hears this and wakes up. He starts telling her that he will kill us all or himself. My mom then comes to me and says she can’t do it anymore and is thinking of killing herself. My dad comes home after working 15 hours on his feet and says he is going to kill himself. My boyfriend is having a tough time and is saying he’s going to kill himself.

280,"Hi friends,

My boyfriend of six months and I recently broke up after what I believe to be some dishonest activity around dating apps (I will spare you of the minutia but basically, he had a Hinge profile that appeared to be active from what I could see, though he vehemently denies this).

I was eventually able to look at his email inbox and found the attached automated email from January. I am wondering if anyone has received this email before and if you know it comes from either a) pausing your Hinge account or b) an extended period of inactivity (for example, not logging into the app for weeks/months). 


The reason I ask is because if this email means the app was paused, my boyfriend likely did lie to me. This email was sent to him about three months after we agreed to delete our dating apps. If it is a reflection of inactivity (boyfriend claims not to have realized his Hinge profile is up) his story is more plausible.

283," Sorry for the long post; I posted in another subReddit, but this one will probably get more views. All of these apartments are the same configuration in terms of bed/ bath #, so that's not an issue. I'm looking at options in a specific area due to proximity to a workplace and am trying to decide what would be more worth it. I have leaned more towards the furnished options.

Unfurnished options are cheaper mostly but have no utilities, laundry (except for hook-ups, which means I have to bring my own machine), and furniture, so furnished is more convenient.

Of the furnished options, I am trying to decide what factors are most important:

Option A: pros- somewhat lower cost than option B, has an actual parking lot, has a pool, no extra fee for my kind of pet, good reviews online (but they had a change in ownership, so I don't know if all of the reviews are relevant to now), has a table and chair so I can do work, larger unit than option B (but smaller than all unfurnished options I've heard of), says size # online, can do in person tours

cons- farther away from the workplace and shopping centers, shared laundry facility where you have to pay in coins, furnishing looks a bit old-fashioned and dark, no floor plan online and no pictures of specific unit (I would likely rely on an in person tour to see a better model of this place)

Option B: pros- very close to the workplace and shopping centers, the person I contacted at the office said several people from that workplace are living there (this makes them a little more trustworthy), joint washer-dryer in unit, has floor plan online, more modern style (although I don't necessarily like it either honestly, but I guess that's what I get for relying on already furnished options)

cons- more expensive than option A, seems to only have street parking, no pool, extra fee for all pets, smallest unit I've heard of and looks crowded in the unit, uncertain if unit will include table and chair as opposed to coffee table, mixed reviews but nothing out-rightly bad except for possible theft from maintenance (they also came under new management recently, so I don't know if that review was applicable to now), only pictures available and not necessarily of the unit I will get (mostly because of social distancing right now), does not say size # online for specific unit (I had to ask)

Hello. I (18M) really fucked things up with my girlfriend. Over quarantine we were doing fine the first week or so but then things started getting rough. We were talking discussing things and she said that she wanted me to share my feelings more and i said ok i will try to start to do that. I have been keeping a note on my phone as a journal entry where i write things down when they upset me (i’m not good at expressing my emotions) and so after she went to bed I sent the note. That was my first huge mistake. she wakes up like an hour before me so when she woke up she read it. There were a lot of things i didn’t mean in there and me over reacting. To say the note made her feel bad is an understatement. I have no idea why i sent it. I was anxious that night and sent it after she went to bed not thinking about the consequences. So she took a few days to think about stuff and when she talked to me again she was saying how it felt like i hated her because i must hate her to send her all the things she’s done wrong for the last 2-3 months. i felt awful and i tried explaining what i actually felt and what i meant. this seemed to help a little bit. a few days later  we seemed to be sort of ok again. Then my dumb ass went for a drive during the quarantine to meet a friend to smoke (4/20, we stayed apart). before i left i asked her if this was a dumb idea and she said “i don’t care” so i took that as she honestly didn’t care so went and then later that night i realized that in fact, she cared. Her birthday is coming up in early may and because of covid i was thinking that our parents wouldn’t let us see each other. But then that night she got very upset with me for meeting up with him because she didn’t want to see me if i’m seeing other people during the quarantine. My brain didn’t realize that if i went that i wouldn’t be able to see her so she said it felt like i cared more about a rip of a dab pen then her 18th birthday. this is obviously not true. This was the final straw and she was saying how she is of tired of being sad everynight and crying her self to sleep. I just don’t know what to do. I tried to apologize but she says that apologizing doesn’t seem sincere because i say it all the time about little things. so i don’t know how to show her how fucking sorry i am. She also said that i have said things that have contributed to her insecurities. But these things i say i’m just trying to help but apparently it doesn’t come off like that. I am really scared i’m going to lose her. please help i really need it. this is kinda a short version of the story so if u want clarification just lmk but please please help 😞",22Apr2020,1

I've talked to my parents telling them that I want to go to SCAD and I've been dreaming about going since around sophomore year.

Personally to me, I want to go to SCAD, in my mind its the place to go for college and even if I were to go to community college I would constantly be thinking, I could be at SCAD right now. I know that the best financial option would be to go to community college for 2 years and then transfer over, but I also want that college experience of staying on campus all 4 years somewhere else instead of my home town. When I told my parents that I had heard back from both and that my financial numbers were about the same, they said they're really hoping that I go with a plan: c type thing and go to community college so it's cheaper for me. I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall with them because no matter what I say they always say to apply for scholarships \*which in reality pay for like 5 dollars worth of tuition because its all chance based\* and that they hope I choose something in my current state, but at the same time want me to follow my dreams and do what I want to do.

Hi guys I feel like I’m always on reddit asking for advice but I mean sometimes people you don’t know give you the best advice .

So basically I need some advice I don’t know what’s going on. 

I recently about maybe three or four months ago got out off an extremely toxic relationship with this guy. I blocked him on everything and I make sure not to see him in public but we are in a large group chat with 1000 other people in it. And like every time I see him talk I feel extremely disgusted with myself . Everything starts flooding back. Like I feel ashamed and embarrassed and these feelings are literally to the point where I feel as though I want to die because I can’t live with myself after knowing that I was willingly with him for as long as I was and that I spent money and bought him gifts and what not. 

He was emotionally  and verbally abusive . He would make jokes about rape and tell me how it was constantly my fault for men raping me. When we argued he would tell me that all his friends wanted him to dump me but if they were him they would have been dumped me. He would yell at me in public and tell me his sexscaped with other women. When I would ask him to stop or any time I tried to set what I felt like were reasonable boundaries he would call me childish and tell me I needed to grow up and stop acting so immature.  He would trash me in his group chats and tell people how he didn’t want me to get the impression he was into to me but message me about how he was super lucky to have someone with me. He also always trashed me friends and was extremely negative whenever he had to do something with me . 

He also was physically abusive he choked me punched and kicked me and tried to break my wrist . 

I don’t know how to get rid of these feelings they’re eating me alive. I talked to my therapist about them but they still won’t go away also my medicine isn’t helping I just don’t know why I keep flashing back to this relationship so much. Can someone give me some advice on what to do here cause I feel like I can’t take it anymore. I’m not exaggerating when I say I cried everyday I was with him  . I feel like this is all my fault because I let it happen .... and I don’t know how to get rid of these feelings ?",22Apr2020,1

302,"Getting to the point, I'll say this I'm not easily scared, I'm anxious but that's never necessarily translated to a fear. I however hold two fears that are so irrational and powerful that now being almost 30 I still cannot conquer. The first is stinging/biting insects (spiders, wasps and the like) this doesn't really effect my day to day or anything. The other is fire alarms/CO alarms (generally high pitched loud sounds). 

I'm posting this because the second one is always there in my mind. Constantly.  For instance right now I'm sitting in my apartment very aware that I am up far past when I should have gone to sleep or at least tried winding down. But the batteries have died on the alarm in my room and no matter how loud my headphones are, and what j tell myself I don't have the guts to get up on a chair and take it down. I get there and try to get on the chair and my body freezes, and I feel my chest tightening up and the only option is to sit there staring at this noisy piece of plastic or walk away.

303,"I don’t know who to talk to, or if I can talk to anyone about this, posting semi-anonymously is the easiest way for me to find advice. This will most likely lengthy so I’ll do my best to be straightforward and to the point.

To preface everything, I’m 17, a high school student, and these past 6 months have been what seems like a rollercoaster designed to break me. I have a lot of mental issues, much of it stemming from a mutation in the methylation cycle in my cells, (specifically the MTHFR gene), and because I wasn’t treated for the issue as a child, recent stress has caused all of the problems to balloon. I’ve been diagnosed with extreme anxiety, that gives me intense physical pain when I’m in situations I feel that I am unable to control, and I am unable to take medication for it. This is because I also have a massive bacterial infection in my digestive system (called Sibo) that has coated the walls of my small intestine and almost entirely prevented me from digesting food, medicine, water, etc, to the point where I’ve begun to lose weight despite eating constantly. It causes me intense pain when I eat and I struggle to keep an appetite. I’ve got symptoms of hypoglycemia and anemia as a result, which has further pushed my body into low levels of functionality. And to top it all off, my brain has been receiving less and less of the things it needs, because of all of these issues, resulting in a serious lapse in my memory and cognition. These have all been confirmed and outlined by my doctors, they’ve suggested more but they were not certain about them so I won’t be suggesting them in case it’s incorrect or false information. 

To address the roller coaster. In October, my mental health took a steep decline and against a lot of my wishes I entered a relationship with a girl I liked a little. It lasted three weeks, and ended when I upset her accidentally when I was trying to prove (mostly to myself) that I cared about her, resulting in one of the most horrendous break-ups I’ve ever experienced, I lost a lot of friends and my general public appearance dropped off the deep end because she told everyone I was a piece of shit and a horrible guy. The few who stayed have become my close and more trusted friends. This accentuated my anxiety, and all of my fears and I began having nightmares and falling behind in school due to my own fears of being in the building and around people I no longer thought I knew. This started to make me sick and I was always in pain, to the point where I had to hold my mouth shut to keep from throwing up.

In November I almost hung myself, the sad pathetic last ditch effort to escape what I thought was a permanently downhill slope. Medication I was prescribed had a horribly adverse reaction with my body (due to Sibo, though I didn’t know at the time) and it hyper accentuated my mental state into the fast track of a mental degradation that dropped me in the hospital. Afterwards, I began to really open up with my therapist, and thought I was heading somewhere positive.

December chugged by, my fears of failing were still building with my school work falling off of the “expectations”. I like to think I’m a decently bright guy, I get A’s in classes when I put some effort in, and while my parents are unbelievably supportive, in every way, and they’ve had no expectations of me, I still feel like I have something to live up to, something to strive for, cause I’ve been given not only a second chance, but resources to be a better, more successful man. My nightmares got worse, and I started to dream up a character in my head to help store all of my horrible thoughts and the intense pain that I’m constantly in. This character is frightening to me now, he’s still in my head, and I’m 100% certain that while I don’t have schizophrenia or DID the idea of it has a lot of power in my head. 

January started to look up. I met a girl, quite impossibly, and I really liked her, quite a bit more than anyone I’d met before. My head was unsteady though, and I did not want to rush into anything, so we mostly just talked relatively unattached. My brain is still in turmoil though, the character/storage device in my head, let’s call it M, is becoming a prevalent part of my attempts to repair myself, overwhelmingly so, and so I custom order a mask designed after the mask M wears so I can try to better release my fears into an external object because keeping it in me is exhausting. The mask comes, it helps offload M, but not the emotions and the pain. A side note here, I realize that the whole M situation sounds weird and odd and it really is, I don’t know how to explain fully why it’s important to me, it involves a problem I face but it’s difficult to talk about to people in a way that makes sense. 

February hits, the best month in all of this. My terror is pushed to the back, the terrible pain is minimal, I’m starting to lose weight but it isn’t too terrible, I’m able to keep it around 135 lbs (at 6’1”) which isn’t healthy but I couldn’t raise it anymore. The girl and I are really hitting it off and it feels good to find someone who likes me for me. I go to the doctors and they teach me about my methylation problem, my Sibo, and the fact that I’ve got some of the worst anxiety they’ve ever seen, go fucking figure. I’m getting my positive outlook back, and my optimism is growing. 

March arrives. I start the treatment for Sibo, it’s twice as painful as the actual infection and involves crazy shit like taking concentrated hydrochloric acid pills. My state’s quarantine starts as coronavirus hits the US. Suddenly new online schooling starts, but I can barely get out of bed, I’m struggling with the feeling of my stomach and intestines tearing themselves apart, and suddenly my worries about failure are coming back. Difficulties between the girl and I start to show as I devolve into my stress and fear and she also begins to struggle with her own personal issues. Everything I’ve been working towards in the past few months has started to unravel.

April. Now. Girl and I have broken up as of two days ago. I feel devastated but I know that right now a relationship isn’t something I can handle. I’m behind 3-4 weeks in schoolwork now, I’ve had excruciating pain unlike anything I’ve felt before in these weeks and getting up is a chore. I’m scared. 

There’s so much build up, so much disappointment, pain, fear, confusion, I can feel it in my chest and my head, it’s a horrible pressure. I can feel myself on the edge of something terrible, like a calm before a storm. I don’t know how to release anything, I haven’t been able to cry, I haven’t been able to scream, my emotions feel stunted, I’m begging for anyone to offer a suggestion for my next steps. I’m scared my head will return to the place it went in November, except now there’s so much more fear and pressure that I don’t know if I’d be able to stop myself. It’s painful and difficult to talk to people. I don’t really have many people to talk to. My therapist has only done so much. 
Does anyone have advice I can lean on? Encouragement? Questions? Anything I can do to try and alleviate this terrifying build-up 

TL;DR: I’m very sick. In pain constantly. Lots of mental problems. Lots of disappointment and fear. Currently teetering on the edge of sanity. I’ve been in this feeling before but this one is much much scarier. I’m hoping someone could offer insight",22Apr2020,1
304,"There was an online class in which the activity was show-and-tell your favourite things that represent yourself.

I love reading, especially since the book is known to be really inspiring and the author is well-known for his works too. The thing is, when my friend who I had the dispute with commented on it, it felt like he took the fun and good emotions out of it.

305,"Hello, redditors.  So tonight, I’ve done something my friends would never forgive me with.  We were all in this Minecraft realm, a server where you can connect with other players in the game known as Minecraft.  We played it in for a few weeks.  We defeated the wither, but I lost most of my stuff from it, so now I felt completely useless in the realm.  We were supposed to fight the ender dragon tomorrow so everyone is gonna be stacked up on OP items.  Being sort of an asshole, I basically destroyed most of everyone’s stuff and their houses.  I got kicked off the group chat for it of course.  One of my good friends was super upset with me when he heard what happened.  He ranted about how much of an asshole I was.  One of my other good friends told me that they were making me some stuff to help me get caught up and that it would’ve been a surprise.  Of course, if I had known this, I wouldn’t have done it.  But the lack of communication and the gifts kept secret from me made it all worthless when I committed such a crime in a gaming community.  Many of my friends prior to this were talking about transforming the realm into an anarchy server, like 2b2t.  I had no other goals to complete within the realm, other than to plan my goals to completely anger my friends over a game.  Previously, others have always messed with my other friend’s stuff, like stealing or griefing.  He always got mad when they did it, but I never took part in it.  But they always said that it was only a game, you had to have fun, and to not overreact over a game.  Well, I tested their reactions and basically did what I did.  Btw, they are friends from school.  Will my friendships with them last?  I hope so, they’ve been good to me and I’ve been good to them (until now I guess).  Was I wrong in the end?",22Apr2020,1

My older brother and I were the only two at the time so we got to name them. I named my dog Mater (because I loved Cars) and my brother named his dog Trinity (he thought the name was neat).

Recently, my younger brother noticed a big bump in Mater’s mouth. So we went to the vet to get it checked out and they found a tumor. Unsure whether or not the tumor was cancerous, they took a sample of his pee. The test suggested that it was likely cancerous, but there’s still a chance it could be benign. They still need to take X-rays to see if the tumor is attached to his bones; this would change whether or not Mater would be in pain. Of course, surgery is needed but if the tumor is malignant he would need cancer medication, which we absolutely cannot afford.

The university I want to go to (University of Washington) declined me from their computer science program, which would be fine. But now I not only DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WANT TO GO INTO, but also can't figure out if I should even go to this school.

319,"Hi all, so my brother and sister have some trouble with reading and writing, both aren’t fond of reading or writing. My younger sister has very illegible handwriting and actively avoids anything reading related because she hates reading. Because of that, she is behind her class in both reading and writing, it’s not that she can’t read or write, she can but she just refuses to improve her skill in reading and writing. She’s a good kid it’s just that she so used to my grandparent’s letting her get what she wants (which is not going to school when she feels like it which is quite often so she missed out on so many school days) but I know she’s much better than this. 

As for my older brother, he’s gonna go off to college soon and he isn’t prepared for the essays nor entrance exam. He’s been procrastinating a lot and his time his gonna come soon, and I’ve been trying very hard to get him to read just a few of the books I had, he keeps telling me he’ll read and finish the book I lent him tomorrow, but as far as I know he hasn’t even touched it or read the first page. I’m very worried for him since my parents (especially my dad) had always been very hard on him with grades, there isn’t a memory I had with my dad where he didn’t bring up how worthless poor and homeless people were and then going on and saying if we even got just 1 failed quiz “You’re gonna end up in the streets with all those other squatters, your children will have nothing to eat, no one will offer you a job and you will be forced to beg for money, eventually you’ll just die in the streets because you refused to get good grades” or something along those lines. If he doesn’t get into college, I’m scared on what my parents would do to him.

My family has a high expectation from me. They put me on a pedestal and praise me for every time my siblings fuck up which makes me feel sad at how they treat my siblings. It’s because reading and writing was easy for me to learn (in fact I don’t even remember learning how to read or write, I just remembering doing it and realising I was doing it), I was always reading and writing. They always tell my siblings to be like me, because they never had to teach/tutor me yet I get high grades in all my subjects. It feels as though they don’t believe in my siblings enough, they get mad when my siblings for not being me, it’s to the point sometimes my brother and sister always tell me that I’m the smart one and wishes they could be just like me, It feels like they’ve lost their confidence in themselves. 

I’m not even as smart as my family puts me to be, I don’t even think I deserve the praise they’re giving me. But I want to help get my sibling’s confidence up and help them get better in reading and writing. Where do I start with both of them?",22Apr2020,1

I still love being surrounded by people—in cafes or parks, I live in a big city—and am always enticed by opportunities to meet a stranger and talk, but am perfectly happy to keep in my own bubble when those opportunities don’t pop up. I’m certainly introverted in that I don’t usually have the stamina for times where I’m constantly talking and doing things with people for more than a week or so, sometimes only a day, but I still love those times when they happen.

What I struggle with is maintaining caring relationships with people who are far from me—which, as a millennial with a bunch of other millennial friends scattered across the country—is most of my friends. My default is to just drop off a cliff and only seldom ever be the one who reaches out. And I’m content to. My sentiment is that I tend to just do what I feel like doing day to day, as much as I can at least, and it happens that I very seldom just feel like seeing what’s up with a friend I haven’t spoken with in a while. 

I tend to gravitate around just maintaining peace and balance in my life—little routines and rituals that feel good, eating well and treating my body nicely. And I have a fairly demanding (remote, these days) day job and a tech startup I operate outside that, so there’s plenty to keep my head occupied.

I am a high school senior in California who is looking to go to college. The problem is that I did not get into the colleges I wanted to go to. Sure I got into a few but I know I will not be happy over there. Anyways, I am not planning on attending a Community College which will make transferring to a public 4-year, such as Berkeley, UCLA, or even USC, easier compared to transferring from a state colleges in California that I got into.

Now...my parents are going through the divorce process and I doubt that they will set aside their differences and come together. My mother is moving to Wisconsin because she cannot afford living here and I don't want to live with my father because I just do not like his living style.

If I move to Wisconsin, my chances of transferring to a top college in California will pretty much be 0. If I stay in California and attend a community college here, I'll have a much higher chance than when I applied as a senior in high school. This is because top colleges here in California make California community college students their priority and cater to them first. I will not have a place to live in California because the community colleges to not have dorms. 

What makes my situation worse is that I have to make my decision by May 1st and, due to the coronavirus, I cannot fully decide where I will go because my Mother has to first go to Wisconsin sometime in July (because that is when the court is allowing her to finalize her divorce and move). She can't go because of this quarantine.

Also, the reason why I do not want to live with my dad here is because I have a bad relationship with only his family ,not him; his family has humiliated my Mother time and time again and my mummy stood by me all this time. She's been waiting to move and I cannot hold her back any longer.

335,"Hello Reddit,

I have  a question!

Would YOU move in with your good friend, if one of their friends was also going to live there, and you don't vibe with them too well? *(and they also have a crush on you?)*

I made it clear that I just wanted to be friends, but that person has still shown some INDIRECT signs of interest in me (no pestering/no harassment or anything!)

I just wouldn't want anything to be weird, moving in with someone who may have had feelings for me that are unreciprocated. However, I don't want this to stop me from moving in with my good friend.

Also, if it matters: *my* friend knows about everything--he's the one who told me about his friend's crush on me. He thinks all is well, and doesn't know about the way I'm feeling ATM. Just wanted to ask on here; since I don't want to offend my friend, or his friend. I know I should probably be direct though. Communication is key, right? ahhhhhh",22Apr2020,1
336,"I recently got into a relationship,  like around 2 weeks ago with my ex. I usually stay to myself, girls often come up to me and always offer relationships and I always decline because I have trust issues. But this all changed when I met her, in the beginning I was suspicious about her first but she shared her stories saying that she feels the same as me since she’s been played in the past. We ended up bonding and sharing lots of close information to her and I ended up get attached even though I never really do. She always said she loved me and would never do what my past relationships did. So we ended up dating, I recently went to her place literally three days ago, and everything was fine; in fact she seemed more obsessed with me. I finally felt happy for once in my life. However in the last 3 days after I went I’ve left from her place, she has become less distant with me. So today I asked her what up and why has she been talking to me less, and she what she told me was that morning she just suddenly stopped liking me. I asked how is this happened and she said she didn’t know and wanted to break up. The worst part of this is that I gave her my virginity 2 weeks prior, I’ve never felt more hurt and deceived in my life and don’t know what to do anymore.",22Apr2020,1

He can’t remember his email, his password for his iCloud, nothing, he is a straight stoned out idiot who barely remembers what month it is.

340,"First thing I’ll say is that my rent doubled because a roommate moved out. I was sleeping in the dining room of our 2 bedroom apartment and paid less than the other two roommates, $400 a month. One of the roommates is unexpectedly moving out, so my rent has gone up to $800 and I finally get my own bedroom and bathroom. I normally make 9.50 and hour with 36-40 hours in a week. Not a whole lot, but that $500-600 twice a week kept me going with money for rent, food, and fun, and still would, if it weren’t for this mess. 

I work at a pet store. We’re still open, but more than half our staff have been furloughed. Everyone else had massive hour cuts. I worked 2 days a week for majority of the virus craze, as apposed to the 4 9 1/2 (with lunch break) hour shifts I was used to. With rent suddenly sky rocketing, I can not afford it. Even if I use my stimulus check, it’ll only last a month an a half. This week, my shifts got cut even worse. I get 1 normal 9 1/2 hour shift and one 4 1/2 hour shift now. 

I applied for unemployment but just got word back that I didn’t make enough to qualify. I’ve been working here since 9/11 of last year, not terribly long but still over 7 months, first two were part time, the rest were full time every single week. I don’t know what to do right now. I’m 21 and have Aspergers, not sure if that’s relevant but this whole thing is confusing. I can’t find a straight answer on anything and I’m lost. I don’t know what to do from here.",22Apr2020,1
341,"Hey guy, posting this question as I'm in a bit of a dilemma. 

I had a final round interview today for a position I've been after, and this interview was conducted by 3 representatives of the organisation. I'll name them A, B and C.

A: Director of Business development, whose department I'm applying for  
B: Director of Marketing, will work closely with their team  
C: Business dev manager

So the interview went alright and I've shot A a thank you email post-interview, as I have got his email. Now, in the thank you email, I requested to extend my thanks to B and C as I do not have their contact details. 

Do you think my one email to A would suffice, or should I connect with B and C via email and send them a message of thanks there?

343,"I really need to buy a house soon. I live in a generally low income area with limited options for renting. Decent homes are around 75k-100k. I found a house I really like for 90k and they are willing to take an FHA loan. I could probably put down around 3k right now, maybe 4k. I know that waiting until I have way more money saved with a much better credit score would be ideal, but it’s unrealistic given my current situation. I’m hoping to buy a home within the next 3-6 months, if not much sooner. If I pay off some debts I could probably get my credit score to about 620 or so, but then I’ll have less money up front for a down payment. There’s always the slight possibility that I could borrow some money from a family member for the down payment, but it would be no more than 3k if I’m lucky. 

Basically I’m wondering yalls thoughts. Is this realistic at all? Is it even possible for me to buy a house in my situation? I’ve heard of people that make less money than I do with a &gt;600 credit score buying a home and I have no idea how tf they did it. I just need a halfway decent place to live :/",22Apr2020,1
344,"Throwaway account.

Some backstory on us... I (35F) have been happily married to my husband (33M) for over 5 years now and I would say that over all, we have a very happy and healthy relationship. He is a wonderful man whom I love and trust, and has always treated me with love and respect. He is a bit of a sensitive soul, though he has a hard time admitting it, and has struggled with anxiety in the past, where he sometimes thinks that people are making fun of him or disrespecting him, which leads him to get very defensive and hurt and sometimes escalates into a panic attack, if he isn't able to calm down. Over the time we have been together, we now are able to better handle these situations. It rarely becomes an issue that we aren't able to work though together.

 Fast forward to now and we are 4 weeks into sheltering in place. Our relationship is more or less normal, not fighting more or anything like that. As a matter of fact, we've commented how great things have been, despite spending so much time together in a small apartment. In fact, to his credit, he has been handling this situation really well, being overall happier, better rested and less stressed. He is still employed and with ability to work from home and his day to day had gotten significantly simpler. I, on the other hand, am a freelancer and have effectively lost all working opportunities during this time and the future of my industry is very uncertain. Financially, we are stable on his income alone, but that doesn't mean that I am ok with my career coming to an abrupt halt. In a turn of events, I find that I am the one who is a little more emotionally anxious these days, easy to tear up at the smallest things, while trying to hold it together.

In the last week, the gravity of the situation has been getting to me more and more and I don't think that my feelings are unreasonable. I've been spending more time in bed and playing stupid games on my phone just to pass the time, but I've also been getting random and unexpected bouts of anxiety which feel like panic attacks where I feel like this is it, and there is no way out to fix this situation, and everything I have ever done has been a waste and suddenly the air becomes too still and I start to hyperventilate sobbing. The intense parts of it last a few minutes and I'm usually more or less physically recovered within a half hour or so, but the few times it's happened around my spouse, it's also triggered him and instead of being able to help calm me and reassure me, he also starts to hyperventilate and gets angry... Not at me directly, but just in general, which is his usual reaction during these episodes... Cursing under his breath at how shitty everything is and banging his hands against walls or into the mattress. To be very clear, this is NOT an abuse situation. However, given his reaction to my reaction, I've begun excusing myself to go into another room or to take a shower or whatever when I feel it coming on, so that he doesn't have to see me when I go through these spells. It's been two times now that he's witnessed it, and both times his initial reaction has worsened it, not just in intensity and duration, but afterwards, from added tension and guilt that I've also triggered him.

I am a bit down to be completely honest, but I don't think that I'm depressed, and I'm certainly not suicidal. I've had a few panic attacks in the past, during times of extreme stress (loss of a previous career, before I decided to become a freelancer doing what I do now) and some rough times in college, but this is a new prolonged sort of reality that I'm trying to get a grip on and I would love advice on how to navigate this with my husband without triggering him also, or at the very least, on my own. 

Please stay healthy and safe everyone, these are tough times.",22Apr2020,1
345,"So I have always struggled through school-- from kindergarten through highschool, every year was a question of whether I would make it. I'm in community college right now.

348,"Long story short, I wanted to get the census done and over with. I am currently temporarily live in a single house, which has 15+ students living in it and is also run by a private off-campus student housing firm . Essentially, it is a house with like 10+ rooms, each of which is occupied by one or two people. We received a bunch of census forms that were left on a table along with other mail. I just grabbed one from the counter, opened it up, entered the code online, and completed it. Pretty simple.

After I hit the submit button did I realize that I forgot that I had a specific room number. I looked at the census form and it did have a room number next to the street address. I immediately went back to search for the form with my room number to no avail. After a little investigating, I also noticed that a few room numbers on the forms did not match other room numbers in the house (Each of our doors has a number adhered to it) vice versa. I'm thinking to myself, okay this should be no big deal, until I did some Google searching and found that lying on the census form can lead to a $500 fine. I'm kind of freaking out. Will the census bureau figure out a way to check that I did not occupy the exact room specified in the form that I had submitted? Should I call them to get it fixed? Or am I being paranoid.

But she has trouble letting me go fully and it’s started to really get to me. 

All my life I confirmed to my parents strict rules and I for the first time ever don’t have to do that anymore. 

I think my mom uses me as her comfort level. Her security blanket. 

You guys. She texts me almost every 2 hours asking me how I’m doing with a bunch of hearts. Not much has changed in the past two hours??? I try to stay kind because she’s so sensitive so I can’t be like every other kid and say MOM I NEED SPACE because shed be like 🥺🥺

This is making me want to move to Europe. 

I know this sounds dramatic but hear me out. 

I feel that it is the only way to show her I am not available for your stupid pointless texts and I am moving on with my life and deciding things for myself. 

It is making me resent her because I wish she would just WANT to let me live. After being in her house for so many years doing what she wants to make her and my dad happy has worn me out. And I finally felt I have escaped it but it isn’t getting better. I wish she would WANT to give me space. 

I hear some people talk to their parents once a day???? 

How lucky is that??? 

I feel pressured to be her best friend. 

I feel like I have to keep her happy and keep her company

I can’t continue to text my mom back and constantly say “I’m good how are you?” Because it is showing her that I am always there for her at her nearest convenience. 

I’m trying to shorten up convos. I’m trying to not text back as fast or ask too many questions. 

This is starting to get to my husband because she is just on our backs too much. 

He is seeing how this is starting to affect me because I feel claustrophobic. And in turn this is affecting our relationship because I get anxious anytime she texts me and I can’t continue to push this off like it doesn’t matter. 

Guys I know this sounds ridiculous. It’s just texts. But it’s so much more than that. 

My mom can’t let me go and I don’t know how to get her to want to. 

I’m angry with her that she doesn’t want me to grow and become my own person.

356,"Hi, 3 days ago marked the day where I was the last single friend in the group. 

We were a very tightly knit group of 4 people. I’ve known the 4 of them since mankind discovered dirt. However, they all now have girl/boyfriends.

At first I was happy for them. I still am, but it has taken a toll on my place in that group. I notice now that I’m not as important to them anymore because naturally they have more important people in their lives now.

And now that group has expanded to around 10 people. My three original friends have grown much closer to the newcomers and the newcomers basically blow me off whenever we hang out/facetime (quarantine) with each other.

Consequently, my og friends have also started to blow me off. Everyone will just kind of pretend I’m there but they’ll ignore and talk over me. I can’t have actual one-on-one convos anymore because they are cut short by one to two word answers and I can tell they don’t want to talk to me.

It mainly sucks, because we’ve known each other since high school, and up until 3 days ago we were best friends. I was even the one who originally brought the group of 4 together.

I’m struggling with the memories and the pictures I still have that remind me of the good days. And now I feel like I’m being forced out of the group I created by people who invaded and took my spot.

I guess you could say I’m mad. But I also know they are happy so that makes me happy. But sometimes it feels like they can’t give me the time of day, sometimes not even 5 minutes.

Should I just accept this as a time to move on? I am kinda demoralized because I thought even if I was the only single one left I would still be equal. I do have other friends in my life. 

Honestly I don’t know if it’s worth the effort anymore to win back their affection and time. In fact it feels like I shouldn’t have to win those back since I’ve invested so much into the friendship.

360,"A little bit of backstory...

My boyfriend and I met 3 years ago while at university and we were both living in a student house with 4 other people. After about a year of being together, we decided to move into out own place, and not long after that I got pregnant (by accident). 
I managed to finish uni while he dropped out and worked a little more. 
We had the baby and everything was good, but I got diagnosed with post natal depression shortly after my son was born and it was really tough for a few months but things got better, I got a therapist and came off my anti depressants and i started to get better.

But recently something has changed. The last few months, i just cant shake the feeling that something is just... off. I got one little thought about 'do I want to be with him' and at first it was nothing, but I found myself thinking it more and more each day to the point where it's pretty much constantly there in the back of my mind. I'm constantly wondering, is this what I want for the rest of my life. But I dont understand because nothing is wrong... we dont argue much and not over anything significant, hes actually the sweetest boy and we get on so well. I just dont know where all of this is coming from. There Is a big part of me that doesnt want to be with him anymore, at least that's the way it feels.
I feel like I have lost myself since being with him and I didnt even realise until now. I used to have lots of friends and now I have one or two, I used to be such a care free, happy go lucky person, but now I'm so pessimistic about life.  

I have always felt like he blames me for failing uni, although hes never said it, and I have said to him in the past that everything happened too quick in terms of living together and having a baby. Everything is so confusing in my head. I know that the honeymoon phase doesnt last forever and every relationship gets 'boring' eventually but that's not it. I'm not bored. But the thought of him one day asking to marry me is terrifying to me because I just dont think I'd be able to say yes. 

And having a child together only makes it more complicated. Hes a brilliant dad and we work together amazingly, how can I break up our family over a gut feeling 😭 

Right now we live in derby near my family, but we had plans to move in September up to Sheffield closer to his family because he wants to live closer to his dad. I dont want to leave derby but he compromised for.me when we came here so I said okay to moving again. And I'm applying for university so all the courses I chose are in Sheffield.

I love him still and I really really dont want to hurt him because it will destroy him if I leave, please help me guys, why do I feel like this, what do I do. As awful as it is to say, part of me just wants him to give me a reason to break up with him, at least so it isnt so out of the blue. I'm always thinking about what it would be like to be with other people (I would NEVER cheat on him). I just feel like I'm going to hurt him either way. He deserves better than to be with someone who isn't sure if she wants to be with him, he deserves someone who wants him and knows she does. 

Do I leave it and see if things get better or do I tell him? 

TL;DR - my boyfriend and I have been together 3 years with no major fall outs, for the past few months I have had a feeling that I want to break up with him and move on but there is no reason for feeling like this, what do I do:(",22Apr2020,1

363,"Hello! This is my first time posting on Reddit ever so please excuse the grammer or formating but I really need some help.

So my bf and I have been together for a couple of months now and I've enjoyed being with him so much, he means so much to me and I love him so much and he loves me as well. So far we've had a great relationship, yeah we've had some arguments and other things a long the way but over all I love being with him. He makes me feel so special. He's my first bf I've ever had.

So today he's asked me for my opinion about him donating his sperm to someone that he knows. At first I wasn't to sure about it, I had no idea how I'd feel about it later on in life but it seemed like something he really wanted to do. I was kind of ok with it but I still wasn't sure about how I'd feel about it in the long run. Then he told me that he'd be donating it to not just some random person that he knew, he'd be donating it to his ex.... That made me change my mind completely and I am at a point where I am completely not comfortable with it.

Now I don't want to sound like a bitch or selfish or anything, I love kids, I want to have kids of my own one day. However I'd like to be the mother of whoever I marry's first child. But I still don't feel comfortable with my bf having a child with someone else while I'm with him. He brought up the point that the child would be kind of like my step child but I just can't see it like that. In my view if he were to have a child with someone before we started dating and he was present when it was conceived would've been different to him donating his sperm to his ex and having a child like that.

Now my concerns are that if he does go through with this I just don't know if I'd be able to accept the child into my life and, if we do decide to get married after a while, I don't know how I feel about my children interacting with them. Let me just say my bf wants to be in this child's life, I just don't know if I can accept them into mine. My other point is, and this could just be me thinking irrationally, that his ex might try and use the child to get him back and make him leave me, which is something that would really hurt me. My other point is to do with something that he said to me while he was trying to convince me about the idea. For context let me say that I have told him that I only want between 2-3 kids, that all I want but he has told me that he wants 4. He told me that it could be a great idea because he could finally have his wish of wanting 4 kids, 2 with me and 2 with her, and this made me very upset and I honestly don't know how to think about it.

Sorry for the long post so I'll end it now but I really need some advice please. I just really don't know how to think about this, I'd appreciate any advice or anything at all.",22Apr2020,1

I took my time to get myself past it and healthy again, and I am now, I started the gym and met my current GF who is just the best in every way, I couldn't ask for a better person to have met.

Anyway over the past month I've kept having the same reoccurring dream with the same format. It's usually me in a relationship with someone, or for some reason my ex is back in my life and for the whole dream I'm fighting my hardest from being  abandoned (that's the term that I seem to use in my dream. But it's weird, I'm never happy in the relationship in my dream but I still fight for it and try my hardest to not be abandoned, and or cheated on(note I've ever been cheated on) and it always ends after I've been left again. I wake up with this dreaded feeling but then remember I'm in a happy relationship and it settles, but its confusing, I think its abandonment issues but I'm not too sure. 

Any ideas?",22Apr2020,1

377,"Just a bit of background. I have been working on a farm for about a year, I work my ass off and get shit pay. The owner has said multiple times that I will get a raise and even a bonus but at the end of the month, the story is always that it will happen next month. For the year I have been working I have had three weekends off and the rest of the time I have worked. In these last months, I have been working 13-15 hours a day in the week and then 6 hours a day on weekends, although at the moment we are approaching winter so that would probably go down to 10 hours a day. 

I have been feeling like this for a while and was in the process of leaving the job and going to another country to start over (the same type of job, but only doing it to get into the country to obtain citizenship and then I want to switch careers.) I had everything sorted and was due to leave in May but with the coronavirus, everything is fucked. We are probably going to be in lockdown for another month and I am reading in some articles that the country I wanted to go to will only open its borders in 12-18 months.

I hate it here and I hate the people I work with and for. I know I should not complain as there are a lot of people that have lost their jobs due to the virus and the lockdown but I am burning out and feel like all the time and effort I put in is not worth it with the shit pay. I feel like I have to toughen up and stay the extra year until my other plans can work out as jobs will probably be hard to come by when we come out of lockdown.

378,"So my bf and I have been dating for a year now and he’s has/has had multiple female friends. Over the course of our relationship we’ve ran into several issues with his female friends.

He has had two ex’s and two girls he’s hooked up with in his past up to my knowledge. I only have one boyfriend, nothing else. Over time I met more and more of his female friends and became concerned about how close he was to all of them and how they would interact with each other. Examples (fake names):

Samantha - She was one of his previous hookups. When I first learned that he hooked up with two girls, he told me they were completely out of his life and they don’t keep in touch at all. Several months later I lose it and ask him who his hookup was because of how many female friends he’s close to and my intuition told me something was up. Turns out I was right, after hesitating for a few minutes to tell me who she was, he told me it was Samantha, a girl he literally introduced me to at a competition, kept streaks with, and organized a secret Santa party where she invited my bf and his ex and organized it so that he’d give her a present (which also pissed me off but I didn’t make a big deal of it because I thought it’d be controlling). My friend later showed me texts where Samantha was trying to get information about my relationship out of her and calling me an “airhead” etc. This all happened between them while we were dating, and all that time I never knew she was the one he hooked up with. I later called him out for it and lying to me, he kept trying to defend his actions saying how he didn’t consider that as keeping in touch at the time even though he would constantly update me on her life like her new job or how she did in classes. He apologized and removed her from social media (except a groupchat with her) but it still bothers me and gives me trust issues to this day.

Michelle -  my bf told me how she had a crush on him for several years while they were in school. He told me that at one point he liked her too, but they never went anywhere because his friend was obsessed with her. she continued to have a crush on my bf for a couple more years. A few months ago after my bf and I are already dating, Michelle has a very grand birthday party. It’s like prom mixed with Sweet 16, there are ball gowns and everything. At these types of parties, the girl is required to select several boys to dance 1-1 with, of which she picked being my bf. When requesting about me being allowed to attend a couple WEEKS before the party, Michelle said no because it was too late to add any people to her invitee list (even though it’s a massive party, she can’t make room for one additional person?) I later sit in my bed that night watching Snapchat stories of him dancing with her embraced in his hands with them looking at one another, their hands all over each other. Knowing that he used to like her and was now dancing with her like that, and she liked him for several years and they were now having their “moment” makes me feel awful now. At the moment I didn’t think much of it, I didn’t care that they were dancing, but after all the stuff thats happened it disgusts me that I accepted that.

Kate - Has a party just like Michelle, invites my bf to dance the same way with her as well without inviting me knowing that we’re dating, and then today she posts a video to her story where she lists all the guys she’s had a crush on each year during high-school and lists my bf twice.

At the beginning of our relationship he acted extremely distant from me and even told me at one point that he had lost feelings for me and asked if I wanted to stay. I said I did because I loved him so much and believed he would get them back. Now he says he loves me every day and wants to get married etc., but after what’s happened from the lies to the disrespect I can’t stop thinking about how I was treated in the past. He has many other female friends and they do things like call each other cute names like “blueberry” and “toasty”, along with other little things like that that I told him make me mad and he said he’ll stop, but every day I find something new that he or his friend does that I find crosses boundaries. At the beginning of our relationship this never bothered me, but after everything that’s happened, especially lying about his ex, I can’t seem to trust him anymore. What makes me most upset is that if the roles were reversed, he would lose his mind. I went to workout with my guy friend once and invited my bf because I was alone with a guy and thought the respectful thing to do is to invite your partner. My bf joins and immediately becomes super possessive of me. After the workout he keeps talking how my friend kept looking at me and asks if we’ve ever liked each other in the past. I kept saying no but the way my bf acted at the workout basically ended my friendship with that friend and to this day I regret it. I also have several guy friends on Snapchat, and something as simple as their usernames would make my bf upset to the point where he’d want me to change them or remove certain boys from my private stories. All while he had girls on his Snapchat with hearts in their name. 

After several fights he says he will pay more attention to how he acts and treats me, but idk I just don’t know if I can trust him anymore, especially after what happened with Samantha. I don’t know what to do or how to regain trust.",22Apr2020,1

I am used to having a shower everyday, sometimes twice a day, and this is all I know. I didn't have a bath since I was a toddler. But I am about to move somewhere where there's no shower, only a bathtub and it makes me uncomfortable. Cleaining myself while standing up in the shower feels natural to me but I just don't know how would I do that properly while sitting down in a tub!

I feel so dumb asking such a question but I just can't get my head around it. I don't want to fill the tub everytime I want to take a bath - not to mention I am tall and heavy, I can't even fit in there.  
Ofcourse there should be an option to install a showerhead above the tub but the question stays - How do you people do it?

381,"I’m reaching a point where I feel completely hopeless with any sort of job. I’ve been working in sales for a few years now and I absolutely hate it, however since I’ve only ever really done this I’m not qualified for much else. Looking for jobs at this point either ends with 1.) Seeing a job I’m qualified for that is not much different than where I am now. 2.) Seeing a job that I might be interesting in in the long run, but requires a significant reduction in pay which I don’t know if I could financially manage. Or 3.) Seeing jobs that would require me to go back to school for, which I’m not against but I’m already in a large amount of debt from my first try, which ended in me dropping out.

It’s very stressful being in the middle of this. On one hand I have two people I care about and I feel as if I am responsible for one/both of them and should tell her that her boyfriend is cheating so she can stop worrying so much. 

I can’t just ignore the situation because our friend group does holidays and stuff together so we see each other a lot. 

Also something to mention is that he has been on the fence about their relationship for two years now. He tells me at least once a month “I don’t know if I even want to be with her” for the last two years. It’s insane.

387,"Hello! Thank you for taking the time to read in advance. :)

As the title implies... I've run into an issue. 

My underwear is wearing out, and I don't necessarily know where to find something better that suits my budget. *So right now,* I have these ""great"" Hanes underwear I really like, and I bought up all I could get about 3-4 months ago in anticipation of my freshman year of Uni. They are the ""Hanes Men's Comfort Flex Fit® Ultra Soft Cotton Stretch Long Leg Boxer Briefs"". 

I've determined that it is long-leg boxer briefs that fit me the way I like. I've tried most styles of underwear at some point in my life, which is why I'm so certain. These things are great, I've worn them with every outfit. Baseline, it's a great all-purpose garment, I just wish there were a few things I could tweak, I wish the leg band actually stayed in place (I have to adjust them every time I stand/sit down, and I scare people when I adjust in public :\\ ). 

Now for the problem.

It has now been brought to my attention that roughly a little over half of my undies have tiny holes in them now. :\\. As you can imagine, I am a mixture of sad and enraged as these haven't lasted as long as I had wanted. I don't have the money to be spending $30 USD for a single pair of undies ;-; and I was wondering if any other guys in my position have a solution! I am a broke freshman in college... 

I am looking for a pair of boxer briefs that boast extraordinary comfort blended with high durability and affordability. Does anyone have recommendations that might work for me? Thank you so much, this has just been stressing me out. Take care :)

389,"Hello there,

I have some problems. The house I used to live at I had neighbours living above me that were extremely loud. They screamed around moved furniture at 11pm (almost every day), had kids that played soccer, were on their Bobby cars and did other stuff like running around. This lead to extrem noises. If you hear all those noises for a longer period of time you'll get sensible to them (at least that was the case for me). Eventually I couldn't sleep properly anymore (2hrs a day) because I knew I was gonna get woken up again.. or just constantly thought about the noises and how I hated my neighbours.

Now the other problem is that I moved out of that shit place.. yeah that's right I moved out right into the next shit place. There is a really bad smell coming from the wall here but that's not the problem. The problem is that I got neighbours above me and I can hear every step they do... They have to get up really early for work waking me up at 4-5 am..  I already talked to them and it's not their fault. But wtf am I supposed to do... I can't get shit done without proper sleep that is uninterrupted. I'm so tired.. I'm studying and also working as a student to pay my bills.. but I can't do shit when I'm constantly tired because of bad sleep.

I can't just move out either because a) I don't have anyone else that helps me b) I don't have a car. c) my sister helped me transport everything here, but she won't help me again because I just moved recently. (2 weeks ago)

Appreciate any advice.",22Apr2020,1
390,"Tl;DR: I ordered a video game to arrive before my sex toy, so I could simply say that the 2nd package was an accessory for the video game. However, corona virus made it so my sex toy is going to arrive first. My parents wouldn't kick me out or anything, but what's the best way to receive the package without confrontation? What good excuse could I use for the package when it comes?

I ordered a sex toy for myself as a reward for sticking to a bunch of good habits I'm trying to form, and because it was my birthday not too long ago. A little background. My parents aren't the type to stick their noses into things, but they are careless. I actually ordered a sex toy about 6 months ago, but the package came earlier than I expected, and it ended up arriving at my house while I was at work. It had my name on it, but my dad opened it up because he's the type to not really double check that kind of stuff. We had a talk about it. He told me that he was sorry for opening it, and that I shouldn't do that type of stuff too much. That was probably one of the most awkward moments I've experienced, but he didn't even make me get rid of it. My parents wouldn't kick me out over that type of stuff, but I'd like to avoid another ""talk"" if possible. I've been testing the waters by ordering a couple stuff online since that incident. My dad will let me know if a package in my name has come, but he'll ask me what I ordered. The last packages I got were just random stuff that I wanted like a mobile charger, a lanyard, etc. And were all things that he could see me using the next day. However, that's not really the case for this time around. My plan was to order a game beforehand, and say that I was expecting another package that was an accessory for the game- which would've been the sex toy. I placed the video game order first and the sex toy order a couple days later, but the toy is getting here before the video game because of corona virus. What would be a good excuse for when my package comes? Should I tell my family I'm expecting a package or try to retrieve it secretly?

392,"I have been friends with T for five years now, we met in high school and have remained friends throughout college. I even lived with him at one point. 

I have had thoughts about this before, how he seems to be self centered and uninterested in me. In the past I viewed these thoughts as intrusive and ignored them or reasoned through them. He has always been there for me in many, many ways, giving me rides and fixing my car (he's a mechanic), loaning me money. I love him with so much of my heart it's unreal, and I'm very torn up about this situation. 

Over the past few months, he has been increasingly uninterested. I used to have many problems with my confidence in the past and I have been working through those very well. I will list a few specific incidences. 

We were out walking on mushrooms. We were talking about some legal related issues and we're very mildly disagreeing, or so it seemed. He told me ""you don't know what you're fucking talking about"" and essentially told me to shut up. I replied with a final rebuttal which made me correct about the argument. I don't care about being wrong and I am not a sore loser, but I happened to be right. 

Any time I make a joke, he literally ignores it entirely. No laugh, no light scoff, no reply at all. Then he begins talking about whatever he wants to talk about. The other day he rolled his eyes and said ""anyway...""

He always wants to talk about himself. I put a lot of effort into maintaining the conversation and showing interest, because I care, and I listen to every word he says. But when I mention anything at all about myself he seems to not give a shit, 90% of the time. 

For example, I have recently found what career I want to go into, I've always had trouble deciding and I finally figured it out. I told him, in a moment of silence in the conversation, and he didn't reply at all. He then began talking about himself again. 

This is constant. I don't want anything to do with him anymore. I don't know if this is a new problem due to something I did, or if it's always been a problem and I'm just now confident enough to notice it and dislike it instead of being a doormat. 

I would so sincerely appreciate your help. This is a precarious situation for me and I would love any advice you can offer. Thank you.",22Apr2020,1
393,"I had been in love with a girl for 2-3 years. We’d had moments but never too obvious. She was always happy that’s why I started to worry a while before the incident that happened. We lived fairly close to each other so I’d take her out everyday after school ( we were in year 10 at the time) but still nothing was making her heaps happy. Don’t get me wrong she was not suicidal or depressed just unhappy and was no longer a social girl. One day I was bored and I seriously couldn’t think of what could make her happy anymore. I came up with a fucking stupid idea. I being female, made a male fake account that she could talk to. I thought that maybe she could be in a confidence kind of talking romantic kind of thing with this guy. So that morning I mad ethe account and added her, planning for it to be all over in a week once she had gained confidence as she was one of the girls with confidence and an ego and loved people chasing her. She talked to this guy everyday for a while and after a while I loved it. I felt so close to her and she was happy. It was a relief at the time till I realised I was in too far deep and what I had been doing. It progressed and it was eating me alive but I knew I couldn’t leave now. At the start when she told me about this guy, let’s say I called him Mark. She told me about Mark and I said I knew him since I’m pretty popular around my area. I said I’d met him and was good friends with him. Eventually, all this snowballed and it was a bad thing. It had been about 5-6 months of being this guy. I had let it control my life and it was eating me up everyday cause I loved and cared for this girl so much. Everytime they tried to meet it didn’t work out and she became sus. I brings two of my friends in and told them about the secret. I said I needed help since I had said Mark went to a boarding school with roommates. I became overwhelmed when she started asking me about them and asking for their Snapchat’s for her friends. We made another two accounts, each in charge of one but we didn’t use the others and held off on them. It became way too overwhelming for me and I cut it off with her by starting a fight. She was really hurt I think but she got over it. Then me and her got together one night and started dating the next day. It was like my dream. 

My literal dream.

It wa stood whilst her parents were away for the month because it meant we could hang out constantly as she wasn’t out to her parents. After they came home, she tried to tell them and they said she had to break it off immediately.  That’s when she changed. We kept dating but she cheated on me. Ironically, she confessed her love to Mark and we broke up. I was so hurt. I loved hearing her apologise and want to come back to me cause that’s all I wanted right? I got back with her soon later. We ramped up the roommates accounts as the best friends were sus. She then cheated on me with one of the roommates over text aswell. That fucking killed aswell and we broke up.

That was about 10 months ago.

They got so suspicious and everyday I wanted to kill myself. I changed into a different person. I thought about suicide everyday and I couldn’t let them find out. It would hurt more to lose her and the two best friends I catfished along with her. I carried the burden everyday including till this day. Recently, I told the two best friends. I tried telling my ex but shes blocked me on pretty much everything. I’m okay with one of the best friends and hang with her reguarly, the other isn’t talking to me but we are on okay terms. I sent a massive apology to my ex on Snapchat by she has unfriended me so it’s pending. Some nights I message her at 2 and beg her to answer but she never does. It just hurts. I did it out of good intentions and I know I fucked up so bad but she won’t even give me the chance to apologise and admit it was me. I haven’t even got to tell her it was me, the girls just did. They all knew it was me for months before I told them but I did anyway. This is what I was scared of. I’ve moved into another relationship with my current girlfriend ur I still care and for some reason cherish this girl. She treated me like shit but I think we cling to the old memories. I’m sick of living with guilt and I want to forgive myself but I just can’t. I was long ago and I haven’t touched the account for literally nearly a year or that, it’s just the fact I lied but it CRUSHED me everyday. I don’t know if I’ve hurt her or if she even cares.the last time I was dating her was October and she gets over people hella quickly unlike me. Er parents said to stay away from me since they caught me smoking and she just does. I think she’s sick of fighting for me even though I’d do anything for her and she knows it. I don’t want to text her anymore because I know she likes the chase and she loves people chasing after her. She likes people who don’t care about her. 

Please, please, please give me some advice.

I haven’t touched the account for a year and it’s long gone, I just don’t know what to do especially with the quarantine at the moment I don’t see her at school. I stay up till 3am hating myself and wanting her to respond it she never will. Please help.",22Apr2020,1

And like this is kind of revaluation to me bc I thought that it was my situation that made me sad and anxious, but now that I’m not doing anything bc I can’t leave my house, and my life actually does suck, made me realizeI had such a good life before and didn’t appreciate things.

So now everything in the world has changed due the ongoing pandemic and I worry wether I can stick with my plans or if I should start studying right away and postpone my travel plans. Do you think that it will be possible and also acceptable to travel internationally to less developed countries like Bolivia in January of 2021? My friend is kind of careful and tends towards studying. I however am not yet sure what subject to choose and wanted to research and decide what to do in fall while I would be working. Nonetheless I already have some ideas, but one of the programmes I like has closed applications in January, I can apply to the other one until 15th of July.

 I tend towards sticking with the gap year and if we can't go to South America, travel around Europe or doing something else, however my friend tends towards studying, so I would need to convince him to give it a try. Is this unreasonable? Or do you think it's likely that we can travel?",22Apr2020,1
396,"I am a 18 year old male that isn't out of the house just yet. My relationship with my father is incredibly strained. He suffered through an extremely abusive past and has done a lot to try and get us where we are. However he is also a huge alcoholic and probably also suffering from schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety. I, myself, have taken therapy since I was 15 and am currently on medication. I had major depression and anxiety. I even had developed depressive psychosis which occurred through  voices and hallucinations. Its taken a lot of work to get to where I am now, I am stable and continually trying to better myself. However, my dad never went to therapy and doesn't completely believe in it. In order to give you a better view of my dad, let me tell you of the things he did while I grew up. He got drunk often, He has occasionally been physically violent with me and my mother, He constantly berates me and my sister about our futures (even though she is in early college to become a psychiatrist), He has made inappropriate racial comments, He would sometimes get drunk and try to spill his problems and life story to anyone who would listen (I could probably write a story on his life, that's how many times I have heard it), He has had the police called on him a few times, He has done jail time once when I was young, and He will have extensive conversations with himself or imaginary people and thinks everyone is plotting against him. However, despite all of this. He is my father and a part of me wants the best for him. I know its not my problem to fix and maybe I am being naive but I want to believe that, given the right resources, my dad could improve himself. Maybe give up drinking even. Do you think there is anyway to get through to my dad and maybe get him to change? Like maybe writing him a letter or setting up a group intervention? Do you think its worth it or a good idea at all?",22Apr2020,1
397,"This is my first time posting on mobile and I'm not an native English speaker so please be kind. This is going to be long

I (17f) (half-asian) live with my sister, my mom, and my dad currently. I have been going to therapy in secret for months, because of depression and the relationship with my family.

My mother used to hit me as a punishment. I don't remember when was the first time, but the hits I remember was in elementary school. Just some slaps on my cheek, or threats of slaps. For example when I couldn't find something she wanted, ( You are gonna get slapped if I find it) Or when It was my first period and my cleaning was sloppy, so the pad sticked to the trash can ( Your sister got slapped a lot because of this too, do you wanna get slapped?). Or she would just raise her hand to show that she can slap me. This is pretty normal at my mom's home country, since my grandmother and my elementary teacher hit my hand/my legs with rulers as a punishment. I'm pretty sure my mom got hit by my grandmother too.

And then we moved to my dad's home country, and in middle School, I told someone at school about the slaps I got. And she reported it to the child services. But the papers had some misunderstanding of what I said, there was things that were not true, and it was all a big mess. I was really depressed before it all happened so my mom thinks I said that just so that I had something to blame my depression on. My sister hated me for awhile after, and maybe now too.

I went to therapy then, but I don't remember any of it. And then we moved back to mom's home country for half a year with only my mom and me, my dad and sister stayed. That was when my mom told me that the therapist said that I wasn't abused. Never heard it directly from the therapist.

I started highschool at my dad's home country, and I talked to someone at school again, after I got the promise that she won't report to the child services. She said no matter how much she loves me, and no matter the reason, abuse is abuse. And I believe her, so I have been cold against my mother since. I do not love her. But I have been always clingy since I was little (crying for attention, hurting my self for attention, saying I love you, hugging her, sleeping together when I had a nightmare etc) and I'm still very dependent on my mom. I talk to her a lot and ask her if I should buy something.

I know that my mom and dad loves me. She goes to shopping with me, and our family go traveling together. But whenever she says things like (you guys had such a wonderful childhood, or I'm hurt that you are scared of me) I feel disgusted with her. I get really mad at my mom because she hit me, and I get mad at my dad for not really stopping her. And I get mad at my sister for defending my mom.

My sister is in college and studies psychology, and she loves my mom. She does everything for her and is always on her side when I get in argument with her. 

My family is a really nice, tight family, without me. And I feel like I'm the one who is just mean and spoiled without reason.

I don't really remember the details, like how old I was then, or why I was slapped. And my mom acts like she never once hit me. So some part of me is doubting if it did happen.

But I'm also certain that everything I remember did happen. Like when my mom told me to take off my glasses (so that she won't ruin them when she slaps me) or that night when my mom and dad got in a fight because of my sister, and she came into our room (we shared) at night and started hitting my sister who was asleep with a pillow. (Yes, I know a pillow is not hard, but I was in elementary school and my sister was in no position to defend herself) After, she came to my bed and slept. I asked my sister if she remembers anything from the last night and she said she doesn't remember. After that night I couldn't sleep very well because I thought she would hit me in my sleep too.

I'm saving up money so that I can move out as soon as possible when I'm 18, and go NC with my family. And change my name. But I also really love my dad's side of Grandma and Grandpa. And I don't want to upset them. I'm wondering if I should talk with my sister for why I was and am so mean to my mom, and why I don't love her. But I don't want her to tell my mom, because I don't want it to be awkward or strained until I move out. I also tell my mom to stop hugging me or touch me (she doesn't touch me in a sexual way), but she haven't stopped.

I'm wondering if I'm just overreacting when my mom wants the best for me, and it's just a cultural thing. And if I'm just in puberty/rebellious teen phase. I really do not love my family. It feels more like a relationship between a student and a teacher, neighbours, or just roommates who are not close.  

I don't want any relationship with my mom. And maybe not with my dad and my sister either.",22Apr2020,1
398,"I'm debating on deleting all of my social media accounts because at one point in my life it was a coping mechanism for me especially throughout high school. I was that very quiet and lonely kid who would have a whole different persona online. I made many friends on there which was all cool. 

&amp;#x200B;

As time flew by, I slowly relied it for my own happiness and it made me feel like I'm not alone. Even though the amount of time spent on social apps like Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat were really unhealthy. But, truth is I always end up feeling like complete shit. It really has contributed to my depression and anxiety. I've kept comparing myself to others, worried about who didn't like my photo, always thought I wasn't good enough, recently I keep thinking negatively, and it has been really killing my mood especially using it for hours.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, I did some thinking and thought it's probably  best to delete everything. What's stopping me is that I'm an upcoming photographer and want to share my photos on Instagram and Twitter. I also don't want to loose connections with people who are into photography. But another part of me is telling me that I should delete everything and work on myself until I feel mentally and physically good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I only have one close friend and my family. I don't really talk to a lot of people because my social skills suck. I don't really like going to parties or anything. I'm a stay home college student lol.

Any advice? Thanks y'all!",22Apr2020,1
399,"Long post, I’m so sorry.

My husband and I are high school sweethearts, both 23 years old and we have a 1 year old son. We graduated from high school and we moved to a different city, a couple of hours away from our hometown, for college where we completed both our Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees. We were away from home for about 5 years and only visited during some school breaks. I found out I was pregnant shortly after we graduated from college. We always planned to stay in that city to start/raise our family but when we told my parents that we were expecting, they asked us to move back to our hometown and live with them because they wanted the opportunity to watch their first grandchild grow and they wanted to make up for the time we were apart while I was away at college. After thinking it over, my husband and I agreed and we got transfers with our employers to the respective locations in our hometown. My family and I all have a really good relationship and spend a lot of fun, quality time together and my parents absolutely love our son. My husband’s parents passed away when he was still very young, so over the years, my parents have become like his parents and they love him as if he was their own.
When I was 10 years old, my mom had my younger brother who is now 13 years old. We never had a close relationship but we did play around here and there, and I usually helped with his homework and that was about it. By the time he was like 7 and we could have like an actual conversation that would interest me (a rebellious 17 year old, at the time), it was time for me to move away for college. When my husband and I moved back home, we both worked full time but my employer allowed me to work from home so I could care for my son. Unfortunately, this current global crisis has left us all unemployed and my younger brother, without school. This means that we all get to spend much more time together and we love it! However, it’s given me (and my husband) the opportunity to get to know my brother a lot more than we thought. Some of the things we’ve learned about him? Not so good. We’ve noticed that my brother is extremely disrespectful and rude to everyone in the household. He makes mean and snarky comments, even about my son. 
I’ve brought this up to my parents multiple times over the last year of us living here and nothing has been done. When I was younger, both my parents were extremely strict. They didn’t allow even the tiniest amount of disrespect in their house. But now with my brother, it almost seems like we have different parents because they let so much “slide”, if you will. Because my parents don’t discipline him or so much as scold him when he’s wrong, he thinks it’s okay to do whatever he wants and talks back to my parents every time they say anything to him. He also uses an insane amount of curse words and he makes racist comments often.
Today, we were at the dinner table and he made one of his rude, snarky comments, directed at my husband, who was just minding his business, eating his dinner. I overheard and said, “what?” which he responded to with another mean comment directed at me. My husband didn’t say anything because he is very non-confrontational, and just politely left the dinner table. I, however, brought it up to my parents after dinner because I could tell it really bothered my husband and it honestly bothered me too. But my parents didn’t care. My brother claimed it was a joke when I confronted him in front of my parents and my parents just said we were overreacting. They said I was “ruining the family” by being exaggerated and that they felt “sorry for us”. Towards the end of the conversation, my brother admitted that what he said was rude and offensive and he wanted to go apologize to my husband (he’s like an older brother to him), but my parents didn’t let him? They told him not to because he didn’t do anything wrong, so he didn’t apologize.
I’ve never been the favorite child. My mom always sides with my brother, regardless of what he’s being accused of. And 90% of the time, she’ll just claim she didn’t hear him, even if she did. This has been going on for a long, long time but today’s issue has caused some clear division in the house. I am obviously standing by my husband and my mom and dad are standing by my brother.
Nobody is speaking to each other and things are just really tense. I think my husband is just fed up with all the crap he’s being taking from my brother for a while now so tonight he proposed that we move out once we get our jobs back and once all this is over. 
I love my parents and don’t want to leave them. They’re growing older and I want to spend as much time as possible with them. My son also loves them and I know he would miss them. My husband and I have been wanting to buy a bigger home and we wanted to take my parents and brother to live with us, but after so many issues and arguments with no progress, I don’t know if that’s possible or even a good idea? I don’t want my child to grow up in this environment, thinking it’s okay to disrespect the people around you for no reason. And I feel that even if I try my best as a parent, he will still somehow catch on to my brothers bad manners.

I don’t know if we can continue living with my parents if they are not willing to enforce some type of proper discipline for my brother and he keeps being disrespectful and offensive. But I also feel like I can’t make them change the way they are with him because apparently my husband and I are the only ones bothered by it. I don’t want to keep complaining to them about something that they don’t seem to want to fix? I don’t know if the pros weigh out the cons or if this is just a dealbreaker for us? I feel like my parents will just continue thinking we’re overreacting until my brother does/says something really awful to them and they experience it first hand.
I’m just confused and overwhelmed with emotions and looking for advice.
Thanks.",22Apr2020,1

405,"My best friend of 8 years (who we will name L) character traits are: one upping my problems with his, extremely self pitying where no other conversation matters, and blames everything on his herpes (that he got from going on a Tinder humping spree). L chooses to not go to doctors to mitigate the symptoms and blow his money on his car/phones/accessories.

He finally gets a great gf (we will name her R) , who I've known through mutual friends. R knows L has herpes but they were using protection. They eventually break up because he has problems with xanax and coke. End up still being friends; meeting up to hang and make out. 

One night, theyre make out and R says multiple times that she doesnt want to have sex. L replies ""Ok I understand."" R decides to sleep over since it was late, then L then tells R to take off her pants to get comfortable. Then immediately starts having sex with her, unwarranted and  unprotected. R admits it's a gray area of rape. L finishes, realized what he did. He blamed it on taking adderall and never talked about it to R again.

From R's account, she could've easily stopped him but wanted to make L ""feel bad for what he was doing.""

What should I do? Am I the asshole for just.... ghosting both L and R? Or are they the assholes? Hate both sides for what they did to each other and no long sympathize with either.

I was bringing along my brand new switch for the flight, including the base, the new smash bro’s, and both nunchucks. I go check my bag and only after dropping it off I realize I put my switch in my checked bag... “Fuck”. I figure it’s too late to go back, it’ll be fine, I have my phone and my charger and the rest of my carryon stuff so whatevs. FF to when we land and I go down to the bag conveyor. Lo and behold, my switch and all accessories have mysteriously disappeared. I end up making my friend late to his own birthday party by trying to see if I can talk with security or something. Long story short, they tell me they’ll contact me to follow up, I get an email later that day saying that

 “We are sorry to hear of property missing from your checked baggage when you traveled with Frontier Airlines. 

There are circumstances when Frontier Airlines does not assume liability for baggage issues. Each airline has a Contract of Carriage filed with the Federal Aviation Administration that describes those situations and the limits, or exclusions, of liability


Unfortunately, the items you are claiming are not covered under our Contract of Carriage.” 

Basically all this means is that they’re not liable for their bitch ass security people taking my shit, AND that they’re not gonna compensate me at all.

Last year was the year I decided to quit my job welding and fabrication to pursue a career in policing. I got the job at a VERY young age which was 17 and the way I got this job was by graduating high school early, hard work and dedication, and by taking a metal fabrication course at a trades school. The job paid well and I felt that my life was at a certain ‘peak’ and I was not happy with the result I have gotten so I saved most of my money to pay for my post-secondary education and I quit. I quit last year in July and began school in September 2019. 

I got great grades (was in the upper levels of my classmates) and I had a promising look for my future. That all changed when March came around of this year. To no surprise the covid-19 situation has put a damper on my plan for my policing career. To be more specific, now that school is done I CANNOT find a job or volunteer work that I would be personally happy with. 

It’s gotten to the point where I have to ask my mother for some financial relief... and I hate doing that because she has been helping me my entire life and I feel that at this age I should not be asking for money. 

TLDR: I stay at home all day everyday gaining weight with a couple hundred bucks in the bank and the only way I can escape this stress and anxiety is by playing video games with my friends. I can’t get a job anywhere and when I am close to getting one life simply says ‘no.’ I feel that life is punishing me for following my dream of become a police officer and I don’t know why.

412,"I (20F) live in Australia and are in my third year of veterinary science. I've really enjoyed it so far and while it's tricky, I know it's what I want to do and have wanted to help animals my whole life.

In 2017 (year 12) my best friend of 14 years was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. One day she had a ""stomach bug"" and then it turned into sage 3 leukaemia. A few treatments weren't very successful and it depleted her WBC a lot so we turned to dialysis and a few blood transfusions. I was a miracle blood match with her and donated pints of my blood and plasma for her so she could build up her platelets. I was so happy that I didn't feel as helpless. By my mid sem finals in first year vet, she was put on the waiting list for a kidney and she was undergoing dialysis every week. I offered to give my kidney but my dad wouldn't let me and it was the hardest thing Ive ever had to do. I continued giving her blood transfusions for a few more months. My best friend was so beautiful the whole time and never let me know that she was in pain. I cried and told her I couldn't give away my kidney and she just smiled and it's so vivid to me even now. She knew it was the end of the road and by December she was gone.

 It was hella hard for me and our families to deal with that stuff and I am doing a lot better now. But when it comes to my career I'm trapped. I physically get the shakes and get sick now if I have a blood test for any reason or if I see or do bloods on animals. I love animals and have wanted to become a vet for so long. I regularly volunteer at the RSPCA and I'm doing clipping and restraining animals for bloods and stuff. It's only intravenous needles which mess me up and it's not just a random fear of needles now so idk. It never bothered me at all in 2018 during my studies and i was doing a lot of blood transfusions. But now all of a sudden this has happened and I'm scared it will impact my career. It's like I'm tied to her even now. It's weird, I don't feel upset anymore about what's happened, Ive accepted it but idk why this has suddenly happened?

415,"For most of my youth I have been very thin and little. About two years ago a mix of medications I was put on caused me to gain 40 lbs (18 kg) within a few months. I went from my 125 lbs (57 kg) to 165 lbs (75 kg) and started feeling horrible about myself. I dropped one of the medications, which brought me down a little to 150 lbs (68 kg). I still felt horrible. 

I’ve started portion controlling since, but haven’t focused much on it. I started drinking straight black coffee for breakfast and skipping lunch, just eating at dinner time. Still not a big deal, I snacked throughout the day and got calories in. But lately, I’ve noticed that my portion sizing has cut to a single meal (like a sandwich) or half a meal (like some chips) in a day. I realized this is not good, and started trying to eat more. 

The only problem is that I’ve started getting immensely nauseous if I eat more than a single meal, at least within the next 8 hours or so. I can have half of a sandwich or a bowl of soup and feel absolutely stuffed for hours. Eating a whole plate of dinner (usually with meat, vegetables, and another side dish) has started becoming a chore. I’m starting to forget to eat because hunger doesn’t come if I only eat a little. 

I’ve recently dropped to 135 lbs (61 kg) and I haven’t been this skinny since my freshman year of high school. I figure it’s not all that bad since I was chubby and could lose the weight, and I haven’t even reached the weight I was before I gained so much weight in the first place.

I can't fucking sleep. I've gotten maybe two or three hours of it in the past three or four days. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD. I'm 19, female. 110 lbs.

I've always had insomnia that got bad from anxiety but never this bad. I used to work at a corporate coffee chain that needed me to be up at 4 am and some nights, I would go to bed at 7 pm and literally lay awake staring at the ceiling. Never once getting some shut eye. My sleep got better since quarantine, but now it's completely gine.

I've had no caffeine at all the past week and I'm tired as fuck. I'll lay in bed all day just *trying* to just get some sleep, but I'm restless and at some points, feels like I'm shaking or twitching. I feel like I can hear every little movement in the house, and I've even tried ambience through headphones, but it gives me migraines and makes my inability to fall into REM worse. My head is poundings and it hurts so bad. I can't focus on tasks and I have no apatite. Any tiny bit of light destroys any drowsiness I had. I feel sick, nauseated, but have no fever. My body feels like it's moving through syrup and aches everywhere. I can't do simple things anymore and I get confused and brain foggy.
As I type this at 2 am I feel like I can hear people talking upstairs above me, but I have no idea if I'm hearing things or not. 

I'm irritated and just want to fucking sleep. I think I'm displaying a bit of paranoia. I'll lay down for hours and get so anxiety ridden, I just start crying because I want to sleep so badly but can't.

I don't want to go into the clinic because I believe they're overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients. I wouldn't even be able to drive to the clinic with how impaired I am. Plus it puts me and the elderly couple I live with at risk.

I literally feel like I'm dying from lack of sleep. It's taken me literal hours to type this up in the best format and create a new throw away account. I don't know if it's medical (sorry for breaking subbreddit rules if it so) or mental or what. I've tried everything like; melatonin, warm showers, eating a full meal, etc, all to no avail. I can't get over the counter sleep aids with this lock down. I'm otherwise a fit and healthy young woman. O'm even good at staying realy hydrated.

419,"Whenever I try to sleep, I get this restless sensation (kind of like when your legs  fall asleep and you finally move it, causing it to tingle for a bit). Well that’s the sensation I’m feeling and i get it all throughout the backside of my body but mainly on my lower back. It causes me to feel awake and uncomfortable, making me want to stretch my body and everything. 

The lack of sleep causes me to have dizzy spells whenever I get up, where there’s a couple seconds of being light headed along with my eyes getting all fuzzy, causing me to have to stop moving completely just so I can stabilize myself. And I’m not sure if google is correct by saying I have restless leg syndrome because the sensation is more in my lower back. Any information on what this is or what it could be? Or anyways I’m able to help myself sleep better ?",22Apr2020,1
420,"Since the beginning of isolation, I've come back to my parents house. They live in a leafy, open suburb where the weather is nice and virus cases are low. I normally live in a bigger city that has become one of the outbreak centers in my region. 

I'm 25, and it's now been 6 weeks of living with my parents. I'm incredibly grateful for the space, food, and shelter they provide, but I am starting to go a little crazy. I haven't seen anyone my age in 6 weeks. I am really, really missing my own space. My room in my apartment is sitting empty, and I could go back, but there is a subletter in my roommate's space and I know they haven't been keeping the quarantine as strictly as I have here (my mom is pretty intense about the rules, which I respect). Plus, I don't know the new person, and adapting to a new personality could be complicated. I'm not too worried for my own health (though I am worried, no lie). But if I go there, I definitely won't be able to come back to my parents place, and I'm not sure if i should give that up.

The thing is, it's been 6 weeks! And this doesn't look like it's going to end anytime soon. Will I really be at my parents house long term? I do love my family, but it's very very intense being cooped up together for so long. We live far enough apart that once I go to my apt, I won't be coming back here.

424,"So this takes me back to high-school. Being forced by my parents to go to church with them. There was this girl that would go and sit in the very back pew and just read the whole time. We only talked in person really one time. And I only got her nickname. 
I recently opened up my Facebook for the first time in years and tried to find her. After about a week, going through every person in my town with a name that would use that specific abbreviation/nickname, and I think I found her. Its been so many years since I saw her that I'm not 100% positive it is her but I'm pretty sure it's her.

I live with my mom, dad and a brother. But, currently I am at my mom’s parent’s house. Whenever I am at my parent’s house, I feel suffocated. I love my mom a lot. 
My dad is too narrow minded. He doesn’t love my mom. He’s like, he married her cause marriage is the thing you must do. He loves my mom in no any way. But, still they are staying together. My mom tells me she’s staying with him for me and my brother’s bright future and whenever I tell her to leave him, she tells that she’s afraid of the society and our future. 

After my school, I was sent to one of my relatives, where they decided that I am going to study engineering. But, I didn’t want to. I told them I don’t want to study that, let me figure out first what I want to study myself. But, they were like, we never figure out ourselves, once we get into something, it would automatically fit us. And I was forced to study for the entrance and I was so much suffocated in that house. I tried to hurt myself coz there I had to do everything their way from eating, sleeping, going to toilet, using mobile phone and all. I didn’t clear the entrance exam. I ended up joining IT but I don’t know how and why. After a few weeks, I told my dad that this was not the subject for me. But, then he scolded me. And then I continued. It’s been 2 yrs and I still don’t want to study this. My dad have not given me freedom to think about what I want to study. In fact, he doesn’t care if I study or not, what will I do in the future and all. He just wants me to treat him as a dad. I don’t talk to him much. He doesn’t like me talking to him about taking life decisions and he wants me to treat him as my dad also. I don’t know what he wants. He is controlling all our lives. My mom is not happy, I am not happy. I see my career going nowhere. When I get out of this learning nothing new and be nothing in my life, Imagining this situation scares me. 

My mom always tells me to study well. She cares for me. But, whenever I open my books, whenever I listen to the teachers carefully, I understand nothing. This doesn’t feel like what I want to do. I told this to so many people including my mom and dad so many times in search of someone, who could show me the right path, who could help me. But, nothing worked out. My mom and I both are depressed. But, our father thinks of a depressed person as a mad person. 
We really need to see a doctor. But, we can’t. I know we are never going to be visiting a doctor regarding our depression. I know my father will never stop imposing his decisions onto us. I did whatever I could while trying to get out of this situation. Nothing worked out. 

A few months ago I cut my hands, but I couldn’t die. I went to my mom’s best friends house for counseling coz I know my mom would be stressed out a lot and cry. 
She told me everything’s gonna be alright, took me to the hospital nearby and the doctors asked us what had happened. They suspected attempt of suicide but we made something up and they sewed the cut. I don’t see anywhere to go. I can’t live this life anymore.

The main thing is my dad, he is self made( paid his way through college, has a sales job he does well at but is hard on him, and has come a long way from living close to poverty with my mom).
This mindset he has of hard work and business mindedness has made them multi millionaires, which I think is great from humble beginnings and all. The issue that I have is wanting to do well for myself as well, I want to make him proud, I want to make myself proud, but I don’t know what I want. Moreover I don’t know what I’m good at.

430,"I'm squeezing myself really hard to produce a solution, and as more years go by the higher the pressure becomes. How can I chose what I want to do with my life and be done with it? It's bogging me down and affecting other areas of my life too.

I have plenty of interests and hobbies, both intellectual and practical, but when I try to turn them into a line of work it becomes all incredibly prosaic and dreary and surprisingly not fun: I only have to turn one of my interests into a choice for life to stop liking it.

I used to be a fairly idealistic person, and worked hard (too much, obsessive commitment) to achieve the ""my goal in life"" that I had at various points in my 20's (I followed 3 paths in total), but after failing really hard at the 3rd (abuse in a toxic environment, I looked into myself and I realised I choose that path to please some people, so not moving on with that in another environment) I have become quite jaded. 

I am also ashamed of being in my mid 30's, it's ridiculous to go for a life goal at my age. After those failures I got a degree in Anthropology that I love, but it's not a job, let alone a life project. I'm currently a regular employee for a big company. What now?",22Apr2020,1

Maybe I'm a bit desperate but I like to think that I'm a good judge of character and he's really sweet, plus he actually seems to enjoy talking to me, and I'm pretty sure we're roughly the same maturity level.

433,"I live in a town where affordable housing is hard to come by.  I work night shifts and usually go to bed around dawn, my lifestyle is a little unusual but nothing too crazy.  I am an artist and musician, and have band practice at home a few times a month (not during quarantine).   I have been living at a place for a few years that I found on Craigslist.  My rent is really good for the area, and I can afford it comfortably, but mostly live paycheck to paycheck. I live a 10 minute walk from my job in a good part of town. I don't have any problems with my housemates, sometimes we chat but I don't really connect with any of them and mostly just keep to myself.  I tend to be insecure about making too much noise or being too messy, but they never complain to me and they all make at least as much noise/mess as I do typically.  My best friend lived here for a year or so but moved out because he found a bigger and cheaper place nearby with some other friends. He seems quite happy with his decision.  The landlord here is old and if they die the house is likely to get sold and everyone would have to move out, but my housemates have lived here for 12+ years and there is no real indication that will change soon.  All in all I feel pretty comfortable and happy here, but its not the best place I have ever lived and I feel like there is some room for improvement.  My main issue is that I want to feel more free to express myself and make art/music without feeling insecure, or better yet live with people who inspire me and motivate me.

A good friend and former housemate of mine is moving out of their place across town.  They offered me the room.  It would be like a 10 minute drive or 40 minute walk to work, still not bad.  In a slightly worse but still nice part of town.  The rent is like a 5-10% increase on what I pay now.  Affordable but it would be a little tight for me (hoping for some hazard pay soon...) The room is slightly larger and nicer than my current room.  The house seems pretty cozy and welcoming, has a much more ""artist"" vibe, and has similar amenities to where I am now. It has only one fridge and one bathroom compared to two of each at my current place, but it has a dishwasher which I currently lack. The yard is pretty nice and has a firepit and good hangout space, but lacks the amazing garden of edible and useful plants that my current house has (and which I can't recreate).  I met two of the tenants who would be my housemates (out of 5, same as my current house) and they seemed friendly, and more likely to have common interests than my current housemates.  They said they are fine with band practice, and that I am welcome to decorate the house with art however I like.  My friend who is about to move out said it is their favorite place they have lived and that all the housemates are chill and friendly. I would be renting from a rental company that has been renting the place out for like 15+ years and it is likely to have long term stability. Overall, I really liked the spot and felt pretty comfortable there even on my first visit. One more catch is that a couple of the people are probably moving out in a few months, which means that I could have a say in who else moves in (I don't really get a say at my current house), but the rental company might bring in random people if I can't find someone.

So when I weigh the pros and cons, I feel like the new place would likely be somewhat of an improvement over my current situation.  I would be paying a little more, but I would have a bit more space and seemingly a nicer vibe (based on one visit).  I would be taking a gamble on new housemates that my friend claims I will get along well with, as opposed to my current housemates who I like but really don't connect with and mostly avoid. I think living with people I enjoy would be good for my mental health and social life which was lacking a little bit even before the quarantine. But the downside is that I find moving stressful and as an introvert I typically always struggle to get used to new people. After 3 years at my current house, its only been the last 6 months or so that I have felt like it's ""home"" and I have been feeling more productive and comfortable.  It usually takes me about that long to ""get settled"".  I don't know if I should give up the good and comfortable place I am living for one that is probably a little better, and possibly much better.  Part of me says that there is an opportunity for improvement and I should take it even if there is a little risk, and part of me says I shouldn't try and fix what isn't really broken, and that I should hold on to the place that is working out for me unless something comes up that is undeniably a big step up. I'd hate to move now and then have to consider moving again in 6 months or a year if something even better pops up.

Any advice on how to make my decision? I only have a few days to decide and I am currently really undecided. I hate to let a good housing opportunity go when there are so few around here, but I also hate to give up a good spot for the same reason.

TL;DR: Current house good, other house probably somewhat better. Go for it, or wait until a ""for sure much better"" comes along??",22Apr2020,1

My role is within a small company providing care which is governed by a regulatory body. I have essentially had a mental breakdown a few weeks ago and for the first time in my career was signed off. 

Going back, the role is horrendous. The boss always bypasses my decisions and runs unethical practices. For one, I told him I couldn't do appointments with vulnerable people because I'm not fit to do that at present (which is outlined in every code of ethics). I've now been asked to contact vulnerable people and have a ""chat"". I don't feel comfortable doing it, and I've already told him. 

I'm going to be pushed into doing it, as I have with things in the past.

445,"So I have recently became roommates with a bunch of students who all go to one of tHe top liberal arts colleges in my country. 

I initially really enjoyed being there since they would have interesting discussions about sociopolitical issues, religion, economics etc. which was absolutely not the kind of discussion that was prevalent in the rooms that I was in before. Everything that I learned about these topics were completely self taught on the internet when I was in school through social media and researching them. This wasn’t exactly encouraged at home or school. So obviously my knowledge is not as extensive and often times I don’t even know the basics. 

The course I’m studying is a technical one, and I didn’t really go to really great college. It was a wonder I even got into the one I did, given the circumstances I had at home. Most of the things my classmates were worried about was getting drunk, going out and college drama. 

The problem is, when I started taking a more active part in their discussions because I was beyond thrilled to be in these rooms and I wanted to learn more - there would be times when I would ask something which would seem really basic to them, since about these issues and often take part in protests etc - I would be asked with hostility “how do you not know this?” 

Yesterday I was watching a video and learned that a famous airlines had been bankrupted. I turned to my friend and asked her about this and she went all “how did you not know this?” She even lost her temper when I asked te difference between constitutional and fundamental rights. 

I agree there’s a lot of basics I’m missing, but I do try a lot to keep up, despite my education and life being on a completely different plane from this. I grew up in a different country and studied there for 6 years, so a lot of the basics they know about my native country has not been internalised the way these guys have it. 

But I can’t help but wonder if I am in the wrong? Should I be putting in more effort to know these things they do? I already spend a lot of my day going through the news (luckily I follow good sources and have developed enough critical thinking to discern) and keeping up because I’m interested. I don’t mind asking questions and being taught. 

But it gets on my nerves the way they say things condescendingly.

449,"English is not my first language. Sorry about any grammar mistakes

I (17M) had a discussion with my best friend (17F) about the monotony we've fell into, the way it affects us and the way I felt about this. For context, she stopped talking with me about her feelings and personal stuff a couple months ago, which had me feeling certainly weird because I just felt like everything was about me in our conversations.

I told her that I felt bad because of the way we had been doing things, that I never got to know how she felt and that it just made me feel bad overall, because I deserved to know at least how she is feeling in order to have a conversation, I just wanted her to be sincere, that's it, the way we had always been.

She then told me that she felt like it is worthless knowing how she feels and that her life isn't interesting at all, that I shouldn't mind about it, which made me feel worse, she continued with things like ""This is all happening because I've always been a bad friend, I'm not smart, I just thought it was okay and left it like that"".

I then told her that we are not getting any benefit from saying bad things about ourselves, and that we should talk more about us, that I am really interested in knowing how she feels and that it is a big deal for our friendship, as much as she is sometimes asking me about myself.

I asked her ""Can we work it to see if we can find any solution ?"" She replied telling me that if we don't feel like talking then we shouldn't do it, I told her that it wouldn't change anything about this but that it that was her decision then that would be the next thing to do.

We had a conversation a week later, which she basically ended by giving me short replies with no real meaning, I then answered and she left it there.

Fast-forward to today, we haven't talked in two weeks and the last conversation made me feel bad because of the lack of interest on her side, I feel relieved with all this but it is not proper to leave everything there, should I do something or should I wait for her to come up and eventually talk about us? 

TL;DR: Discussed with my best friend about our friendship and monotony between us, she then proposed not talking until we felt like it, talked with her a week later, got just short and meaningless responses, haven't talked in two weeks, am I ending everything with not doing something about it?",22Apr2020,1
450,"My girlfriend seems terrified of being alone and it seems to really be affecting her lately. I don’t know why, it’s a new thing because she hasn’t always been like this. But lately she wants me to be with her all the time (I don’t mind but I gotta work) and when I’m not she wants to facetime me. And sometimes I can’t ft so she calls god knows who to keep her company so she doesn’t have to be alone. She’s facetimed her ex boyfriend to occupy some of her time. She doesn’t want him back, she just HATES being alone now and I don’t get it. She recently reached out to an old friend that hurt her pretty badly just so someone can occupy her time when everyone else can’t. She hasn’t even been falling asleep in her own bedroom unless she’s on call or facetime with someone. I’m really concerned about her, she usually LOVES being alone so it’s a major change of pace. And when she is alone she listens to music super fucking loudly so she doesn’t feel it. How can I help her and why might she be acting this way? I’m not worried about her cheating (not thrilled about the ex), more so concerned with why she’s suddenly so afraid of being alone.",22Apr2020,1

452,"Today I had an argument with my husband - honestly it wasn’t a big or relevant fight, it was just being indoors together for too long. We were discussing some house stuff (he was pissed off but not at me) and he was raising his voice and talking down to me because he was getting worked up, I responded equally aggressively in defense and corrected him over something he misunderstood. He said I was speaking to him like he was a knob (I’m not sure he realized how aggressive he was coming off) and here we are. He’s stormed off to the study and I’m trying to take my mind off it in the living room. Trivial right?! 

Anyway everything on my newsfeed is jarring me, it all seems aggressive and angry (I follow aita, lnm, wcgw? Amongst others and what with all the protests going on right now too I’m just done being riled up!) It physically feels tight in my chest.

453,"For context, this specific friend is one I’m not super close to. We met in our younger years in elementary homeschool through a homeschooling group, and recently reconnected thanks to phone calls. After not having seen her in person for years (We’ll call her Gabby), Gabby and I plan to meet up for a lunch date (this was before Corona), to catch up. After all, we are young adults now and a lot has happened since we last met. We meet up at the location and the lunch starts off great, with some friendly banter, good eats and catching up with each other. 

Then, without even really thinking about it, I mention my boyfriend, and how he got me a gift for Valentine’s Day when no other boyfriend I’ve had before then got me one. It’s a pretty watch with charms, and me and Gabby started talking about boys before I let it slip that he’s trans. He used to be a she when we met but now is a he and I totally still love him and I don’t care what he identifies as. 

Well, Gabby’s face slowly scrunches up and I immediately regret revealing that he’s trans, cause I know what’s coming next. Gabby starts telling me that my ‘girlfriend’ (totally misgendering him on purpose) has a mental illness and isn’t right in the head, not even trying to be nice or hide that she doesn’t like trans-people. She comes from a Christian conservative home so I should have known she would react like this but she didn’t even try to hide it which was what shocked me. 

I defended him a bit, mentioning how he’s one of the best men I’ve ever met and that she doesn’t know him, but I soon realize that is going nowhere so I change the conversation topic and the tension slowly goes away, but overall my opinion of her dropped drastically after that lunch. It’s been about a month since then and she occasionally texts me asking to have a phone call with me but I always find an excuse not to have one. It’s clear she won’t quietly go out of my life, so I need help. 

I’m usually a very reasonable person and I am fine with people having differences in opinions, but with how I have so many trans-friends and even my boyfriend going through mental troubles cause of people like her being so mean about their struggles, I can’t have her as a friend in my life anymore and be comfortable with it, that goes against what I believe. 

TL;DR: How do I get her out of my life without being a total prick about it? I just can’t have her in my life, not after that awkward shit and with how many trans-friends I have. 

P.S. don’t turn this into a conversation over if being trans is fine or not, I’m just concerned with removing her from my life and giving her the message that I don’t wanna be friends with her anymore.",22Apr2020,1

We're very much on the same wavelength. Similar senses of humor, obviously both into video games, etc. We already know a decent amount about each other through conversation, but the next ""big leap"" to make (at least to me) is seeing how similar our religious/political views are. I have no idea if she's on the same page as me in this regard, since neither of us have brought either up in the slightest yet. But these things are pretty important to me, as I assume they are with most people.

Maybe I'm a bit desperate but I like to think that I'm a good judge of character and he's really sweet, plus he actually seems to enjoy talking to me, and I'm pretty sure we're roughly the same maturity level. The age of consent where I live is 16 but we live over 2000 miles away from each other so it'd literally be impossible to do anything sexual in the first place. I'm thinking of maybe refraining from telling him how old I am or initiating anything until I'm at least 14 (if we ever were to meet irl and do anything it'd be legal because of the close-in-age exception law), but there's still a flaw in this plan because I'm worried that in half a year we won't be close anymore, and I'm also worried the both of us will face judgement because of it. This is just assuming he'd want to have a romamntic relationship with me, but I don't know. Would normal people call someone they only like platonically 'hotstuff' and 'cute', speak to them late into the night every single day, text them in particular when anxious or stressed, and give them cute nicknames? In the same conversation?

My mother has always been a bit nuts, and she kicked me out when I was 17. I moved in with my boyfriend (now fiance) and since we have moved away. My mother signed the papers for my younger sister (just turned 16 at the time) too get married and she left, leaving my younger brother by himself with my mother and her abusive boyfriend. 

Long story short, me, my fiance, and mother in law worked together with my brothers dad too get a power of attorney too keep my mom away from my brother. This was easy, as she had already signed one giving me power of attorney over him because she quit her job and her boyfriend refused to hold a job, so they had nowhere too live.  She also was talking about running away too join the circus. It got too the point they were living off of my disabled grandmother and great grandparents, who have alzheimers. I could go on about how bad it was.

Hes been with us about a year now, and the agreement with his dad was that he would finish the school year with us, then go back too him. A couple of months ago, my brother talked too him, and he agreed he could stay with us indefinitely, because it's what my brother wanted. He talked too him again last week, and has apparently changed his mind, saying he wants him back. His dad seems like a good guy, who has gotten his stuff together since him and my mother were together. He has 2 other kids, is 3 years sober, and has a good steady job and he owns a house. The advice I need here is, my mother in law is insisting my brother stays. I love my brother too death, but me and my fiance agree we are in no way fit too raise a child, much less a teenager. How do I get it through too her that I want too give his dad a chance?

461,"i’m gonna try to summurize it as much as possible. 

I have a best friend that i’ve known since 6th grade (10th grade now). We have this connection where we’d complete each other sentences &amp; we trust each other with everything. It’s awesome. Recently me &amp; her got into an argument &amp; that slowly killed our friendship (later we fixed it tho) . &amp; also she had a new phone &amp; started texted me 24/7. But recently since the quarantine, she hasn’t been reaching out to me. It started of with her not texting me a lot which is fine. &amp; my other friend started noticing she’d leave her on delivered 

One time my other friend texted her saying that she’s been trying to talk to her all day &amp; she left her on seen &amp; later came back &amp; said that texted is hard/draining. I understood but what hurt is that i had a family problem &amp; went to her &amp; left me on delivered yk?

Later on, she’d wouldn’t even open my streaks but post on her story. Today i did the same thing for a few hours &amp; she didn’t even check my story. Before i thought she was giving the same treatment with everyone until she posted on her private story saying « i’m so bad with texts, a good friend of mine was calling me &amp; i was sooooo dry » at first i shrugged it off but later on it hit me. We rarely call because we always send audio messages which is fine (i don’t like calling because they’re awkward silence) but like she couldn’t even open my messages yk? That gets me so pissed. &amp; i sent her a même &amp; she didn’t even open it. 

I can’t be mad because she did mention how she prefers either calling or texting. But i’m scared she’s calling my crush. I know she won’t do anything with him but it’s like whyyy yk?  So yes hope i could get everyone’s opinion on this.

462,"Very recently, and to keep it simple, I had a small friend group that was me and my gf, (18m and 19f) as well as our friend of four years (18m) and his gf (18f). Recently, our friend and his gf broke up. We found out it was due to him violating multiple relationship boundaries, messaging other girls online through Snapchat, reddit, and discord, and incredibly questionable posts to r*pe-fetish subreddits that were graphic enough to make us feel sick. Not only that, but before he actually got a gf, he had used images of girls from Instagram against their consent to pretend he had girlfriends, which we interpreted as incredibly creepy. 

We promptly blocked him on everything and ceased contact. We are still in daily contact with his now ex girlfriend. However, I’ve known him for four years and he was one of my closest friends.

465,"TL;DR is the title.

This problem happens to me in my studies, exercise and when I'm learning to play a competitive multiplayer video game. I can't even get myself to start reading books.

I like computer science and programming. Since I'm not in uni or in school now, I was planning to do some online courses. I started one and got stuck at a particularly difficult problem. I attempted it again and again for hours and just gave up. I looked up the solution online and tried to learn it instead. I took the easy way out. The person who had the solution had tried it for a week and I gave up in a matter of a few hours. 

In school too. I was never the smartest in class. My marks would be around 70/100 but everyone else was at 90+. No matter how much I told myself to focus to study, I never could. 

For gaming, it's really hard for me to start playing a new multiplayer game. At first, I truly suck at it and then, I look up numerous videos on how to improve. And that's it. I never touch the game again. In my head, it's like I just can't put myself through a task like this. I always wish that if only improvement could come instantly and not take months or weeks of practice. I hate that. It has stopped me from playing many games like R6 Siege, Rocket League, DotA 2, CSGO. They are complicated games that require game sense and skill. Things that take 100s or even 1000s hours of game time to acquire and develop. I wish I could enjoy these games again and not drop them after 7-8 hrs because ""omg so much learning I hate this"".

For exercising too. I will check my weight, feel like crap, exercise with all my might for one day. Check my weight the next day. Feel bad that it didn't go down. Same problem. If it's not not instant rewards, I'm not happy. If it takes a month to lose 1kg, it's just not worth it...

Lastly, books. I'm not a reader. Not even comics. I have Stephen Kings IT and reading it feels like such a task. I just can't. My sister tells me it's too high leveled for a beginner reader like me so I should start gradually. That's something I clearly can't do.

I've realised these problems with myself and I have no idea how to change this. I keep telling myself that I need to be determined to it but internally, I'm just not feeling it. I don't even what may have caused this sudden change in mindset. Need some real advice so I can change myself before I screw up my life.",22Apr2020,1

Their tasks are quite easy to do compared to mine, but they always end up doing it half-assed and just expect me to fix it. I've already spoon fed them everything. I gave them specific steps, examples, and answered all their questions so that they can do it properly. But they still do it half assed and I always fix it so we dont fail. 

They were cooperative at first but as we were going deeper in our research they stopped reading our group texts and replying late. Heck, even one of my groupmates bailed out on us. She just stopped seeing our chats, does not respond to our texts, and didnt do anything since chapter 1 and now our research is almost over. But what really hurts me is that my other 2 remaining groupmates are also starting leave and let me do all the work. They are ingoring my texts. I even asked for help and they didnt care at all. 

I know that I can just tell our professor but I dont want drama and that would sacrifice our friendship.

474,"Hello Everyone,

I’ve never really used this app before but I can’t really go to anyone for this and I need some advice. I’ve been dating a girl for about 3 years now and she is my first ever girlfriend. In the beginning of our relationship it was really rough and I should’ve seen the red flags in the beginning but I was in the honey moon stage. She’d always message guys and there was one guy she’d always talk to in class and she claimed that was her friend. She’d always post videos on her snapchat story of her and him and be flirtatious. When I would confront her on it she’d say it was just her friend but it would always bother me. They stopped talking out of no where and my suspicion grew bigger to a point where I think something may have happened between them. At this point it’s been about a year into our relationship and there was a day where she invited me to hangout with her and her cousins. I remember this day like it was yesterday, I already knew one of her cousins but she had brought along another and the minute I seen her there was this really strange and strong connection with her. I’m not one for love at first sight or even one to fall for looks I’ve been approached by many beautiful girls who a lot of guys actually try to talk to even asked me if I can introduce them even though they had tried asking me out but they just didn't feel right. I’ve never felt like this towards anyone and every time I’m around her it feels right and my mood changes. For many months it only felt like that when I was in the same room as her but now it’s to a point where I can’t stop thinking about her no matter how hard I try to stop. I’ve tried everything like new hobbies, going out, talking to a lot of friends you name it I’ve probably tried it and it doesn’t work. I know how it may sound but in places where she’s there I try to avoid her when she says hi I say hi only, when she tries talking to me I give short answers. Even times when I feel her looking at me and I try to use my phone so I don’t stare back. Im just to a point where I know I can't have her and as much as I try to take my mind off it she's there. It really feels like I'm living in one of those movies because now I know exactly how the guys feel except in movies he gets the girl. Anyways I'd like to know what you guys think given if you were in my situation do you think this feeling will pass over through time?",22Apr2020,1
475,"Obviously this is a throwaway account. Looking for advice or any similar experiences. I have been with my boyfriend a few years and we have a house together. In that sense we are very committed. We sometimes argue and in no sense are perfect but generally we are very close have a lot of fun and there's a lot of love there.
The main cause of arguments we have had are themes of dishonesty from him. He's admitted that he thinks he has a bit of a problem with lying after I have caught him out on some things - generally speaking nothing major (no cheating etc). The problem is that I HATE lying and dishonesty and it damages the whole relationship. On more than one occasion he has promised to be open and honest with me - and there had been improvement - but there's still been some issues.
Most recently it's a Biggie. At some point in our relationship we both agreed (led by him not by me) to not watch porn. I would regularly watch in past and he said he would occasionally and somehow it was agreed that we would focus on our relationship (which is very active and healthy) rather than pornography. 
Yesterday my phone died and I jumped on his phone to Google something. In the browser history there was not only porn, but some really really vile abnormal stuff. 
He has been watching porn that mainly involves poo and other such things. Extreme fetish stuff. Again, we have a very healthy sexual relationship and I had thought we had shared all sides of ourselves. I've even found that he consumes gay porn (and has previously claimed to not at all be interested in men -i'm bi and he knows-). 
I'm first of all mortified by the content - it baffles me why someone would want to watch that. He has since admitted it has been a regular part of his adult life. 
Second, it's the lies and dishonesty surrounding it. As I said he's hidden other stuff before too. the not watching porn thing was mostly his idea and he was the one to break it (on more than one occasion) while lying to me and saying he didn't (fyi ""normal"" porn in healthy quantities would not be a deal breaker here as I understand it's fantasy and I have done it myself etc) 
It just feels like this whole other person I don't know. How has he lived in the same house with me doing this and lying in this way, doing it while I was in the next room and then kissing me and acting normal afterwards
Sorry for the word vomit but I'm honestly so lost and desperate. I had put my whole life into this relationship and I don't know if I can even tolerate him touching me ever again. Do I leave?",22Apr2020,1
476,"Idk how this reddit things really works I guess I just need a platform to get this off my chest. I guess I just really had a hard time in elementary school getting friends well at least real friends you know I used to want to fit in so bad I would try to make friends and be friends with a lot of people but I guess that was just my way of not feeling alone, I actually remember certain times I would go up to random kids and ask them “hey do you want to be friends” then a little later we would end up never talking and I guess that made me feel like I had little worth and such and such I guess to feel like I fit in but no matter what I always felt like a misfit or I wasn’t good enough for this or for that. I mean some kids back then really didn’t like me or thought I was weird or just didn’t want to associate with me unless it benefited them point blank and period and sure this doesn’t go for everyone I had a few real friends from back then who I am still friends with today. But as of recent I feel like I have been scarred due to this terrible elementary school experience because once I made it to 7th grade I completely started to change I had started dressing different talking different changed my mindset so and so and then I started getting in a lot better with people and started talking to a lot more people I started smoking weed and doing a whole bunch of other stuff So fast forward to now I am a junior and I’m starting to realize maybe elementary school did have an effect on me and this might be the reason for my sudden change because whenever I think back about those moments I just feel hurt. I just guess I feel like I sold out and I don’t know who I am anymore what I should do if I have worth and such and such. So now I’m at a loss for what to do I am starting to try to get closer to God and fix this hole I have (P.S. sorry I’m not really good at expressing myself if that was a bit confusing )",22Apr2020,1

483,"So in a couple days my precious dog will be put to sleep after having a couple of painful weeks. It’s incredibly hard to process since he has been with me since I was little until my adulthood. He has been the perfect dog anyone could ask for, seriously. I don’t think any other dog will match up with him. He never bit anyone, was never aggressive, was playful, silly, sweet and he has been in my life for every important event. 

It’s very weird to think that he won’t be in my life anymore. Even though he doesn’t live with me anymore as he is our family dog, I felt incredibly sad when I heard the news. He seriously is the perfect angel. But he is in pain, and we can’t let him live on like this. 

My question is, do you regret not being in the room saying goodbye to your dog when they put them down? Or did you find peace being in the room with them? 

I’m just worried I will find it very strange and uncomfortable seeing him pass away, but at the same time I want to be there for him and hold him while he takes his last breath. I don’t want him to be alone (even though my other family will be with him). I’m just very worried it will be very difficult seeing him like that. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.",22Apr2020,1

486,"I'm a 33-year-old woman who spent a good number of years homeless (over 5) before I moved back in with my parents when I became pregnant in the summer of 2016. I ended up having my baby on St Patrick's day of 2017. Up until he was born, I went through a lengthy decision-making process about whether or not I should keep him and raise him. At the time, I wasn't really sure at all and was going back and forth repetitively, thinking about whether or not I wanted to give up my previous life for the massive responsibility that is taking care of a child.

Fast forward 3 years. It's now 2020. I gave my child to a family to raise. They're nice enough and they take great care of him and he's happy. They're about 400 mi away. And I do end up seeing him about once a year. Which in my opinion is not enough at all, but I have no control over that so I have to make do. 

I'm very depressed about the whole thing and I have nobody to blame. I chose my previous existence over raising my son and I regret it every day. I'm depressed and think constantly about whether or not I will ever have another child. I feel like staying at my parents house is limiting me from doing that. It's limiting me from doing a lot of things that I would normally do if I had my own place.

The only thing is, I feel broken in a way from all of the troubles I've been through. And I don't really want to leave my parents house because I don't want to end up homeless again. Even though I thought I really enjoyed that life, I never really want to go back to it. I was on drugs and very close to death. I also really don't want to spend rent money. I've been saving up quite a bit and don't want to blow all my monthly earnings on a place to stay when I don't have to.

Part of me really wants to leave, but my parents do benefit from having me here on some level. I take care of things like cleaning and other tasks that they have trouble with. They are in their '70s.

A present time I just feel stuck. I don't know if I should stay or go, and I can't seem to muster up the motivation to leave. Part of me wonders if I'll ever have a family of my own. It's very angst inducing.. It's on my mind constantly. I feel like I missed out on my chance to have my own little family and I beat myself up constantly for it. Sometimes I wonder what will happen in my later years, now that I have no kid. Nobody to take care of really. And it scares me. I think of suicide often. Not that I'm thinking I'm going to do it very soon but I do think about it everyday.

I don't really know what to do which is why I'm posting here. I know I'm supposed to go get counseling. I'm looking for other insights as well.",22Apr2020,1

490," 

My son ""Dan"" (23 M) is a great young man - handsome, smart, witty. He's never had any issues getting girlfriends in the past and has always been very popular with women, which makes this all the more mind boggling.

At the start of February, my family (myself, husband, Dan, and my daughter) attended a family wedding. It was a lovely night and Dan met a girl there named ""Rebecca."" (20 F) I noticed them having a drink and dancing much of the night, which I thought was cute at first until I realized who Rebecca is.

So my sister (Dan's aunt) is married to this man, Chris. Chris has a brother named Rob. Rob's daughter is Rebecca.

I've never met Rebecca before, only seen the odd picture, so I didn't realize it straight away until my sister pointed it out to me that Dan and Rebecca seemed to be hitting it off.

I didn't say anything at the wedding because I didn't want to embarrass them, but I'm sure everyone else there was thinking about how disgusting and inappropriate their behavior was and it definitely made me uncomfortable.

Since then I've been keeping tabs on it, and apparently Dan and Rebecca have been texting. Because of lockdown, they haven't been able to meet up in person, but they seem to be making plans to for the future. I've mentioned a few times how weird/gross the situation is but Dan just laughs at me. It's getting to a point where I think I'm going to need to put my foot down, which I normally hate doing but I think is necessary given the circumstances.

We come from a ""normal"" family, up north, we're all well educated, incest is NOT a normal thing in our part of the world and I am sick about the whole situation. I don't think Dan understands the societal ramifications of marrying your cousin - how people will look at you, what they think, the stigma, the difficulties their children would have, not to mention your own parents not approving.

Has anyone been in this situation before? Do you have any advice for how to have this conversation with him and put a stop to it without seeming overbearing?

tl;dr: My son wants to date his cousin and I obviously don't approve. I don't know how to handle this.",22Apr2020,1

when he didnt answer she called his phone not even 5 seconds later, said ""omg next time answer my ft call that was so rude"". (She was with her best friend atm)  2nd time she called him at 11pm. (Idk why you would ft a guy with a gf at 11pm? Like what other intentions would you have) Also she was tweeting the day before how she was lonely and wanted attention... 
3rd time was a couple days ago he didnt answer so her best friend texted him in their group chat asking him if he wanted to go get lunch with her and her best friend, just the 3 of them... (during a stay at home order? I...) anyway he declined and that's that for now.

Now to be clear I dont mind him having friends that are girls he can text them all he wants idc and I appreciate the fact that he doesn't give her the time of day and let's me know when she ft him, but also his coworker knows about me, he tells her about me all the time, so it's not like she has a crush and doesnt know he has a gf.

I tried to let him know how it would feel if the roles were reversed bc I know he would be really upset but he still wont do anything. My friends think I should be more forward and message her but I dont like confrontation lol. Told him she'll keep calling if he doesnt say anything. He got annoyed, told me I stress him out and I said its bc of the situation she caused and he said no its because of you. Idk what to do I dont drag on the convo for days and argue with him about it, I just talk to him when it actually happens the day he tells me.

The next step would be them checking if I am good enough to attend the entrance exam. I don't want to bother them with a new e-mail but at the same time I wan't to fix the mistake.",22Apr2020,1

518,"Hello,

Unsure if this is the isolation talking or if I do genuinely think its the right time to get a dog. 

I live in a flat, but right across the street from a large park so although the flat only has a small yard out back it would be easy to just pop across the road with the dog. I also work as a nurse, but I'm planning on going back to uni in September for another five years. My sister is planning on moving in for summer so she could help look after the dog whilst i'm at work and then come September I'm hoping I can leave the dog for 4/5 hours a day whilst i'm at uni, and then I work on the weekend ill hire a dog walker to take the dog out. 

I keep talking myself out the idea but then coming back to it. Although I said I would hold off for another few years I', still finding myself texting adverts for labradors. Anyone got any solid advice on how to either stop texting people or how feasible it is to have a dog in an urban flat?

519,"So, my dad paints cars for a living and last week, this guy who is basically my dad's apprentice went home not feeling well.

Every other employee has been touching tools and surfaces for the last week and there's a good chance somebody else has the virus and just isn't showing symptoms yet. The employees that might be sick are just going to start infecting every surface again no matter how many times they disinfect the shop.

521,"I was a quiet kid at school before especially in kindergarten. I didn't have friends but I never felt lonely even once. I mostly did things on my own and I was more than okay with that. Although I did play with kids from my class from time to time, I didn't feel the need to have a friend.

But one time during first grade, my sister and her friends (who I was acquaintances with and I usually also play with them) made fun of me. I can't really remember what exactly happened but things just happened and I was crying a lot at that time. I was crying in front of them and they didn't seem to care. That's when I started feeling lonely and I started seeking friendship.

And then I started to have a lot of friends at school. During that time, my brother would often tell us stories about their rebellious adventures at school and how they were cool and all that, and that started to rub off on me. My friends before weren't popular and rebellious, and I started to feel ashamed of them. I aspired to become like my brother, cool and laid back. I was successful for a few years, until I decided it wasn't for me.

I've had ""friends"" from the popular clique, but they're not really nice people. One of my ""friends"" claimed herself as the leader of our friend group and that honestly put me off. It made me feel like I was just a pawn, plus they were sometimes toxic. So I left them for good. I settled with my new friends and we don't belong in the popular clique, but I am more than thankful for them. They're supportive and when you have a trait that isn't all too good, they'd point it out for you to fix them. They're also a whole lot more mature than people our age honestly, and it's a good thing that they can point out their bad traits and try to fix that. They hate pointless drama and I've never been more thankful for them.

But my siblings never fail to make me feel like such a loser. My sister and my brother has friends that belong to the popular group and they'd share stories of the ""cool"" things they did at school. I have also done fun things at school but I would just keep it to myself because I don't really share much about myself to them. While they were busy talking about how cool and popular they are, I just keep silent. Then they'd ask me what are the cool things I've done in school, but I'd just shrug the question off because I don't see the point of showing how ""cool"" I am. And whenever I shrug them off, they'd tell me that I'm a loser with no friends and that I'm a loner and all that.

There was also this one group on Facebook that all the popular people from school are members of. I haven't heard of it because I'm inactive on social media, and I probably only open my Facebook every once in a while. My brother asked me if I was a member of that group and I said that I wasn't. He laughed at me and called me a loser. It honestly made me so mad but I couldn't show my frustration because I'm not open with my feelings towards my family.

And I've been reading a lot of books these days and I just purchased a Kindle and I was so excited to have it delivered. My brother asked me what I was so excited about, so I explained that I got a Kindle. He called me a loser and a nerd. I know it's normal between siblings to tease each other, but this had gotten to the point where I'm dwelling on my siblings's words. I usually just stay in my room to read and their words are eating at me again and after purchasing a Kindle, I'm starting to believe their words. While reading a book I'm thinking that maybe I'm actually a loser. That I'm a loner and that I will never be as cool as them. I know it's very irrational to think like this, but I actually think that I'm going to be lonely and will be labeled as a loser for my entire life. I do have friends and they're great, but my siblings's words are getting my self-esteem down and I do not know what to do.

I'm just going to say straight away that I'm looking for comfort and consolation. I feel so alone and useless. I'm thankful for my friends being there for me, but I can't really just take their advice and not believe what my siblings say about me. I know I shouldn't believe them, but it's hard not to. I also can't open up to my parents about it. We're not a very emotional family and when we have problems, we usually just keep it to ourselves. My dad is emotionally closed off so asking for advice from him wouldn't help. I've never really had meaningful conversations with my dad. We probably only talk about school, physical health, and the news. Nothing emotional. I also don't want to talk about it with my siblings because we all hate talking about sappy emotional problems. 

I'm very sorry for this long post. I just had a lot on my mind and this has been eating me up for a long time.",22Apr2020,1
522,"I'm relatively new at my workplace and there is another woman who just started. She latched onto me rather quickly as I was the ""new girl"" before she started. I was happy to be her work friend as those can really help your work experience, little did I know girl is straight up a conversation manipulator and she feeds off of attention and pity. 

Because of Covid a handful of us were furloughed, myself and her included. Fortunately, we have been invited back and have returned to our jobs. We had to return to the physical office to pick up our company phone and laptop. There were three of us and our boss. It's a rather eerie environment as no one feels safe or confident at this time. My coworker can't read the room and loudly proclaims ""I was happy to hear good news. I needed it. My uncle is now in the hospital."" 

I say nothing. A small gap of silence. In my head I beg that no one entertain her, but alas my boss says something along  the lines of ""that's too bad."" And that was enough, she then takes this as an invitation to discuss her family's ailments and how so many of them are in the hospital and how things are just a mess right now. It's almost as if she's talking to herself, as we're all frustrated with our current situations.

528,"So (very) long story short, I’m pregnant at 24 before my career is entirely stable. I graduated from uni abroad in 2018 and have been working since. But still hopping around a bit trying to find what fits me best. I’m in a lovely relationship with the father (29M) of the child and we have plans to get married soon after baby is born. I hadn’t moved out of parents’ house yet by the time I became pregnant, but only because they resisted my moving out when I wanted to early in 2019. 

My parents (50s M &amp; F) are extremely disappointed about me being pregnant. My dad has said on several occasions that it’s like taking money to a bank and investing and investing then ending up with no returns. They’ve pressured me out of living with my SO till we get married. But while I’m here, they keep reiterating their disappointment and I’m starting to feel like nothing will become of me because I’m having a kid a little younger than planned. It gets me down a lot and I’m feeling really hopeless about my future even though SO and I have really ambitious plans about our lives and he really pushes me to become what I want to be.

How do you deal with this disappointment? My sister (25F) keeps telling me they have a right to be and I have to take it because it’s my fault we are where we are anyway. So I can’t complain. What can I do to stay positive? Especially for my daughter? Anyone else with similar experiences?

531,"I feel like I may have made a huge mistake living how I do. What triggered my unease?

* Our upstairs neighbor, who is a lovely early 30s woman, offered to help us financially during the pandemic. I have zero question in my mind that her offer was well meaning, but based on our jobs, I probably out earn her by a lot. We have no debt and a lot of savings for a condo downpayment and an emergency fund. I suspect she assumed we were poor based on how our apartment looks. 
* Some of my family has been on my case for years about how I live in a crappy place when other people my age moved to the suburbs and bought houses, which I could afford. That I shouldn’t be spending my money on travel and experiences, because that could all be going to improving my home conditions. I never heeded them, telling them I loved living in the city, having events and friends at my doorstep and not having to battle traffic on a car commute. I liked walking to the bus and taking in the city. 
* Everyone’s on Zoom and FaceTime and I’m realizing everyone has nicer places than me, except some of my closer friends who live in the city. I am worried I was blinded to how I was living because I was never home, so my environment just didn’t matter. I’m grappling with the fact that I’m turning 40 in a few months and my city friends and I are living like college students, and maybe that was a huge mistake. 

It's not just baseless envy. I see these people have built something, and it feels like I made a mistake. I’m in a tiny rental, so I have nothing to do except work and find ways to waste time. They’re out there doing home improvements, decorating their places, fixing up their yards, sorting through stuff and improving their environment. 

What’s adding to this is that I was supposed to do IVF in March, and I could be using this downtime to be building a baby, but all infertility clinics have canceled IVF for probably months. I can try to do more of the same treatments, but this morning the doctor told me there's a really minuscule chance it will work. This would be the perfect time to be pregnant and knocked off my A game since my work is so demanding. I've ""gained"" like 3-4 hours in my day due to not having to get ready for and commuting to work, and I can't use the time to grow a kid. 

I don’t have enough to do and I’m crawling out of my skin. Working 50 hours a week and working out only uses a small amount of my energy. I can try to zone out, read, write, talk with friends, Netflix, but it’s just filling time. If work shuts down I'll lose my mind completely. I'm trying to keep perspective by thinking about how others have it worse, but I'm struggling.

532,"I apologize if this is long but it is a breakdown of who I am and my situation. I have been married for nearly 8 years, before that I was a bit of a wanderer. Due to a screwed up situation I never graduated from high school (I got a GED). I eventually joined the Navy and planned on being a lifer. I unfortunately got injured after a very short time and was med out. I fell hard into a bottle and was completely lost. My mom helped me out of that funk and shortly after I was homeless for 5 years traveling 48 states and 3 countries a few years before I settled down. Eventually I felt beyond alone so I stumbled into a marriage. I started working in security but due to the low pay and lack of advancements in my area I never stuck with one company too long. I eventually got up to decent pay and great hours but my wife broke her leg and I was forced to quit since we had to move. She wasn't able to work so we lost a lot of financial stability. When we got back to our hometown I was back to low pay jobs due to the cities economy. I went from 16.00 an hour to 9.00 an hour. After months of barely surviving I made the decision with my wife to quit and move to Chicago. I was going to be moving alone and once I had a job/apartment she would come out with our kids (We have 2 young children) I put my 2 weeks notice in and bought a ticket. Everything was looking up until I got to the airport. I was experiencing severe stomach pain and I blacked out. When I came too, I was at the hospital. They had diagnosed me with food poisoning and advised that I rest and not fly right away. I was than released. Unfortunately I had to purchase a Greyhound ticket back to my small town which was more expensive than the flight. After a couple weeks at home and still in severe pain, my symptoms got worse. I was having difficulty breathing and was mildly jaundice. My wife rushed me to the ER. I was than told my gallbladder was severely infected and I had multiple stones. I was than drove back to the big city by ambulance. I had my gallbladder surgery but it was worse than the doctor expected . Normally its a quick recovery but for me it took weeks. I eventually recovered and was a little distressed on what to do next. I was not wanting to do security because in my small town it is high risk with low pay and options were highly limited. I was about to go back to my former boss and request my job back when this Covid crisis happened. Now my city is shutdown and I have a lot of time to think. I never learned any skills growing up, I am unable to do a lot of heavy labor due to arthritis and a bad back, and I am not highly educated. I have considered going to college but have been burned by a college before so I am highly nervous. I just know I need to find a career ASAP due to me being 33 and having a family to take care of.

I have no friends, no SO...no one. 

I hate browsing social media see all these (pre-quarantine) posts of people together having fun. I always feel extremely envious, I just want that life so bad. I dont even want to be popular or anything, just a couple really solid friends but I cant have that. I've tried
 I've been trying for years to be good to people and make friends but they always end up disliking me, I've changed my approach many times, researched the hell out of social interaction and what not and it never works, people just dont like me for some odd, unknown reason.

535,"Background: 24 year old female. Mother was the bread winner/head of house &amp; always working. Moved every year since age 17 to a different state. 

I feel as though I’m skating on the surface through life. I feel like I have to ignore my instincts as a human, and specifically as a female, in order to be “successful” in life. Not the life or death, fight or flight instincts-I intend to never ignore those. I’m more so referring to the instincts that guide our natural desires and sense of well-being. Instincts are meant to help us survive but I’m ignoring mine as a means to survive in this modern day society in order to “live”. “Live” with a decent job, multiple degrees, a comfortable amount of money, etc. 

But I don’t feel like I’m living at all. In fact, I hate life. It is not fun. I have accomplished so much for my age and people tell me it all of the time. I’m known as an independent, intelligent, risk-taker, bull-headed individual/woman. 

But I’ve never felt more alone and unhappy. 

I’ve moved year after year chasing opportunities for school and work. I’ve lost so many friends and relationships to where I essentially have no one now. But I’ll be successful right? So it’s worth it? 

I’ve been taught, bombarded really, my whole life to pursue a career and be an independent individual first, and then to pursue relationships. If there’s every an ultimatum between a person or a career opportunity, choose the career. Because it’s better for the long-term outcomes. Right? 

Recently I have met someone who has really made me question this.

I feel the most happy when I make a dinner for my boyfriend. I feel so wholesome when I rub his back and lay down with him. And I feel like I would be okay with just that. If anyone personally knows me and my reputation, those facts about me would make no sense to them. I love being soft. I love the contrast of a man to a woman and how much they can potentially compliment each other. (No disrespect to other sexuality’s, I love everyone, that’s just mine) 

But maybe the grass is always greener? If I were a  woman with no rights, maybe I would long for a career and the years of work it took to get there? It’s not just specific to women. I’m not a man, but I imagine men have to make decisions between work and relationships/friendships as well. 

I understand everyone is different. I understand not all women have the same feelings about making their man dinner. I really don’t want to bring sexism into this at all but that’s my reality. I love making a house into a home. But I’ve been led to believe for so many years that that’s “weak” and not a financially good decision. 

All I know is that I’ve cut off so many people and cut off relationships with plenty of potential by always being in the mindset of living 6 months ahead. “I’m moving soon for this next opportunity, therefore I can’t invest into this person.” 

Obviously, society now looks a lot different than it did thousands of years ago. The concept of marriage has changed and evolved completely. People are moving locations more and America especially, is encouraged to be extremely individualistic. Used to, people stayed in their villages and married to reproduce and survive. Now, along with sharing financial burdens, the purpose of marriage is to find the perfect soulmate. Humans are still the same at the core in my opinion. Some are just more in tune with it than others maybe. There is so much “fluff” in today’s society to cover it up though. 

I’m not sure how much sense this made because everything in my brain is connected. But thank you for reading if you did.",22Apr2020,1
537,"TL;DR: I still have feelings for my ex even though she'd rather be friends. I want to get over these feelings so I can just have a normal friendship with this person

I'm a 21 year old dude that entered his first relationship with someone last year. We hit it off fine at first, but I became really awkward, anxious and clingy. It was the first time I let myself have any romantic feelings for another person and I let my emotions go overboard. I wrote her a love letter after the second date; I was absolutely smitten. I gave her plenty of red flags for her to justifiably break up with me, so when she eventually did I wasn't exactly shaken to the core. She let me down easy, but I almost wish she didn't?

Despite my childish behavior, she never talked down to me or reacted strongly. She understood that it was my first attempt at a relationship and gave me a rundown of what she found off-putting and why she didn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore. Then she said that we could be friends.

At that moment I went, ""I don't see why not. I don't want to be with someone that doesn't want to be with me. If my feelings can't be reciprocated, then I'm not gonna be interested in you that way anymore and we can be friends.""

I apologized for how I conducted myself and she was, again, really chill and understanding. I was naturally depressed afterwards but somewhat relieved it was over and done. I sincerely believed that I could flip that switch and be friends instead because I thought it was reasonable. It only lasted a couple months, it wasn't a huge deal, some relationships don't work out, it doesn't mean we can't be friends, yadda yadda yadda. But ever since that night she broke up with me, I have never stopped thinking about her.

It's been almost 5 months, and she still occupies every other thought I have throughout the day. I lose sleep at night thinking about what I could have done differently. Maybe it's because I've never been through this sort of thing so I have no idea how to move on, but I know it's irrational and unhealthy to harbor these feelings for someone who doesn't feel the same way back. 

After Covid-19 entered the picture we've interacted a lot more. She asked me to hang out and help her buy groceries because she's stuck at home all day and just wants to go out and do something. I try not to read too deep into any of her invitations to go out, but when I go with her and we hit it off like the good ol times it's hard not to think, ""could there be hope? Could she ever like me again? Will she see how I've learned from my mistakes and matured? Even if it's a long way from now, could I re-awaken something by spending time with her?"" 

I'm disappointed in myself for having these thoughts and that I can't move on. I've become really self conscious. The little confidence I had has plummeted even further. I miss her so much, but what exactly do I miss from her that I can't experience with someone else later in life? I guess I've lived a very privileged life to be so torn up by this. I don't want to completely break it off with her. I just want to be friends with this person and not see them with rose tinted glasses anymore.

538,"I left my city (nyc) because my parents have a much more comfortable large house near the forest, pretty much ideal. My boyfriend of 1.5 years, who I don’t live with, stayed in the city. He has visited our house to sit (socially distant) in our yard a few times but otherwise I haven’t seen him in a month. I’m having a really hard time with the distance and feel like it’s killing our relationship. My options as I see them:

1. Stay with my family and continue long distance for months and months, maybe not see him for an unspecified amount of time which will lead to a break up. 
2. Go back to the city and go between my apartment and his. The issue is that he’s expressed concerns about moving in together if I come back, but I feel like staying permanently at one place is safer. In this case I’d have to walk about 20 minutes to his apartment from mine and go in the elevator in my apartment. I also wouldn’t be able to come back to my family if I go back to the city. 
3. Somehow force him to let me move in which he doesn’t want and wouldn’t be comfortable. It’s a tiny city apartment with no windows really and there wouldn’t be a place for me to take calls. But we’d be together and a bit safer. 

What should I do? On one hand, it’s more comfortable and safe here for me, but it might hurt the relationship. On the other, a lot of couples go to and from someone’s place, and we both live alone so that would be our only trip outside in the city.

Hey everyone. I am scheduled to start a new job in a new state 1,500 miles away mid-June, meaning I am scheduled to move cross-country at the end of May. The first week in March - right before all the COVID-19 closures began here - we found a new place, signed a new lease, and informed our current apartment leasing office that we’d be moving out May 26th. My new job is at a university and will most likely be remote through the summer, so I have been assured that my start date will not be impacted, for which I am thankful because my current job end date is not negotiable (my employment is linked to enrollment in my graduate program, and I’m graduating). 

I feel very anxious and irresponsible about planning a cross-country move a month from now. We are not planning to use movers; we are renting a trailer and driving ourselves, but it is a 20 hour drive and will require us to stop for the night in a hotel at least once. Furthermore, my SO is an essential employee and thus is at a higher risk of contracting or spreading the virus, and we currently live in one of the worst states for testing. When we move, it will be no-contact on both ends as both our current and our new place already have guidelines in place for that, and I am okay with the prospect of self-quarantining for 14 days upon our arrival, but I don’t believe this will be feasible for my SO as he is keeping the same (essential) job and transferring to our new location. 

I’d love some advice here...I’m not asking for anything on the legal side of things - fortunately we are protected if we must stay past the end of our lease (just might have to pay for two places at once for a little while). But, would it be irresponsible to go through with our move? Should we suspend our plans until things start to get better? Has anyone here had a similar experience? We’ve been working on backup plans, but it’s really tough to figure out with so much uncertainty regarding the timeline and future predictions. Thank you in advance!",22Apr2020,1
542,"So I hate my company and have a lot of issues with the way things are handled and done. I’m sure my company has an open door policy so I was considering going to HR to formally complain, at the same time I’m a bit embarrassed to do so and I have a feeling she won’t take me seriously. I don’t expect her to actual do anything about my issues. It’s more of a venting session if anything. I feel like I’ve been stiffed on promotions and I also feel like I’m overqualified for the position I’m in. I make mediocre pay despite having a four year degree and working with high school graduates. I feel the company doesn’t value or recognize me and I also consider myself one of the harder and better workers in my department and I know my boss sees that as well. 

Someone said this might be better than my original idea of writing an anonymous letter to corporate complaining. I just don’t want to be reprimanded or fired for going to HR for complaining. I don’t know if they can legally fire me and I’m pretty sure if I talk to HR they legally have to keep what I tell them secret unless I suppose it threatens someone or the company. 

Would this be a good idea? I’m about at the point where I’m ready to quit but the job market is so bad right now and I’d rather not quit in this job climate. Oh and we’re deemed essential workers yet we don’t get hazard pay, another grievance I have with the company. I’m out there risking my health to do a job that underpaid for.

543,"I never could. I cannot say to people ""I'm feeling terrible"" or ""I'm in a bad shape lately"" kinds of things. It makes me feel like I am soo ungrateful for the life I have. I think that it is not fair for me to say those things.
I was never good at expressing emotions but this is the hardest to admit. 

Also, I know it is strange but as a man (22M) I feel like I should overcome every obstacle, alone, in life. When people try to be on my side, I feel so angry at them. I feel they are patronizing me. Every time I beat those feelings and express my emotions to people, my gf or my friends I always regret it afterwards. I absolutely hate to show my soft spots and scars to people. This also put a distance on every relationship I have.

Lastly, I am don't like long romantic relationships. I never wanted to commit any of my partners more than 5 months. When I feel things are getting serious, I do everything I can to keep the relationship light. When we go to breaks in college I always feel like I should end my relationship and often I don't have to be in a break to want to end it.

545,"  I might've only known him for 2 years, but for a 2 year friendship, we have really deep connections (nothing romantic or sexual, and me and him are males). when first met him, he had a really bad social anxiety, and at one point last year, he was going through suicidal phase. lucky hes past that. 9 months ago, me and him started hanging out with a new friend group. the people are good and respectful  (and i am still friends with them), but for everything good, there is a dark side, they do weed, drink, vape and act like idiots sometimes, i personally didn't care much before, and i am resistant to pair pressure to do those stuff, but not my best friend. infact he is hooked up on weed and smokes it everyday. initially, when he started doing it, i did hate that and did want him to stop, but slowly i kinda accepted it, because he was kinda of able to control the consumption. and also because it helped him a lot on seeing the world differently and reduced his social anxiety. the thing is also, at that same time, he met his Girlfriend, or sadly ex girlfriend.

  his relationship with his Gf seemed so good tbh, they did have few conflicts, but always seemed to resolve them, and generally, they were heading the right direction. and i always thought he found the perfect catch for him, but a month ago, out of no where she broke up with him. when he told me i didnt believe, nor he, it didnt make since, we thought she may need some time, as she also has mental issues (depression). but not until now i connected the dots.

we call the friend group the boys. and when he and his gf where still together, she was against drugs, she kinda made him see the boys less, (which i agree is right). but in like the past few weeks in the relationship, hes been smoking weed a lot more. (and in current quarantine, hes been smoking everyday). not until today i connected the dots, tbh i think his gf was the best thing that happened to him, i dont think made him more confident, it surely helped him with anxiety, but not much else. 

one of guys in the boys group, now illegally sells weed, others smoke it everyday, or drink everyday (even before quarantine). obviously they are a bad influence on him, and i dont want him to fall in that hole. 

for people wondering, dont worry about me, i sometimes hang out with them, but i dont do weed, or drink, or vape. very occasionally on parties. 

i feel like an idiot to not stopping him before, but i subconsciously distant my self from him, to not get influenced. but, i want to help him tbh, maybe my other friends too, i dont want to see people in my life fall. any help, advise or ways i can stop them or make them realize?

550,"A little back story ... I have been working in live music for the past decade as a tour manager, guitar technician, guitarist and venue owner’s assistant. I have had very steady work between a handful of excellent clients and always having a venue to return home to work when off of tours.

In 2010, the band I was playing in began heavily touring and I was forced to leave college. I took as many online courses as I could but I am still short (6-8 classes essentially) of graduation with a BA in Philosophy. I first took a leave of absence after exhausting all online credits I could take and then my career in music thankfully has carried me quite well through today. I always planned to return to school and finish my degree but I imagined it to be something I’d enjoy later in life once touring slowed down.

My further question is considering the pandemic, I imagine large gatherings will be off the table for quite some time. I am concerned I won’t be able to get back to full working capacity for 6-12 months, at least. Of course, this is just an educated guess.

I chose Philosophy as my study because it has always interested me however I didn’t chose it in hopes of having a career. I know this is a very expensive investment to just study something that’s interesting but I decided after a few months of starting college that I’d never make it unless I chose classes that I wanted to wake up every morning and go to. And ultimately, a degree would help me in some shape or form.

Fast forward to today and my mindset is much different. Considering my back story and skills, now I’m wondering what the heck to do. I could finish my Philosophy degree but I’m wondering if maybe I use my credits to apply towards another program with potentially a greater promise of employment.

Other than live music, I’ve held a supplementary income job as a seasonal marketing rep for a home improvement company. Out of high school, I was a GM for a fast-casual chain restaurant. Otherwise, I’ve worked in nearly every corner of live music.

558,"TL;DR at bottom

Some info: i’m under 18 so my parents have full control of my bank account. I can’t access it at all and they won’t let me buy anything with my own money. 

For the past 2 years i’ve been saving up my weekly allowance and putting it in a box behind a picture frame in my room. Its the only money i’ve had control of. It was my birthday recently and I got some cash so I went to put it in the box when i found out that almost all the money was missing. There was over £200 and now theres like £30. I had the money tightly rolled up and secured with a hair tie. Hair tie was gone and a note that hadn’t been taken was ripped.

Here’s the thing: nobody knew that I was saving up money and they definitely didn’t know where the box was. And the money couldn’t have fallen out because it was properly jammed in there, it wouldn’t even move if you shook the box.

It couldn’t have been my brother cause he’s too young and he never goes in my room anyway so I decided to ask my mum about it. She was suspicious af. She insisted that I probably misplaced all £150+ of it (i didn’t) but agreed to help me look for it later. We’re obviously not gonna find shit.

I haven’t asked my dad about it yet cause he’ll get mad but i’m pretty sure its him. For like a month now he’s made jokes like “[my name], how much money do you have in your room haha” or “Hey, where’s that money you have hidden in your room?”. I always assumed he was joking but now i’m not sure.

It really doesn’t make sense why any of them would take it though. They both make a decent amount of money so it’s not like they need it or anything. And my mum has borrowed like £5 from me before so she knows i’d willingly give it to her. 

Shit just doesn’t add up and honestly I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated and i’ll update if anyone cares.

560,"PSA: This is a throwaway account so that my personal information is not obvious.

Hey yall,

So, at my high school I recently founded and created the first child's right initiative internationally (not being specific of the name) to raise awareness and fundraise for children's rights. In creating the club, I faced a lot of trouble. My school has debt problems and so they were hesitant to let us create a group. They also said that another club was too similar to ours and so we should merge with them and form separate divisions. Let's call the other group: Local Help. Since it was our first year and I had no evidence to counter them, we merged under one umbrella name (EMPWR). However, we retained our divisions and were entirely independent. Similar to branches under a tree except the branches have nothing to do with each other. Local Help's main purpose is helping locally. However, they are extremely small (less than 15 people) and had minimal impact throughout the school, holding 1-2 events each year with minimal participation as well. My group on the other hand, had 100 fully engaged members (2nd largest group on campus) and we raised over $5000 worth of charity money to donate right before COVID shut schools down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because the school year is now coming to an end, I had evidence to tell my high school admin to separate us. I have been logical in my emails and have tried to be reasonable but they simply cannot understand how we are different from each other. I explained that being with them is hurting us, since students don't understand the umbrella concept and that lowers recruitment. It's also to difficult to send school-wide emails since we always have to say its from EMPWR and students get confused on which division the email is about (Local Help/Child Rights). I have sent countless statistics, compared both of our groups, shown the success of our social media but they still don't get it.

I was thinking originally of asking the Local Help group to just be under us because they would be more successful. However, they are already choosing their next exec team and I don't want to seem like I'm overtaking them even though we have more power in the school.

568,"So basically I had made a friend in Minecraft, we used to play together. We used to talk on Hangout and everything was good, but one day I did a suicide joke to her (it was not a joke, it was an experiment. I just wanted to see if she cares for me or not? And how much she cares for me? So I send her some messages on Hangout and pretending that I am doing suicide, and didn't talk to her for 24 hours) which was a terrible mistake I did. Then after 24 hours, I said it was a joke. She was just mad at me and I can understand that. After that day, she was not the same as before, she was changed. She was asking me why I did that joke to her? I said come to Minecraft with your old acc (she had created a new acc and I wanted her to meet me in Minecraft with her old acc, otherwise I won't come) and I will tell you there. She said she will not use her old acc again because she had met a lot of creeps, had bad friendships and was done with that acc. She also said that she had forgot the password of her old acc, but I thought it was just an excuse and I was keep pushing her to use your old acc one last time. I wanted to make things right, but I was only making things worse instead. In the end, she didn't meet me in Minecraft and what she did was unexpected, she created a group in which she added her boyfriend and me (she actually wanted her boyfriend to talk to me and tell me to leave her), and then she and her boyfriend started trash talking to me and saying toxic things to me. They were both making me feel very comfortable. And the worse thing is just listening to them and not saying anything in return, and that's what I was doing because I deserve all this. I was saying sorry to her many times, but it was no use, she was not listening to a single word I say. And the way she was talking, it looked like she had probably made up her mind about breaking up the friendship with me and never talk to me again. Bottom line, her boyfriend told me to leave her, never message her again or they will call the cops. I messaged her one last time ""Bye, take care"" and decided I won't talk to her again.

All those trash talking and toxic things they said to me, it made me go into depression for 1 day.

(I'm male. I forgot to add that in the title)

I was visiting my friends last Monday. I had a great time and I went home at around 2:00 AM. It takes 30ish minutes to bike home, so I was home at 2:30 AM. A bit late, but it is not unusual for me to come home at this time when I go visit my friends. 


My mom came into my room today and she said that I was awfully late home last Monday. I said sure, but it isn't like it is unusual. She told me that she had been worrying for months about me coming home so late, but she hadn't expressed it, at all, until now.


She said that she wants me to be home at 12 AM from now on when I visit my friends. I understand her worries, but I am 19 1/2. I am an adult. I don't want to go against her will, because she is my mother after all and she is the only family that I have, but I want to come home later than 12 AM. The only time when I feel just straight up happy is when I am with my friends, so naturally I would like to stay with my friends for as long as possible.


What, in my opinion, is just straight up weird is that when I visit my friends I must be home at 12 AM. But, when I go out to have drinks with my mates I can come home at 4-5AM.

So, does anyone have any advice how I can approach this situation? How can I convince my mom to not give my a curfew.

An important detail: I moved houses over the summer, so I basically live 2 times as far as before. Before the move it would take me 15ish minutes to get home, now it takes 30ish minutes.

Then the day of the confirmation (17/4/2020) he sends a message saying that the University prohibited students from doing internships the usual way (working at a physical place and getting work experience) and switched it to an online course but that he didn't know how the online course was going to be implemented. By the time I saw the message I had already confirmed my enrollment so my only choice was to drop the class which I wasn't going to do because I will lose money from my scholarship, it would affect my record and I would be charged a dropped course fee.  Today (22/4/2020) the day that the course begins I get an email from the professor assigned to teach the online course and the way its going to be taugh is purely online and the first assigmnet was watching a movie on Netflix and answering some questions.

I'm supper pissed the the University pushed an online version of the course when anyone with half a brain would know that the whole point of the internship is to get real life experience. I did not went to school for four years to do an online internship that seems to have been thrown together in 2 days.

What are my options? Is there a way that the University allowed me to take the course as it should have been implemented when this whole COVID things dies down without charging me again? Who should i contact  about this issue?",22Apr2020,1
572,"My sister has always been a lonely kid, she did not have many close friends growing up so she usually hung out with me and my friends. She is also not academically strong but extremely talented in the Arts and my family has always praised and encouraged her Art skills. I am naturally strong in my academics. We both went to the same high-school where academics was highly valued and the most ""popular"" kids where the smart ones. I believe my sister has developed a low self-esteem because she is not ""smart"", she doesn't see her own talents and values and keeps comparing herself to others. 

When she graduated from high-school she chose to go to community college for an optician program, she studied very hard as far as I saw but she did not get good marks. My sister didn't like going to college, she felt people looked down on her for going to college rather than university like I did. She told us she was being looked down upon by her professors and peers because she got low marks (60s-70s). She wanted to drop out but we encouraged her to continue as it was a 2 year program and she was almost done, she eventually dropped out. She stayed home for about an year and tried to find work but she wasn't able to hold on to any of them. We told her it is okay to stay home and encouraged her to take up drawing and other activities, she didn't seem too interested in it. During her time at home, she barely went out or talked to anyone, she spent most of her time on her phone watching documentaries about people struggling in various countries. When we sent her out for errands or went out to family gatherings she would become withdrawn and sullen, when we asked her whats wrong, she would say people are looking down on her because she doesn't have a job or because she didn't finish college.

She re-applied for college for another program and she was doing really well. At some point she made a small mistake in front of her class and her professor said something rude to her, she says he is trying to get her to drop out of the program because she made a few mistakes. She wanted to drop out of that professor's class, we told her to complain to the coordinator but she just decided to drop out of that class. 

During the summer, we went to stay with our dad for a couple of months. Our dad only sees us every couple of years, so he is especially caring towards us. My father often pats our back and our head in a fatherly way but last month my sister told us that she thinks my dad sexually abused her because he patted her back and tried to open the bathroom door when she was in there and at some point he scratched his privates when she was nearby ( I have seen my dad do this too, but he doesn't try to show it off like a pervert). Ever since she said that I have not spoken with her even though she speak to my dad and told us to forget everything she said because she ""knew we weren't going to believe her anyways"". I refuse to believe my sister was abused by my dad because I was with them all the time, my sister was happy and seemed comfortable around my dad when we were there, I even slept in the same room as my sister, so I know nothing happened at night for sure. As for the bathroom issue, my sister takes very long showers and my dad has a hard time seeing so he may not have noticed the lights on inside and my sister's voice is very soft so I am sure he didn't hear her saying she was inside because I was also never able to hear her saying she was inside during the times I accidentally tried to open the bathroom door on her. I don't know if she speaks to my dad because she feels forced to speak to him, I don't want her to speak to my dad if she truly believes he touched her with sexual intentions and I told her that multiple times. Apart from this incident, when we were at my dad's she refused to go out anywhere with us because she thought people looked down on her because she doesn't talk much and because she is skinny. 

 Now, I recently found out that she is being bullied by her classmates at college because of the professor incident mentioned before. I believe she might be bullied because she is an easy target to those assholes. 

I don't speak to my sister anymore, but I want to help her. I strongly believe most of her problems are because of her self-esteem issues. How do I help her fight back and not feel ashamed of herself?",22Apr2020,1
573,"My dad had a friend ship a package (with tracking) to our house, but jumbled the address, so instead of it being ""12345"" he accidentally told him ""12543"". His friend shipped it and my dad went this other address to tell them they are going to get a package and they said they would call if and when it came. when my dad got back he checked the tracking and it said it was already delivered so the people lied to him. now what can we do about this? since it wasn't a big company or anything, is there anything we can do on our end with these people or are we just shit out of luck?",22Apr2020,1
574,"When I turned 18 I did not expect that 3 months later the world would collapse and that my chances of going to college would be left up to a pandemic. I have been around my family for longer than I think I can take and what is healthy for me. A little history, when I was 6 my parents got divorced and my mother was insanely physically abusive so I was moved from living with her to living with my dad. However, as I got older and into middle school my dad became increasingly controlling and mentally abusive. The weight of trauma from my mother on top of the stress that my father put me under was one of the main reasons I started binge eating and self harming.  I got my first boyfriend in middle school and the minute my dad learned that I cuddled up to him and kissed him I was called a whore and told I would be just like my mother if I continued the behavior. On a time when I almost got caught with one of my scars, I was yelled at and told that if I was self harming I would be thrown in a mental institution. I went to a friends house and went to get pizza with her mother, I did not tell my dad and was grounded for a month. My phone was tracked until I was 17 (when I learned how to shut it off) Freshman year, I got another boyfriend and any time I wanted to go out with him or any of my friends at all I was constantly swarmed with questions of when, where, times and if times were deviated (even if I was just at a movie that ran over expected time) I was grounded for another month and yelled at/called a manipulative bitch. My step mom was no help and honestly made everything worse by fat shaming, slut shaming, and constantly telling me that my clothing choices ""were a disgrace and made me look like a hooker"". I wanted to wear jean shorts. Sophomore year I realized I did not believe in god (my family is insanely religious) and junior year I got another boyfriend and the same control was placed over me. If I was even a minute late, there was no chance to explain just grounding and yelling. I wasn't doing drugs or drinking. I just wanted to spend time with my friends like a normal high schooler. During this time I was also forced to attend church and I also had a part time job. I was late to work a few times because I was not allowed to leave church to go to work even though I was told working was required so I could make my own money and start to support myself. 

This year, I met my roommate early and she came for my birthday with another of our mutual friends, we shopped in the mall in Dallas then went to dinner at a local cafe and came back to town to stay the night at a friends. As soon as my dad learned I had met her, he also learned I had bought myself makeup. I was yelled at for being irresponsible with my money and for being manipulative and selfish for meeting my roommate early. The trip that was planned to meet her family was for my dad and step mother as they ""wanted to make sure they were not crazy and that we would be a good match"" I did not mention the meeting because the trip was still planned for them. On top of the trip, I was going to be forced to pay their housing expenses.  After the meeting was discovered, my newly bought college luggage, microwave, coffee maker and mirror was taken along with a car that my grandpa had requested I get before I left before he died. They accused me of not caring about anyone in the family and even kicked me out at certain times as ""I could not be trusted""

 Now, that corona is in full effect I am stuck in the house with them. While the understanding has gotten better and we are not at each others throats as much I still want to leave. I have had a plan to leave if the case is bad enough with my friends and current boyfriend (20M who lives in the town I will be attending college). My problem is that my savings is locked in my dads safe and I do not make enough to support myself through college if I do leave. I would not have a car or a lot of the money or tech I would need to start school. I have a plan and all I have to do is send a text and pack bags and I could go but be completely fucked financially. Or I stay and play it out, see what happens, hopefully get some money, suffer through a little more and if corona isnt gone by August then I leave. Is staying worth it? How could I get out now? There are countless other things that have happened that they don't acknowledge hurt me but continue to put all of the blame on me.  I have a job, but I do not make enough to put me through 4 years of a D1 university. I won't give up my dream college and I will do a lot to go there even if it is debt. Can someone explain my options to me and see if there is a way to either make my situation healthier or just leave?",22Apr2020,1
575,"(before I start, I am recovering covid19 but right I am dealing with my brother smoking inside the basement which I don’t it’s good for my lungs or immune system
I am 27 year old male recent college graduate from New York City who still lives with his Parents. I am only one in the house with a bachelor degree. I am a personal trainer for It has been difficult while working or getting a good night sleep since my room is between my brother and sister room who also still live with my parents. They stay up very late with the tv up very loud, speaking loud to their partner, or at times having loud sex. They don’t care that I have to work very early the next morning.They also like blasting music from their loud speakers. Whenever I tell them especially my brother that if he could please lower down his tv or the music because I have to be up early he gets very frustrated and tells me that I don’t pay rent. In college I would put all my classes at night to get be well rested for class but in most jobs I can’t pick a certain schedule. Yesterday I wish I would of recorded my brother last night who came home drunk arguing loud with his girlfriend and punching walls at 4 am in morning to show you guys proof of what I deal with in the daily basis. Last summer, I had a job where I had to be up at 6am. At the time my brother would be smoking a lot of weed in his apartment especially when I was asleep and the smel of weed would travel to my to my room and it would have be up all night. I rarely got any sleep last summer. My parents are afraid of my brother reactions so they get away with acting that way. I am hoping you you could help me get out this toxic environment. It would mean the world to me.

578,"Honestly i don't even know where to start with this, things have been so bad for absolutely years and since i don't wanna leave out any details this is going to be a long read. My whole life leading up till now is a huge part in this so I'll summarize my younger years up until about 13 (im 18 now). So as a child i grew up in an extremely abusive household both physically and mentally, my mother wasn't around for most of it due to being in jail so i was stuck living with her drugy boyfriend who's the father of my younger brother and sister, lets call them amy (14) and chris (12). Her boyfriend at the time wasn't my father and i believe that may be why he treated me so badly compared to my siblings, but at some point it got so bad while my mom was gone he kicked me out (at age 6 i believe) and i moved in with my grandparents. From then on i was doing great, finally being treated right and i finally felt like i had a real family. My grandma even got guardianship of me which still hasn't been removed. But when my mom got out she obviously wanted me back so i moved back with her and her new boyfriend, again she was just leaching off of him and i later found out she was cheating on him, this boyfriend was great tho we got a long really well and he got me really heavy into gaming and music. With him she had two more kids which we'll call will(4) and lilly(5). And while living with my mother again she kicked me out and had hit me on multiple occasions so i ended up back with my grandparents. But as soon as that school year ended i was back with my mom again and all the physical and mental abuse started all over again. And now about 3 years ago my grandpa passed away, it broke my heart and my grandmas as well, he was like a father to me and he had been with my grandma since she was 16. But my mom didn't seem to be bothered by the loss at all, in fact she took this as an opportunity to move amy, chris, and me into my grandma's house to ""help her out"". Never have i ever heard such a bs lie like that. From the day we moved in she immediately went through all his stuff and got rid of everything SHE didn't want without even consulting my grandma, and that obviously hurt my grandma a ton. From then on my mother has done nothing, and i mean absolutely nothing, she couldn't keep a job for longer than a week and would take months to even start looking for another job, she doesn't do any cleaning or cooking but will bitch about the house not being clean or there being no food cooked. My brother just sat in his room all day playing games and he would be screaming and cursing constantly and straight up bullying people online, his room is right next to my moms and she never gave a damn what he was doing and saying and she still doesn't. My sister is just as bad, again doing nothing but sitting in her room letting dishes pile up and get moldy. The two youngest thankfully stayed with their dad but even though they're supposed to be visiting every weekened we haven't seen them since before Christmas. My mom then proceeded to get into several dwi's to the point where she got her license taken away but somehow got no jail time, and she will still take out my grandma's car without asking and getting pissy when my grandma hides her keys. And so if you haven't figured this out yet my mom is acting like a damn teenager. Now for the more recent stuff, and if you thought it was bad already that's nothing compared to now. A few years ago i finally met my dad, he was living on the other side of the US and as much as it broke my heart to leave my grandma i decided to move with him. Things ended up not going well with my dad so after a year i moved back with my mom and grandma, but when i got back on my birthday... ON MY 18TH BIRTHDAY i found out after having a 24 hour drive that my mom had given my room to my sister so she set up a bed and a fan, i kid you not, in the motherfucking shed. So i was living in the shed for a while, at that point i had no license, not even a permit and my mother had ""lost"" all of my documents like my ssc and my birth certificate so i had to go out of my way to get them replaced with no help from her but my grandma did help in any way she could but since im 18 now it made everything 10× harder. Keep in mind i still don't have my permit or license because of how far she set me back by the time i got all the stuff i needed to get it the virus stuff came up. And while i was in the shed still i found out she had been bringing guys over while i was with my friends and she would trash the place, steal whatever money i had hidden, and she'd leave wine and alcohol all over the place, and god knows what else she was doing in there with those guys. So i got sick of it and moved back with my dad and we came up with a plan to get me my own place and everything. None of that worked out and i had met my fiance and after my dad found out about him we had a huge argument that ended with him kicking me out, so right now im with my fiance in quarantine trying to figure things out. Then finally, yesterday while at work i get a call from my grandma and she fills me in on all the crap that has happened since i left. My mother has gone absolutely insane. She continues to be a childish leach and has changed nothing about how she acts or things she does. But because my grandma smokes in HER room with the door shut and the window open my mom got mad at my grandma so much over it because my sister has asthma and its supposedly affecting her breathing from across the house, my mom actually had the audacity to lay her hands on my grandma and push her. And after some convincing from her friends my grandma called the cops on my mom, but they completely ignored everything my grandma told them and believed everything my mother eas saying because she was sitting there crying playing the victim card. After the cops had left my brother comes running down the stairs and almost punches my grandma yelling about how his mom never touched her (he wasn't there to see it) and he was swearing up a storm calling her a cock sucker, this kid is 12 and he did this right in front of our mom and she didn't say a damn thing she just smiled and let it happen. My mom had also turned off my grandma's phone so she's unable to make any important calls to the bank and her doctors. my mom also has her blocked on facebook and had made a rant post about how ""horrible"" my grandma is to her and she had so many people start to back her up believing every lie she was saying. It infuriates me just thinking about it. My grandma had found out about the post and asked me to send her pictures of what everyone was saying, so that's what i did. And due to what was being said about her she called the cops again (this was yesterday) and they suggested that my grandma find somewhere else to stay for a while, yanno leave the house she pays for and gets no help taking care of. My mom ended up texting me asking why i would show her the post and i explained why and told her straight up the problems we have with her and i even gave her the chance to prove me wrong or give any valid reasoning for what she's doing and she just didn't, she completely gave up and stopped talking to me because she knows im right about it all. The plan is my grandma is going to get my mom evicted the moment she can but who knows how long that'll be till then, and i really wanna just drop everything and move back up with her and my fiance now to try to help out but im not getting stuck in that shed again. The obvious thing to do is cut contact with her the moment she leaves but the guilt of doing that is killing me, its been bothering me so much i haven't even able to sleep. If anyone's got any advice about literally anything in the story it would be greatly appreciated.

586,"Hey there! So I'm a 19 year old female and I've been with my boyfriend (21) for almost 11 months now. I met him online back in May and we have a very deep connection and loving relationship. We call for hours a day, facetime, send packages and Christmas presents to each other. I went to visit him last month and it was the BEST week of my entire life. It was so fun and validated so much for me. (Please don't make comments about me meeting him online. I really don't need the judgements.)

In the future we've talked about moving in together. I'm getting an apartment in August at my college and we've came to the conclusion that he should move in with me some day. 

I would need to spend a lot more time with him first, and experience living on my own as well. I may see him in July and we've talked about him staying for a whole month in October. Of course distance is hard but we make it work really well. We're both okay with it honestly. 

Now here's the thing. My boyfriend lives in an emotionally abusive household. He's adopted and his parents physically and emotionally abused him his entire childhood. They don't love him at all, treat him like a slave, etc. He can become depressed at times about it, and wants to move out more than anything in the world.

I know he loves me so much but I often wonder if his motives to move in with me are solely based on wanting to escape his shitty household. Because moving in with me would be an easy ticket out. Cheap rent, fresh start to life in a new state. I wonder how much of it is truly because he's ready to live with me.. forever. 

Does anyone have any advice or steps I should take? My best guess is if we do move in, it'll be a year or more from now.

Learn a Language (was meant to be spanish), play all the games I have wanted to buy (bought Doom Eternal and Hearthstone on the same day lockdown happened), workout and lose some weight, read more books, cook, basically the whole schlot of stuff people want to do when being in this situation.

But nevertheless, I just can’t be asked to do any of it. I was learning Spanish for a week on Duolingo until I just stopped for no reason, I played Doom for a week and just stopped, I have worked out twice since this has started, don’t even ask me about dieting

I have been siting in my back garden for around 5 hours now doing nothing thinking to myself that I should really do something. But I am not doing anything. 

The only thing I have stuck to is reading, I am actually kinda proud, I have read three books since lockdown, thats more than the past 3 years prior

It goes in other ways too. I was one belt away from Black Belt in Karate but I just stopped cause I lost passion for it. And tbh, looking back did I ever? 

All I ever do with my spare time now is sit down and watch YouTube &amp; scroll through Reddit and Twitter. I know this isn’t living. I can’t even watch TV shows or Movies any more because I am just too lazy to get invested in the stories. 

I could think of a few reasons but I don’t think they excuse it

598,"This will be a bit of a long read and I’m so sorry in advance, I’m feeling really anxious right now and I’m needing to vent, I don’t know what to do or how to feel or anything.

I met this guy at the start of the year on Tinder, let’s call him R.  We hit it off almost instantly and we spoke about so much stuff and we got on so well, we spent the whole days talking to each other and it felt incredible.  We had only been speaking for about 4 days and I was out on a night out and I got drunk and kissed a guy, he came back to my hotel but I fell asleep and we cuddled and he left in the morning and R got very possessive and was upset and was acting like we were together even though I had no loyalties with him but to this day I still feel so guilty for doing that and I beat myself up about it constantly.  He kept accusing me of lying and that I had slept with this guy even though what I said is literally exactly what had happened but no, he kept digging and digging and pulling out accusations left right and centre.  So that kind of spooked me a little bit because I had only been speaking to him for a handful of days and he was already acting jealous.  Anyway, I let it slide and we continued as normal until one night I had finished work and I asked him a question.  I can’t remember exactly what it was but it was something like “what you doing tonight?” And his snap location had turned off and he literally full on snapped at me and got really angry and was like “you don’t need to know everything that goes on with me” and I got really upset and blocked him.

Then about 2 weeks later, I noticed he had dm’d me on reddit and I decided to respond and we got talking again.  This time was the exact same, we hit it off and stayed up all night talking and it felt no different than the first time we started speaking to each other.  We ended up meeting up and from there on, it was a constant whirlwind of us being “just friends” and then “more than friends” and it was just a bit of a head fuck.  But I was really invested in him as a person so I kept him around because he made me smile and he was really reassuring.  And I’m an idiot who always tries to see the good in people no matter how dirty they do me.  We hadn’t slept together, it was just me giving him head, I wasn’t getting anything from it but I’m a giver so I was okay doing so.  But something sexual would happen and then immediately after he’d be like “no you’re just a friend, you don’t even turn me on” even though it was clear I did.

Anyway - this next part is a key turning point.  So I was going on a night out with a friend and then he last minute decides he’s going out and he’s going to the same club - coincidental huh?  Long story short, I ended up getting super drunk and baring in mind that I am super attracted to R, I was on him most of the night which was unfair on my friend and on R’s friend and I look back at this night and want to punch myself in the face.  I begged him to let me come home with him and he didn’t want me to but he let me anyway because he felt guilty and didn’t want to leave me in the state I was.  I got back to his and I was being sick and he was being caring and holding my hair back, giving me mouthwash and staying with me to make sure I was okay.  I constantly thank him for this night, he was the best help.  I was acting like such a whore, I get so horny when I’m drunk but I was just taking it to the next level and I was flashing myself to him and his friend and I had taken my underwear off for some reason.  I was posting NSFW on here at the time and I was flaunting my pictures and showing off and then I eventually passed out.  R had put a blanket and a rug over me so I wouldn’t wake up and I was out cold.  He (or his friend - idk, he changes the story everytime he tells it) took a photo of me and whilst you can’t see me that well - you can still see my hair and make out that it is a person, which is me, I am still very uncomfortable that they took a photo.  Not only had I just met his friend and I hadn’t even known R that long either, he kept this photo secret from me for 3 months and then decided to tell me last week.  Surely if you take a photo of a friend whilst they’re in a state when drunk, you show them the morning after like “hahah look at the state you were in” - not 3 months later.  I feel like I’m severely overreacting but it doesn’t sit right with me and makes me uncomfortable.  

I eventually woke up and then I went and sat on the edge of the bed with R and he pulls me in for a spoon.  We cuddle most of the night and he’s turned on and I’m touching him and things get a little heated but nothing major happened.  And he always brings that up as me assaulting him and I feel so horrible about it but it was two sided because he was touching me too.  But at the same time I think he just says that because I call him out for exploiting my privacy.

Also I wanna add the fact that I was on my period this night out but completely forgot and I ended up getting a little bit of blood on his bed which he got so angry at me for and shouted at me and kicked me out immediately when he saw that.  And I still get so embarassed and upset thinking about that.

But from this night out, he constantly brings it up and accuses me of sexually assaulting him and it makes me feel like such a bad person.  He told me that he should have left me on the streets which is where I belong and that he wishes he left me with my ex who would’ve taken advantage of me sexually whilst I was drunk and that really broke me. 

Anyway - things carry on from that night and we continue to meet up and the whole cycle of us being friends and then more than friends was still going on.  He told me I would never be “his girl” because he didn’t like the fact I posted NSFW on here even though he was fully aware of that the moment we started speaking.  I was determined to change for him and be what he wanted so I deleted all of my NSFW content.  Then we spoke about it a few days later and he told me I shouldn’t have done that and that I should do what I want and that I should go back to posting.  So I did, I listened to him because he made me feel like it was okay and that it wasn’t a bad thing for me to be doing.  Then we met up a few days later and then we finally slept together, this was the first time for us, and then he immediately regretted it because he found out I was still posting NSFW on reddit and he didn’t like that.  He checked my page after I left and then sent me a wave of hate and disgust after it.  Saying how I’m nothing but a mistake, not to tell anyone about this because he’s so ashamed about sleeping with me etc etc.   And then he accused me of lying - I didn’t lie, I just didn’t tell him I had been posting again which I admit I should’ve told him.  But at the same time, he said it was okay for me to go back to posting.  

That all blew over (he has a tendency for just acting like nothing ever happened and completely starting fresh, this is why we just kept going) and we continued to hang out and meet up and have sex.  And sometimes it was okay but most of the time it ended up with me in tears and him feeling uncomfortable. 

I feel like I’m rambling and not even getting the key points in here.

So basically as of right now, we’ve fallen out and he wants nothing to do with me because I’m a scary and dangerous person allegedly.  He accuses me of this because of little things like I checked his snap score, I looked at what song he listened to on Spotify and nosied at what subreddits he followed and because of this I’m a stalker and a psychopath when he literally does the exact same with me, if not worse, he takes screenshots of my content, constantly checks my tik tok and other social media to see if I’m posting, tunes in to what I’m listening to on Spotify but I don’t think of any of that as bad behaviour yet he does??  He constantly calls me a crazy bitch and tells me he’s petrified of me and this makes me really upset.  

Not only did he take a picture without my consent, he’s also sent my nudes to people without asking me and this was after I stopped posting NSFW.  And this is kind of a blurry area because he was like “you post nudes online anyway so I can show whoever I want” but it’s different because I knew him personally and he was showing his friends my nude photos without even asking me and that just felt really upsetting to me.  And he sends me girls nudes that I don’t wanna see and they’re without their consent too and I just feel like this is out of order and he needs to stop.  

He tortured me and my brain for 4 months and constantly messed with my head and made me feel like the worlds worst.  Whilst he’s blocked me on everything, I wish I could reach out to him and I’m sad I don’t have him around and that doesn’t make any sense but I miss him and I really loved his company.  But I was nothing but a body to him and he lead me to think he actually liked me.

I have rambled and I’m sorry - any questions just ask or if you’re not sure on anything just ask.

I really need advice, should I report it?  Am I over reacting?  What do I do?  I’m a nervous wreck right now and I really don’t want to report it because I like him and I want us to be friends but I don’t think that’ll ever happen and I feel dumb for still trying to see the good in him even though all my friends tell me he’s dangerous",22Apr2020,1

604,"Edited to add ages and to label backstory

I (23f) want to let my (19f) coworker down gently. 

Backstory:

I'm on mobile so sorry for the mess. I've ended three friendships intentionally in my life. It's a whole different story but all three were by childhood best friends and one I had dated, and when I felt it was time to end the friendship I sat them all down and told them why I didn't want to be friends. All three of those people had wronged me but I felt it was fair that they knew why and I didn't ghost them because of how long we had known each other.

Current:

So currently I'm still working four or five days a week despite the corona (I'm an essential worker, I guess) and because of the corona, everyone knows I'm not doing anything when I get home. This has caused my coworker to constantly ask to hang out, everytime I see her and if I don't work with her, she'll text me to ask to hang out. I don't have anything against this particular coworker, but I don't like being harassed and honestly, we have no similar interests or hobbies, and she's also just a lot to be around even at work. I'm an introvert and I prefer to keep contact with even my good friends at a minimum, and maybe hang out with someone once a week. Obviously I don't want to do what I did last time because she hasn't done anything wrong, but I don't want to straight up tell her she's annoying and I don't want to hang out. I'm not very good at putting things nicely, or letting people down easy.

I've(19M) found my self in a sticky situation atm. Backstory I've been using Hily which is a dating app and I've met someone and we clicked very quickly, it was very unexpected but we both felt a connection and both admitted to it and how rather quick it was. I'm excited to say the least, but she does live an hour away. Google maps said that it was about an hour drive from here to there, I bought it up with my mum, only the distance thing, and she said that it is quite a distance to travel. I somewhat agree, but I genuinely felt a connection and I don't want to off my chances with it, (I'm not the best at meeting people which is why I used Hily).

613,"So around a year ago I had what I think was sleep paralysis as I woke up, and was unable to move for about  30 seconds even though I was wide awake. I thought nothing much of it after.

In the past month or so, I’ve had four different episodes of waking up around 10/15 minutes after falling asleep at night and experiencing weird like hallucinations. The first time it happened it felt like my dad was trying to wake me up (he does a specific thing to annoy me into waking up in the morning) but after a minute it stopped and only then I realised that I was lying in a weird position that I couldn’t feel before, and my dad wasn’t in the room, it was midnight. 

Since then I’ve had episodes after waking where I can’t really move and I hear someone talking to me, last night I saw an arm reaching out my wardrobe door which I’d left open. 

I think it’s sleep paralysis but I’m not that sure. I have an awful sleep pattern because I work shifts and go off/on night shift a lot and also I’ve been super stressed lately because I’m a nurse and work isn’t great. I just wanna know if this is normal or not.",22Apr2020,1

617,"The other day I got a LinkedIn request from someone that played an integral role in making my life miserable. Granted it was years ago and for the most part I’ve moved on from it but at the same time when my family and friends tell me to let it go it’s pretty damn hard.

I had a best friend in school that I had confided in after I had been sexually assaulted. Rather then keeping my secret they told other people who continued to tell additional people. Now at 15 it’s really hard to not only deal with “friends” saying your a liar and turning on you but also dealing with sexual assault from a senior.

Long story short I switched schools and to this day it bugs me sometimes. I do everything in my power to avoid these people. To forget about the horrible things they did to me and how they made me feel. All in all, I just don’t know if it’s normal to still feel this way. It’s so hard for me to trust people, to get over the past and forget it.

620,"Man... I (26f, 16 weeks pregnant) think I sound like an asshole but here we go: 2 years ago I got a two young cats. After one week, one had epileptic episodes and suddenly went blind. My boyfriend and I brought him to the vet. After a few days, it was clear that he had liver problems. His liver isn't working properly and he was basicly poisoning himself. He had liver surgery, which helped a bit but we had to wait till he was almost a year to get the surgery (he needed to have a certain weight and had to grow). He is better, but still not well and he will never be a healthy cat. He still has liver problems (needs a special diet-20€ for 2kg cat food), he still has epilepsy (needs medication every 12 hours, costs about 20€ a month), he isn't coordinated- he can't climb, falls over and he doesn't groom himself (he always has poo on his hind legs, we have to bath and shave him weekly). He  is also deaf and REALLY loud because he doesn't hear himself and he meows (more like screams) all the time.
We already paid about 10.000€ for the cat. The surgery was super expensive cause we had to drive to a special vet clinic and we still have a lot of medical expenses because he needs bloodwork kinda regularly.
I am a student, my boyfriend doesn't make that much so we have debt.
We can't visit family because we can't leave the cat alone for even a day. That is really hard and my depression got a lot worse because of the financial burden and not beeing able to see family.
So... now I am also pregnant (unplanned, birth control failed) and I don't know what to do. 
I really love my cat, I do everything for him, we live really frugal and manage our money well but we can't visit our families and that really hurts. I want my child to see their grandparents, I want to visit family with my child, at least for a single day but I can't as long as I have this cat (don't have people who can give him medication when we are away and family has severe allergies and I can't bring the cat along).
I feel so bad, I wanna be with family again but this cat makes it impossible. 
It's also kinda impossible to find a home for this cat. He doesn't like beeing touched and want to be left alone, he is super loud, he is really dirty because he doesn't groom himself and he has all this medical problems. 
But he really likes our other cats, he can't be an only cat. 
He basically needs a well of family with other cats, who can cater to his special needs and leave him alone all day besides giving him food, medicine and washing him.
I don't have hopes that anyone would want him. I also feel like a failure for giving up. I think pets are for live and I wanted this cat. His medical problems came a bit later and if I knew what I was getting myself into, I would have never got him. I thought I could handle the responsibility of a pet with medical problems but I didn't know a young cat could be that sick and how hard it is to have a mentally disabled pet.
I feel like a complet failure that I want to give my pet away bacause I can't handle him and having a baby. I am really depressed and hate myself for it because I really love my cat.
Another fear is that nobody wants this cat (I asked and till today nobody is interested-understandibly) and I am stuck with a baby and a severly disabled cat. 
I am afraid that wont be a good mother and I want the best for my child. Our family is awesome and I want them in the life of our child. I am afraid that I wont be able to visit family with my child because of my disabled cat.

Then I made a mistake and fell into a deep depression. He came through to check in on me once, which was a big deal because I lived across the country. Another friend came to check in on me too. I didn't get out until recently. I give those guys, my family, and friends credit for being there.

Fast forward a bit. For the last year or so, I noticed that this guy just didn't hit me up that much. I would initiate contact. To check in and all. Sometimes, he wouldn't respond to my texts at all, make comments about visiting me in my city but never come through, make plans about taking a trip together but never commit, and doesn't keep his word.

I had kept how I was feeling to myself for a while. But I told him how I felt last week or so. That every relationship is a two way street and I felt taken for granted. He apologized and promised to do better. 

Last night, I called him up because something I read triggered me. I talked with him for 10 minutes and it wasn't nonsensical. I'm trying to get into a Master's program and wanted to start dating again. I just don't want to end up with an abusive woman (it's happened in the past and I don't want to repeat it), and wanted his thoughts. He told me, ""Don't let someone who you're just starting to see hurt you more than 3x"". Also, red flags, which I wanted to discuss with him, but his mom called. He said he'd call back in an hour, but never did.

I have other friends too. They may not respond immediately, but they usually get back to me within a few hours. They're not perfect, but they respect the balance and me. I'm just getting vibes that my best friend isn't all that interested in who I am as a person anymore. Whenever we hangout, he mostly talks about his interests, opinions, and feelings. While I try to voice what I like now, he responds to it, but immediately moves on back to himself. Like I don't really have anything interesting to say.

I'm torn. And a little angry. I've known this guy for a while and we've had some good times. But the respect and love just doesn't seem like it's there anymore. Or it's one-sided. Not sure what to do.

TL;DR: Friend just doesn't show interest towards me or my life anymore.",22Apr2020,1

i’m going to keep this as vague as possible. there’s a current investigation going on in my town against a child predator. big number of victims, however- one of the individuals who have come forward against this person has been lying about most of the events that took place between themself and this predator. not only i know this, but there are some others close to them at the time who know this as well. as i said, i don’t really want to get into specifics. but i was super involved in this whole situation at the time.

it is possible some sort or assault may have taken place but a lot of the things this person has said are far from accurate as to what was going on around the time. i.e. “ i was with him on ~said date~ “ when the predator wasn’t even in town at the time and a friend recalls hanging out with her for most of the day. its not just dates being mixed up, i mean barely anything she’s said actually happened. 


her and this said predator only had met twice, second time being a short period. her parents, close to her for most of the encounters. shes claiming her and this predator had an on-going relationship and would be near each other constantly. this simply wasn’t possible. this didn’t happen. also at the time, this individual would make up a lot of stories about herself having boyfriends that didn’t exist and dating famous people. she suffered from a lot of delusions. she had a lot of mental health issues. i genuinely feel like her lying isn’t intentional, i believe she believes these things actually happened. 


the reason why i feel like i should maybe get the ball rolling and explain the timeline of events as i, and many others, witnessed and remember them is that i’m highly concerned this could hurt the investigation big time. this predator is incredibly guilty, the other victims have a decent amount of evidence despite his attempts to not leave a trail. but he could have a decent defense because of this girl. 

also i should mention this girl has been trashing other victims on social media, especially one of his longest victims. she’s claiming her and this other victim had a very close friendship and she did nothing to help her, ignoring her abuse. they did not know each other at all. everyone who knew this girl at the time knows this. i’m worried for the other victims and i’m worried that no will receive justice.


however, i feel incredibly bad for this girl. she is and has never been right in the head. i just don’t know how to handle this situation but it’s weighing on me. any advice would be appreciated.",22Apr2020,2

I thrive off hugs, they give me energy to actually get through a day and Ive never met someone that feels this way but Ive always had to deal with it. I know I'm an anxious person but it's been alright.

632,"Hi, a little of a backstory.
I(19f) met my boyfriend (19m) months ago, together for about 8 months. We really cliked and we have a strong and healty relationship. We live 45 min drive away and since I have a car and go to school near his house, I am often the one going to his place. Also, I have been diagnosed this past January with an eating disorder called boulimia binge eating. In few words, it means that everytime I feel an any kind of emotion, I eat to get back to my “neutral state of mind”. I am curently in therapy and I am feeling way better. Since the disorder started, almost 5 years ago, I had a lot of problems with my parents, especially my mom. She didn’t understand my emotions and my hypersensibility. She used to putso much pressure on me to do sports, on school, on getting a boyfriend and being the perfect big sister for my siblings. We would always fight because I didnt want to her “perfect daugther”. Now, she always comments on my weight (she litteraly said that my therapy wasnt working because I havent lost weight), on how much time I spend with my bf. My current therapist and my boyfriend both told me that she was doing a lot of emotional abuse on me. 

Back to the point.
Last weekend, my bf and I decided to go to my place for a couple of days. When we arrived on Saturday, both my mom and my dad were on their phone making facetime all the afternoon and part of the evening. It didnt bothered me at first because I thought maybe they havent talk to their friends/family members for a long time. So bf and I just went on with our things and cooked supper with my siblings. On Sunday and part of Monday, I had the impression that my parents were mad at me or us but I didnt know what could have caused their behavior. On monday afternoon, they started to make comments at me and giving me weirds looks. We were supposed to stay until Tuesday night, but I was feeling so not at my place that I asked my bf to leave early. It is in their habitude to give me shit when we are alone or by text, but never in front of my boyfriend or anyone else. Today, my brother texted me saying that mom and dad thinks my bf is not sociable and doesnt help me. He said that my bf was sitting in the stairs on his phone while I was washing the outside of my car. My dad came outside just when my boyfriend finished passing the sweeper everywhere in my car...

I really don’t what to do. My boyfriend told me their opinion didnt bothered him, I want to believe him. But they are also my family.Should I ignore what they said or not? Should I give my point of view to my parents?",22Apr2020,0
633,"Hi,  I need some advice. I need to know especially if I'm being crazy or not.  I want to preface this with my boyfriend has been nothing short of amazing so far, and he gave me permission to be on his phone, to call my phone when I lose it or something, so that's trustworthy right? Point is I didn't get on his phone to snoop. Another preface this relationship is the best one I have ever had, I've been abused in the past and as of late the longer this relationship goes the more my brain is telling me he's going to turn on me, or leave me, or cheat on me and It's my fault, even though I have known him for a long time and he wouldn't ever do these things. Maybe I have been a bit much trying to be a perfect girlfriend so that stuff for sure won't happen??

Anyway, last night I woke up because this bright light stared bothering me. I asked my boyfriend who he was talking to and he said his dad, so I rolled over and the light started up again so I aske if he was taking pictures and he said no it was just the brightness on his phone. I shrug it off and sitt up because I can't sleep and we spend sometime together, I get back to sleep around 3 am. I woke up really early this morning, as three hours later, and couldn't find my phone. So I got my boyfriend's phone to call mine, open facebook messenger (because he doesn't have any phone service he can only call and text over messenger.) 

I get out of the convo the messenger opens to, to find our chat to call my phone, his messenger was in the spam message request section so I went to hit the back button, my cat meowed at me so I looked away from the phone to say hi to him. When I looked back I realised I accidentally opened the chat underneath the back arrow, I went to exit the chat and saw he sent her a heart, (I don't know how he's able to meesage people in the spam section without it transfering it to the regular message section) no big deal he's a good friend and even send his guy friends hearts or I know he send hearts to people when he talks about me and our life together. Figuring that was the situation I scrolled up to see what he said, because it makes me so happy when I see those, I didn't read any of her messages at this point. 

I scroll up and saw he actually had taken pictures last night (of just his face, which I dont know why he lied about who he was talking to or taking pictures I have never ever freaked out him having girl friends or him talking to girls) she asked if he had a good birthday and he said 'I did. But it reminds me of my birthday awhile ago when we almost kissed and we got rowdy' with a kissy emoji and then the heart. I quickly got out of the convo and then realized all the message requests in the spam section were really pretty girls that he has at least sent one message to. I didn't read anymore messages and just called my phone and put his back when I found it. I have been wondering what to do for hours now. I want to bring it up because it's hurting me so bad, but I don't want to potentially lose him or make him mad because he'll think I went through his phone. I love him so much and I switching between being upset and hurt and thinking I'm overreacting and misunderstanding the situation. I don't know what to do..

634,"Hoy!

For the last 2 years, I dedicated my life to a Physics degree. I love Physics, truly do. But ultimately I found out that I do not want an academic career, one of the reasons is that would mean being in another country, an entire world away from every one I love.

I moved countries to pursue that degree, and eventually that led me to breaking up with my girlfriend. Initially, that was a huge shock. But today I can see that it was bound to happen anyway, whether I had moved or not, and I do not wish it was any different in this regard.

My current problem is that I would like to pursue a career in Rocket Science. But that is nearly impossible due to a list of military regulations called ITAR. ITAR dictates that no foreigner, unless with a permanent resident visa or being a citizen in the US, can work with rocket technology. This makes it incredibly difficult to me to even have access to that industry, let alone to be able to land a job on a company, which by itself would already be difficult if I was american. This is the 'dreams crushed' part.

So, I am back to my home country. Trying to decide what to do. I am thinking of Mechanical Engineering, just because I want to feed the small hope inside me that one day I will be able to work with space exploration somehow. But I know this chance is tiny, and if it does not work, then I will be stuck with a Mech E degree, which honestly I do not care about that much. I would be able to work on machines, cars, trucks.. that really feels meaningless to me. I can not find myself motivated to study those things. They do not excite me nor do I feel like they are needed to society. Why would I work so hard to make a new car which is only going to pollute the world and be thrown at a junkyard after a few years of use? Do I want to invest my life in something so pointless?

And what is worse, being back in my home country, living with my parents, 20 years old currently not majoring in anything, really makes me feel useless. If I end up on a local university, which is highly likely, I will feel like I chose the easy path, the mediocre path, which was never something old me would do. I always strived for greatness, for adventure, which is why I chose to move countries to pursue my dream of being a physicist in the first place.

I am just trying so much to find something that I can believe on and that will allow me to work hard everyday, much like when I was doing Physics. But I got no options that make me excited to work on, that bring me that inner fire to do anything possible to pursue my objectives.

So, in the last month or so, I have been thinking hard about all of this, but I have not reached any conclusion. Lately, I have been feeling depressed, staying at bed until late and not really working on anything all day. Does not help that I can not go to the gym because of COVID-19, and I was really progressing a lot in the gym. If it keeps up like this, there is a pretty big chance I will fall into depression. Now, I consider myself to be a pretty active person that does not let things simply 'happen' before my very eyes, but I just see no course of action to prevent this from happening.

I know no one here will be able to give me magical answers. But maybe someone went through something similar and will be able to give me some advice on what to focus on or what I should try to do going forward.",22Apr2020,1
635,"sup yall,

first of all, i hope yall are safe and healthy during this corona crisis, now let me start of by saying that i've had multiple accounts on reddit and always deactivated them to then create a new one, since i always doubted to really ask for advice.

Now i'll keep it rather short for you all, since i assume your time is as precious as anyone else.  


Short backstory, my mom and dad divorced 9y ago (i'm 21y old now), my mom later remarried with my stepdad about 6y ago. He's a nice dude and my mom's real happy, my mom had a some depressing years before due to non related issues. I've been suspicious of my stepdad cheating on my mom with one of the neighbours, but not just one of the neighbours, one of their daughter's (16y). A lot of the times my step dad goes walking with our dog and the neighbours daughter tags along quite a bit. I've seen them texting eachother quite often aswell, aswell as at very very late hours. We have a garage behind our house and one time i went there to get some water since we store the bigger bottle packs there. I walked in and they were standing very close to eachother facing eachother and when i came in they kind of shocked. Like the instant reaction you'd give when you would be doing something wrong as a kid, you'd hear someone or something and you got this spike of adrenaline and pulled away from whatever you were doing. That's sorta what it looked like.  


Now i kinda need advice since i don't want my mom to have her heart broken and go back to her past depressed state. But since this might be cheating, with a minor aswell. I don't really know.  
I thought i could maybe keep taps on his phone and confront him myself with evidence but since i don't know how to do that, i'm kinda lost.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks ahead, for any and all advice that follows. I'll keep you updated.",22Apr2020,2

This is my first serious relationship, the only previous one ending after a week. Matt is bisexual, and i am panromantic.

My girlfriend texted me good morning, then said that we needed to talk  about something serious. I asked her if she wanted to text or call, and she said texting was alright. This is the following text conversation (copy and pasted):  
Matt: So do you you remember when i came out to you as poly....  
Me: Yeah  
Matt: We need to talk about it..... So essentially I need to know if you comfortable with me dating other people if you aren't thats fine and i won't but i need to know.  
Me: Im going to have to think about it honestly  
Matt: Okay that fine take your time I know it would be a big change and everything. Just know i love you and will respect your wishes no matter what you choose.

\*Honestly, I am not comfortable with her dating other people. I understand what being poly entails, and how it, like other sexuality and romantic parts of you, you cant control. I dont want to break up  with her either, cause i truly do love her. But if i do love her, why would i keep her from being herself?

Some of you parents or adults in this sub might think ""Oh thats wonderful she really cared about you."" or "" I wish my parents did this for me when I was a kid"" No it's not ""fun"" or ""enjoyable"" being tirelessly worked from 6:30 to 8:00 at a young age. I had no time to do any schoolwork because of all of these things I had to do after school and in result got no homework done, which resulted in my mom screaming at me for hours on end. I never got to develop any friendships because of lack of social skills and no time to hang out with friends. When I turned 11 I realized I couldn't take her constant bullshit anymore and decided to move in with my dad. Moving in with my dad was like a breath of fresh air. I finally had time to make friends and relax without the constant stress of my mother. I was all stress free for a year and a half until I was diagnosed with cancer. In the summer of 2019 I was diagnose with an optic pathway glioma. As soon as I was diagnosed I knew my mother was going to fuck me over somehow. She immediately opposed chemo and started giving me ""herbal teas"" and ""essential oils"" on her visits. I had to start chemo which was good because there was nothing my mother could have done about it. She opposed all the vaccines I had to get to protect me because of my low immune system (She's anti-vax and thinks vaccines cause autism.)

Turns out luck was on my side for once and that I responded to chemo really well! Everything was going just fine until Covid-19 started and school shut down. My mother decided she was going to drive over to me for quarantine. (She lives in Canada. I live in the U.S) Her reasoning was she might not be able to visit me for a while because of the pandemic. I freaked out because this could mean I would be stuck with her for months. I know it sounds fucked up but I was hoping like crazy that the border would shut down or they wouldn't let her through. But my luck had ran out and they let her through easily. I don't know why my dad is letting her stay at his house even though they are divorced and he is re married.

649,"Hey,

I’m honestly confused over the behaviour of one of my best friends and would appreciate some advice. I often overthink so I can’t tell if I’m overthinking a situation or not.

Me and my friend live with one another along with some other friends. We’ll call this friend Jake. I’ve known Jake for one year and a bit, nearly two and we get on really well. Early September I got into a LDR relationship, still everything was fine and cool. Then in late October or early November I came back from my partners after being there for nearly a week and Jake was a little quiet. Jake is also best friends with my other best friend who we will call Max. So in a way it’s a trio of us. 

Anyway I dismissed his quietness but from then he continued to be off with me. And by off I mean we would all be sat together and I’d say something and Jake wouldn’t say anything back or talk much but the second someone else did he would joke on a lot. Essentially he seemed to just avoid conversations with me which as a result did make me feel awkward about the whole thing. Now and then he would be okay and he’d ask if I wanted dinner but as a whole I felt like something was up. As a trio we have a group chat which we would always talk in about boys etc or Jake would say he saw a cute boy somewhere. Anyway we just sent a lot of things into the chat in general. Then Jake just didn’t anymore around the same time. Naturally I began raking my brain for what I’d done wrong because no one just acts cold to one of their best friends for no reason especially when he was fine with Max. 

Me being not very confrontational, I didn’t say anything. During Christmas I didn’t speak to Jake much because honestly it felt like he didn’t want to talk to me. Then we all met up back after Christmas and I spoke to Max about it and he said he hadn’t noticed Jake being off but he agreed that if I wasn’t making it up for no reason. 

Anyway one night we were having a party and Jake was being really nice and talking to me like old times and then he said how he hadn’t meant to be cold to me. I got a bit upset but he apologised which was really kind of him. The next day we talked about it and there wasn’t a reason why he was off with me. 

From then we’d be good to talk in groups together but on our own for some reason it just still feels awkward. With quarantine right now, I’m always talking to Max, equally messaging one another first etc but Jake hasn’t messaged me. Twice I’ve sent a message whether it be a quick compliment regarding something he posted which would lead into a greater conversation. The time I did that he did reply to me and we had a bit of a chat but since there hasn’t been anything. I did post in the group chat and he did reply but it still feels weird. 

In my head I feel like there’s something wrong. As in, why would Jake be cold for no reason. Bearing in mind Jake is the most upbeat happy person and this literally came out of nowhere. I went over everything I could have done and I can’t think of anything. For things still to be awkward to me it feels like an underlying issue. We do get along okayish now but it’s nothing like before. Also to note, I was thinking some people might suggest that he’s upset over the relationship I got into but he’s gay and I’m female. 

I’m hoping to get some opinions on what people think because I’m honestly sort of lost with the whole thing or where to go from here.",22Apr2020,1

652,"I’ve been talking to this girl a little bit. Seems like a nice person. She likes to talk about the environment and all that jazz, and I like to listen to her inputs and opinions. So that’s kinda like her thing. I’m a religious person so I like to talk about God and will even connect Him to her discussions. Though whenever I talk about religion, even if it’s about the environment, she seems to sort of shut me down. I know she doesn’t believe, but she won’t really contribute or acknowledge it more than “I respect that” and turn the subject back to her.

And he said you are not ready to be in my life go work on yourself some more. And I blocked him. Because I knew if I didnt I would message him and beg him to take me back.

659,"Hello Reddit! So I am a teen girl, and my ""friend"" (who we'll call W), is honestly not the kindest to me. 

Backstory time!! So W used to be really nice to me when we first met, and we were in the same friendship circles. We were around each other so much, it was natural for the friendship to progress rapidly. 

Within weeks, she was one of the prominent members of my social circle, and one of my good friends. 

I guess, I was just naive.

When things started to go wrong, I denied it at first. She'd insult me to my face, steal my homework, shove me while we walked, and talk behind my back. Of course, if I had seen it like that, I would have cut the relationship right away.

But it wasn't that straightforward.

She'd play it off as a joke, or thank me profusely for homework I had ""lent her"". She'd have days when we'd just click, and she was so funny and kind, and I'd remember what made me want to be her friend in the first place.

""It's just my personality"".

And when I looked around me, all my friends just accepted it. They just laughed and took it.

""W is always like that"".

 ""That's just the way she is"".

&amp;#x200B;

Was I just sensitive?

That was a whole other longggggggg battle I went through to realize, 

""If W makes me feel bad, I don't need W near me.""

So I started drifting.

I'd text less, talk less. Hang around the friends that treated me like a human being.

I wasn't mean. If she waved to me, I'd wave back. But I wouldn't spend more time with her than I needed to.

And wOW. My happiness and self exteem practically **exploded**. It was **amazing**.

&amp;#x200B;

I always knew W wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. She had days when all she drew were vaguely concerning drawings. I'd listen to her complain about her life for hours. I'd cover for her when she didn't do the work. If she rejected a compliment, I would only bombard her with more.

But I would not stand to her bullying me.

And now, she's telling me she has depression. That me leaving her is making her feel horrible. She tells me she wants to die.

I'm so tired of this. 

I don't know what to do. I asked her to look into therapy, that I'm not a professional.

I want to tell her that I'll be there for her, but I don't want to lie.

I don't doubt her, depression is a tough battle that explains many of her mannerisms.

I don't know what to do.

When she hurt me like that, it led me down a year long cycle of self hatred and doubt.

How do I help her without hurting myself?

Advice really appreciated.",22Apr2020,2
660,"Hello all, I have been feeling quite stuck with this issue for quite some time now. It's a crazy story, and I would really appreciate patience and kindness with any advice on what to do. Some disclaimers: I have been to therapy multiple times for things including my GAD and insecurity, and I have a history of manipulation in family and friend relationships, so it can be hard for me to identify unhealthy relationships and behaviors sometimes. It took me a long time to realize these behaviors were wrong and harmful to me as a person. I don't mean to come off as naive or dumb.

Here goes. My BF and I are long distance, USA to AUS, started dating July 2018. I was 18 at this time. We have a super positive, healthy relationship. From early on he told me about his past relationship, how it was super negative and she cheated on him, and they broke up on friendly/respectful terms but did not keep in touch since it was a pretty awkward breakup. I didn't concern myself much with it because it was a past relationship and had nothing to do with me and any trust issues were worked on by my BF and I with less of a focus on past partners. Everything was just fine until I noticed my BF's ex started watching my Instagram stories periodically in like December or so, and consistently in January and February 2019. It caused me an insane amount of anxiety because I was insecure and confused why she was looking at my profile. Btw this was before you could limit who sees your stories. My BF said to just block her, but I as a girl know that you can tell if someone blocks you and I was worried about making her mad and causing her to reach out to my BF about any issues. Well, I finally blocked her and it happened! She reached out to him asking if there were problems because she was happy for us etc, so I messaged her myself and explained it was just making me uncomfortable since we don't know each other. From then on, we kind of started talking in a friendly way, she said she is used to being friends with her ex's partners and wanted to express her kindness to me since ""my BF is a great person."" My BF didn't really care if we were in contact as long as she didn't text him or anything. So we talked periodically and eventually followed each other on socials bc I was trying to be nice and civil, not rude like my own parents (who are divorced and remarried) or my rude ex's partners. We were pretty good friends until about May 2019 when my BF's family started questioning me being friends with her. I guess at the time the girl, we'll call her Grace, said she was trying to show she had changed and wanted to be a good friend to me. She was genuinely nice and stuff so I never had a problem with talking to her. The only sus thing that really happened was one day Grace texted my BF and basically apologized for being so shitty in the past, she's changed a lot and is really committed to her BF then, and she wanted to be friends again. It did bother me but my BF didn't take up her offer of being friends. I told her we should probably not talk as much though because of my partner's family's concern. So we didn't talk for a while.

Then, in July 2019 my grandfather passed away and I was in a terrible state mentally. I was having a lot of family issues and my closest friends at the time were toxic, so I asked my bf if it was okay to reach out to Grace in this lonely time since she had been so nice to me. He said sure, again he didn't really mind as long as she didn't talk to him, so Grace and I were friends again until December 2019. In those months, there would be minor things that bugged me (just kind of offensive things that I personally disagree with but it wasn't against me personally), but things were fine and she was just another nice person to talk to. Things started to go to shit though in December. My bf was really struggling with his mental health, and I was really struggling feeling worthy as a partner and feeling like my support was enough. One day I vaguely talked about it with Grace, and she ended up saying ""his depression had made her get fired from a job and drop out and make her depressed too."" That was super off-putting to me bc I know my BF's history and his weakest moments and I know for a fact her statements were exaggerations. I was also disgusted she made it sound like his mental health was a huge inconvenience to her. Then, while she went to bed that night (AUS night and my day), my BF found out from his friend that she had tried to hook up with his best friend at the time way earlier in the relationship when they had broken up for a few days. That was before she cheated on him. That was the tipping point, my BF had me block her on everything because he was so disgusted with her actions and the nerve she had to befriend me. she cursed him out over text because ""she was just trying to be a mature adult and not be rude and ignore me,"" then he blocked her too. 

I know that it is a lot and of course from the beginning I should have ignored it more or something. Overall, the entire relationship and interactions with Grace deeply affected my anxiety, as I wondered if she still liked my BF even though she was dating someone, I was super insecure because I felt her looks are superior, and just the fact that she is in AUS and I am not. The anxiety still bothers me pretty frequently and I always worry she will reach back out again and I don't know what to do. She is so unpredictable and I feel like she at any time could message me or my BF. So, what are good ways to move on from her toxic presence and let go of her presence on social media? I just don't know how to shake this anxiety. Thank you in advance, I know this is a lot.",22Apr2020,1

665,"Incoming wall of text, so bear with me. I work in a construction lab testing soil and concrete. It's not my ideal job and it's not where I saw myself working but it's a decent paycheck and the company has good benefits and I get to drive a company truck.  Problem is I work with one of the most annoying, toxic, and arrogant assholes I've ever had the displeasure of meeting in my life. He is younger than me by a few years but is the lab manager (I went back to school for civil engineering in my mid-20s - his daddy also is good friends with the CEO for what it's worth). He is a complete and total narcissistic bastard that is constantly criticizing everything I do, badmouthing other people behind their back, and generally creating an extremely uncomfortable work environment for me and the other technicians. He is the quentissential stereotype of the douchey I.T. nerd that thinks anyone who doesn't know how to program a computer is a complete idiot and that he is a superior genius. 

The most frustrating part is tht the upper management all seem to like him however because he knows how to put on a good face for the bosses. His arrogant behavior and know-it-all attitude make it torturous for me to interact with him in a job where communication with your coworkers is essential. Don't know a specific detail of a test we have never preformed before? He will talk to you like he is Einstein and you are a knuckle dragging bafoon. Do something in a way that slightly deviates from his preferences? You're wrong, you're stupid, and if you disagree he will not relent. You're actually right about something that he tries to arrogantly correct you on? No apology, no admission of being incorrect , just shifts the blame to something/someone else for not giving him all the information to be correct. Many times throughout the day I fantasize about telling him off, telling him to go fuck himself, and quitting on the spot.

I've requested since December to be moved to a different department of our company since I genuinely do like the other people at our company. I was told that by February when construction picked up in our area that they would get me out on some different jobs. But so far, nothing. I never cited his behavior as a reason for wanting a transfer because I don't want to seem like a drama queen or have to pit his word against mine since he has clout in the company. During the quarantine our business is considered to be essential so it is just him, myself, and a handful of other people around, and I cannot bear it any longer. I've dealt with asshole customers, I've dealt with ball breaking contractors getting on your ass, my father is a Marine and I've dealt with criticism and tough love, but this isidious little coniving, scheming, and narcissistic undermining I cannot take much longer. 

I've thought about writing our department head about this but as I said I fear that they won't believe me and that nothing will be done except that my reputation within the company will suffer and be seen as ""being sensitive"" or whatever.

670,"I keep having dreams in the theatre room of the school I went to last semester. I’m pretty sure it’s because I was in the class and I had a crush on a kid that was also in there. 

Okay so the dream was at first me going to see one of their plays because my friend was in it. Everyone knows how dreams are so it turned out to be just like a dress rehearsal. My sister was with me and she knows I like this kid in the class so she tried setting us up. He doesn’t like me back which is fine you know I can’t force him to like me. But anyways I don’t remember exactly what but I guess he was talking to his friend but I was standing there and listening. The friend asked a question and said boy said something and I don’t remember what. What I do remember is this kid said the n word with a hard r. (Keep in mind he is white, therefore cannot say the n word) I got so mad and walked away and then I like told the teacher something but don’t remember what. So I hid on the floor of one of the rows of seats and she starts asking something and then she asks who they think has a crush on this kid. After a while I am discovered and I had a little argument with this kid. Again we know how dreams work so then suddenly we’re all pretty close to Canada. He starts saying something about who wouldn’t wanna see Donald Trump and I said I’d rather cross the border and go to Canada or something because although I’ve never been there, I want to live there. Here’s the thing, sometimes I’ve thought he was a trump supporter and I don’t know if this dream means that he is. (I am not a trump supporter and personally wouldn’t want to date one, nor someone who says the n word if they’re not black) next thing you know me and this kid are arguing I guess. Then all of a sudden I’m on the bus ride home from school and me and my sister get off in our old neighborhood we’re my dad used to live.

673,"My friend needed some money. The corona stuff is happening, she has to pay for somewhere to stay and she has a kid. I’ve given her money in the past when she needed it so it’s not a big deal as far as I’m concerned. She decided that asking me for money made her feel weird so she wanted to turn it into a business transaction. The transaction being she would send me a series of nudes already on her phone in return for the money. During the five year duration of our friendship, although platonic, she had sent me a lot of nude photos. We’re talking about in the literal hundreds. It was routine, she likes attention. I agreed to make it a transaction. 

I sent her the money. She acknowledged it but didn’t send me anything back. I waited a few hours and asked for the product, she sent me a message saying “yea no im arguing with my ex” followed by silence. I’m annoyed at this point. It’s not about the photos. It’s about the fact that it’s a transaction. If I were to go to McDonald’s and pay them but not get a burger, I’d be pretty frustrated. A few hours later, I send another message asking about them. She doesn’t answer until the next morning. Provides me an excuse regarding another personal problem between her and her (ex?) boyfriend. We have a conversation that can be described as “life’s a bitch, we both have problems,” and in the end she even said she’d send them by the end of the night. She never did. The next morning after sending a quick reminder about the fact that she owes me, she responds with another excuse trying to make me seem like a dick for asking for them. It would take her less than a minute to send the photos yet she is not. I have already sent her the payment. 

I’m not unsympathetic about her problems. I get it but we all have problems. We made a deal and I held up my end of the bargain, she’s not holding up hers.

676,"So bit of a strange one.
Me (M20) and my cousin (M22) have been close all our whole lives, his father passed away at a young age and we basically were best mates; to the point where I’d spend more time with him than my friends from school. 
In 2018, I was really not enjoying my job and he was just finishing university when he decided to go for a job at a company which will remain nameless however they employ over 1000 people just at one location. 
He went for a job and was accepted for an interview which was great news, I was very happy for him and still wasn’t satisfied where I was and that’s when he suggested me going for an opening at the some workplace. 
I was a little unsure to begin with but before I knew it I had a phone call from them offering me an interview which was great news. We had been talking about how we could carpool to work together and it’d be great to know each other there and maybe even work together. Or so I thought that was still the case. 
As soon as I told him that I got an interview he claimed I was “stepping on his toes” on his first job out of university. 

He later said that he wished he had said sooner but it was such a shock and an incredibly fast change of how he felt about our friendship. He said that we should spend much less time apart. He said that if I should think very long about what I want to do as if I went for the job interview we wouldn’t be friends anymore (sounds very childish I know but that’s the only way I can explain it). 

Fast forward 2 years I still do not understand what happened and have reached out numerous times and offered on an internal messaging system at work where I now work with him to catch up as I feel it would be good to get it all out in the open. Each time I’ve either been blocked or told no but I can’t seem to move forward. He acts like he doesn’t know me at work at all and it’s so intense whenever I see him.

Am I in the wrong? I am told constantly that I’m not but I can’t help but think for something so rash to happen I must be at least somewhat to blame for something?

I know its a person thats watching me on my phone cause when im watching a youtube video and the same number comes up it also says the same thing, when im playing a video game it says can you please play him and play that like BRO PLEASE SHUT THE FUCK UP.

I think its so obsessed with me that it has to show 24/7 that he or she is watching me and has an opinion on what is happening, i know its a person looking cause when i go outside for a while without my phone i dont hear anything at all, all i feel is my nose leaking which apparently in psychology means someone is thinking about you.

This person is so annoying please god help me or someone tell me what i can do.

my grandma is some sort of a mother-figure to me but as i’ve been growing up i’ve just seen through my family so much that i lost the respect towards them, it doesn’t mean that i’m disrespectful and mean, i just keep to myself a lot and don’t spend time with them and don’t share anything about myself because of them judging everything and putting through their standards of thinking which are very narrow; they’re those typical closed minded people who think they know everything the best and their way is the best way for everyone

yesterday she started screaming about the tissues sticking out too much of the trash can and that i don’t push them in like i apparently should. 
i never talk back when she screams or tries to start a fight, i’m hearing it all but don’t ever say anything so it’s kinda like ignoring, and when i do that she gets frustrated so she tries to get under my skin by saying some hurtful and personal things which is really not pleasant.
i’m a very calm and peaceful person and i just hate it when someone screams at me or just tries to fight me especially for stupid reasons like that.
i know that’s a toxic behavior from her and the day after when she cools down she’s actin a bit sad that i ignore and don’t talk to her her right now. the worst thing is that i always feel a bit guilty about it and i start talking to her couple days later and the cycle repeats itself as if me being finally nice to her is a vulnerability that she can exploit again, kind of like a green light to start some shit again.

how should i act right now if i don’t want to be on bad terms but i also don’t want to get screamed at for stupid things like that

686,"A couple of things I want to clarify before I get into this post:

* I work with my dad.
* I don't live under the same roof as my dad. I live in one of the properties he owns.
* Where we live we have 2 cars. A Tacoma that we use to get to work, and a trailblazer without insurance (""My"" car).
* What my brother did is out of character.
* My dad hasn't paid me for 2 weeks.

 My brother and I were getting ready to go to work this morning when my brother just left without me. I see a missed call from my dad around an hour later with an angry text message saying how he's going to take my car away and charge me rent for being lazy. I tell him that my brother just left without me, and he replies by saying ""stop making excuses."" He keeps calling me names, so I just tell him that he should pay me before I work with him again. He brushes off my concern and threatens me again. I tell him that if he's going to take my car, then he should pay me back all the money I've put into fixing it ($1000). He replies with ""that's not going to happen."" 

First off I'm extremely grateful that he allows me to live at one of his places without charging me rent, but he constantly threatens me by saying he'll charge me rent, or he won't pay me if something remotely annoys him. He's super controlling and I keep finding myself under his influence somehow. How should I convince him to pay me as well as give me the money that I put into fixing the trailblazer?

689,"So my bestie and I have been best friends going on twenty years now. I love her to the moon and beyond and I know she’s loves me that same way.

Two years ago we started living together and no before you go off saying ‘that was your first problem’ let me make this very clear. We get long splendidly with the occasional spat like any friendship.

Now all of our recent spats have been about my besties lack of motivation, laziness and overall disregard for the cleanliness of our shared areas in the apartment which is driving me up the wall because I happen to be OCD clean. 

Some of the biggest issues are stacks/sinks full of dishes that can be left for up to three days at a time when there are just two of us. She doesn’t reuse her crockery and utensils whereas I do, so her chore is to to do the dishes and clean the kitchen because she’s always cooking and/or baking which can get quite messy. 

FYI we have a Dishwasher which I have no problem with being used but instead of using her brain and stacking the dishwasher till it’s full enough to use she’s just leaves it all lying around and when I tell he she could’ve stacked the dishwasher her excuse is always ‘oh,yeah or oh, I forgot.’ 

This infuriates me to no end because that’s all I ever get from her, I can understand Aspergers but she’s high functioning and she knows what she’s doing. She can do the house work but she’s being lazy and choosing not to, instead gaming on her PlayStation from the moment she wakes up.  

There’ll be empty packets of crisps or foods, empty sauce bottles, tissues on the floor from her bouts of hey fever, empty soda cans on coffee table? ‘Oh, I forgot’ it is that bloody hard to put things in the bin once your finished with them?!?! 

I have tried reminders, I’m tried asking nicely, yelling, pleading, cursing, even getting to the point of screaming at her where I had to leave the house because I would have said something I would regret. I’ve been dealing with this for two years and I’m at my wits end. 

I have made a board that lists all our chores AM/PM chores lists and days and she hasn’t used it once since I brought it a month ago. 

I can’t kick her out because she has no where to go and I have no one else to ask to live with me. I’m tempted to either smack her or restrict her from the internet or something that will actually get her attention other than me ended up in the mental hospital again.

691,"What would you do if you were in this situation?

Soooo I’ve been in a relationship since I was very young.. (same person)

A few years later we moved in together with his family...

His family has made it known from the beginning that they don’t like me... they always make racist black jokes towards me... I’ve never heard a racial slur in Spanish so I wasn’t familiar... but, I’ve always picked up on it... (they were calling me racial slurs and using racial references since they’ve met me)

There’s been lots of other issues, but I want to direct this post towards a specific person.... my SO brother has made my life hell since I’ve met him... he has convinced his entire family that I’m this bad person and now nobody talks to me... years before, he was stealing from his own mother and I was being blamed for it... one because I am the outsider, two because I am black.. (his grandmothers words not mine).... His brother has called me a slut, bitch, nagger (change letter), etc.... since knowing me, he has stolen my pictures, money, burned my clothes, he started eating my food (I didn’t eat anything that they made back then, so, I purchased my own food).... so, I was getting sick and losing a lot of weight. He caused me a lot of medical issues.

Fast forward 2019, I heard him saying that he was going to pay someone and have me raped, he said that he wanted to find and pay someone to have me beaten, and that I would deserve it... he also said that he hopes someday his brother beats tf out of me and eventually killing me.... he has been stalking and harassing me online... he came across one of my social media accounts which would’ve been impossible for him to come across because I don’t use any of my personal info... 

I have never done anything to this guy to deserve the things that he’s done to me... the only thing I’ve done to him is call him a fag... (because he’s actually gay) and his family never stopped bringing it up... I just don’t understand why something I’ve done in hs is so much worse than what he’s currently doing... 

Do you believe that he would truly act on it? 

Let me add, I’ve tried to be the better person so many times but they won’t just let things stay the way they were.... I’ve told his brother many times that it’s fine that he doesn’t like me, I don’t like him either, and that he needs to stay away from me.. I told him that I don’t wanna talk to him, be around him, or have anything to do with him and that completely enraged him.... I don’t understand why he harasses me if he doesn’t like me... my friend and his friends are mutual friends and they’ve all told me to be careful and stay away from him because he’s said crazy things...

I never wanted to develop feelings to a woman who’s with someone else — especially one that’s engaged for a while— because it just feels so weak. I don’t want to be so vulnerable mentally and emotionally. I always felt this mindset, wanting someone who’s with someone else, was for the weak. Yet here I am all of a sudden. If I tell her, that’ll screw up the friendship. If I keep quiet for as long as I know her than I’m a loser. And I don’t feel comfortable “waiting” to see if they’ll eventually break up. 

We talk pretty frequently. About life and about music. She has teased and joked with me so I think she kinda likes me that way, but is loyal to her relationship, which in general is good. You don’t see that a whole lot today.

702,"Hey everyone,

So I work for the state where I am from as a radio technician. I have been here full time for 2 years. There is a promotion opportunity in a bigger city about an hour away from where I live where my managers really want me to apply. The job would be a promotion and I would get a pretty good initial pay increase and would ultimately lead to a higher earning potential.

I am having trouble deciding to apply as I want to be more than just a radio technician in my career. I would like to do more things that would lead me to a management role and get promoted in other areas In this state department however, management would probably not happen until way down the road. I am concerned that if I take this job that I will put myself in a box so to speak and limit my opportunities for management or other high up positions outside of just “technical” work. On the other side, if I don’t take it there could be a long period of time before another promotion happens and is unclear as to what that would be. 

There is another non technical position opening where I live currently with the same department that wouldn’t be as big as a pay increase but it would be a complete 180 as to what I am doing now. My thought on that job was that it could potentially give me more time to focus on getting another degree in a non technical field and complete management like trainings. Ideally I want to develop my skills and resume to help me move up the state ladder as quick as possible.

Apart from my career path the new position would be about an hour to an hour and a half away if I decide to commute and if I choose to live up there the cost of living increase would diminish my pay raise.

So, I’m kinda in a tough spot lol. Would you guys have any advice? Do you think it would be beneficial to take the job in a different city to test my comfort zone and learn more technical skills? Or do you think school could be a better option to move up the state ladder?

I have always felt trapped wherever I go. People, places, social media posts, and other things just remind me of bad memories and an old life i can barely remember. 

For example, certain restaurants remind me of old friends, or ex's, and I can't shake the feeling. I've deleted my social media, I've tried to cut down on talking to old friends and trying to rebuild myself, but I just feel like moving away is the best option.

I am paid decently, the insurance is expensive, though. I couldn't move up unless I went to school and got a degree in nursing. I am very comfortable there.

For the last year, we became very short staffed and I started applying elsewhere last year because I was working alone on the floor with 25 residents and I wasn't getting extra pay or any recognition at all. Since then, I have gotten a new coworker and things are better in that aspect, as long as that coworker actually stays.

721,"Today is the one year anniversary of my(f26) dad(m57) serving my mom(f53) with divorce papers. It is also the day before their wedding anniversary. My dad filed for divorce after 30 years of marriage and it broke my mom. My dad has son mental health issues- I think bipolar or some form of ptsd but he’s never been officially diagnosed. He had a really bad childhood with his mom, dad, and stepmom and between the 3 of them experience literally every kind of abuse(mental, physical, sexual)4-5 years ago he had an experience happen with an older lady that was so much like his abusive stepmom it triggered him and he wasn’t the same person for years. Like literal years- and it all came down on my mom. 

He blamed her for why we was hating his life because she was the closest person in proximity. We were visiting and he’d come home from work and she’d ask him about his day and where he went for lunch and he would give minimum answers until he got so tired of her asking questions he would blow up about her “trying to control him”. He was not well. 

Now he is living across the country for probably the last 5-6 months and I think he is seeing that it wasn’t my mom that was making him miserable and asked my mom to help find him a counselor and she did. And that he loves her and wants to be with her and he is so so so sorry. My mom wants more than anything to reconcile and have her husband back- but she knows that he isn’t quite back yet and told him she would only consider getting back together with him if he went to therapy and worked out his own issues and got the help he needed. He FaceTimes me every day and he does seem like a different person than he was when he left. My mom did say that if he does end up doing therapy then it will be “step 1 of 1000” but she has hope.

I asked another one of my roommates what they thought, and if I might be overreacting, but apparently she told my landlord about the conversation.

726,"tw/suicide-abuse 
hey guys ! 

I (F18) wanted to share my (quite long) story for advice and sorry in advance for mistakes cause I speak french.
Everything begun in april 2019 when I learned that my parents were secretly planning for a while to move back to their country and take all their kids with them. 
They’re the typical muslim immigrant parents who criticize non-muslim/non-conservative people, wouldn’t let me go out \at with any of my friends even when I was 8, extremely strict rules in and out the house etc... but I didn’t complain bcs I still found out ways to do that at times and they were still kind people who provided me what I asked for.
My dad was also the « beast » (my mom became it afterwards) , when I was a child I witnessed physical abuse st but mostly moral abuse on her. I feel like I never got to have a childhood.
Sooo when I found out that they wanted to go back AND MARRY ME TO MY COUSIN like wtf incest dude??? I freacked out;  starting to cry whenever I was under too much pressure even in class, I talked about it to my friends and they suggested me to move at their place until I found a solution but I turned it down bcs it was too risky : my father knew where all my friends lived and even if he didn’t he would found out + I was too sacred ,my father being extremely nervous he would be able to kill (in the namr of god or « honor).
So fast forward to summer I was still planning to go get admission to my nursing school and I needed to get my medical record and do some other stuff to finalize my file at my doctor AND my dad came with to get his treatments (for his BP, heart , diabetes ;he also had a stroke a year earlier and this made even hard for me to leave). So he comes with me and I tell my doctor about my future ambitions and he without holding goes MAD , like he started screaming at me things like « I’m your old father, i need peace now and go to my homeland, you’re a disappoint and on top of that you are not ashamed that you want to become a shitty nurse what would people think about that? .... » I bursted in tears and he took my file with him, when we got out he tore it up. 
Throughout the entire summer I had fights with my parents : I told them that I did not wanna go , them fighting me and trying that i would feel guilty, my mom trying to physically abuse me and it goes on... 
I went to the social services and they told me that they can’t do anything because I’m not 18 yet so I pretty much lost hope. One time I was at my friend’s house (I convinced them to let me go bcs I told them that I would be moving away anyway) and it got a little late so he showed up and threw me in the car , shouted at my friend’s mom and even hit me in front of them ,I was so embarrassed, and one home he strangled me with my mom and locked my in my room for 2days. Things eventually went down and it was « okay » again.
My flight was for Pakistan was coming closer and closer, and I was panicking because when you come from a family like mine where Islamic and cultural morals take over the simple fact that you’re a human being and you have feelings and ambitions too, you’re fucked up. I knew if I ran away my mom (even if she did fucked up things to me) would pay for my actions as well as my little sisters and brothers , my dad could have another stroke, my little sister(15)could get married to the 30 years cousins and I didn’t want for her to go through that.
My mom eventually convinced me to come for just 1year to see how I felt there and if I didn’t like it she would send me back to Belgium and I believed her idk why but I did the biggest mistake that ruined my life.
It’s been now 8months I’ m in Pakistan and at first it was okay like I attended a weeding , i went out with my czns, took driving classes bcs meanwhile i turned 18 ...i was living my best 1 year holiday.
SO one day my mom said you need to go to college and I went like why? I’m gonna to back anyway in some months I don’t want and I can’t even read or write Urdu. That’s when the problems started : I told her that I would never her nephew that I would rather die and you know what she did ? She hit me because I insulted her dear favourite nephew . THIS WOMAN ??? When i tell her that i want to go back she laughs at my face and insults me , says me that i « want to become a whore like the western sluts », « what sin she did to have  a daughter like me » « she would kill me bcs i’m not an obedient muslim girl » 
Sometimes i’m in the room and she will start insulting me just for the fact that I don’t want to talk to her or that i don’t come and sit with her and i can’t even tell all the hurtful things she does to me

she disgusted me from islam, my culture, from my entire family. They are ALL against me bcs they learned how to pray but I didn’t , I left reading the Quran, talking to them....I just want to die , I don’t see any way out or any purpose to live 
they crushed my soul, my love for them I’m so tired for all this bullshit, of islam ,of them of everything
My little brothers and sisters even tell me to go marry my cousin so that i would die can you believe that?
I’m litteraly crying writing this


I thought that my parents’s love was unconditional but after all this i think I was too naive and that i minimized the things they did before, that’s the biggest regret in my life and probably the last one if I don’t find a way out
I dont want to die but I want to end all this suffering that never ends, they already killed my soul so what difference would it make? They all say I should die anyway so it will be a pleasant surprise no?",22Apr2020,0
727,"I got back in touch with some old friends I haven't seen in years several months ago, naturally, some of them are guys. There's one dude in particular who's company I really enjoy, so I've been making honest attempts at having meaningful conversations with him that go beyond surface level BS (this isn't an action of mine that's isolated to this one dude, this is just me); he ghosted me pretty hard after a few months. Weeks of silence went by, so I chose to directly ask him what's up. He told me that my attempts to have those conversations made him uncomfortable because he thought that I was looking to get into a romantic relationship with him. That couldn't be farther from the truth! But he didn't ask so he didn't know so he shat on our friendship.

Unfortunately, this is far from the first time this kind of situation has happened to me; sometimes it looks different like dude wanting to be involved sexually or romantically when I don't be etc.

And, honestly, it would be easy for me to dismiss this as ""dudes just having sex on the brain,"" right? But I can't do that. Is there some kind of way that I could have interacted with the guy in the above example that would have led to a different outcome? Should I just assume most dude-girl friendships are likely to be surface level? Cuz I can't do small talk. It pains me.

She can't seem to get a permanent job, doesn't have close relationship with her parents or have any real friends (only people she met online). When he tried to break up with her, she threatened to suicide. My friend is now committing another 6 months with her so he can help her build her life and then break up with her once she is more stable.

I am trying to explain to him that he is just giving her hope and that it won't be any easier in 6 months, but he thinks that if he helps her build things in her life to hold to she will be able to move on easier and won't threaten to suicide again. I explained to him that she will likely cling and depend even more on him in 6 months. She already started making plans of moving in with him in 3 weeks and he does not want that. She always plans for their future and already said he is ""the one"" after less than 3 weeks of dating. She is 27. He is 30.

734,"TL;DR - He keeps everything from old clothes &amp; shoes to all the kids toys they’ve ever owned to every single piece of paper they have from school. We’ve downsized into a new home and need to get rid of *some* of the stuff he likes to hold onto. He says I’m insensitive.



Before you guys envision a “hoarders” episode, it’s not quite that bad. We live in a clean home and effectively get rid of our waste (old food, plastic silverware, trash, etc.) To a degree, I understand his keeping things for sentimental reasons. A band t shirt from a concert he attended once. A plaque with the birth of his daughter inscribed. Small memorabilia such as  that, sure. 

However, we are expecting a new addition to our family. I’m due in September. We recently moved to a new home that’s more cost efficient for our needs, but also 2 rooms smaller. We need to downsize A LOT. Our master bedroom is going to double as the baby’s nursery for the duration of our stay in this home.

At our last place, the entire downstairs was his storage area for all of the toys the kids have ever owned, broken CD’s, notebooks from high school, shoes that have the soles ripped out, every cord for every electronic that’s ever been bought. This stuff was mostly organized by totes and trash bags. I let him move it all with us from the last residence, under the condition that it all be sorted through. Toys that are for toddlers sold in a yard sale. Stuff that holds high sentimental value, either turned into wall decorations, or stored away in totes. We lived there for approximately 10 months and it was hardly ever touched safe to go find an envelope or look for a Barbie doll outfit.

Now we have a swift timeline (1 week) to get it all sorted out and get rid of what we don’t need and bring the stuff we’re keeping to the new place and we’re planning to do that this weekend. In preparation of the gobs and gobs of useless stuff he’s going to try and bring to our new (cramped) living quarters, I decided to go through our clothes while he’s at work. I told him I’m going to go ahead and store most of our winter clothes and get rid of stuff that doesn’t fit us or isn’t fashionable anymore. 

I’ve pulled out each dresser drawer of his so far and I have a 13 gallon trash bag FILLED with clothes that haven’t fit him since high school, t shirts with holes in them, stuff that hasn’t been in fashion for 15 years. I told him he can look through it when he gets home and if he *needs* to keep any of it, we can discuss it, but it’s been sitting in the bottom of this dresser for at minimum the two years we’ve been together.

He says I’m being an ass by getting rid of shorts with a 29” waist whenever he’s now a 34” waist. I understand remembering and wishing you were smaller. If he’d just started an exercise program or something and was working towards fitting into that stuff again, I agree it would be insensitive for me to want rid of it. However, I invite him to work out with me 2-3 times a week, and he always finds an excuse not to do so. He eats a “meats and potatoes” diet and drinks copious amounts of pop/energy drinks. He works a desk job. Those inches aren’t going anywhere and it’s wasting space (as in closet space) we desperately need for the baby’s stuff. 

How in the world am I going to get him to stop being so stubborn about holding onto unneeded items?",22Apr2020,1

737,"I (19F)  live with my mom (50F) is a decent sized city. She and dad are married but stay seperated and she's a homemaker. She is reluctant to try out new things. Says that doing the chores of the house is more than enough for her. She has a bachelor's degree in science. I chose to stay back in the city for college (bachelor's in engineering from an average to bad college. Not bragging but I was one of the best back in high school; debates, arts, science, school council etc) to mainly be with her. She barely has any friends here and without me, the house is practically empty. Hence, stay back made sense.

We're well off and dad never raises questions about spendings. 

It's like my exposure is being limited and so is hers. She talks about the past a lot and cries whenever I say rude (but honest) things to her.

I want her to get out and live life and have fun. I want her to see and embrace new things. We can be a team having fun and rooting for each other! She can't live like she's 70 right now, right?


She thinks raising me whilst seperated with dad (wasn't as rocky, to be honest) was an act of extreme bravery. I want her to be more than a housewife who raised a kid while seperated. I want her to be someone, See more, do more, make use of her education. I'm not doing the best in life right now and she thinks what I'm telling her is just a manifestation of my own frustrations.

Last year around this time, my soon to be sister in law and I were the best of friends. Which was so nice because we spend Thursdays-Sunday’s together because we are (almost) family and she runs in the same friend group as my fiancé and I. Well after my fiancé proposed, she ended up not liking me anymore. She went behind my back to my fiancé on his birthday and screamed at him about how much she hates me. And yes, she did this in front of everyone including my brother. We’ve tried working it out, but she just keeps finding more reasons to hate me. Yes, some things I needed to work on, and I have. Everyone has things they need to improve on, so I was happy to do so. But she finds every reason to not like me. She goes around saying such awful and hurtful things about me, she retweet’s/tweets things directed at me, and every time I try to be nice to her, she snubs me. It’s gotten so bad that she won’t even look in my direction when I’m around. She’s 23 years old and I’m 21 so there is a little bit of an age difference. Her family has told me multiple times that this is just how she is and to just hold my ground because she won’t stop until she’s happy with herself. My fiancé has tried to talk to his sister and that only made things worse so I told him just let her run her course and let her cool off, but it’s almost been a year now and things still aren’t ok between us.

We live together in an RV we bought over a year ago with our two dogs. Our relationship is amazing and I could never see myself with anyone else, obviously ups and downs but I love her to death.

Our problem comes from the bedroom, I truly enjoy going down on here (could do it everyday) and she turns me on a TON... but I can't get comfortable enough to let her go down on me. It's a mix of control issues and low self-esteem, but I am not sure how to fix the problem. I had a sexually abusive boyfriend and after him, it's EXTREMELY hard for me to relax when I am not in control during sex. I also find her 10x more attractive than myself which makes me self-conscious about how I appear, and before when I was dating men there was never a direct comparison between ourselves.

Since the begining of quarntine we had nothing to do so we used to chat on the phone daily. It was all going well and i used to joke a lot. Until one day i slipped and called her a hooker, i didnt mean it in a demeaning way. It was a joke we used to say before
But this time she took it to heart and wont talk to me. When ever i apologize she would either ignore my text or remind me i called her a hooker and then proceed to ignore me. 

I know I am mistaken in this situation and that because we were so close she was really hurt, but i generally dont know what to do now. This has been on since 6 days and would really aprreciate any advice on how to approach this situation",22Apr2020,1

I kept lying to myself to my abusive parents were perfect, my high school bulles we're gonna make me stronger and that I had a happy childhood. All these lies used to let me live my life in peace, now it's been over 3 years of clinical depression and I just can't seem to move on with my life.

746,"So I am a singer and I've always wanted to play the guitar. I play the piano but I've always wanted the independence of being able to play my own little shows but was alway too busy in my band where I was a frontwoman and a singer. So now that the band is on a break/hiatus I picked up a ukelele to warm up before transferring to playing guitar and I shared a video on my stories of me learning. I've heard from some mutual friends that im being laughed at for playing the ukelele and that my ""attempts at learning it are pathetic"". After that mutual friend told me that I noticed that the first people who see and share my stories are male friends of my bandmates who were always against me cause they believed the boys would be a much more manly and badass band with a guy on vocals. So those people are more like friends of my friends, not my close friends. I've heard they make fun of me that I can't handle a guitar and that now I won't be a rock singer anymore but a ""indie delicate soft flower girl and move to Hawai"". 

I understand that maybe this isn't a big problem but somehow that hatethered got to me today. I suspect its because of quarantine but I just would like to ask you guys for some advice on how to now care about what my past friends or just distant acquaintances think of me.

747,"Hi all,

I'm a grad  student in the UK, currently staying away from my family as I've got a lot of work to get through and I wanted to avoid having to do it with my huge bio family buzzing around me in one house.  I've been having issues regarding my mother's genuinely weird behaviour towards me and now that she's confined in one space for a longer period, I think she's going crazier and taking it out on me.

To put it  lightly: she likes to ""compliment"" my body. But those compliments are really fucking creepy.   
I was 14 when we went dress shopping for an event I had to attend, and she commented on my boobs and downstairs area in such a creepy and disgusting way I had a huge panic attack in the changing room and also back in my room (and as a result, I genuinely hate shopping and also anyone making a comment on my body- either positive or negative). But because she's very strict in terms of me being critical of her (=she always turns it into ""you're an ungrateful lil shit and I know what's best for you, you know fuck all and don't respect my feelings"" speech even now) I haven't said anything. like, ever. and it's starting to get to me.  When I'm at my parents', she takes pics of me (ofc without my consent) saying that's something for her to hold on to later when I'm not with them, and when I try to avoid the camera, she'll stick it right in front of my face and hold me in a way I can't avoid the lense. Then as soon as I'm abroad, she starts going through those pics and ""complimenting"" my body (I say ""compliment"" because she puts it in a very creepy and not compliment-y way that makes me wanna puke my guts out). I don't skype or facetime with her as I'm not comfortable with that, I've done it in the past but she'd only stuck her camera in my face and keep taking pics of me (I usually turned my camera off asap but then she'd start screaming and emotionally using me- ""I haven't seen you in so long"" and such). I don't want to invalidate her feelings but how she shows them makes me super uncomfortable and frankly, piss-scared. 

Now to put a bit of a spin into my situation: she's a life and business coach. Also for parents. Got certified only about a year ago. Tells herself and on her website that she's the shit. She has photos I took but never gave or sent to her on her blog. I don't know how it got there but frankly, I'm fucking terrified. I can't trust her with my personal or private stuff (as I've learned from my past mistakes of trusting her with my academic record, or my friends' non-personal non-private stuff-that I actually made up as a test of if I can trust her- the whole fucking town knew within a day) yet she tries to speak with me in a way that she believes I would confide in her with my private matters (e.g. if she wants to find out if I have a partner, or an active sexual life, she'll start talking in a sexualized way). I always have to wear a bra and underpants once I'm at theirs because she'll comment and/or touch me there. I'm not sure what to do but she's driving me batshit crazy.  She tries to get to coach me on personal stuff, as a practice for her and a therapy for free for me, but I don't think that I can trust that- she's told me the names of her clients a couple times, asking me if I knew them.  I don't think cutting her off is a safe thing to do because she's very much willing to go to extreme lengths. But I do know that I need to do something. She's inside my head and it's affecting my life in a negative way...",22Apr2020,1
748,"Hey.

19M. Firstly, I should say, that me and her both have been through tough times. Not really as tough as much people or even you have gone through, but still, a fair share of sh*t. 

We met and quickly became good friends, and eventually became very close, unearthing our secrets and telling each other about our problems and insecurities. We both lacked self-esteem, were pretty socially awkward and generally weren't sure in what days to come hold for our lives.

So a few months ago we started dating, she had a few mental breakdowns about how horrible she is, but everything seemed pretty good, until today. It was, of course, predictable, something everyone experiences eventually.

Today she wrote a whole essay about how she feels that she's dragging me down, has nothing to give me and it's time for us to go our separate ways because she doesn't want me to go down with her. She constantly refuses to accept that someone actually cares for her and is genuinely sure that she's a nasty mess. Of course, that's not true for me, I love her and really care for her, and I can see that it's mutual.

I told her that I give her as much time as she wants to think about what she really wants, not what she thinks is ""worthy"" of.

So is it a real issue? Should I just wait for her to come to her senses? Should I do something? Or is she just being an energetic vampire/lying to me so she can break up with me and find another guy? Really confused and not sure what to do.

TL;DR gf has mental breakdowns about her being a mess from time to time and now decides to leave me so I won't be ""dragged down"" by her, what should I do

Thank you in advance.",22Apr2020,1

750,"I just want to start off by saying thanks for taking the time to read this and sincerely any advice is appreciated. 

I recently joined a discord server for a Minecraft server I play on like 2 months ago. It’s a small group of maybe 15 people, but only like 5 are actually active and stuff. 
After a while of chatting I realized that I am the youngest member of the group and the oldest member of the group is about 6 years older than me which is fine (keep in mind I’m still a minor). 

Anyways one of the older members of the group adds me and I add him back just to be nice and stuff. He talks a lot to me and I didn’t think anything of it since I’m just friendly and enjoy conversation but like it’s starting to get too personal for me. I like talking to people don’t get me wrong, but like I don’t really have anything in common with this guy since he’s significantly older than me and has no interests as me. 


It was fine at first but now he kind of constantly texts me and stuff and it’s just starting to make me uncomfortable. He’s a super nice guy don’t get me wrong, and I’d hate just to stop talking to him out of the blue because I feel like that’s super rude and inappropriate, but at the same time I don’t want to constantly talking to this guy. I would hate to make him upset or say anything weird since I enjoy the discord server itself, and wouldn’t want to ruin my relationship with the rest of the group. It’s fine just playing Minecraft and stuff with him and the rest of the group, but I feel like I don’t really want to be personally constantly talking to him. In the same regards if I say something like “this is weird and I want to stop talking because of the fact that there’s like a huge age difference” then it would seem strange because I’m literally in a discord server with a bunch of people older than me. 

I’m just looking for an excuse that can kinda get me out of this situation with the least feelings hurt. Additionally on Minecraft I started this huge building project with him and I’d hate to leave him to do it by himself but I would much rather keep our talking to the minimum.

763,"I am my moms only ""available"" daughter, my other sister is in prison and is never getting out. My other siblings are men and by default are more prone to be selfish and insensitive dicks or maybe that's just how they were raised. My mother is a saint sweetest person you will ever meet but is a complete doormat to her kids and just about anybody else. Especially to my middle brother who aside from being your average dick is also clearly dependent on drugs and alcohol is physically and verbally abusive to the mother of his child ( shes a complete POS in her own right) has pawned his kid off on my mom and is the most entitled pos I know, who's also verbally abusive to my mom. My mom for the last year has literally shared a room with her husband and dying mother because she gave the master up to my brother after he destroyed his own room fist fighting with his GF. My oldest brother and his BF are alcoholics and my youngest brother (18) is just caught in the middle and is just your typical teenage boy.

When living with my dad I was definitely living a better life and I imagine when they were living with their dad they were living a worse life since they never stayed with him long. Today we are all adults, I recently moved out of my moms into my own apt. After I did this I realized how damaging witnessing the constant abuse of my mom and others around me was. Because of Covid19 I was laid off and had to give up my apt, now I am faced with the choice of returning to a toxic environment at my mother's, with my own room home cooked meals and of course being with my mom who I love or staying with my dad who's never home and his wife.

766,"So, my (19m)  boyfriend (22m) and I have been dating for about 7 months. Now, to give a little backstory, he just got out of a long relationship of 5 years, and I was going through a “hoe phase” before I met him. Now, to maintain our trust for each other we made this rule, that neither of us would delete/hide anything. 

To keep it simple I’ll refer to my boyfriend as “Alex”.

Recently, Alex got some texts from an unknown number. So him and this number are texting for a couple hours, because he’s trying to figure out who it was. Alex “doesn’t like hurting people’s feelings” so instead of just asking “who is this?” He just keeps the convo going to find clues about who this person is. I had my suspicions from the very moment he got the texts, because of the area code the number had.

So later that night, Alex finally asks the number if it was his ex.

Yes, my suspicion was confirmed. It was ex texting him this entire time. At that point, IN MY HEAD, my boyfriend, Alex, should’ve instantly blocked the number, but that wasn’t the case. Alex kept the conversation going for just about a day. I only saw like the first 6 messages between them. The messages from his ex were along the lines of “I love you, I wanna kiss you, can we just talk” I didn’t see any of the messages after that because he deleted them. 

When I asked him why he deleted the messages, his response was “we were just talking about sensitive things from our past, that needed to stay between him and I”. So, OF COURSE, my suspicions are raised once again. So now it’s the second day, and Alex still has not blocked his ex’s number. Should I be worried that he’s just gonna continue to talk to him and delete the messages? Should I just trust my bf?

I compared my boyfriends ex to one of the guys I use to mess around with, during this “hoe phase”. And Alex’s response was “You can’t compare the two, my ex isn’t just someone I met up with to fuck on an app”. 


We had a little argument, about the rule. And I told him, he wasn’t following the “don’t delete shit” rule even before his ex texted him. He’s deleted other chats in the past. So I threw the rule out. And told him that I’m not following it anymore. He literally told me to “fuck off”, and “Unblock all the dudes you fucked”, now why was it so easy for him to talk to me that way. But he couldn’t tell his ex to leave him alone and that he’s moved on.

TLDR: My boyfriend has been talking to his ex, and deleted the messages so I wouldn’t see them.",22Apr2020,2

In pretty much every stage of my education, however, I have encountered students who go out of their way to change their behaviour around teachers (saying stuff they wouldn't normally say or lying about their interests) hoping that the teachers would treat them impartially, such as using ""professional judgement"" to give the students a small boost, marking their tests with a more forgiving mindset, etc. Sadly, for the most part, I have noticed that this behaviour does give these students an unfair advantage, leaving me confused about whether I too must change my behaviour to even the field, or if I must stay true to myself. I believe that most teachers and other authoritative figures simply recognize the hard work and interest of their students, and look past students who are trying to ""woo"" them, but my experience in the past couple of years is making it extremely difficult for me to stick to this belief. I cannot help the feeling of guilt every time I think of ""buttering up"" an authoritative figure because I feel as though I am losing a piece of my dignity and the pride I take in my work. When it comes down to my position in life versus my dignity, however, it makes logical sense that I pick my position because it means that I could be more successful in life, but I still cannot figure out whether it is immoral to do so. And going into a highly competitive field such as Medicine, I am not sure whether ""sucking up"" to professors or doctors is an essential part of being successful in university, med school, etc. So, I just wanted to hear some of your thoughts on this, which brings me to my question: To ""suck up"" or not?

773,"I am a 21 year old (white) male. In general my life is a bit complicated, so I guess I will keep it brief.
Ever since I was a kid I have always had a thing for superheroes as I spent my time watching some shows (I won't specify which exactly) that include characters that possess superpowers that can easily defeat the villains with a 9:10 chance of success.
Unfortunately as time passed by and I grew up year after year, I noticed how I am still the only person who has a dream of becoming exactly one of those superheroes with superpowers and not the ones who are just some basic soldiers, fire fighters or some doctors. Maybe the reason is not because I want to be a superhero that saves lives with his superpowers, but someone who just has superpowers and is free to do anything he wants, without any limitations. That in itself kind of contradicts the whole idea of a superhero so it is more likely to be more of a villain type of ideal.

It doesn't matter if I look up to anything related to science, biology, politics, business, art, IT, or sports. It all just looks the same to me and nothing that it offers could ever excite me or pique my interest.

777,"My brother and I cut our neighbors' lawns weekly during the summer for pay. One of our neighbors is a middle-aged divorced woman who lives alone and has numerous health problems, rendering her unable to do manual labor, so she usually asks my brother and I to take care of a few extra miscellaneous things when we mow. (Weeding, raking pine needles). She also prides herself in having one of the best gardens on the block.

Last November, she asked my brother and I if we could plant around fifty tulip bulbs before the ground froze. I want to make clear the fact that we were not paid in advance for this. For context, we live in Minnesota, where the ground typically freezes around Thanksgiving, making planting impossible after then.

We told her we would. However, a combination of poor timing and unavailability on our part resulted in my brother and I not being able to plant the bulbs before the ground froze. I have attempted to contact our neighbor through text several times since then, and she has not responded at all. She typically used to respond within a few days of us sending a message. 

I believe she is disappointed that we did not follow through on the planting, and this spring she won't have any tulips in her garden. I feel terrible about not having done this for her and am at a loss for what to do next. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!

EDIT: For context, my brother and I are both older teenagers. This is not a professional service - we're just two teens cutting lawns.",22Apr2020,1
778,"Over the last few years I’ve decided to take up new hobbies and try new things. The biggest thing being growing my hair long (I’m a guy). My parents REALLY hate my hair and have screamed at me many, many times for it. Some of the things I’ve been told include: “You’re fucking retarded.”, “You’re a shithead”, “You’re too young to make your own choices”. They don’t use that speech when their friends are around but they will berate me for it even with the friends around. My parents friends have even tried standing up for me and eventually my parents literally dragged me into a barber shop and forced me to cut it, and it really broke my heart. I didn’t talk to them for a few days after that and they tried to play the victim card. My hair has finally grown out to the the same length it was before they made me cut it and they have began getting on to me for it and I’m really tired of listening to them.

I just graduated college and I don’t have any sort of degree or experience working with animals. I’d someday love to become a nature documentarian or producer/host of a wildlife show.

782,"I work as a direct print operator at work. Basically print awards, signs, name badges, etc., things that cannot be fed through a typical printer. 

I was very excited to start this job exactly one year ago today ,April 22, 2019. I was ready for learning. I had very little experience operating printers of any kind, but have a graphics background. File manipulation for printing i can handle, but the actual PRINTERS have me hella stressed right now. 

I have two printers, my primary we use as a flatbed printer and 90% of jobs. It prints quickly and is usually reliable. Around end of Feb/early March we had issues with it not printing white, which we NEED for most of our jobs. They cannot be done without white. Around that time the Nashville tornadoes happened and our techs were delayed due to that. Then Coronavirus happened. They want 3k just in transit costs because they dont want to fly the tech. If the problem is what I THINK it is, it will cost multiple grand to fix. Printer is worth 30k plus easily. So since my company wont pay for the tech, or a new printer (both understandably), i am left to use the other printer.

My secondary printer is new, since August. I got 2.5 days training on a 35k machine. It mostly is supposed to be used as a rotary printer (think cups or balls). But since early march, I am having to run ALL orders. 

I struggle a lot to get this machine to run effectively in terms of time due to all jobs being on dark material, which can double or quadruple the print time needed depending on the darkness. All my orders have been on black. Fucking black. Thats 4x the normal print time. 

My current order is 60 5x7s, 8 layers of ink, 53minutes for 3 5x7s. I have been printing this order nonstop since Friday (17th). I am running behind schedule because the printer keeps fucking up the prints. Streaking WHITE ink, droplets, uneven colors, etc. This is normal for printing. Shit happens. 

But I am starting to wonder if it is just me or the nature od my job. I cannot stand asking for extensions on orders due to printer issues. It makes me feel like a bad employee, like I don't know how to do my job and it is making me miserable. Panic attacks in the morning, losing sleep, lack of appetite, looking for a new job, but I make a moderate income, but under 2k a month bring home. For the first time in 6 years I have insurance. I see a therapist, have since september. She tells me i have high standards and cannkt control machines, so I shouldnt stress so much about that. Not make it so personal. 

However I am desperate to figure out if it IS me and a lack of training/experience. Or simply just a shitty machine. I feel honestly it is mostly me since I dont know enough to fix the machines myself or adjust settings to get good prints but faster. Tech support is insanely unreliable. 

At the same time, many times I have been highly stressed at work and my employers know I am high stress. I hate not knowing if my day will be spent fighting the machinese or not. If this will be the day I am finally fired for being stressed all the time. Im usually in a room by myself, and have no coworkers I feel close enough to or trust to talk to. 

I processed 325 orders last year with 1 error. Just 1. I work hard to make quality product and 99% of the time get it out early and or on time. 

Do you think this is a personal failure of me not being able to manage my machines? Or is this something i shouldnt judge myself for since printers are notorious for being unpredictable?

TLDR: main printer down at work. Secondary printer is gives me bad prints a lot. I have 12 months experience in printing total. Is it my fault and fair to judge myself for bad prints? Or should I not worry because printers -can- be unpredictable and i have low experience and no formal training on them?",22Apr2020,1
783,"Super long, but really need advice. I want to preface this by saying I think a lot of teachers are great. However not all are. 

My middle son started HS in Italy this year and it was immediately apparent that his Italian teacher was not great. He came home complaining that she was unfair, didn’t explain things and would quiz on uncovered material. I initially gave the teacher the benefit of the doubt, and went into meet with her to better understand the issue. 

My son was born in Italy and has gone to Italian school his whole life, however after meeting his Non-Italian parent she put him in an extra class for immigrant language learners. She then said he had no Italian skills.

Concerned, I independently tested his reading (190 wpm) and put together his past report cards and middle school test grades that demonstrated 7/8 Italian marks. He also has 2 brothers who miraculously do fine in Italian and and Italian family. 

I met with her again to see how I could help him to better succeed in her class. She told me she preferred not to meet with parents during her office hours because that’s her free time and she is part time. 

She showed me the curriculum. They were reading The Budenbrooks. I read the book as well. Discussed and helped analyze the book with my son. She tested  on the book and gave him a 3 out of 10. He was very demoralized. 

I met with her again. She produced the quiz which was subjective and said she didn’t believe he had read the book. The quiz took very random quotes from the book and asked the student to explain the quote. I asked her what her belief was based on - while looking at the quiz which had the correct objective answers where possible. She said that was her feeling. 

I always record all teacher conversations since Italian isn’t my first language, so I can review them and make sure I understand. (That is legal, I checked first.) I understood what she was saying perfectly. She really just doesn’t like him, has no teaching methodology, and just wants her paycheck. Not a fan of me either. 

Same thing next book. 2 more meetings, then co-vid 19 hit. Since then she has put several negative in constructive comments on his online platform. She has also missed several online classes. 

YesterdayI received a call from his counselor because he had missed 2 online classes (we were having wi-fi issues) and hadn’t completed some homework. I checked the online registry and the missed work was only in her class - a book report  (I read in English so we didn’t have an unread Italian book at home since bookstores have been closed for over a month  -we haven’t ordered off amazon since the crisis began) and an assigned movie that was not legally available on any platform - most of the kids weren’t able to get it. I explained this to the counselor. 

Again please keep in mind, the counselor called me. Today my some received a private email from the Italian professor saying that he’s acting like a baby crying to his mother to tattle on her to the administration. It’s his own fault that he’s lazy and not having WiFi is not an excuse. 

I have been trying very hard to keep him motivated with this particular Prof all year. Even with the understanding that she is not good. He showed me the message, but doesn’t want me to share it with the counselor. He is afraid that if he speaks up she will fail him, and with the current situation none of the kids are supposed to be failed. 

So, if you are a HS teacher, administrator, parent or Italian parent who has dealt with something similar - any advice would be appreciated. Thankyou.",22Apr2020,1

790,"So I've been writing fanfiction for 3 years and recently I decided that I wanted to write original stories and self publish them. I wrote the original stories on the profile, where I write fanfiction. 

But then I realised that people in real life could find out that I write fanfiction if they went to buy my book. I'm worried that would put people off buying the book or hiring me for a job.

I really don't want to delete the accounts where I have fanfiction and I don't want to remove those stories. And the original story has a bit of a following as well.

I thought about making a new account and putting the story there, but then people would either think I was plagiarising or they'd find out that I was the same person.

So we bought some appliances as we renovate a house and just had them delivered. Now that we are done with flooring we moved them closer to their places. Upon doing so we noticed multiple dents in the dishwasher tub. We also noticed dings in the side of the fridge. These are Whirlpool fyi.

We bought them from a local dealer and called. They ordered a new tub and got it replaced. Great.

But with the fridge they said the sides cannot be repaired. Ok I understand so we would like some sort of partial refund, because if we wanted scratch and dent, thats what we would have bought. 

They stopped responding so I followed up, and a rep called me and said that it is ""waves caused during the manufacturing process, you'll find them on all black Whirpool fridges"". I told them they look like specific dents, and the tech that was out said so as well. ""Nope they are waves caused during manufacturing, we can show you the ones on the showroom floor as well"".

I have a background in engineering, so I wanted to think through how that could happen. I have no knowledge of fridge manufacturing so I don't want to go back and argue this further yet. I believe the fridge sides are assembled and then foam insulation is injected. Maybe uneven distribution would cause the thin sides to ""pop and wave""? I get that physically, but also think a company like Whirlpool would sort that out in their manufacturing if it was a thing. 

I contacted general Whirlpool customer service and the rep hadn't heard of it before. But unless they work directly in manufacturing I dont want to go back and put words in their mouth.

At the end of the day, I am guessing the dealer will insist this is the case, but more-so out of curiosity what do you think? Are we being too picky here? It's more-so about good customer service at this point that the actual partial refund. Would have been good to know if thats a common issue with these fridges before we bought it.

793,"2 months ago I was interested in buying a vintage magazine from the 70’s. The magazine was about a band (they’re not really known) and it’s on eBay. I noticed that the magazine had been one eBay for more than over a year now. The magazine was $275 so I sent the owner a message on details of the magazine. She responded and she brought the price up to $300!! So I didn’t respond and haven’t contacted them in 2 months. However within these 2 months I’ve gotten deals like for $285 but I didn’t give in because that’s way too much money for a magazine no one wants.

Ever since I can remember, my family have always had bad tempers, whether that is getting frustrated and shouting over tiny things, such as leaving a glass at the table, or having a lie in, they will find something to get angry about. In particular my dad. He hates my brother, 25, would still lives at home and doesn't have a job, which I can understand is frustrating as a parent as you want to see your children fill their potential and live a good life, he has no signs of changing as he plays video games most hours of the day. Everyone in the house finds this frustrating but after nearly 6 years of this, we have accepted nothing can be done, after numerous conversations and arguments we are out of ideas. Anyway, I dont know if this anger of my dads, stems from my brother or not. But he will shout all the time, threaten divorce with my mum because of him, it has caused major problems in the house, there is an argument at least everyday. The last one was over not getting a plate out and resulted on it being smashed on the floor by my dad. To me, this is such a toxic place to live. I am a happy and outgoing person and whilst living away from home and in uni, I have loved my time and have really enjoyed being alone! now I am home, my moods have sunken and I find it hard to get through each day in this tense atmosphere. I dont know what to do, I just want a happy family where we all support each other, the opposite of being at each others throats all the time.

Anyways, when I was around 13, I moved across the city to start school elsewhere and I wanted things in my life to get better. One of the things I was bullied for was my name, although now everyone thinks it's a beautiful name. Anyways, I decided at 13 to go by a shortened version of my name. Sky. Three easy letters, no problem. Majority of the people I've met since then have no clue that it's not my real name, but in times when they do find out I explain to them that the change was for my comfort.

I absolutely hate it, she expects me to take over the business but I keep telling her it's not remotely what I want to do with my life. The issue I'm currently facing is, well what DO I want to do?

Most of the reason why I feel so lost is because I'm 22  years old, almost 23 and I dropped out of college because it wasn't for me AND because I don't know what I want to do. My whole life has been dictated by my mom, she's always shoving ideas down my throat telling me I should do this or that, that now I have no idea what my actual passions are.

Since working with her I feel as though I've been severely restricted by her and because she is my mom I feel like I need to listen, but I know the things she's suggesting I wouldn't like. I see her doing this with my younger brothers, too.

Unfortunately, it's really hard to get away because I still live at home (and work from home even when there isn't a pandemic) and don't make enough money with her to save up and move out.

804,"The title seems pretty dramatic, so let me add some backstory. 

Basically, I was raised in a very conservative Southern Baptist family. I’ve never felt like I’ve fit in, even as a young kid, but I was still really close with my siblings and parents as I grew up. 

When I got to high school, I stopped questioning my beliefs and embraced them instead. I’ve always been more liberal-leaning, and I’ve never really liked practicing religion (I still believe in God; I just don’t really like going to church or evangelizing like our religion calls for). My family completely dislikes this part of me, but for the most part, we’ve stayed close regardless of our differences over the years. 

Well, recently, I’ve felt like my younger siblings have been shutting me out of their lives. I don’t live with my family anymore (I’m 21 and live with my boyfriend, which they all believe is sinful), but since moving out, I’ve talked to my siblings every day. Lately though, they haven’t been answering my texts as frequently, and they completely ignore phone calls from me. Again, this is strange because I’ve kept in consistent contact with all four of my younger siblings up until now. 

My younger sister sent me a message today that led me to believe they’re cutting me out because they don’t agree with my beliefs. She basically said I shouldn’t be complaining about the COVID-19 protestors and I shouldn’t be upset that my job threatened to fire me because of COVID. I know this sounds out of left field, but it’s not; my family is very capitalist-minded and agrees with the more conservative viewpoints of the pandemic. I obviously don’t, and while I don’t argue with any of their viewpoints, I am vocal about how I feel. 

The fact that they’re cutting me off breaks my heart. I love my younger siblings so much. I still have two older siblings who I’m close with and who agree with all of my opinions and beliefs, but I’m still extremely hurt that the rest of my family doesn’t want to associate with me anymore. 

I know my family, and it isn’t worth trying to fight for their approval. Also, I’m not willing to change my viewpoints for them because I’m passionate about what I believe in, and the way I see it, no one should have to change their viewpoints to please someone else. In other words, I’ve accepted what’s happening. I just need advice for how to cope with it. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar or know someone who has? What’s the best way to move on? (I already go to counseling, but is there anything else I can do?)

TL;DR: I’m the black sheep of my family and they’re cutting me out. How do I cope with this?",22Apr2020,1
805,"To avoid confusion I am going to refer to \[M35\] as Gus.

Almost exactly a year ago I met Gus. I had been single for 5 months following a 2 year relationship which ended extremely mutually and respectfully. I had started addressing my struggle with depression and it sort of just turned out to be healthier for both of us as I ended up isolating quite severely. For those 5 months that I was single, I chose to be abstinent. Not a moral or religious decision - I just didn't feel like prowling dating apps and everyone I met in person either irritated me or I simply was not attracted to them physically. This dry spell ended abruptly when I learned that Gus existed.

\[this paragraph is back story that you could technically skip\] Gus is a transplant from a city about an hour away. He moved to my neck of the woods around 2017 I believe. We had never crossed paths, but legends of his beauty had been shared with me in the past. Gus is an adonis. We had some mutual friends in common and my best friend in particular had suggested that I break my abstinence streak by hanging out with him. I hadn't genuinely considered her proposal, because although I wish this desperately weren't the case: I hate hook up sex. Don't misinterpret - I have no problem with the concept and terms of hooking up - I just find that first time sex is potentially unfulfilling. And by unfulfilling I mean I typically don't get what I came there for, but the guy always does if you catch my drift. Well this philosophy went down the garbage disposal the moment I laid eyes on Gus in person one fateful day. I was beyond intrigued.

For the sake of length, I'll keep this part brief. We added each other on Instagram and immediately made plans to meet up and grab some casual dinner that week. We hit it off seamlessly. To this day, I cannot comprehend how aligned our interests are. We're both consumed by 80s new wave/metal/80s horror, we have almost the exact same sense of humor and we both can't tolerate most people for more than a couple hours. We hung out excessively. But from where I was standing it just felt fun and we both just really dug each other's presence. One day he introduced me to his best friend as his girlfriend after no real discussion between the two of us prior, but I'm not going to pretend I had any issue with that. We dated for perhaps a month before suddenly radio silence. We had made plans to meet up for a beer and food, and I was sitting at home waiting for him to choose the bar we'd go to. I sent a text...no response...I sent a second...no response. I waited a while and finally decided to call. He was extremely short and cold - something I had never experienced from him before. He told me he didn't want to meet up and that I wasn't the person he had initially thought when he met me. I was absolutely gutted. Nothing had indicated this was coming and I cannot express how affectionate and warm he was since day one.

I was clueless at the time, but here's the nutshell of what had actually happened and what I discovered over the following months: Gus had ALSO come off of a long term relationship when he met me. However, there were some key differences between our situations. His breakup was not amicable, quite to contrary. And although his relationship with his ex had began around 2016, they had broken up countless times throughout their relationship. And every time was nasty (name calling, cheating, lying). When Gus told me he didn't want to keep seeing me, it was because he was seeing his ex girlfriend again. Ouch.

Within 2 weeks of dumping me and radio silence, suddenly Gus decided to reach out via text. If I felt like putting myself through the emotional ringer and digging up those texts to see exactly what he said, I would. Either way, we did start hanging out again. I was heartbroken when he dropped me like a sack of potatoes, because in all honesty I had really started to have love for him. I was invested by that time and we had bonded on some important levels.

Our story line for the remainder of 2019 looked like this: Gus and I would hang out just like we had in the beginning, having a blast and enjoying ourselves, then he'd go silent. Within the same week he would open communication again...then inevitably silence. This pattern repeated itself all year. After our first break up, we never began hanging out again as an item. We didn't discuss exclusivity and if anything it was a friends with benefits situation but we spent almost every night either at his apartment or mine. I accepted this because 1) I knew that every time he went silent, he was attempting to patch things up with his ex and 2) I didn't care to be in a relationship. Yeah the idea of a partner who loves me is beautiful, but I'm going back to school and I know the most important thing I can do is become a stronger individual.

This brings us to today. Gus and I are very good friends. Since the beginning of 2020 we've hung out more than we ever did before. We cook dinner together, go to movies, sleep together multiple times a week. When his car broke down an hour from home I drove him back and forth for two days until it was sorted. When he and his ex would attempt contact and it ended in an explosive fight, I would welcome him into my home and hold him until he fell asleep. Although I don't fully understand my role in his life...I accept it. Don't ask me how I have this, but I have a text screenshot from his ex girlfriend blatantly stating that she reaches out to Gus from time to time when she wants to get laid. Oh yeah I didn't mention that she is talking to another man, whom she had dated before Gus, and had cheated on Gus with when they were dating. This entire thing is a mess. And of course Gus' ex is absolutely stunning, and she must be intelligent because she's a med student. So that's great for my self esteem lol.

In every sense of the word, Gus and I live like we are in a relationship. Not on a commitment level obviously, but in regard to our daily behavior. I feel split 50/50. On one hand, I have a friend who I get along with exquisitely. We go to the gym together, we play video games and keep up on tv series together. We make meals and have sex. He texts me every day. And at face value, yeah I'm happy with that. I haven't cultivated romantic relationships with anyone else since I met Gus because as I stated previously, I prefer familiar company. So our situation is comfortable for both of us. I guess if you wanted to strip it down, you could say we help each other stave off loneliness. But I would be liar, and I wouldn't be posting here if I said I don't feel a great sense of insecurity as well. I do feel immense anxiety almost every day because I'm just waiting for his ex to inevitably hit him up and my little bubble of companionship to burst. Not to mention I'm the safety net he falls to after she cuts him out and that is borderline traumatic for me. 

I'm a nurturer by nature and having an outlet - someone I can care for and be shoulder to lean on is fulfilling. I have unconditional love for my friends and Gus is one of my closest. So I've justified this set up by that concept. I think if Gus' ex treated him the way I do he would be in heaven. And I'm sure at one time in their relationship she did. Otherwise why would he keep beating a dead horse hoping to bring it back to life? What hurts me the most would be that when he does go back to her, we can't really remain friends. I mean we do things that friends don't do. And she knows who I am, although I don't think she knows how often Gus and I see each other. It hurts to know that I would lose one of my best friends, but if one day they can be happy then I want to be happy for them. And I can't decide for the life of me if I would be less insecure if I stopped hanging out with Gus. Wouldn't I just be lonely and annoyed? I know I wouldn't be hopping on Tinder or attempting to date (COVID-19 challenges aside).

If you were able to plow through the length of this post, I would love your opinion. I wish I could include some more details but I feel I've already exceeded a reasonable length and I think laid out the key points to understand the situation at hand. If not, I'd be happy to elaborate in the comments if you have any questions. Am I cheating myself by being so readily available to someone who if given another shot would run to his ex like a puppy? Do you think it's possible to enjoy mutual benefits of a relationship like this and just be content with what it is? Isn't real love unconditional? Not ""I love you as long as you measure up"" or ""I love you until..."".",22Apr2020,1
806,"Bought a car from a family member from New Mexico, I live in Arizona, in February. The tags expired in March.

I was planning on registering it anyways but with all this COVID stuff I haven't really left the house since late March.

808,"I'm in a computer programming class in my high school. I've been in this class for 2 years, and I've begun to realize that my teacher simply doesn't know the subject that she is supposed to be teaching.

This may sound odd, as she is supposed to be a teacher, right? Aren't they supposed to know the subject? Well, she's a coach, and at my school, coaches are required to double as teachers. Most of these coaches actually don't know how to teach, and their classes end up being very hard to pass since we are essentially left on our own.

In the first year, we didn't even have computers. We were literally in a normal classroom and we only used the computer lab around 3 times throughout the entire year, and out of all of those, we only programmed ONCE. And it wasn't even for an assignment, it was literally on a website designed to teach computer programming. So, it's quite obvious that she was trying to use that website to do the teaching for her. Her excuse for not doing programming was that we didn't have access to computers, which is a pretty bad excuse, considering the fact that we could have used the computer lab. She also gave us many assignments for things that had absolutely nothing to do with computer programming, claiming that, since it was a business class, that she was actually supposed to teach business skills instead of programming. Whenever she gave us an assignment that had something to do with programming, it was actually just an assignment from the textbook and we had to use the book to get the answers. Through this method, we were able to get high grades without being able to actually retain any of the information.

The next year, we actually had computers. However, things started to get much worse from here. She kept on saying that we weren't doing programming because it was a business class, and as such, she thought she had to teach more business skills than anything else. Not only that, but we have never done programming at all this year. We STILL just did assignments from the book, and when we were finished, we STILL couldn't program. The ONLY thing we could do is either play typing games or do assignments from other classes. She also gave us many more assignments that had nothing to do with computer programming. For example, we had to do an entire project for Black History Month, and on one day, we literally played Monopoly for an assignment. We also weren't even able to use the computers for a vast majority of the class period, as she would block anyone's access to them as she rambled on about herself and her political ideas. Making matters worse, she also threatened anyone that called her out with a zero.

Things started to get obvious when, one day, her computer froze and she asked if anyone knew how to fix it. I went over there to find that she had around 12 tabs open, along with multiple windows of just file explorer and multiple instances of MS Office. Not only that, but she wasn't even doing her job. She was quite literally shopping on Amazon while we did some assignment from the book. On another day, I overheard her talking with another teacher. She openly admitted that she was learning computer programming with us. In other words, she doesn't actually know the subject, and she's learning as she's teaching it.

This teacher has literally been setting students up for failure in life, and it's really unfair to the students that actually intend on doing computer programming as a career. What should I do about this?",22Apr2020,1
809,"I (20F) have a niece that is soon to be 8 that was born when I was 12. She is my sisters bio daughter &amp; I’ve never met her because my family is so dysfunctional. Long story short, we were pretty much raised by our grandparents bc our parents were shitty. As a teen my sister had a lot of behavioral problems &amp; was pretty much “out of control.” On my sisters 18th birthday, she literally moved out of the house at midnight, the second she was 18, &amp; we never heard from her after that. 

A few years later when she was 21, she had my niece. I remember her calling us &amp; letting us know she was born &amp; she sent some pictures of her in the mail to me &amp; my brother. However, we never met the niece in person because my sister was living with our mom at the time &amp; due to the trauma my mom caused me I was 100% against the idea of going over there. So I never met her. 

My sister ended up losing custody of my niece when she was 2. Niece went on to live with our Aunt (who I don’t really know well) &amp; her wife who wanted to have a family &amp; she got adopted when she was like 4 or so. They live about 4 hours away in another state. 

To put it simply, my sister has never been a functional adult &amp; has been to jail at least 100 times. Also, now she is a meth addict. So she hasn’t had any contact at all with niece. The Aunt who is raising her messaged me on Facebook a couple of nights ago asking how I was doing &amp; if I have heard anything out of my sister. I told her no, we’ve been estranged for years. I then asked about niece &amp; she sent a pic of her &amp; talked about how she was about to turn 8. 

I asked her what kinds of things she liked so I could send her something for her birthday. I always wanted to send her something for birthday or Christmas but was always shy about it. She told me a few things she liked &amp; I picked her out a few things &amp; sent to her through Amazon. It was a little awkward when I was trying to come up with a gift message for the gift because even though she’s my niece, I really don’t know this little girl. 

She then asked if I could send niece a picture of myself so that she could include it on her “family board”. I said of course. I plan on sending her a picture of me &amp; maybe if the aunt says it’s cool I’ll send her a couple pics of my sister from when she was a teen since she looks nothing like that now. But this has got me thinking like what should I even say when I send the pictures? It’s so hard knowing what to say to a child you’ve never met. 

I’m looking for advice on how I can build a relationship with her. I’m a shy awkward person and can have a hard time coming up with things to say even though I mean well. It’s hard for me to really know what to say to her &amp; if she will even be interested in getting to know me. I grew up without both of my bio parents too so I know kinda what it feels like to be away from your bio family &amp; raised with non bio family. Any advice on how to go about this will be appreciated.",22Apr2020,3

814,"Hey, r/Advice. I need some advice.

Short description of me, just in case that’ll be necessary: I’m in my late teens. Pretty independent, self-reliant and more practical-minded. I’m not the most outgoing person, but I can pull myself together when necessary. I try to see the positive things in life instead of focusing on the negative, and whenever something doesn’t go my way I do my best to find solutions. Hence why I’m here.

Last summer I befriended a person (in their early 20s) that seemed to be an outsider of some sorts. They didn’t really talk or socialize a lot, so I made an effort to include them in conversations with classmates and social activities like going to bars in the weekends, studying together after school and going to the gym. They seemed happy to join me, and I was happy they seemed happier.

The person in question is a bit socially awkward in the sense that they can offend people without meaning to, disregard personal space and overshare personal information, which makes people around them uncomfortable. I didn’t really think much of it at the time when I befriended them, and kind of chose to overlook it. I figured it’s not their fault they’re a bit clumsy socially, and neither is it any of my business.

After a while, the friendship got pretty intense. The person in question started opening up about their mental issues, their inability to lose their virginity and after a while their genitals. I think I’d be fine with it if it was say, a couple of months into the friendship, but this seemed like a bit ( a lot) too much for me. I tried to be supportive, and I felt like it went OK after all (even though after a while I found myself praising them for the smallest achievements, like going to the gym or getting out of bed to go to school). What I didn’t like, however, was that it felt like they demanded that I open up as well.

I usually try to keep my problems to myself as I find it unnecessary to burden those around me with my issues, especially when I know they can’t help me with the problem at hand or that I’ll get over it quickly. At the same time, I felt like that was fair that I open up a bit as well, given that they’d opened up, so I talked about having a debilitating illness in the past that made me unable to live a normal life for three years as I was in and out of hospital and more or less bed-bound. As I mentioned, I don’t like dwelling on the negative, which includes the negative things that happened in the past. So, I ended the conversation on a positive note, saying that “everything is fine now though and my condition has been stable for the past three years. I managed to graduate those three years of school I missed out on in one year, so I’m all caught up now”. They implied that I shouldn’t brag so much and that it didn’t suit me. After that, I didn’t really want to open up about myself that much.

After a while, the person in question suddenly started apologizing for a lot of things they’d apparently said/done to me, which I didn’t find necessary at all as I 1) had already forgotten all about it or 2) hadn’t even realized. I confusedly assured them that everything was okay between us, and that they shouldn’t worry about it (because I didn’t even blink an eye). I thought it was a bit strange, but I didn’t really worry about it too much.

Then came the demands. They told me I didn’t compliment their outfits (and just in general) enough, that I never told them I loved them and that I never gave them hugs. I’m not the most touchy-feely person, so I felt like in a sense their complaints were valid. In addition, they always complimented me (to the point where I had to ask them to stop), and it would be fair for me to compliment them. At the same time, it kind of felt forced to compliment them after they’d told me to compliment them more. It felt inauthentic as hell, to be honest. In addition, they also started leaving passive-aggressive messages when I couldn’t hang out due to studying, appointments or just everyday errands, which I found annoying. They also tried to guilt trip me when I didn't want to hang out, which didn't really faze me that much.

At some point asked me if I wanted to be in a romantic relationship with them, to which I declined as romantic relationships have never really been my thing. In addition, I’m not into their gender (sexuality-wise). They accepted the answer, and I tried to move on with the friendship. I didn’t say anything, but after that things got really uncomfortable. They asked me once more, to which I yet again declined. It was as if they had verbally stated that they took my no as a no, but it still felt like their agenda was to convince me regardless. I might be overreacting, but it was creepy. As time went by, I started feeling extremely uncomfortable around them, but logically, I had no reason to. So I disregarded the red flags and tried to ignore it. After all, they hadn’t done anything wrong. Nonetheless, I couldn’t shake off the paranoia. I tried to tell myself I had no reason to feel like that, but I couldn’t stop.

I think the turning point became apparent when they became angry after I had made out with a girl while we were out drinking. They told me it was rude and unbecoming of me to make out with someone when I knew they were in love with me. I felt like that was extremely unfair, as they had made out with the same girl while out drinking. And even if I wanted to be into them, my sexuality wouldn’t really allow me to. I didn’t see the logic at all, and frankly, I felt like enough was enough. It seemed like they completely disregarded my sexuality and boundaries. I distanced myself a bit after that.

What made me completely cut the person, however, was when my closest friend of seven years passed away due to suicide. The guy’s the most loyal person I’ve ever had the pleasure to know and he never hesitated to help me out when I needed it the most. I’d describe our relationship as very tight, and his death really took a toll on me and my mental health. My grades were deteriorating, and for months after his death I got out of bed everyday powered by nothing but willpower. I know myself well enough to know that if I’d stayed in bed, I’d never leave it again. So, I did my best to attend school every day, to perform to the best of my ability and to stay in touch with my family even when things were so bad that in my darkest moments, I considered suicide several times. I started talking to a therapist after his death in order to process the grief, as suicide wasn’t an option for me. If my friend couldn’t live his life, at least I’d live mine to carry on his legacy in as sense.

The day after he passed away, I went to school as usual. The person that I considered my friend, regardless of a couple of hiccups, met me by the gates and tried to make conversation. I don’t remember a lot as I was in shock after my friend’s death, but I remember the person saying that it didn’t seem like I cared that my friend had passed away. I tried to tell them that I of course cared a great deal and that I was crushed that my friend is gone, and that people grieve differently. Some people cry, some people don’t.

During our break, the person asked me if they could have a chat with me, to which I said OK. They took me to a secluded room in our school and started to ask me about my friend’s death. I told them the truth, as I didn’t see any reason to lie. I told them that my friend had been struggling with his mental health for years, and that he had committed suicide. The person proceeded to tell me about how they as well had considered suicide a couple of years back. After I’d listened to them and tried to be supportive, they decided to make a joke of the matter (it was the classic “down the road, not across the street” joke). I found that extremely offensive and told them off. To make a long story short, I told them to grow up and not to make a joke like that in a situation like this one. In a sense, however, I tried to justify their behavior as they didn’t seem to have any friends and that inappropriate comments seemed to be their “thing”.

After some days had passed, they started giving me gifts and asking me how I felt, etc. In ordinary occasions, I’d be grateful, but I didn’t want to open up to a person that had made a joke of my friend’s death. I decided to reserve my concerns and grief for professionals and those who didn’t get emotionally invested to the point of codependency/enmeshment. I politely told them that I’m fine, that I’m getting better and that I’m getting help. They seemed to ignore the hint, and proceeded with the gift-giving and questions. At some point I told them that the gifts were unnecessary and confusing, to which they got offended. Maybe it was due to the condition I was in at the time (which by the way is no excuse), but I told them clearly that I didn’t want to discuss this matter with them and that it often times felt like they were only supporting me because it benefited themselves (after all, in times when I was down, they got to play the white-knight).

After the incident with the suicide joke, I’ve maintained a distance from the person. I’ve forgiven them, but I don’t want to stay in touch with them anymore. No hard feelings, but this friendship seemed, in lack of a better expression, weird and unhealthy as fuck. After keeping my distance for about 4 months, they started texting me, asking why I’d been away. They told me I was a liar, a bad person and a hypocrite for not staying in touch, that they saw right through me and my intentions (I didn't even think I had any intentions with this friendship at all other than to end it), that they’ve given a lot more in the friendship than they’ve been getting (which is exactly what I’ve felt all this time) and that they didn’t want to be friends anymore. I told them I’m fine with that, and I thought we were done for good.

A couple of weeks later, they hit me up telling me they were really struggling and begging to hang out with me. The person (or at least that’s what it seems like) doesn’t really have a lot of friends and I felt a bit bad for them, so I told them we could study together. They said that they didn’t really feel like studying, and that they’d rather go for a walk. I said that I wasn’t skipping school to go hike with them, so they’d either have to bring their textbooks or find someone else to hang out with. After a lot of back and forth, they agreed to bring their textbooks and we studied in awkward silence for a couple of hours.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this incident they haven’t contacted me, which I personally think is great. However, it seems like I can’t let go of this. I’m constantly replaying all of these incidents in my head, and it’s annoying as fuck. I’ve moved on, so why can’t I stop thinking about this?

I often feel like I’ve been way too sensitive or that I’ve been overreacting to a lot of things and that I should give them another shot. At the same time, the suicide joke was a hard deal-breaker for me. I’m pretty accepting (as in, people can disagree with me, people can be awkward, whatever. As long as it doesn’t bother me), but that joke really didn’t sit well with me. However, giving up on this person makes me think I’m not as accepting as I’ve considered myself to be.

I feel really confused about this person, because at times they can be extremely nice, yet at other times they’ll put down me down because of my interests, future plans and hobbies. Sometimes they’ve made others join in on ridiculing me. I’ve always tried being supportive of them and their choices (because I know external validation means a lot to them). I just don’t feel like it’s been reciprocated.

In addition, it felt as if they were feeding off of my “bad days”, in a sense. In hindsight, it seemed like they only cared about me when I was down or when things didn’t go my way because it made them feel good about themselves for helping me out (even when I didn’t ask for help). Every accomplishment I made seemed to be met with either scrutiny or ambivalence. They’ve offered to come with me to doctor’s appointments (which I quickly declined), and it’s pretty fucking weird. It just makes me feel uncomfortable, but at the same time they’ve implied I should be more grateful and made it clear that they're ""really nice"" (which to me doesn't carry much weight due to several occasions) etc . and I don’t know what to make of this anymore.

Maybe I've just misunderstood everything? People often point out that due to bullying as a kid I've become extremely self-reliant, which has resulted in me rarely being involved in friendships and thus having little to no understanding of how they work. With the few friends I'm close with, however, things tend to work out great and I feel like I understand friendship well enough to sustain most of the ones I find important.

**As for the specific questions I have: am I in the wrong here? Should I have given the person another chance? Have I been overly sensitive? I feel like I've tried my best, but could I have done something differently?**

And most importantly, **am I just stupid as fuck?**

&amp;#x200B;

815,"For a little back information, my husband feels absolutely nothing good for our neighbor. When she first moved in she came over and accused my husband of stealing a ladder that was on her back porch because ""you can only see her back yard from ours"". After talking to her for a bit she threatened to call the police if we didn't return it and my husband welcomed her to do so pointing out that he has threw of his own and wouldn't need hers. We heard nothjng else and then a few days later we received an apology of sorts issued through a friend of ours. Apparently the ladder was never at her house to begin with. That's what sealed my husband's dislike for her, she could accuse him to his face but couldn't apologize the same way. 

Fast forward we have finally decided to clear out our side yard and begin family building projects. After about 20 minutes my husband brings me down to show me that this lady had created a perfect trail that leads from her yard into ours and has 3 different huge piles of brush and scrap lumber from where she cleared out her yard and built her back deck. My husband wants to go straight to the police, just because he doesn't want to deal with her. I've convinced him to hold off and let me talk to her, but now I'm not really sure what to say or given how she acts if me saying anything will matter. So now I'm torn between just letting him do what he wants or giving her the chance to take care of it herself, within a reasonable about of time. Therefore I've come to you for some advice.",22Apr2020,1
816,"I suffer from depression, anxiety and an eating disorder. All of this is very new to my parents,and I would say they've been doing the wrong things for the right reasons, but I kind of doubt their intentions right now. 

They've been adamant about not putting me medication, because they think it'll form some sort of addiction? Their reasoning is that if the chemicals in my brain are balanced with medical help, my body will become reliant on the medication and I'll get worse. 

The psychiatrist I've been seeing recommended 4 types of supplements, which ironically my parents immediately approved of. I've taken them for a few days and found the results to be more harmful than helpful; I've had a spike in suicidal thoughts and bursts of anxiety and panic attacks I can't control. 

When I shared this with my parents, they responded negatively. My mother got angry because she thinks I just don't want to get better and I'm making excuses. My father loftily told me it's my own fault, because my diet's in shambles. Note that I was in hysterics from the anxiety, he didn't hesitate to add that if I would just ""calm down"" things would work out. 

What is the best thing I can do to help my parents realize I want to get better but they're not being helpful to that? I want to do the best thing for my mental health but since I'm a minor I really don't know how to go about doing that.",22Apr2020,1

Today my mum and sister (who’s a 9 years old) went out for a walk and my sister took her bike, she rode it around for a bit but wanted to go to a field next to our house, so rode back to leave her bike in our front garden. Then she says she sees the man standing  in front of her friends house he’s on the phone and ends it, then walks up to her with his bike, Because of covid-19 she tells him 2 meters. But he kept getting closer and the says ‘ R-U-N’ to her so she starts running to which he begins to follow her on his bike she gets to the end of our street and turns a corner to where my mum is waiting and then walk towards the field. 

When she gets home she tells me the story to me and my sister, then saying it the same man who she saw at a shopping centre a few months ago,and starts getting really scared saying he’s in our house and looking behind my closet door and other ones looking for him - then begin crying and insisting he’s in our house. 

She’s just really freaking out and idk what to do. Tbh I think she just trying to make links between that guy she just saw and is imagining she saw him a few months ago. I do think there was a creepy man outside our house but I doubt it’s the same one she saw months ago, I just don’t want to invalidate her feelings and dismiss them so idk how to help, any advice???",22Apr2020,1
821,"I sold my car and moved to a new city last year for my dream job, and ended up getting laid off due to COVID. The job was really the only thing keeping me here, to be honest. It's been pretty isolating here and where I'm currently living is rather unsafe. Luckily, my lease is up end of next month and I'm paid throughout the lease. I moved here with 4 boxes, but have acquired a small studio's worth of furniture over the past year. Sucks, because for once my apartment was everything I wanted it to be, despite the safety factor. I know my options for a job are limited where I'm at without a car, and I have a car in state 2 waiting for me (not that really anyone is hiring, but I recognize I'm going to have to find something in the meantime and car=more options).

I'm also moving in with my elderly mom and am hesitant to fly because of COVID. I also adopted a cat before this COVID mess and he is stuck with me no matter what- please don't suggest I give the cat away because honestly, he's the only thing keeping me going right now. Finances are tight, but I do have enough saved to make the move. I'm thinking through a few options:

1. Rent a car, give my large furniture away to colleagues who also got laid off (no one is buying furniture right now anyway), and do the drive. I found an SUV rental for $1000 for 2 weeks, unlimited mileage. I could try to do the drive in a week for half of that (plus gas), but I'm moving from opposite ends of the country. Literally, the furthest mileage point from where I'm at. Biggest concern is the cat in this scenario, but seems the safest in COVID terms for my mom if I sleep in my car on the drive. Plus I love a good road trip.
2. Hiring a moving company, move all of my furniture, fly with cat. Nervous about flying with COVID, and after looking up car rentals, not sure it's the cheapest option anymore.
3. Hiring a moving company to ship a pallet of personal items and clothes, fly with cat. Similar concerns as #2.

Also, I applied (but haven't received) unemployment for state 1. Do I need to reapply when I get to state 2?

Sorry, this is all new and weird to me. I'm trying to consider my mom's health, finances, and my cat and I'm just not sure what the best option is.",22Apr2020,1

824," 

Okay so this is probably going to be quite a long introduction story and I am sorry for that. I just want to give some context to the situation.

I am a 21 student at a university. In my first year I started noticing a girl in lectures that drew my interest. This is now 2,5 years ago. Our year of the study was mostly quite close, and it was not difficult track down who she was. The interest stayed and I believe I talked to her a few times through mutual friends when I saw her at nights out. Slowly, as we were both quite involved in our study association, I got to know her better. I kept liking her more, but I also learned that she had a boyfriend.

Years passed and I started to see her more and more through the mutual friends we have and through the study association (I saw her nearly every day). I don't know if I have really been in love with her, but I do think so. The feelings went up and down over a period of two years before something insane happened. At a night out I was quite close with her at pre-drinks. In the bar when we were both quite drunk, we were having a good time and she kissed me. I was baffled, but I learned that she broke up with her boyfriend 6 months before that. I had never been so happy. I had kissed people before at drunk nights out, but never someone I truly liked. I hoped this would have been the beginning of something, but it did not. I texted her the next day but received only some dull responses. Somehow this whole situation made me like her even more and she was on my mind for at least three weeks straight. I kind of let the situation rest a little bit and decided to wait it out, wait for a good opportunity. I never had a girlfriend but I do really have a great social life. I am also a virgin, but this is something only my very best friends know and I think most people would be very surprised if they found out since I am not an introvert and I take good care of my appearance. I am just not so good at flirting and taking initiative in this field.  
Anyways, last christmas went by and I was still waiting for an opportunity to see her again at a party or a night out, and try my luck again. Or at least try to talk about what happened, because ever since we both acted like nothing ever happened. Conversations felt weird the months after. We both went on a skiing trip with this study association (with about 70 others) and I really thought this was the ultimate chance for me. We went out pretty much every night, and I was drawn towards her at nights. I tried my chances very carefully, but I was determined. At the third night one of my best friends at uni asked me if I would be ok if he would go after her. I totally thought he was making a joke, but he did not know I still liked her. Somehow my stupid brain bluffed and said: yeah sure. He kissed her that night and I had never felt that much pain before. I dont think I ever made it clear to anyone, including her, that I liked her. I am just so bad at expressing my feelings to anyone, even my friends.  
I was broken, but I decided not to give up. I wanted to give it another chance when another chance would come around. However, corona came around and I have been in quarantine for 6 weeks now.

I have been thinking about the situation a lot, and I know that I am not going to figure it out myself. That is why I am asking for your help. Should I just call her and ask her out, risking our 'friendship' and making future encounters with her and her friends awkward, or should I just leave it? I really feel like i am longing for something (dating, relationships, just sex idk) after more than 21 years of very little experience. I would not say I am in love with her, but I do feel something when I think of her. It is hard to describe. Sorry for the huge amount of text. I am already just happy to get this of my chest because it has been quite a rollercoaster for my (although that is still hard to explain through text).  
I would be happy with any kind of advice! Thanks for reading.",22Apr2020,2

826,"I work in a fairly competitive field. Technical sales, I'm out in the field pretty often and not in the home office. My boss is a pretty chill guy, everybody likes him, and it's easy to see why he's looked up to by everyone around him. When he hired me years ago, it seemed like he took a shining to me. I was new in this field (transitioned from a completely separate industry), but he thought I was smart and had potential.

I feel like that's a major part of our boss/employee relationship. He's hired me because he thought I was smart, and though I'm very proficient in a lot of different fields, when honestly I think I'm smart enough to pick up new topics quickly, and rarely the expert.

Since we've been in quarantine lately, he recommended I pick up online chess and play him. He's been kicking my ass EVERY SINGLE DAY. This is the third game in a row he's trapped my queen and is relentlessly destroying my punk ass. The last time I regularly played chess was in the Chess Club in 7th Grade and I was never good.

827,"So, to start off. A little while ago, last Friday, I had a very bad fever of 102. Naturally, I called out of work, and for the next few days, the fever continued, until I started feeling a bit better.

My manager texted me asking if I'd gone to the Doctor's Office, and I knew I should've said no then and there, but I said yes, and that I had a head cold. I had no official diagnosis, but that's what I assumed. Every time around this time of year, I get a nasty head cold because of the allergens in the air. I didn't go to the doctor because I didn't want to pay the copay for something I thought I knew how to treat.

Then later, I did something insanely stupid in the midst of a massive fever and aches. I told my manager that it had spread to my chest, and that I wouldn't be able to come in for a week and a half. Partially, because of my fear of catching COVID-19 (it's a customer service job at a gas station).

Now, she's asking me for a doctor's note, and I've scheduled an appointment with the doctor, but my symptoms are subsiding. Even though I'll get the note saying that I was there, how can I bring it to my manager and ensure that if she calls the doctor's office that they won't tell her that I haven't been in for a third appointment, but a first?

I know, I know. I'm incredibly dumb, and it's probably best to just fess up and admit that I didn't want to pay the copay. The only issue is, I was actually sick, and now I'm scared that this idiotic mistake will ruin my very strong relationship with my manager, and she won't trust me when I say that I was sick.",22Apr2020,1
828,"So, a few days ago, my mum just came us to me and hugged me. 
The next day, she looked like she was about to do it again, and I said that I don't like hugs. She looked at me and said ""why dont you love me anymore?"" and hugged me anyway. When I got annoyed, I tried to push her away, where she jokingly said ""is this you being a teenager now?""
I honestly dont like hugs. I don't like being touched at all. When I tell her I dont like it, she just doesn't let go. I'm getting frustrated now, because I don't want her to think I don't love her, but I didn't think physical affection equated to love.
She still does it, and I dont know if I should just deal with it because I'm being rude, or if I should somehow stop her.

840,"29 year old single guy here, single child. About 2 months ago, I landed a job at a national bank as an administrative employee. I was coming out of a burnout while working at a startup and I figured it was a good chance to work on my UX skills on the side. I'm really glad I took this job now, especially with the corona crisis now and the security of having a year contract.

For my job, I also need to have a specific basic education about banking, insurance, monetary systems, and more. While learning the contents, it makes me hugely aware of my shortcomings / what I could do better.

Now don't get me wrong. I'm pretty happy where I am at. I have lived abroad multiple times, done a Masters degree, have a good social circle, me and my parents are healthy. I have about €8000 in savings, have little to no trouble managing my money for the short term. Since I am learning about retirement, investments, etc I keep having this nagging feeling whether it's good enough or not. I can save my own ass, even though I still have to pay my parents back €2000 for a UX course which I am paying off within the next year. That's the only debt I have, student loans all paid off. But they are pretty chill with that. 

However, I notice I compare myself a lot with friends, old classmates, who are looking to buy homes now and have well paid steady jobs at big companies and firms and most of them are in long term relationships. Sometimes it seems to me that they want to settle everything down so fast already, while my ""big plan"" is to land a UX job in a year and try to go to New Zealand with a work holiday visa while I am planning on what first tattoo to get.

843,"So I (23f) had an abortion at 17, like so soon into 17 that the fertilising intercourse occurred on my 17th birthday. So I was a kid (though I felt like a mature af adult at that point). But anyway. Period was late, took a test, went to the doc and confirmed that I was pregnant. Caught it early enough to be able to take the pill, took the pill. Years later and it still makes me sad. I live in India, so abortion is legal and calm, and accessible af. But I don’t want to tell my parents because even though they’d support my decision to have an abortion, it would make them sad (not the abortion, but that their baby went through that). I don’t want to put them through that. So basically my question is this: is it weird that I’m sad about a decision that I didn’t want to make, about a decision I didn’t necessarily have to make, but ultimately a decision that enabled me to live a life, to go to law School? Essentially, a decision that enabled me to have the life I want, but makes me sad every time I think about having children in the future?

849,"Last July I decided to move out of state and into an apartment with one of my friends from high school. My family and I were displaced last year from the Paradise, California Camp Fire of 2018, so I was previously living in a travel trailer with them and I needed to get out and move on my own. Since I was still in California, she applied and got us into a 2 bedroom apartment in Oregon. I am not on the rental agreement but I did pay half of the security deposit along with paying my half of rent and utilities every month.

 A few months later she decided to get a big dog which I was extremely hesitant about because our apartment doesn't allow animals. I didn't want to be a hypocrite since I have a cat here and she was begging to have the dog as an emotional support animal, so I finally said okay that's fine. It seems like everyone else in our complex has dogs and cats so I didn't think it would be too big of an issue. She works every morning and for the first couple months the dog would always stay in our garage because she would chew up things in the house. 

My boyfriend moved in November and we share a bedroom so we've been splitting the rent into thirds ever since then. For some reason she started letting her dog free roam our house every day instead of putting her in the garage which without surprise she chews up something almost daily. Not only this but the dog has destroyed our door into the garage and scratched up the inside foam of our brand new garage door. The last few days I've woken up in the morning to the dog ripping up and destroying the carpet under her bedroom door and tore a bunch of it up into the living room.

 I am sick and tired of my roommate not garaging her up when she goes somewhere and I send her pictures and tell her that I'm putting her up because she is tearing up our house and we obviously won't be getting a security deposit back. My roommate got extremely mad at me for ""locking up"" her dog when she has plenty of room in the garage, she's not even in a kennel. I told her that yes I will be putting her dog there while she is at work so she doesn't further tear up the place. 

She comes home early from work storming mad that we need to ""talk."" This was the talk. She tells me that I have no right to put her dog in the garage and that I'm extremely disrespectful for not letting her dog stay in the house during the day when she isn't there. I have very good reason to do this. 

She continues to tell me that this really isn't my apartment (Remember I paid half the deposit and rent every month) and that it is actually her house and not mine and that I have 30 days to move out since I put her dog up. During a pandemic. I have done nothing wrong other than that. She tells me that I need to find my own place to live and always excuses her dog for everything she does.

 I don't even have a stable job right now and me and my boyfriend can't afford to leave quite yet. I think it's really fucked up as a friend to do this to someone and I am appalled that she thinks the house is her house and not equally ours. I'm honestly disgusted that she would say that to me and I'm disgusted that she thinks she's entitled to our home. I don't know what I should do, but any advice will help me out. I really need it.

851,"So I'm comfortable enough to be posting this here, long story short I'm 16 and my girlfriend (also 16) gets her phone taken off her.we both haven't spoken to eachother since the first Sunday after quarantine started in the UK. However this has been the longest we've both gone with no contact, I have texted her mum and she hasn't 'seen' the messages (I put it that way because idk if I'm being ignored on purpose by her mother). So rn I'm stuck and I have no clue what to do. My only hope of speaking to her is on our 1 year anniversary which is in 2 days. 

And before anyone jumps to conclusions I doubt she is ignoring me herself, it may sound stupid to others and I may be 'too young' to 'understand' what love is but I can't help but have this feeling that she is the one, i have never been sure of something before. We are in a healthy relationship and my issue is not with her. 

To sum it up It has been the longest we've gone without talking to eachother and I'm worried for her. It's gotten to the point where I do lock myself in the bathroom and do grieve (if you want to put it that way) her absence. So then these thoughts cross my mind whether I'm good enough or if I've done something wrong, which I know for a fact that that's not the case but I'm sure everyone thinks these things. There is one more detail that I would mention but idk if anyone would care enough to delve that deep into a stranger's problem, however I would be happy to share if someone would listen.

855,"Tldr mom hold stuff over my head a lot, now she's guilting me into taking my SN little brother in with no financial support. 

So my mom is moving to where my dad works, but he only has a 1 bedroom apt there. And she doesn't want to take my little brother with fetal alcohol syndrome (he's technically my foster brother but he's been around so long he's just family) with her because it's a small space. So she wants me to take him in. 

Now this normally wouldn't be a huge problem but COVID-19 has me a month behind on rent and I've barely got enough for my family to get by. 

I asked my mom if she'd pay some of my rent and buy food for him and just pay his part so it doesn't come out of my pocket. She said no she's not going to do that, that she's done enough for me and that I owe her this basically. She has given me a lot. But 98% of that she gave me without me asking. She likes to do stuff so she can hold it over your head.

Today my dad asked if they helped me fix my truck if I'll take my little brother, still with no financial support after that.

856,"The background info for my situation is very complicated so here’s a summary:
- I’m on the east coast of the US
- The college is on the west coast
- I received an amazing scholarship which makes the tuition Id have to pay 17,500 with dorm and 7,500 without
- My in state school is charging me 28,700
- A friend on the west coast will let me rent their extra bedroom for $200 a month
- My mother is very opposed to me going to this university purely because she would be unable to drive to me if she wanted to 
- I’m going to be paying for my school + flights, with the help of my father who will co-sign my loans
- My father is ok with me choosing whichever college I want and my parents are separated 



How do I tell her I’ve decided to go there and how do I tell her I’m considering renting instead of dorming without making her too upset? And if she gets upset how can I communicate to her that I love her and I’m not trying to run away from her, because everytime we’ve talked about it she’s seemed to feel this way. She also thinks I haven’t given this any thought when in fact I’ve planned out everything and considered how beneficial going would be vs a closer school

859,"So I know this guy and he just calls me when he’s feeling bad and needs someone to talk. I have no problem with that because I just really like helping idk. Some informations: 
- he’s in therapy 
- he’s kinda emotionally fucked up (one day he likes my friend, the next day he likes another girl, a week later he’s madly in love with another one)
- he started drinking at a very young age and has contact to people that aren’t the best influence due to the drinking 
- he had shown aggressive behavior towards other in various situations, I was never there though 
- in past conversations he’d mentioned being a bad person, that he doesn’t deserve anything and stuff like that (it’s bad but 'normal' considering his mental illness)

Today he called, needing someone to just be there. He was crying. He continued saying that he was just feeling bad and nothing 'really' happened to trigger that feeling. My friend (the one he’s sometime in love with) told me she had just explained to him that she now had a boyfriend so I was kinda expecting that to be the trigger and that he was ashamed to just tell me. I kept asking what he was exactly thinking about, just to get to understand his thoughts better and because I genuinely think that talking can help and I experienced it being really good for him in other situations. He was really strange; not finishing his sentences, saying that I should just stop helping him but again I’m used to this behavior when he’s in a bad place so I just gave him time. He slowly started telling me about how he got bullied by kids in elementary school (they actually did hurt him a lot), that he was ashamed of things he did while being drunk ('especially last year') as an example he told me about how 
he punched a guy (apparently that caused serious damage). Then he started telling me again that he was a bad person, how he had done things that can’t be forgiven and that he can’t tell them because he’s the only one hating himself rn and he doesn’t want others to do it.
I kinda kept pushing him. After a while he finally started talking. Basically (without all the interruptions in which he told me that I’lll hate him afterwards and that he shouldn’t be telling me that) he told me that (idk when) he was outside, drinking with some friends (he said himself that he was wasted at that point) and they were walking back home when one of them said that they should take another path and go through a park nearby. While in the park the same guy that led them there went peeing (or that’s what he said to them) when he came back he had a girl with him (I don’t have any other details about her). Then he got very confusing again (not finishing sentences etc.) and just ended with saying that the two guys basically ended up raping her. What he did: the first time he said he 'just held her' afterwards he said he 'just stood there laughing and watching' so I don’t know the exact story.  After that we just said nothing and tbh I was in total shock by then. At some point he started saying that he had lived through tough things (as an example he told me about his grandma blaming him for his grandfathers death because he didn’t visit him enough- when he was 11) and nobody could understand what he went through. If you ask me he was just trying to explain his actions, just searching for excuses. I was left...shocked. I don’t even know what I should feel or do. 
Me being a victim myself I just can’t get over it and tell him that he’s not to blame (he could’ve done something, being wasted isn’t an excuse for losing complete sense of wrong or right) at the same time I just don’t know what the fuck I’m supposed to do. That’s why I’m here. help.

865,"I've had a very rough relationship with my mum and my mum's side of the family since I was very young. We have vastly different family values (I'm from a country where patriarchy is very much ingrained in the family standard) and I've never been good at keeping my opinions to myself. I'm 26 now and I've been in a different country since I was 18 so I've come to accept the rest side of the family for what they are since I only talk to them maybe once a year. I've still been in constant contact with my mum through all of this though. She is very set in her ways and is extremely critical of my way of life. The fact that I dropped out of uni to start working in the alchohol industry and do not regret it at all, I've experimented with my sexuality, and I started taking drugs for depression and anxiety are the worst offences. She is very abusive in her way of referring to me and my life and is the type of mum that just expects me to owe her. 

Two years ago I left my industry to start uni in a related field to make her happy. I moved countries for this and I depended on her financially. We had a falling out since I wasn't able to take my finals due to some paperwork issues which meant I was gonna have to retake the entire semester and she cut me off out the blue, leaving me 5 days before I was supposed to pay rent, with my 4 months tuition which I still haven't paid and virtually no way of sustaining myself. My aunt has been helping me financially but she left the country and I couldn't even afford food during this time. I stopped taking medication when I moved and for the first time in all my life I even contemplated suicide. To her I failed in every way, I dropped out of uni, I took drugs (prescription), I never found a stable boyfriend, I was working in a bar, I was an alcoholic (I went out but I've never had any issues with addiction thankfully), I was the black sheep of the family and it really got to me. My whole life I've dealt with her and her ways, since my family always said ""you're not gonna change her, she's your only mum"". But I was almost evicted of an old flat because she was screaming at me so violently the neighbours called the police. She's not anymore, but she used to be physically abusive as well. I've not spoken to her since this fall out which was last year.

However, she is my only mum. She does compliment me to other on whatever things I do. She never missed any events, even though she caused a scene in a couple. She helped me financially and has always said I could count on her for money. When she's not being abusive I really do count on her and tell her everything about my life. I know she loves me and wants what's best for me. I've been at fault as well and I left her alone through whatever she's gone through these past months. 

Quarantine has really taken a toll on me emotionally so I've been thinking of reconnecting but I'm really scared it'll go wrong. Part of me really want to just forget everything and move on so I can have my mum back but I don't want to feel the way I felt last time. Although this was the worst fight for me psychologically we have fought before and we always just move on and go back to normal until I do something wrong and it all starts again. 

Has anyone gone through something similar? I guess I just wanted to hear opinions of people that aren't my friends. I'm not a parent so I keep trying to look at her behaviour from the outside but it's really hard. 

Should I cut her off or should I just move on and talk to her again?

870,"Okay, thank you to whoever takes the time to read this. I have been thinking about one of my best friends that I met at dance class. They had a lot in common with me, and when we met in real life at a recital, we had so much fun together. That was in November 2018. we never saw each other in person again after that. However, we facetimed and talked online a lot, and it was really fun. They were a great person to be around. We actually met for the first time in June 2018 but weren't really friends. Then I recognized them again in November, and we talked a lot and had fun. Then right after we met again in November, they gave me their phone number and Instagram. I was then invited into an Instagram group chat (which I still go on now and I still have friends from there) and then my parents got really mad because of the fact that I didn't know the people on there.  
 My parents thought that the friend was a bad influence on me, (even though everything they thought they did was my fault) (also, I'm willing to take the blame for it if that's what is necessary in order for me to be in contact with them again) and I was really sad and I wished I could call them again. Soon, I found my own way to talk to them again, with my iPad. Since my mom gets to see who I call on my phone, I did it in secret on my Ipad when I was home alone so that nobody could find out. My mom had to go into the office every weekday in the summer, so that gave me lots of time to facetime them since I had about 6 hours every day. We had so much fun together. In the time that I was able to communicate with them over the summer, they updated me that they had been diagnosed with severe depression and OCD. This was when I really started getting worried.   
My mom then somehow found out that I had been talking with them, and then whenever they tried to text me, I had to say ""I can't talk."" I could never talk. it really got to me. But still, I took another chance because I felt like I needed to talk to them. I did it this time on discord. My parents never found out about the discord thing. I still, however, had their TikTok. I commented on their tiktoks and that's how we talked, but I basically broke contact with them. we never talked that much. Soon, I got a voicemail from them and they said that there was a lot going on, and I could talk if I was allowed. They also said that they didn't have a phone anymore. My mom blocked the number and deleted the voicemail so I couldn't get it, but I still found a way to go into ""deleted voicemails"" and find the number.   
A day before my birthday, I called them again. I asked a few questions and found out this information; They had gotten their phone taken away because their parents thought it was the source of their depression and that they had to use a home phone, they have been in and out of mental hospitals, and that they haven't been going to school, dance, or any other activities like that. And I have SO much going on in my life that I want to tell them over the phone. I haven't talked to them in so long, and I sometimes worry about them committing suicide. But anyway, I still have their number and I can call them, and I am willing to take the blame for anything that it gets me in trouble for.  so, should I do it? Please let me know. I wonder if I should or not.",22Apr2020,1

I did have one briefly back then but I would barely talk to her and didn’t bring her to my house even though I lived right down the street.

I'm a 4.0 student getting ready to graduate, I've worked REALLY HARD to get this far. During the beginning of this semester I got sick and it really affected my grades on all of my exams. I've caught up on all of my other classes except this one. That's because we only took one exam in class and then everything went crazy because of COVID. I took the second exam online and I'm still waiting on my grade. 

Today I decided to check out the grade change policy that the professor posted, I know professors reserve the right to make changes to the syllabus, but I've rarely had any issues with professors doing so. 

This is how the grading system was originally weighted: Exams 1-3 each at 20% (60% of our grade and one of the exams can drop) homework: 10% and the final exam 30% 

During the first exam I got a low B, which is a bad grade for me, but since one grade would drop I figured I would work really hard on the next exams. 

Now the new grading system is exam 1 (30% and it CANNOT be dropped ) exam 2-3(15% and can be dropped) and the final exam (30%) and homework is (10%) 

I understand making exam 1 not droppable because it was our only proctored exam, but increasing the weight to 30%? Is that allowed? According to the professor he got it approved by the dean, but that doesn't seem right at all. 

I already planned on working my ass off on this course, but it really hurts me to think I might lose a 4.0 GPA during my last semester because of all that's going on. Ecspecially when the professor isn't acting like he cares about this class at all. 

What the hell do I even do? Tutoring centers are closed, the professor isn't making sense on Zoom lectures and I'm stuck with a bunch of math notes that seem like a foreign language. I have one test I have no clue what I got, another test to take and a final that there won't be a review for.",22Apr2020,1

Now, I feel as if every friend I made doesn’t like me, thinks I’m boring and annoying. They didn’t even message me and I’m too afraid of messaging them, since I don’t want to be seen as weird?

The situation is pretty childish, but the ‘trauma’ I got from middle school gave me anxiety, I feel drained. It feels hard to do even the most basic things.

forget about gaming on a mac?
try to uninstall the mac updates?
try to troubleshoot? 
Im not an expert when it comes to steam so I dont want to end up breaking everything lol
Anything else to do in this situation?
A lot of games arent available for mac in the first place, and the few that are usually arent compatible with Catalina.",22Apr2020,1

Look fuckers upstairs, you don't want me living in the place. But there's a fucking quarantine and I have no fuckng choice. My dad wanted to save a few bucks so he submitted a notice before we even left the apartment, I had no time to help him find one, without telling me, he just went and booked a place and now I'm in a basement with him.

When he goes to work, I'm alone. Look, shit's too fast in my head and I can't think straight, so going upstairs and beating these fuckers isn't my prime action, this is a time when my action. What IS on my mind however is shutting them the fuck up. I went to the kitchen, audibly opened the only drawer there and made it sound like I'm taking out a knife... now I feel like things are spinning in a weird way.

886,"Please redirect me to a subreddit if this is the inappropriate subreddit to ask this in. I do not mean to break rules or offend anyone, but I do need advice, so here I am. 

A couple years ago, I had a toxic, manipulative boyfriend who is long gone as of the present moment. Sexually, being something he obviously lacked respect in considering the following:

He had told me one night that his fantasy is waking his girlfriend up by oral, etc etc. At the time, I was a virgin (and never even ended up giving my virginity to him at all, thank the Lord). I told him that I was uncomfortable with that and wish he would not do that on me. I told him I prefer to be woken up first, because by all means, it's my boundary that I need to be fully awake to be comfortable with what's happening. I told him this multiple times in different conversations within our time line. 

However, there were also multiple times where I'd wake up next to him and sometimes my clothes would already be off. He'd already be doing what he was doing. For the first couple of times, I let him because I felt trapped. He knew I didn't want this yet he was still doing it. I didn't know how he would react if I pushed him off, especially in his own bed, his own house. But one morning I did do something; I pressed my legs together and pushed my arms against my chest to keep him from touching me. When I got up and started getting ready for the day, he had gotten super pissed off and mumbling under his breath, ""This is bullshit."" 

Now... I've started my healing process about a year ago. I'd never realized how bad the relationship was until I got out of it, and even more when I started seeking counseling. But I'm talking to my friend about our personal experiences, and she thinks it's 100% rape. And for me, I think it's sexual assault at best. Is it rape?

If you have any clarifying questions, ask away. I know this is a sensitive subject to analyze on a simple Reddit post. I also want to mention that I do not plan on taking legal action for the sake of my own mental health (and the fact it was 3 whole ass years ago, I have next to NO evidence to convict him of anything).",22Apr2020,0
887,"The dream:

Me, my girlfriend and some third party (can’t tell what gender they were) were on my twin sized bed. My girlfriend is naked with a blanket kinda around her but I can still see her cock vividly. This third party was behind her and stroking her dick and for some reason in the dream I knew this started out with me being ok with it. Like I must have gave her permission or something but then all of a-sudden I became extremely jealous and angry.

I woke up sad and angry and stayed that way for quite a bit. Not that I meant to, I just naturally was upset for awhile and I didn’t even realize it had anything to do with the dream until she mentioned it later that that’s what she thought triggered my episode of anger. 

Not sure how to take this dream. Have you experienced anything similar? Do you know anything about why I may have had this dream or what it means?

890,"(TW: this post will make your skin crawl)

I am a 21 year old man living in Europe. I have Asperger's Syndrome and suffer with depression and anxiety. When I look into the mirror, I do not see a human staring back at me, just a deep, ugly pit filled with anger and hate. A lot of the time I don't even feel human. I kind of got bullied in school but I think a lot of it was deserved: I was obnoxious and rude to other kids. I have always struggled hugely with making friends. When I was 17 I dropped out of school, and eventually got a job working in a supermarket, a job that, I admit, I actually rather enjoy.

I am now 21 years old, and I am terrified that this is the rest of my life. Other people my age are hanging out and having the time of their lives, I am sitting at home feeling bitterness and resentment. I often think I would have been better off simply going to college. I feel like because I never left school I never really 'grew up' so to speak. I do things like drink alcohol I hate and hire prostitutes I don't even have sex with.

I feel so lonely all of the time. I really want to feel the warmth of a woman's skin against mine. Like I said I went to bed with escorts but all we did was cuddle. It was... ok. But I desperately want to feel loved. I am infatuated with a girl at work, who I can confidently say is one of the prettiest girls I have ever met, with a sweet and kind personality to match. She is aware of my feelings towards her (I asked her out), although was very polite in putting me down (she has a boyfriend). I have cried several times at work because of this feeling. She has so many guys pining after her, I feel sorry now she has a creature as vile as I to add to that list. I know that having a girlfriend would not automatically solve all my problems, but i know that my sorrow would melt into insignificance if i held that sweet flower in my arms. i am not a religious man but she makes me believe in angels.
I really want friends as well. But i just dont know how to make them. i try talking to people at work, and they seem friendly. there have been times i've been in a bad mood and said something they found troubling and they were genuinely concerned for me. but every weekend (before corona) they go out, and every weekend i am at home on my own.

898,"Hi, so my friend, we’re going to call him Phil, had broken up with this girl about a year ago and has never quite been the same since. He feels hopeless to love again, replaced, he wants her back more than anything, and obsessed over it almost every day. I have known him and his ex girlfriend for the entire time that they had dated and Phil was an amazing dude before he met her. She is great, super kind has been helping me and she did her best to make John feel better after the breakup, which ultimately probably led him to being hurt more but she thought it was best at the time. We never thought it would get this bad.
I had been texting him through quarantine asking him how he was doing and trying to get some response out of him to no avail, one day he texted me out of the blue asking about his ex girlfriend’s new boyfriend. I had met the guy and he was nice so I told him that and he burst into anger over text and proclaimed all of the feelings of replacement and jealousy that had been consistent throughout the past year. I was in shock because I had no idea he was still at this level of unhappiness, I did my best to calm him down and talk to him about what he was feeling and I tried to explain to him that he needed to realize the predicament he was in and get himself out of it. I have been talking to Phil about this for the past year or so and it had been on and off threats of suicide, I mean even during my sisters wedding I was on the phone with some of his family trying to help. I’ve known him since elementary school it’s tough to see him like this and he won’t listen to a thing I say. Anyway back to yesterday he blows up over the phone saying he’s gonna end it all so I finally called his mother as he is home from college. I spoke with her briefly and then he came into the room so she hung up because he would’ve gotten angry, and he did calling me back saying that I have no right to call him mom about him. Basically I don’t know if his mom is aware of the severity of the situation I do plan on calling her once more to talk about it but ultimately I don’t think his behavior or thought process is going to change and I think he needs professional help quick. I was so close to calling 911 on him and telling them that he was suicidal yesterday but I had heard from him and he was no longer talking about it and I don’t know how any of that works.

I didn’t ask him to elaborate cause I was furious but it still stuck to me, I decided to create a fake account and got my friend to do a loyalty test on him, she asked him from the fake account if he wanted some “pics” he said yes then later called the “girl” a scammer so I guess he passed it?

906,"Me and my partner moved in two years ago and we are looking to find a new place as soon as restrictions are lifted later in the year. Two weeks into our lease we had a visit from a lovely cat who seemed pretty insistent on staying - 'voted with her feet' as cats do. She has stayed over every single night since but she normally leaves for long stints in the day, especially when the weather is nice.

I have, however, been very aware of the fact that I never wanted to steal someone's beloved cat, she is so lovable and I'd be devastated if someone was coaxing my cat into their house and feeding her so we have been extremely careful to never give her food or force her to stay (except a single treat no more than 2 or 3 times a week if she's extra whiny). So it's obvious she has a ""food home"" - probably where she came from in the first place - and she sometimes smells a bit like another house. 

I can't help but feel like she see's us as her ""main people"" though.. she spends the most time with us and cats rarely just up and leave unless they're really unhappy. She obviously learnt after a few days that she needs to keep 'one foot in the door' at her old home after realising she's not getting food from us.

907,"So recently a close friend of mine who I’ve known for a very long time has had me very concerned. He has started expressing extremely fascist ideas, and sympathizes/identifies with the Nazis. Now I’m sure that can sound pretty exaggerated considering the political climate we exist in where people call each other nazis on a daily basis, but this is true. He has said that the Holocaust was a good thing or just didn’t happen, Jews are evil master manipulators who control the world, he wants to kill certain groups of people because they are “degenerate”, and all that kind of stuff. 

Now I (and another friend who is equally concerned as I am) can’t just call him out right now on any of this because he takes any slight criticism or questioning of his beliefs as a deep personal insult, and thinks we are attacking him. It’s like these views have become a part of his personal identity. My not crazy friend who has more personal contact with him than I do says often he can’t seem to find any other personality trait other than “he is a Nazi.” Anyway me and this friend are working on a plan that can be described as an ‘intervention’ which will happen online because I live in a different state. It won’t happen for awhile yet.

We are both prepared that this will go badly despite our efforts, but we have good intentions of trying to help him. That’s why we haven’t disassociated from him. Because we are his friends we want to make an effort with him before we give up. We feel if we don’t do something he’s going to walk down a bad path in life.

917,"TW /// r-pe &amp; abuse mentioned. 

sorry for the long read guys but what should i do?

so i’ll start off by my mom had her first kid when she was 15 going on 16 i believe. she then had my older sister a few years later then came along myself &amp; then my younger brother. then around elementary school my mom took in two kids who were siblings.

we grow up relatively poor. we were on section 8 &amp; food stamps. my mom worked a lot so she was never around. my older sister took care of us. she stayed home after school to cook for us, clean, make sure we all showered did our homework etc. although my siblings used to taunt me a lot. when my mom would be around while it was happening she would never really do anything about it. they would call me “snaggle tooth”, fat, ugly, four eyes etc. my mom would only yell at them if i cried but i could see the grin on her face while “punishing them” like she too thought it was funny. i also got bullied in school for being fat and having glasses. i grew up hating how i looked. i never would look in the mirror bc i hated what i saw. i don’t remember having a lot of friends either. there are certain parts of my childhood i can’t remember no matter how hard i try but i do know i spent a mass majority of my childhood alone. my mom once told me when i was 18 that she doesn’t remember raising me, she doesn’t even know my favorite food or color. she admitted she doesn’t know me. 

anyways, i wasn’t abused growing up. i always had food, i always had nice clothes, any toys i asked my mom to buy she would etc. 

things got a bit better for me once i reached high school. i went through that whole “she was super ugly &amp; now she’s hot” stage at the age of 16. so i wasn’t super popular but i did have a ton of friends and a tight group of friends who some of which i am still friends with today. anyways, it was my first party &amp; my first time drinking. i guess i got too drunk and i was r-ped by two guys. i didn’t tell anyone in fear i’d not only get in trouble for drinking but the other drugs i were also doing and that nobody would believe me bc i was absolutely trashed at this party. 

this pretty much added on to the downward spiral i was already going on. by the time i was 17 i was not only using but selling. i had a pretty decent amount saved bc i couldn’t spend it in fear my mom would question where i was getting money from but to my surprise she actually started to pressure me to work bc she “couldn’t afford to keep taking care of me” &amp; would need “help paying the bills”. i eventually started working at the age of 17 two months shy of my 18th actually. anyways, i met some people and got involved in a lot more things a 17 year old should not have been doing but i didn’t care bc i knew nobody cared about me. 

there would be times i would be gone for two weeks and not a single phone call from my mom. one time i had a friend ask me if i had any parents bc they never heard them checking in on me to see if i were ok. it hurt bc it was my reality. by the time i was 19 i moved out on my own up until i was 23. during the time i also stopped using &amp; only smoked bud and drank every once in a while. anyways, i was living on my own &amp; i had gotten into an abusive relationship. it was physical, emotional, &amp; mental. instead of my mom encouraging me to leave him she would encourage me to work through it. 

stupid me, i listened to her &amp; that resulted in me being stuck in an abusive relationship for 3 years. during this time my mom knew what was happening. she saw the bruises for herself at times. my brother even asked if he was hitting me. she even took me to get new glasses with him after he broke my glasses in a fight. anyways, when he would hit me i would call her (bc she moved to another state leaving me alone in a state with no family with an abusive boyfriend) to talk about it and she would just yell at me or give me attitude. she never would call and check on me. she never would tell me to leave him. she would never call me back when she said she would. she would make the conversations about her. she never helped me. the week before i left he tried to beat me to death. 

i posted a rant on fb and people sent screenshots to my mom and she called me &amp; asked if i were coming home &amp; during this conversation mentioned me moving out once i got there... like i wasn’t even there and she already wanted me gone. she never asked if i was ok either. during this time though my sister and i got super close eventually she helped me leave him.

i’ve been back for 5 months. two days after i got here i got a job. i’ve been working every since. i pay my phone bill &amp; i also help with household bills. i eventually quit what job i had and i started a new one about a week later due to higher pay &amp; i was working for a week before covid-19 shutdown everything. i had gotten one check and then was told i would be getting laid off until march. i filed for unemployment and waited for my stimulus check like every other person in the US. i still haven’t been approved for unemployment bc miami is utterly smashed with people trying to file. anyways, she’s an essential worker and has been working through this. she also has a boyfriend who gets almost $800 in unemployment. 

she tells me “i need to get my life together” &amp; “help around the house” that i need to “be an adult and grow up”. she’s even told me to apply to low income housing bc she wants me out that bad. i don’t even have a car yet. anyways i saved my money so i can buy my own food outside of the house so i never eat at home &amp; if i do i clean my mess. she makes dinner for her and her boyfriend &amp; won’t invite me to eat with them but expects me to clean up after dinners i don’t even get to eat. i don’t understand why she doesn’t ask him. she cooks, he cleans. y’alls a couple. anyways she wants me to moved out during a global shut down and i don’t have a car. i don’t know why she makes me feel like i’m a burden to her. 

i take care of myself.
i don’t ask her anything.
i pay bills. 

but i’m such a burden to her. i don’t know why but i just think my mom hates me. so here i am crying writing this trying to figure out what i’ve done to make my mom hate me to the point me being home for 5 months after being abused for 3 years is so horrible? i don’t feel welcomed and i don’t feel like i’ve been given anytime to reflect on what’s really been going on in my life. she’s just like “go, go, go” i feel so overwhelmed and unloved.... at this point i’m so ready to move out. she makes it seem like i want to live with her forever like living with her is a walk on the beach. i’m so ready to be on my own.

Today I get requested on a social media account of mine and accept, I wasn’t thinking but I recognized the last name as my fathers (I have my mother’s) “M” had requested my social media account and asked if I knew who she was. I automatically hit block from pure anxiety because we don’t talk and I’m not sure if my mother would be mad since she doesn’t talk to them. I want to know about my sister and siblings but I’m not sure if I should tell my mom or what’d happen if she found out.

921,"Hi, I've kind of gotten myself into a pickle here and I don't know how best to approach the situation. I go to school not too far from my house but far enough that I've rented a place for the past 2 years. Me and my roomate were considering moving to another place next year with better rent and people we know better, and at first before all this happened I was willing to put down the money to move in june although our other rent ended in august. I agreed to this on April 2nd thinking things would get better / we would hear a decision for the summer 2 and fall session for my school, and we have not. I was planning on subleasing where we live now to lessen this burden. I have not signed a lease for the new place yet but they have asked for a security deposit and month of rent for may (reduced due to someone staying in house).

 However, I work through the university and have very recently heard the earliest I will be able to work one of my jobs is in June, and they haven't said yet that my other job is guaranteed anymore. Adding onto this, we havent heard if summer 2 is happening, and if it isnt, my job is definitely not happening.

My parents have helped me pay some rent recently due to this, but I'm wondering the best way I can bring up how unsure I am about the house (after agreeing to these people before) given no one will want to sublease at this point? They all need to live in the house as it is their only place. I just cannot afford it especially if classes are online, it just seems like a waste.

I feel terrible about this especially since I really agreed 20 days ago, but now I don't think its viable. What is the best way to talk about this? I will need a place if fall happens but dont want to jump the gun and pay for a year starting in June if this is all going down. I feel paranoid but I don't know the correct course of action.

Any thoughts are appreciated. Thank y'all",22Apr2020,1

In the hallways, they’re so kind and polite and quiet but it’s as if they don’t know how much sound carries. 

They’re slamming doors and screaming and fighting. They speak a foreign language so I don’t even know what they’re saying. It’s getting really annoying. 

I’d have no problem reporting them but we’re literally the only neighbor they have, because of how the floor is set up. If word got to them that “someone” complained, they’d be able to immediately surmise that it was us, since everyone else is at least decently disconnected from them. We share a wall so we hear they’re shouting and they’re banging on the wall and table. They slam their door which makes our door rattle.

924,"I know how crazy that sounds, but hear me out, because my situation is actually kind of unusual. 

It may be relevant here to know that I live in Canada.

I am 40 and dying of cancer. I have about 2 years to live, however this timeline is not guaranteed and it could happen sooner or later. I don't own any assets aside from an old Corolla that really is not of much value and that I will give away or sell when I become too sick to drive. I have no savings, and live off the long term disability that is paid through my employee benefits. 

I have a massive student loan that I avoid making payments on by just reapplying for interest relief every six months. This reduces my payments down to $0, and when I die, my loans will be forgiven. I'm not worried about this debt and I don't feel guilty about what I'm doing because I literally worked for six straight years putting myself through a bachelor's and masters as a single parent, only to get cancer right after graduation.

I addition, I have about 10k in credit card debt. I accumulated this debt at times when I had no or very low income due to my illness.

From what I have learned through research, CC companies could try to go after this debt after I die, but because I don't own any assets, there's nothing there to pay it, and they will just be forced to swallow it. You can't take blood from a stone, after all. 

So, for now, I just make my monthly payments, but because I am on LTD benefits, my income is only 60% of what it was and I literally have no wiggle room. I'm dying and these monthly payments are often the difference between being able to enjoy my last months and just sitting at home waiting to die. 

There is a huge part of me that just wants to stop making the payments. I know eventually this will cause the debt to go to collections, but I'm not sure that really matters when I'm dying anyway.  My credit score really doesn't matter anymore. 

What I'm wondering is whether they creditors would have any ability to do something like freeze my bank accounts or...I don't know...just do anything aside from calling me and sending me letters demanding payment. If they can do anything like that, how long will it take to get to that point?

I'm sick of hearing about covid all the time and cant wait for a bit of normality (as I'm sure everyone feels this way too). I go to work, have to wear masks in order to protect ourselves and patients, I come home from work, I constantly see covid related things on the t.v., my phone, my parents constantly talk about it and dont seem to understand that I dont wanna waste my days off talking about the virus when I have assignments and uni work to do on top of working full time, its seriously getting me down. 

The only sort of release i get is when I'm actually at work, talking to my colleagues about things other than the virus, we're all in the same boat, worried that we'll get sick, and pass the virus to our families, so we try to keep eachother motivated and happy. We have a group chat for us to use to post motivational things and quizzes to play every Monday, this is helping a little.

Recently I've just been so down and tired. I try to tell my family how I feel but they just brush it off like ""arent we all unhappy, arent we all scared"". I've become agitated, I flip out over the simplest of things, I get snappy with my family and my boyfriend. I get very tearful over little things too, if me and my boyfriend have a little disagreement I get emotional and cry about it (I've not been able to see him for 2ish months since lockdown started). I constantly feel anxious when going to work. I also have no motivation at all to do my uni work, I have 3 pieces due mid-June and I havent even finished 1 (I usually have my work finished about 2-3 weeks in advance) I dont know how to stop feeling like this.

934,"This is kind of my first post on reddit so i guess I’ll just jump right into it. 
I’m a 21 year old female who doesn’t know what to do with her life. I graduated high school in 2017 and since then I’ve just worked shitty retail jobs and always wished I was doing something more. I never went to college and currently I am living with my boyfriend and essentially being a stay at home mom minus the kids.

 I’ve never had a sense of purpose or an idea of what I wanted to do with my life. I always knew I wanted something that made me feel like I was helping something or someone but I never found what that was. Now I am in a place of hopelessness and somewhat depression. I feel lost because I know that I am not living up to my potential in life. I don’t want to just be this forever. But I have no clue where to start or what to do to change it. I’ve tried looking into careers that I felt like might give me a sense of purpose or accomplishment in life but I guess the voice of doubt in my head always chimes in with how things won’t work out or what if I end up hating it or what if I’m no good at it. On top of all of this I don’t have the financial means for college without taking out hefty loans and what not. I’m terrified of being in debt but that would be the only way for me to pursue something now. I come up with so many excuses as to why I can’t do something and I guess it’s mainly my anxiety and fear of failure/wasting money on something that isn’t worth it. I don’t know what to do. I’m miserable with how my life currently is but I feel trapped in my choices. 

I guess what I’m looking for advice on is how do I break free from fear of failure and feeling like everything seems impossible? Is there anyone else who might have felt the same way at some point that could maybe share how they moved through this?

940,"Idk what to do anymore I'm tired of him,his narcissistic attitude,his sociopathic behaviour,he is a monster and I want to get as far away from him as I can.My dad was always a real piece of shit but quite recently he's turned the bar to whole new level.

For some context,middle eastern ,m18,and I am trapped in Istanbul.This is not my country,my father being the psycho control freak he is took me and my mom away from our home town when I was born and we lived in shithole apartments in third world countries all my life.
I remember all the arguements we had when I was younger about how everyone else is emmigrating to a better life in the US or UK and remember crying to hard pleading to him to do it,and I remember him laughing and grinning at me,amused in a sick and twisted way.Almost like he was taking pleasure in it.That was six years ago,from then on I realised this man is a psychopath and he is going to torture me and my mom till the end of it all.

It all improved slightly in 2018 when he moved back home to the old country for work and left me and my mom alone for a few months at a time.I remember all the calm,happy days going out to the movies with my mom,seeing her face,knowing he isn't gonna hurt us for a while.Fast forward to 2019 and my IGCSE exams are coming up,I work hard and get straight As.

Well now as my high school was over I didn't know better and decided against continuing my A levels there.That was undoubtably the worst mistake of my life.Not knowing what this monster was planning to do with us.He came back,talking about moving us to Oman and other quite frankly ""terrible places"" to live,just so itll be cheaper for him.He kept saying we'll be closer to him and he can be with us more often.

This psychopath was planning my misery 

My mom and I refused to go and insisted on a somewhat ok place to move.Turkey,istanbul.Fairly good place,and the plan was he come to us, help us pack and move to Istanbul,and then he would go back home.

He came in july,2019.I had these amazing 4 little budgerigars and our plan was to bring them with us,I had rescued one of them and they were practically family.My mom promised she would move earth and heaven to bring em with us,and I believed her because she loved them as much as I did.

before the move dad brought his buddies over to paint the house without asking so that he could get his deposit check on the house,and thats only the half of it.

(P.s he hadn't payed the rent so he ended up not even getting it in the end)

Painting the house wasn't the end of it,he sold everything.All our furniture , everything,he even had his buddy to ""fix"" my bed,so he could sell it.He basically asked for 1000 dollars and let strangers come take everything they wanted from us,picking our house clean.Mom and I had never felt so uncomfortable.

At this point I had already kinda realised what this guy was doing and when he barged into my room at 7 in the morning demanding to ""take a look at my bed"" I refused,telling him to get out and he's not selling my bed and making me sleep on the floor for my last weeks here.Can you guess what he did?

This monster showed his true colours.

He grabbed my by the neck ,threw me on the floor,banging my head onto my luggage bags btw and proceded to choke me.Spitting on my face he said,""I'm gonna kill you you shit"".Mom heard the commotion and came to save me intime before he had done some permanent damage.

You would think after seeing her son abused like this,a mother would divorce this son of a bitch and protect her son.

So later dad went to ""take the birds to the airport to be flown to istanbul"" and in a couple weeks we followed suit, when we got off our flight we realised he hadn't planned to take an ordinary taxi to the hotel,and there wasn't gonna be any hotel.

He had found this illegal taxi business who was comprised of unlicenced assholes with beat up pieces of junk with no ac to take us.Just so he could save a couple bucks.

So we get to our temprorary place and even though hotels are quite cheap dad decides that it would be a good idea to do the same thing he did with the taxi for the place.He books us an illegal airbnb SHITHOLE that a bunch of scumbags were renting out with no furniture and burnt sheets.And his excuse was,""its holiday season all the hotels in istanbul were overbooked"".As soon as I start protesting this bullshit ,he goes complete apeshit at me and threatens me,when my mom steps in and threatens to divorce him and move away as we can easily go to our own country away from him ,he backs down realising that he doesn't have complete control over us ,yet.

He agrees to move out,giving the keys back to the scumbags and telling our illegal taxi guy (I'd like to clarify that these illegal scumbags and taxi guys aren't from turkey, they are scumbags from our home country so you can realise why I'm angry dad is doing this,its not a oh its a strange place strange faces type deal, its deliberate) to take us to the nearest (he makes sure to add cheapest) hotel.At this point mom and I are exhausted ,its been a 12 hour flight and we are just aching for some bedrest.We check in and what do ya know, turns out the rooms aren't overbooked after all,makes you think.

So after a week or two we find a place to move and pack out our stuff.A couple days pass and dad goes HEY I FOUND A JOB HERE.I CAN STAY HERE WITH YOU GUYS.He comes into my room and gives me the coldest grin,one that gave me goosebumps,it felt like staring into the eyes of the devil.

So now he's staying with us,after a year has almost passed, an unfurnished home with just a matress on the floor and a table for my computer,he even got one of those green office chairs,you know the cheap ones with no arm rest.How generous!

Turns out he gave away my birds btw,to some jackass from the home country we don't even know.Haha how good can it get!!

A couple months go by and I notice my moms acting different , drowsy,tired all the time.Turns out he's been giving her fluoxetine and xanax to keep her mellow and preventing her from protested the abhorant living condition we are in.

So now everyday,12 hours a day ,drinking and calling his buddies on the phone n talking absolute rubbish like ,""you know in my past like I was an Irish king"" and ""westworld is such a complex tv show"" 
He yells and laughs so loud at night we cannot sleep and when me or my mom ask him to be quiet he simply ignores or tells us to close the door and put earbuds in.This guy is a narcissistic psychopath!

And when his boss calls him asking why he hasn't sent his paperwork he makes excuses like I have medical issues and will be delayed in my work,he then proceeds to call the buddies again and Bitch and Moan about how bad his boss is and how bad he has it.

I'm so fucking tired of this guy,he is the bane of my existance,I want him dead I want to die I don't wanna be here anymore,Its been like this since july 2019,its almost may 2020 now.Im tired,Please Anyone Help me get out.PLEASE",22Apr2020,1

to do.  I’m a huge gamer, I spend most of my time playing videos games, i often switch between multiple games that I all play for different reasons. 

I’m also a third year university student and very recently I’ve been massively pushing myself to finish a huge backlog of work that I had left last minute. One of my main motivators was that when I finished my work, I could spend all day playing video games and have no distractions.... but I don’t want to. I get super excited to play a game, but I get bored after a few minutes. 

I submitted my last assignment and instead of playing video games, I basically spend my day loading a game up only to exit after 10 minutes because I can’t enjoy myself anymore. I’ve done this for like, four days now and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Eventually I get tired of switching between games and I end up throwing something on Netflix until it’s time to sleep. 

Why can’t I enjoy anything that I use to love doing? I don’t want to do anything else and it’s leading to me just wasting my days doing absolutely nothing.... does anyone have any advice that could break my out my funk?

8th grade came along, and boy did he have a glo up. and I had also liked someone else but when me and my friend were working together he would come up  and act like we were best friends, and when I was talking about the other guy he would kinda act weird.  
My friends were like omg dude he totally likes you, and I just ignored it. Because I had liked the other dude.

Semester 2 came along and I had moved on from the “other dude” and we had a lot of classes together, like 3/5 classes. 
So, I ended up liking him. As we were getting closer he started calling me this nickname, that nobody else has called me before. And then started rhyming my name with a bunch of things when he would see me in the hallways. I decided that it would be nice to tell him I liked him in a note one day,Well, my friends texted him and he was claiming he didn’t like me like that. But was still showing signs that he did.

946,"My (21F) mom (60F) is drinking every night. I have noticed throughout my childhood that she has always had a little issue with alcohol but I think it has gotten worse in this quarantine and after my sister and her kids left about a week ago to go back home. My mom has experienced the death of two of her sisters, her father and her step-father. So I can understand that she has a lot of pain inside and that amount of pain I truly cannot relate to. However, her drinking bothers me. She doesn’t drink all day long (only starting in the early evening) but it changes her personality and makes her unpleasant to be around. The other night I wrote her a letter explaining to her in a very civil and gentle manner how her drinking affected me. I wrote the letter because she is very introverted and does not like talking about her feelings. When I try to ask her about things in person she gets very defensive, therefore, I thought the letter would be a kinder way of letting her know. Ever since (I think) she read the letter, she has been even more depressed, and still drinking every night. This hurts me bc even though I told her how it bothers me, she’s still doing it. I think what’s most upsetting about all of this is that I know she’s a good and caring mother, and she cares about making smart and healthy decisions (except for when it comes to her drinking and dealing with her pain) and this behavior is so out of character from who I truly know her to be. 

Anyways, I’d normally be at college now but bc of Coronavirus, I am at home with my parents. I really just wish I could leave this house and not be around her making these decisions that hurt me but there’s nowhere to go. How can I cope? 

Side note: I am very sensitive so while this may not affect many other people it affects me. (I think bc I know she’s not drinking for a social aspect but to hide from her pain)",22Apr2020,1

960,"I'm studying Law at an european university, and in my uni students are given 2 evaluation methods to choose from. With method A (the default), if you get a 50% on class evaluation (meaning essays, papers, oral participation during classes etc) + 50% on the exam, you pass. With method B, classwork weighs 0, and your final grade is the grade you had on the exam, but in order to pass you need at least a 60%.

I think I'm doing relatively well in 4 out of my 5 classes this semester, but one in particular is just a headache. The teacher is a bit demanding and really set on evaluating students through zoom classes, which I just can't get used to. And on top of that, I have a 15 page essay on a theme I know nothing about due in 5 days. 

So the question is this: I can either ""give up"" on that class and change it to method B, meaning I don't have to worry about essays or zoom classes, and can just prepare at my own pace for the exam in june and focus my attention on other classes for now; or try to keep going with method A, meaning I have to do the essay and generally be on top of stuff for a month until classes end, since I could get called out to answer a question anytime. The benefit of going with method A is I get the ""safety net"" of only needing a 50% on the exam to pass, while with method B the minimum is 60%. The difference seems small, but it's actually quite big. The scale goes from 0-100, but in practice it's 0-80 - my uni has a ""tradition"" of giving out low grades, and some teachers will straight up tell you they won't give anyone 80+. For reference, I'm an above average student and my average grade is 65-70.

962,"Hi! Burner account so my sis doesn’t see. I live with my sister who is 9 years older than me. I’m still in college and she has a grown up job, so I’m many ways she takes care of me. I love her so much, and she is seriously my best friend. We have so much fun together and we talk about everything. We talk about weight and weight loss often. I’m pretty active and work out regularly. I’m not ripped, but I’m definitely in good shape. My sister is 34 and extremely overweight. She must be about 200 pounds overweight. Being overweight isn’t a problem, but we’ve had long conversations about how she wants to lose weight cause everyday tasks are difficult and she feels like people see her for her weight and judge her. So of course I want her to do what makes her happy. The thing is, she’ll say “okay this week I need to go for a walk one day and to the gym (prequarantine) once a week and that alone will make a big difference” and I’ll always say like “yes! Let me know if you want to just walk with me” (since I go for a walk every day, multiple times a day in quarantine) but she never follows through on walking or exercising. 

She will also start super intense diets like every month and give up after 2 days and go back to eating junk and fast food. I’ve tried to say like “why not start with one healthy meal a day and go from there” and she’ll say “good idea!” But once she abandons the diet then it’s weeks of fast food until she starts another super intense diet at the beginning of the next month that she gives up. 

My family never calls her fat, or pushes her into living a healthier lifestyle. I know a few years ago our dad sat her down and said he was worried about her weight and just wanted her to be healthy and started paying for a gym membership, but as far as I know that’s the most anyone has ever said. 

My sister already knows she’s overweight and wants to lose weight, but how do I help her without overstepping? I try to be super supportive (but not in a cheesy way) and when she starts a diet I always eat healthier too so she doesn’t feel alone or smell my unhealthy food. I offer to walk with her/go to the gym with her and more. I just want her to live until we are old and decrepit together. If you have some advice, I could really use it!",22Apr2020,1

I currently work non-essential retail, and I've been furloughed from my job. My boss has no idea that I've been thinking about leaving, much less that it's going to happen in the next couple of months. I also need to provide her contact information to my prospective landlord. Is there a good way to tell my boss I'm leaving AND I need her to serve as reference? Should I just provide her contact details and hope she doesn't notice that the call comes from another state? Even without the reference factor - how on earth do I put in my two weeks while none of us are working?

On the flipside of things, I'm not sure how to provide proof of income to my prospective landlord. I'm currently receiving unemployment, and I have a paid position lined up for after I move (albeit not for a couple months), so it's not like I'm totally up a creek. Would providing proof of that be better evidence than pay stubs from the job that's not paying me? Does the landlord even need to contact my boss? Do I need to explain this before I apply, or would that cause problems?

967,"Like the title says, I'm thinking of returning to college (community college) to get a degree in graphic design; however, it would have multiple implications in my life as a whole, so I'm not sure exactly what step I should be taking next in my life as a whole. The degree that I want requires full time and doesn't allow part-time. Or, should I get a different degree entirely (that I might not like or would stress me out but might be more stable)? I don't even know if I'll enjoy graphic design, because I prefer drawing and illustration over making logos, etc., but it seems like the most stable art-related job that I could have and might not hate. I would love to also work on video games, shows, or movies one day.

Should I try getting a job first instead, and if so, doing what?

Right now, I'm on disability (SSDI and SSI) for depression (technically psychotic depression because I've gotten so depressed it made me psychotic), PTSD, anxiety, and migraines. I risk losing disability if I return to school. The degree requires full-time study, which would make me enter the disability 9 month trial period where, if you successfully complete in that time either full-time study OR a job, you lose your disability. I've been on disability for around three years now, and I was first diagnosed in 2009 when I was hospitalized for the first time. I don't want to lose my disability if I'm not actually able to handle full-time school in the end. Of course, I want to work and go to school if I am able, but I'm not sure if I am.

I'm not even fully sure if I can handle full-time study. I've struggled greatly in the past with attending college, and the last time I tried to go to school in 2017, I couldn't even handle one online class. For unrelated reasons, I ended up trying to commit suicide that semester. However, I am doing leagues better mentally now. Even so, though I'm doing better than in the past, I'm still am dealing with my mental health issues.

I really want to graduate from college with a degree, and I feel like a failure for not having done so already. It's not like I haven't tried; previously, I attended art school for two years, and then nursing school for roughly two years, without finishing either degree. I left art school because my cosigner bailed on me, and I left nursing school because I was depressed, and nursing was too stressful for me to handle. I attended what's widely regarded as the best art school in the US. The degrees were years apart.

I had a job as a PCA (per diem, nights) for two years in a hospital during and after leaving nursing school, but ultimately got fired from that job for not showing up due to my depression, migraines, and anxiety. At that job, I was constantly stressed out and anxious about everything I dealt with at work, from the depressing sick patients that would leave me compassion fatigued, to coworker troubles. Sometimes my coworkers would ask if I was okay. But my boss loved me and fought for me until the end, and would always say she couldn't wait to hire me as a nurse. Previously, I also worked at an arts and crafts store in the framing department, and at a department store in the women's clothing department. However, both of those jobs were short-lived (eight months and four months, respectively) because I struggled with the stress of customers and interacting with people, and quit them when it got to be too much for me.

My social anxiety and general anxiety wear me out to the point where in the past while working or going to school, I would have constant panic attacks and/or crying breakdowns that would last multiple hours, multiple times a week. I would have panic attacks before every shift that would make it hard to show up, and then the stress over it would lead to migraines that would leave me bedridden. I've also struggled with my depression in regards to work and school, which made studying hard to concentrate on and a struggle to get ready in the morning to get myself to school or work. Even so, at my various schools, I kept a GPA from 3.2 to 3.6.

I value my intelligence as well as my talent in art, and it's so frustrating to be in the position I am in life right now. I spend my days struggling to get out of bed in the morning, and my life is very... limited? I don't have many friends and rely on my parents to support whatever disability doesn't cover. From disability, I get around $600 total a month. It's not enough to live on whatsoever. I worry about what will happen to me when my parents die. I want a better future for myself than how I'm living currently.

I tend to only leave my house for monthly psychiatrist appointments, and I don't even have a therapist at the moment. I will talk to my psychiatrist tomorrow about getting one. I'm scared to have a therapist again because my social anxiety is constant when I attempt to open up and get to know a new therapist. I've struggled with attending my therapy appointments because of the anxiety as well as depression, and at appointments, I tend to have trouble opening up or knowing what to talk about. I'm a very quiet, reserved person, and therapy is difficult for me. However, I know that it's necessary that I have a therapist to help me to work through all of this. In the past few years, I've been hospitalized at least 10 times up to three weeks at a time, for depression. But it's been a year now since I was in the hospital last, so I think that's a good sign. Lately, I've been working on the DBT workbook that I have.

I don't want to be stuck where I am forever. I want so badly to get better, be independent, and support myself. My cosigner pays the loans that I had with her because I can't afford it, and the rest of my federal loans are at $0 payment (IBR) right now because of my limited income. I have a lot of guilt in regards to that. I want to have a job that would allow me to pay my loans again and support myself. I still live with my parents and have never owned a car. I want a boyfriend again but I don't want to put anyone through my limited life because I don't think it's fair. But it gets lonely not having that connection with anyone. I want to get married, have kids, and have a successful career, but it all seems so far away from my reach and it makes me sad all the time.

What should the next step in my life be? Should I try going to school to get a degree in graphic design? Or should I finish my degree in something else entirely that might be more useful? What job should I get? Should I try to return to work first instead? How can I dig myself out of this hole that is my life, so that I feel excited and hopeful about the future and live independently?

TL;DR: What should the next step be in my life? I struggle with multiple mental health issues for which I'm on disability and don't know what I can handle. Should I attempt full-time school in the fall for graphic design, or should I get a job? How can I improve my life, because I feel so stuck?",22Apr2020,2
968,"So for a bit of context, I struggle with ADHD, and some mental heath issues, and so sometimes I can think myself into a wreck. I have been with my boyfriend for four years, and he joined the army in December. He has been doing basic training for a few months (prior to Covid-19, now he has been sent home until daily life resumes). I have no intentions of leaving him, or trying to stop him from following his dream, I am incredibly proud that he has found something he is passionate about, and I will always support him. I also do not rely on him as my source of happiness. We both are perfect for each other (I’m sure a lot of people say that, but it makes me happy to think we really are soul mates!) 

However, I feel like I will struggle immensely with him gone, not for the fact that I need him to bring me happiness, but for the fact that I will be alone (I know that it’s selfish, and likely every other army partner goes through this, but I can’t stop thinking about it). The army career route was only something he brought up at the start of last year. I am scared that I will fall into a rut just from overthinking all the time whilst he’s gone. I have gone to several counsellors, and taken medications, but at the end of the day, I still sometimes have days where I fixate on one thing until I practically pass out from stress. I have an amazing support system in my family, but I still feel like him leaving is going to send my progress flying back. I will never tell this to him (in the way I have wrote it), as it would be very manipulative, but having ADHD it’s very hard to keep my thoughts inside my head. I’m not sure how to tell him how I feel without him being worried about me, or affecting his enjoyment from the career he’s chosen. He is suspected of having autism, and I think that’s why he finds it hard to talk about his feelings, but he is always there for me, so i want to be as supportive to him as I can. It’s just everything is constantly playing on my mind, and of course it’s hard to distract myself right now with the pandemic. 

What I am here to ask, is if there are any other army partners out there, and how they cope, especially when their significant other is out on missions? 
How do I talk to him about how I feel without sounding manipulative, because I really don’t want him to give up his dream for me at all?
Am I being selfish for thinking this, whilst he’s joining a career where he will be serving our country?
Should I even tell him how I feel at all?

972,"Hey, so I'm a 19 year old female college student who is currently living with her parents because of the quarantine. Today my parents attacked me and accused me of not doing shit around the house and not helping out in any way and my dad said that next week he is going to drive back up to my school and he's going to drop me off at my apartment. Which doesn't sound bad written like this, but I would literally go out of my mind if that were to happen. All of my roommates are gone, and basically everyone on my floor is gone. Everyone evacuated from my college town because it's not a place that people normally live so I think I will go absolutely crazy not interacting with my siblings and stuff. My apartment is also tiny and my room is a literal box with a closet and a cubicle-sized bathroom. When I was still going to school in person, the apartment really just functioned as a place to sleep and it was convenient having a stove and refrigerator and stuff. But there is like no good place to study. I cannot get anything done if I study in my room. The lighting is awful and it's extremely depressing just sitting in my room all day. All the libraries and coffee shops are closed. Absolutely nothing is open besides essential stores. I am a biochemistry major with two minors and I basically have to study everyday like all day long. It would suck if I were to be stuck there by myself for like months and months on end because I also have to stay there during the summer for summer courses.

I have two finals (physics and calc 2) back to back and a research paper to write all due in like 6 days. I have literally no time to do anything besides study. The semester is literally over next week and then I will be able to clean up if that's what they want me to do. I don't even make that big of a mess. I alternate between the same two shirts and pants so it's not like I have loads of dirty laundry. And my mom is a germaphobe so she overreacts. And it's literally just my room that I don't clean all the time and I told my mom that's it my room and I can do what I want. And it's seriously not bad at all. I just have a few notebooks and papers lying around and the bed is sometimes a mess, that's it. I told them I'll take 2 minutes to fix it if that's what they want. But it's too late. They want me gone. They keep saying I'm going to be gone soon and they are going to be so happy being without me. They accuse me of being a spoiled brat who has everything handed to me on a plate. I told them they should be lucky that I have a full scholarship to go to college so they don't have to pay for anything. I also pointed out that my dad does absolutely nothing all day either besides work, and he got really defensive and angry, but it's true. He treats my mom like her sole purpose in life is to be in the kitchen all day and serve him. 

They also accused me of being annoying because I study in the living room, even though that's the only place I can study since my sister took over my desk study area that was supposed to be mine. They get annoyed at seeing me there all day and they tell me I should just study in my room, but I have back problems and studying on my bed hurts my back a lot.

I don't know what I'm supposed to say. My dad hates me and wants me gone and even if I try to reason with them they don't care. They are going to send me back and it will literally be awful because I am pretty sure I will spend every single day for months in a tiny apartment room with one small window.",22Apr2020,3
974,"For the last 3 years I worked in a lab as a work-study student. The lab has closed for now for obvious reasons, and the university has a hiring freeze until activities resume. 

My employer and I verbally agreed that I’d work here for a year, but didn’t agree about payment at that time. Partially because we were going to discuss it the week after the shutdown. However, my employer seems to have forgotten, and he technically can’t make anything official for now.

I’m a little nervous to reach out and straight up say “Hey, how much am I gonna get paid?” I know I have to be more courageous and standup for myself in the job world, but this would be my first “real job,” and I’m kind of nervous about it.

976,"My dad is a sex pervert. My sister and I just had a long talk about it. 

When we were little, maybe around 6 or 7 to about 8, he would make us go up to my mom and say, ""Tonight is the night, Wheezie."" In this way he would solicit her for sex through us. 

When we would go to the beach, instead of filming us swim and play, he would zoom in on my mom's buttocks, and the buttocks of perfect strangers as well. 

He used to watch the Fashion Network in our living room in the middle of the day just hoping to see a nip slip. He would jiggle his balls. 

We caught him one time watching an underage teen girl mow the lawn. He was making sexual noises. 

After my sister got a boob job, he kept making unsettling jokes about her boobs. Now she will no longer go braless in the home of my mom and dad even if it is an overnight visit and she is in her pyjamas.

When I was a college girl he said I should be experimenting sexually. 

He got fired from one job (maybe more but one we know of) for molesting his coworkers. 

He made my eight year old sister wash his back during his daily bath and he only covered up with a wash cloth on his weiner.

I have never lived anywhere else, lived anywhere alone or in fact even payed rent or done much for myself. I have had the same circle of friends since childhood and have recently split from my long term partner, as he would not leave with me. So I am going all by myself. 

I have no idea what to expect! I am unsure if it’s better to rent an flat for myself, or to rent a room in a communal house sort of layout. Of course renting a room is cheaper but what is it like? How would I spot out a good room or flat? 

I am also not sure on the best ways to make friends in these sorts of places. I have never had issues making friends however I’ve often heard it’s harder to in bigger cities so what would people suggest?

At the end of March I had scheduled a dentist appointment for myself to have a cleaning. I've recently turned 19, and getting myself to go to the dentist/schedule my own appoints (when I really do hate going) has been difficult. 
Well, at this cleaning, the ladies that have seen me since braces back in 8th grade told me I had a ""pretty bad"" cavity, and that I should schedule and appointment for the soon future, lest it turn into a root canal. 
I noticed in about a week later the cavity they spoke of - and oh how it haunts me.
It's on my furthest back, right side upper tooth. Cheek side. It feels as though I have a broken braces bracket scraping against my cheek again. It's more than ""pretty bad"" I'd say - and causing me massive amounts of undue stress - but my dentist office will be closed until AT LEAST April 30th - May 4th

985,"First off, this is spoilers for Season 3 of Jane the Virgin so spoiler alert!!

Basically, I watched the episode where the main character's husband and my favourite character, Michael, dies from a sudden heart attack. After this, the series skips forward three years and so it doesn't give the viewers time to mourn him properly.

I've been dealing with death anxiety for a couple of months, especially since I've started dating my boyfriend. I love him and I could never imagine my life without him. However, my anxiety has been through the roof, and I just constantly overthink that something might have happened to him if he doesn't reply for even a couple minutes.

Now, I compared the relationships in the series to our relationship irl many times. I see my boyfriend in Michael as they're so similar, and especially since I can't see him during the quarantine, this character really helped me feel closer to him. But now that he's dead, I just keep getting anxiety that something's gonna happen to my boyfriend and I'm gonna be seperated from him and have to live my life without him forever. It absolutely kills me and it's getting in the way of my school work. I haven't been able to stop crying and it's also just annoying cause I wanna get on with my life as well.

Is there a way around this? Especially during this quarantine, I have no clue what I can do to get over it and move on. Any advice would be helpful :).",22Apr2020,1
986,"For the past few months I’ve gone through cycles of deleting my social media from my phone, never for more than a day really, and not telling anyone in the meantime what I’m doing. My mental health is in a pretty shoddy state generally and now as I approach the end of uni without really having any plans, I think it’s getting worse. I go through nearly daily cycles of feeling fine or even happy to then feeling awful.

I’ve noticed that a lot of how I feel seems to be linked to social media. I live in a rather small country where it seems like everyone knows each other on media. There’s definitely a hierarchy in this network and I definitely feel like I’m on the lower rungs of the ladder. I already have self-esteem issues so if I’m already having a bad day then social media can make me feel worse cause I feel like I’m not good enough. This also sometimes extends to my university friend group - sometimes it’s great and I feel a part of the group, sometimes feel like I’m being annoying and I don’t belong there. I guess my gut feeling when I’m like that is just to cut myself off completely by uninstalling my social media.

Here’s the thing. There are people on these sites with whom I regularly talk etc. and I feel like vanishing without explanation would be bad. However I’m so sick of going through this cycle that I kind of just want to rip it out at the root and get rid of it. I may be working abroad for a year soon so that’s also pushing me towards deleting everything and having a clean slate. I know I could just post something saying that I’ll be deleting social media but that seems attention seeking and I don’t really know if I want people to be asking to stay in touch via other means etc. besides my really close friends *who I will be staying in touch with anyway*. I’d rather I just slip away and be quietly. I feel like I need to go through a few months of just being completely on my own so I can be content with myself without comparing myself to others, but I still feel bad doing that in case people feel upset because I’ve effectively ghosted them or are worried that something has happened to me. But I can’t really see any other way than just ripping off the plaster and letting it take its time to heal, I guess. I think it would be the best for my own mental health but is it wrong?",22Apr2020,2
987,"Edit: 15F 

I spent the last year being friends with people who didn't really care for me. I won't go into specifics but 2019 was a really rough year for me. I made new friends, but there was a period of time from June to October where I had no friends. It sucked.

There were two guys that I talked to for a while. One turned out to do some pretty sketchy stuff and didn't seem like a good guy at all. The other lied about having feelings for me and it took months to get over him. In all, I haven't had a great experience with guys this school year.

There was this guy I liked in February and after the shelter in place restriction, we started texting a lot. We had really meaningful conversations and just overall a genuine connection that I haven't had in a while.

Being out of school has made me really happy. Like, I've had time to exercise and do things that I enjoy. I never had time for that stuff before. So basically, I don't want to jeopardize that happiness. I didn't really know how to explain that to this guy even though we both had feelings for each other. I didn't want a relationship.

I tried my best to explain but I feel like he didn't listen to me. I don't think he really read the texts. At one point I copied and pasted an entire message and he didn't notice, so... I'm just really bad with the pressure of dating. I've never dated anyone before so I feel like I didn't want my first relationship to consist of texting.

Without any pressure on me during this break from traditional school, I felt like starting a relationship would put too much pressure on me but I couldn't really explain that to him. It ended with us deciding not to talk anymore because he didn't want to talk to someone if I they weren't interested in dating.

Unfortunately, my stupid brain misses the conversations we had. I told him this but all he said was 'yeah.' So I don't think he's interested in restarting the conversations we had.

So, lay it on me. How bad did I fuck up?",22Apr2020,2

I wouldn’t consider myself introverted, but I didn’t go out all that often either. Prior to this COVID quarantine scenario, I maintained healthy amounts of contact with the people I wanted in my life and I was content. Some I could have talked to more but regardless I was pretty happy. 

Since this social distancing started, I have had more contact in a single week with family, distant family, friends, old friends, and basically anybody in my life family I’ve ever known than ever before. And I honestly hate it. I’m grateful, please know that. But especially now there is not much going on and I don’t have things to talk about particularly on a daily basis because every day is pretty much the same. Even still, I’m constantly hit up by family, immediate, distant and everything in between, for weekly Zoom conferences and it’s driving me insane. I love my family but I also don’t feel the need to talk to them every day especially when everyone is in good health. I understand this comes off as ungrateful and that I shouldn’t feel this way. But I do. I want a little less contact but also will never say so because you never know how much time you have left with anyone these days. 

So I guess to sum up here’s a question. Can anyone relate to anything I stated above or am I the only one? If I am that’s fine, I just think at times there IS such a thing as too much social contact.

Its an insanely short visual tl:dr of my last post made in August:
[I'm 17, and here is a TL:DR about my situation. What should I do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cxi6zt/im_17_and_here_is_a_tldr_about_my_situation_what/)
With some extra things that happened until now. It's a post which I encourage reading first, but its not necessary.

---

**What happened after that post:**

I completely changed my mindset, I started to take responsibility for any and every mistake in my life. Also I started to lay down my priorities for life

I started to disregard looking for a job because i think that its more important to sort myself out by fixing my sleep and work schedule before i burden an employer with someone who doesnt have the right work ethic.

I also started to get seriously into bodybuilding and am pretty confident that's its something i will continue to do in a few decades. I was always a skinny kid and people made fun of me because of that, so im pretty happy to announce that i managed to gain 10kg [22lbs].

Next thing is that I started drivers ed, I did fail it however which wasn't the best thing to happen to me, especially since i really needed everything i planned to succeed smoothly.
at first i blamed it on luck since i studied very hard for it and the questions where randomly selected, but like i said earlier, Its no one else's fault but mine.


and lastly I also worked on the new look of my website https://isthisgoodvol3.netlify.app/

---

**The Problems:**

Somewhere mid February my productivity went down, I think im lazy again, maybe my lifestyle wasn't sustainable?

I stopped studies for drivers ed, stopped working out, stopped eating - lost a little weight, and started to stay up late again.

is this normal?

**So my question now is:**

* am I still to naive and delusional about how everything works or do I have my head at the right place? 

* are employers going to care about all of this or just see a gaping hole in my timeline?

* what should I do?

1016,"I (25f) have been dating my boyfriend (27m) for 2 years. We recently moved in together, and quarantine has only made me more sure about this relationship. 

Around the same time we started dating, he and a few friends started a business. He put all of his savings into it, gave up a stable career, and dedicated his live to getting it off the ground. Before the shutdown they were working with many large companies and had 60+ employees relying on them. 

Unfortunately, COVID-19 has essentially shut the business down. Most of the large contracts have been canceled. Some of their smaller customers have gone solvent, and cannot pay back for work completed. It’s nasty, and my BF’s company is going to have to fire around 20 people next week. 

He’s absolutely devastated. This is his life’s work, passion, and income dying around him slowly. Everyday he comes home from work sadder and sadder. I know many of his employees are close friends with families relying on this income during the shut down. He keeps blaming himself for what’s happening and worrying about the future. In addition, almost all of his personal wealth is tied up in the company. This means that if the company closes he’s going to lose near everything. 

I just don’t know how to comfort and help. I’m trying to be supportive as possible, but it’s really hard right now. I’ve made it clear that I’m staying with him through this and love him. 

Is there anything I can do to make his life better? Even little things just to distract from his anxiety for a while. 


TLDR: My boyfriend run’s a business that is dying due to COVID-19. I’m looking for ways to comfort and support him in this time.",22Apr2020,1

I made a cool friend over a coding discord. He was very nice and had an odd way of wording things, which was due to his high functioning autism. But as we chatted more and more, it turns out he’s a misogynist as well as a misandrist, who is a strongly fundamentalist Christian (indoctrinated by those around him), and has problematic views towards trans and others of the queer community. We’re the same age and when not discussing politics he’s extremely empathic and a good listener with an inquisitive streak. He’s still young (high school) and I see hope, as we’ve grown quite close, at least for internet friends. I don’t fight with his views but neither do I concede, just listen. But I would like to take a more active role in helping him see more perspectives. If not completely change, I would like to be a good influence. Female, btw.

Any tips?

TLDR; how do you change a person’s core beliefs, if they are toxic and problematic ones, with the least amount of conflict?",22Apr2020,3

1019,"Hey guys. I just finished my freshman year of college (basically) at a commuter school. I have to make the decision to transfer to my state flagship two hours away by May 1. I didn't make a single real friend my freshman year. Not sure why I'm so antisocial. My parents keep telling me it's my fault, I'm very passive, but I'm not sure what could be wrong with me that I'm so awful.

Basically this: **Is it realistic that I can break my habits in a satisfactory way to have a college experience here or should I transfer?** Should I wait another year? My state school is one of the top party schools and it's in a rural area (Champaign-Urbana) and my current school is where parties go to die, in Chicago (UIC).

We did stupid shit, didn't lose my virginity to him. Thank god. And now we barley talk, he don't really text me. We still have each other added on insta and snap. He told me he loves me and that I'm still his first love and I told him the same thing. And for easter I got a visa gift card of $20 from my nina.

- told to start of with an interesting fact about myself that’s not on the resume &gt; shared and had 5 seconds of silence from both interviewers &gt; that’s also when I can start to feel my voice trembling as I continued on 

- shared about my experiences but 2 of them looked really emotionless and they didn’t try to engage me and just let me talk till I stopped 

- but they did explained in great detail what the job entails and how it fits into the whole org chart and also shared with me all their new initiatives and what they expect to achieve 

- did not ask about salary expectations and ended off with telling me I’ll know the results in a couple of weeks

We have had some trouble a few months ago but worked those out and things were going really well again, even thought we aren’t able to see each other during this time.

I don’t know how to handle it because I do love him and I do want to be with him, but there are many reasons that I shouldn’t. He has hurt me mentally in the past and I keep giving him more chances holding things will be better. They have but the cycle seems to keep repeating with taking a break.

I was so happy but I never was boyfriend or lover of the year (now that I think of it I was kind of a prick) so things fell apart. So she started flirting with 3 of my classmates and probably planned to make out with one of them. She touched them, and talked to them in the same way she used to touch and talk to me, it broke my heart. The day before her birthday our school system was forced to shut down and it was the day before her birthday. So I hugged her and told her her happy birthday before we left. She sarcastically said "" so emotional"" and that shit hurts even if it wasnt much. Well two weeks passed and I dreamed that she was flirting with one of them.

She mentioned this a few years ago and we talked it out and she promised she wouldn’t and yesterday she said that every single one of them was a lie to make me “feel happy in the moment” of course this pissed me off but I was there talking to her and eventually we settled that she’ll give up on herself the day I do (I don’t plan on it, our friendship suffered through much worse but it’s seen some really good times) I’m not sure if she’s angry at me for it, she claims she “can never be mad at me” due to me being there for her but I’m not too sure.

1030,"So as the title states, I'd like to move house and found the perfect home I want to move into.  They want $1k less than I was prepared to give them to move into the property and it seems easy enough, awesome.

Then the guy tells me that they do a credit check and whatnot (and I understand this is normal) but when I point out to him that I do have a couple of dings on my credit, he becomes stand-offish and suggests I pay off these accounts prior to applying.

One of the debts I had when I moved into my current rental (I've been here 4yrs) and then I accrued two more through an unfortunate instance of unemployment.  I still have every plan on paying these off but I've also been furloughed since March 23 and am only going back to work next Wednesday.

Now, there's 3 of us that will be applying for the home and only I have ""bad credit"" (accounts in collections).  My bf doesn't really have any credit history and our roommate has a credit card and car that he keeps up with.

# So my questions are:

* What sites or information can the company see when they pull my credit report??  Is it the same report that I get from the annual credit report website?
* Can my less than grand credit be overlooked if my boyfriend and roommate both qualify?

(I've also already asked if I can simply pay another $1k down towards a deposit if I don't qualify and he said they very rarely do that anymore).

I'm just desperate to move.  I hate the house I'm in now with all it's multitudes of problems and the neighborhood is sketchy af.

1032,"So I [M21] been unhappy/lonely for years now and ended up getting really depressed for a few months and am still dealing with depression and mental health issues. I'm really trying to have healthy habits and get better though, and I have tried therapy. It wasn't an effective experience, but I'd really like to try it again, but I honestly don't have the money for it right now. 

Anyways, I have a really close friend [F21] who I have known for 6 years. We have always stayed in communication and talked a lot, even when she moved out of country for 9 months. We have always been open with eachother and would talk about how we're doing and feeling and things that we are struggling with.

My mental health set me into bad habits, and I don't really have any friends besides her and 1 other person who I try not to talk to too much because they don't help my mental health. I have been lonely for probably 3 years now, except for last summer when we texted and hungout a lot (once or twice a week usually). I was doing much better during that time, but when she left for college last fall I started struggling again, and then over time she got extremely busy and could barely ever talk.
My depression got much worse, to the point of me sending long unfiltered messages about how I was feeling to her, sometimes in the middle of the night because I couldn't sleep. (As a side note, she had really been helping me develop positive habits like getting out and doing group activities to meet people, but then covid happened)

Now, from what I've read, and what I got from my therapist it's it's healthy and important to have someone to be able to talk to, but you don't want to overdo it to the point of it becoming too much for them, which I did.

The unfortunate fact is that I had developed feelings for her (influenced somewhat by my mental health and that I dont have much other friends especially female friends). I was honest with her and told her that I was trying to get over it (I'm over it now, and have told her that I'm over it, and as far as I know she believes me), and telling her didn't cause our relationship any harm. We have both liked eachother on and off in the past, but we're just not compatible for eachother.
Anyways, that mixed in with me venting my unfiltered depressed thoughts to her began to be too much for her, which is totally understandeable, I think also considering how busy she was, so most of our interactions were just about my mental health.
So she said she couldn't be the person I could go to anymore and I needed to get a therapist. Fair enough. But I had a really hard time with that. I did go to a therapist and it was not a helpful experience.
Then I went on a ski trip, spent time with some of my relatives, met new people, and the trip gave me a lot of perspective and I started doing much better comparatively, although I'm still not out of the woods.

Then covid happened and she came back to my home town, and i contacted her and she said it was a very stressful time for her and that we should limit our texting to when she actually had time. I sent her one last text to give her some important info with where I was at, and then I was not going to text her until she initiated. After 2 or 3 days she texted me and we started talking more often again, with me trying to have some restraint talking about my mental health.

Things were getting much better between us, until she said again that I was texting her too much, which I had intentionally been trying not to do, and didnt think I had been doing. In the past, I've always texted my close friends everyday or pretty much everyday, including her. And I had been trying to make sure I was only having short texting interactions with her. And she had been sending me stuff fairly often and initiating sometimes as well, so honestly it was a bit out of the blue for me.

Anyways, unfortunately her saying that made me get very anxious because that was where most of my social interaction comes from right now, and that caused me to slip back a bit mentally, and I overwhelmed her again because I was trying to just communicate about my mental health and let her know that I felt scared about not being able to talk as much because I tend to do worse with less social interaction, especially now with covid and not being able to go out and meet new people. And she said she needed some space again and had to go, but she knew I had more to say so said I could send her a text.

I sent her a text apologizing and letting her know that I am okay trying to text her less, and just letting her know where I'm at in general. And I asked her if it would help if we arranged a dedicated time every so often where I could talk about how I'm doing so it wouldnt consume our other interactions, because I really just want to be able to talk to my friend.
I also let her know that I really dont want to put pressure on her or make her feel responsible for my mental health because she is not responsible for it at all, and that I am the one solely responsible for my mental health. And I tried to explain that I don't need her to be my therapist and come up with solutions or whatever, but that I just need someone to talk to to be able to get thoughts out of my mind and off my chest.

But, I really am at a loss. I'm trying my hardest to think and act reasonably while I have an unhealthy mind, but it's hard and I know I have slipped up and overwhelmed her sometimes.

I just l feel like it's a paradox, because I really do need social interaction from my friend, and to be able to talk with her about how I'm doing (i know i cant expect her to be ""at my disposal 24/7"" obviously), but I don't know how to ask that of her without putting pressure on her because she's the only one in my life who I'm comfortable turning to for help. And I've told her that I hate the pressure that her being pretty much my only friend puts on her, but I don't know what to do about it, and i want to work it out with her so she isnt overwhelmed.

And I get really overwhelmed and feel like my mind is spinning when she gets overwhelmed and takes a step back to get space. And I feel like she only starts to get comfortable with the idea of me talking with her about my mental health in the times when I am doing better and don't need to talk, but then when i am doing worse and i try talking to her she immediately gets overwhelmed.

And I'm not blaming her, I know I might be doing something wrong here, but I am really trying my best to understand, and I want to work with her to make sure she is comfortable. But it's hard to know what to do when I know my mind is unhealthy.


Right now I'm waiting for her response to the long text I sent her. I've had some time to think about my behavior and I've realized some things, and I'd really like to talk through some things with her to see if we can work it out, after she responds.

I'm just worried she's going to say she's not comfortable with me talking to her about my mental health anymore, even though I'm trying my hardest to figure out how to do it in a healthy way, but I need her to communicate with me. And if she tells me that, i wont know what to do because it would be my closest friend of 6 years telling me she isnt comfortable giving support, and that I cant even communicate with her to try to make it work.


Does anyone have any ideas for what I should do to make her feel comfortable and interact with her in a healthy way? And you can be blunt to me, I know my mental health makes me act unhealthily sometimes, so if there's something I'm not seeing, please tell me. I just don't know what to do and don't really have anyone else to go to.


TL;DR
I have been depressed, and I overwhelmed my long time friend, making her feel like I am solely relying on her to ""keep me above water,"" even though I am trying my best not to, and am trying to build healthy habits in other ways. But she is the only one I can really turn to to talk to, but it is hard to communicate with her. What should I do to make her feel comfortable and interact with her in a healthy way?",22Apr2020,1

1034,"Hey all. When I was 15 years old, I reached out to my half brother (same mom) and said that I’d like to know him and basically just “hi, I’m your sister.” He’s 6 years older than me. He responded very positively. He was adopted and raised in a different part of our state, and my paternal grandparents raised me. When we first reconnected, our birth mom was in prison. 
We talked all the time. He kept saying he’d drive down to my town for the summer to visit me, as I hadn’t seen him since I was 5, and we shared a lot of interests. I was very happy to have a brother. 
About a year later in 2016, our birth mom got out of jail. She never relinquished partial custody of me, so I was required to have some form of contact with her as a minor. Around the same time she got out, my brother’s adopted father passed away. My birth mom was on my dad’s ass a lot and would harass him over Facebook, and he ended up trying to just push her onto me. He asked if he could tell her about my brothers dad passing, and I said I’d ask. I asked him, and he said he’d “ask, but the answer was probably no.” He hasn’t talked to me since then
Our birth mom ended up getting his number and began calling him. The theory is that he might think I have her his number, which I would never do. There’s no proof that this is what he thinks, but I don’t know what else it could be. Over the past 4 years I’ve sent him a lot of messages, ranging from, “are you okay” to “happy birthday” to “I thought you of all people would know what it’s like to reconnect and then be left behind” to then an apology for saying that, all the way to recently when I said “I hope you’re staying safe during all of this”.

When I masturbate I feel really dirty and alone. Like, I'm not in a super sex positive environment and I don't really get to talk to people about anything. I can't just pull up a hardcore porn video and enjoy it even when I'm insanely horny (which is basically all the time). I think its do to a lot of the shame I have about it just from years of being told it was dirty. Now that I'm older I don't believe that mentally but emotionally its still there.

The only time I work through it is with another person. LIke, I struggle to masturbate alone. Its like I need a woman talking to me about it just gently guiding me through it. Asking me what I like, what i want to watch, and kinda pulling me out of my shell. Then we can start sharing stuff, then we go from sharing lightly erotic stuff to more pornographic stuff and then to normal porn. I love sharing what I like with someone, I love watching it, but I just feel like i can't alone.

I am unsure if I can still press charges / have any kind of action taken against him because we broke up two months ago. It’s not like I’m currently being abused or we just broke up yesterday. 

If anyone has any info they can share please let me know. The abuse is still affecting me to this day and it makes me angry knowing he’s walking about as if he’s done nothing wrong. I feel defeated. PS: I live in Canada (if that changes anything regarding laws etc).

1039,"Hi! This is gonna be long so bare with me

We've been friends for over 2 years. I met him my freshman year of college (I'm currently a junior) and it was clear he was interested in me from the beginning. Long story short, we talked for awhile, eventually kissed (thats the furthest we've gone) and I eventually asked him what his intentions were. He said he didn't want a relationship at the time and we left off on good terms and stayed as good friends. Sophomore year came along and we still stayed as friends and he would ask to hang out here and there but we never did anything physical or anything

Summer entering this school year, things changed completely. We began to talk a lot through Snap, he would tag me on things on Facebook. Immediately when classes started in August, he asked me to hang out which then became a consistent thing throughout the year. From August to March, he did a lot of things for me such as: asked to hangout a lot more often, always pay for my coffee several times, always try to hold my hand when we hung out, bought me wine, cooked for me (even bought me a steak because I specifically asked for one), asked to hang out in the city and Facetime over winter break. We were at two parties together this year and he stayed by my side the whole time which was unusual because the past two years he would be hooking up with other girls. At one of those parties, I was dancing close with another guy and I knew he got jealous but just didn't say anything. Anyways, he also remembered my birthday and bought me a bottle of wine after I jokingly asked for one. At my party, I got really drunk and was apparently flirting with his friends and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Fast forward to March, our school required all of us to leave because of COVID19. The day before we all left, he asked to hangout with me because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, he pays and holds my hand. Eventually, we go back to my room and we talk for a bit. Eventually, he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I say I'm not good at this physical stuff (By physical I mean like kissing/making out - i have no experience) and he ensures me its fine. I say I'm only comfortable with just the cheek and he just kisses me on the cheek and kind of just makes out with my neck. We then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he's coming too. I dance with my guy friends and then later, I see him hooking up (making out) with another girl. I then got kind of pissed so I find another guy where I eventually sit on his lap and I knew he saw it.

I know I should’ve asked what his intentions were but I feel like he should be the one making it clear if his intentions from freshman year changed — not me. I'm not sure if I should reach out because I don't know if he still has feelings for me or if he even thinks about everything that has happened. We’ve barely talked since all of this happened (it’s been around a month) and we’ve always kept in contact since freshman year except now

I like him but I’m confused if he just wanted to hooked up or something more

tl;dr: I don't know if this guy just wanted to hookup with me or something more.",22Apr2020,1
1040,"I met someone online a few months ago. At first it just seemed like it was just a friends with benefits thing since we just really had this crazy sexual attraction for each other, but we also got close pretty fast; we are both pretty depressed, and he was getting over someone as I was also going through something similar, so we were there for each other. We also talked nonstop about any random topic. To be honest I didn't think he would actually be interested in having a real relationship with me as I'm 9 years older than him (FYI: he's over 18), and I didn't really want a relationship at first either as I'm very emotionally damaged, but as time passed, I really fell for him and started wanting an actual relationship. He also mentioned that he was in love with me and that he wanted a relationship multiple times and I had started making plans in my head to meet each other after the whole COVID-19 mess ended.

However, about 3 weeks ago, he mentioned being really anxious about his future and not having any career or a job, and even mentioned he wanted to spend more time together to see if we could actually have a relationship. He's been really distant and sometimes takes hours to answer, seems very uninterested in talking in general, and the sexual aspect has died down completely. I've asked him and he says he's just going through a phase where he's not really actively interacting with people and is just really anxious. My insecure brain tells me that he just changed his mind and he's using that excuse to get rid of me, but I also get why he wouldn't want to have a relationship at the moment. I'm just a complete wreck, I really miss him and can't sleep at night because I think I did something to push him away, and I don't think he's coming back to the way he was. I keep trying to convince myself that it was for the best because of the age difference, but I haven't fell this hard for someone in a really long timee.

What do you suggest I should do? Do you think he just needs time? How can I stop having feelings for him?",22Apr2020,1
1041,"I befriended this guy online. We had similar interests, music tastes and humor. He came out a bit strong telling me he had feelings for me the 2nd day after knowing me! I told him I don’t feel romantic feelings towards people I haven’t met. Anyways, we chat for 1 week and even videocall once. He was fun to talk to —that is until he went on a whole intense racist spiel against black people —and then adds he isn’t racist because he likes Asians. 

Of course that threw me off because my first thoughts were, “okay. That was pretty intense. *enter defense for POC* “ Eventually I wanted to drop the topic because he kept ranting and I started to feel uncomfortable because I had friends who were African American and they’re cool. We drop the topic later after I become silent and start talking about other stuff. 

Fast forward to today, we’re talking and joking and then I use “Y’all” while talking to him to which he says “ew” and he finds that type of speak gross/ unpleasant. And I explain to him that I hang out with my African-american coworkers and we speak like this and it’s fun. He then goes on another tirade about his dislike for black culture and blah. I try to counteract his remarks by explaining why his thoughts are racist and how he started to sound like a white supremacist. He doesn’t let up and eventually I call him out saying he probably doesn’t see it cus, and I hate to say this, his white privilege and he’s being narrow minded. 

Now he says I’m a bigot and I hurt his feelings for judging him. And I’m flabbergasted! This seriously frustrated me that I had to ask advice from 2 of my guy friends who then tell me to block him because he is racist and intolerant. And I did just that. But I felt bad. Like he was a cool guy and I think we could have been good friends if not for his racist rants. I always thought I was open minded and tolerant. Was it the right thing to do? Or was I overreacting?

She didn't know it was my first time and I didn't know it wasn't her first first time. 

After that we talked about that and I just thought that in this world things doesn't work like a fairy tale. I stopped thinking about it and I kinda assimilated it.

1044,"Ok, long question here but I really need a person’s opinion. I go to a high school and there is this man that helps run the sports clubs and works there. He is high functioning autistic. Recently, he was outed for trying to meet up with a 13 year and asked her very disgusting and sexual questions online. Turns out the 13 year old girl was actually popsquad, people who expose sexual predators. They have their own videos online to expose pedophiles and I saw the video of them confronting him and showed screenshots of the texts. Many people at my school are making excuses for this man since he is on the spectrum. And even my local newspaper took his side. However in my opinion it’s still wrong, usually, high functioning autistic people know the difference between right and wrong and if he doesn’t he then shouldn’t be allowed to be in a position of power around adolescents. Also when he was caught he kept saying “i didn’t do it!” And started deleting the messages which makes me think he knew perfectly well what he was doing. Am I right for believing he should be arrested and fired?

I know I am not the most skilled or most experienced student graduating. I have been interviewing extensively with a medium-large size company in Ohio for the past 2 months and they finally gave me a job offer. The pay is 36k, the benefits are decent (according to my friend who graduated last year and lives on her own), and after some negotiation, they added a 1k reimbursement for moving. I can't decide if this opportunity is worth taking. I know I am entry level graphic designer, so I am not expecting much but I had hoped for 40k, so considering that I will be moving to another state, should I be more picky? I liked the people I talked to, and the work is interestng enough, and most importantly it will be the experience I need to move up one day.

Growing up I lived in the middle of nowhere where my closest neighbors were my cousins sho lived half a mile away, and we had to drive 45 miles to the nearest grocery store. I also have pretty decent social anxiety, tourettes, and mild Asperger's so I'm not good with people.

So I moved halfway across the country and bought a house in a small town in a cute little neighborhood. It was a recently flipped house in my price range and only a twenty minute drive to my college so it was perfect for me. but Everytime I go outside I'm really aware of how close everyone is and I feel watched all the time (even though I know it's irrational). 

I love to garden and I want to put a privacy fence up at least in my backyard so I can feel comfortable going outside to garden/exercise and just enjoy being outside. Also so my dog can run free and we can play catch

I was wondering if it would make me seem creepy or if it was socially acceptable to make the privacy fence go around the front yard too so that we have more room to chill in the outside without worrying about observers and so my dog doesn't bark when she sees people outside my bedroom window (that faces out to the front yard) another thing is the fence would make me feel more secure as I'm a 23 year old woman living alone in a strange state and a fence is one more barrier of protection.

I spoke with my therapist and she told me to keep telling myself to not think the thoughts and that I would never do such awful things. I already do that, more than I get the thoughts to be honest. These thoughts just randomly popped up one day and it went downwards.

I quit watching crime shows weeks ago because of the thoughts and I kept getting scared.

1052,"Hello there,

I am using a throw away account because I do not want my friends to know that I am struggling with this problem (just in case you look at my Profile and it seems empty...). I also do not wanted to post this in the r/relationshipadvice subreddit because it is not a relationship (yet?). I might do so later. 

Ok, now let me get started. I am a guy in his early twenties and I met a female friend of mine before that corona thing came up in the beginning of the year. it was only the two of us and I went to her place because she was a little sick the days before but otherwise we could not see each other(We know each other from school).  She did not want to go out and I was just passing by because of a ""meeting"" (study related). So when I got there she went in for a hug, which I wasn't to sure about since she was sick and corona was somewhat a thing already. But I went with it. We had a good time talking but I also felt like she made long times of eye contact. She even apologized once for what I was thinking having her legs open towards me and thinking I got distracted by it while talking. No the thing is I do not know if I just saw that because of hormones and a long train ride before that or if she really wanted to give me a sign. 

The thing is, I do not know what to do because I would like to date her, but there are some things that stop me from asking her out but also things that kind of give me a sign to make a move ( I guess). But let me explain.

Pro: I think the situation is a good reason. I also asked her if she wanted to meet since I am passing by the place she lives at and she knew it would just be the two of us. (I also found out she had a tinder profile a couple of weeks before that, which does not have to mean anything). 

Con: The main reason I know her is because a group of friends, that mean a lot to me, which pretty much only consists of girls and me. If I know fuck up, I would probably loose that group. Another problem is, that I am constantly on the move for at least the next two years and I  (probably 4-5). Which would really suck in a relationship. (not a big fan of long distance relationships.)

Neutral: I am not the type of person, that just wants to get laid. I mean I would do it, if she wanted to, but I appreciate affection more. (I might be asexual because I do not really feel the urge to have sex with anyone. That does not mean I am not interested in a romantic relationship)

&amp;#x200B;

I do not know what to do? Should I kind of ask her out on a ""second date"" when this corona stuff over and just tell her the struggle I am in? Or should I just forget it and enjoy the group of friends? Or maybe something completely different?

1053,"Ever since he (11) was little, my younger brother has considered me (19) a role model. And while I wouldn't consider myself a great one, I try to show him and teach him all the good things I can. We're eight years apart, so the things I was interested in when I was his age are probably pretty different, sure, but some of the things he says/does/is influenced by really irk me and kind of have me worried.

Five Nights at Freddy's. The game, albeit pretty repetitive and dull imo, isn't necessarily a horrible starter horror game for someone his age. He has this... Obsession with it. We're all fans of some things and that's totally fine but... Why this? With the way technology is advancing and the huge varieties of modern games, why is he stuck on this? Same thing with Roblox, which is also not a bad game; it has plenty of creative outlets and an okay online community. My brother never stops playing it. And if he isn't playing it (when my parents tell him to stop) he watches YouTube videos about it. For hours. Several. Hours. YouTube is another one of those things that I'm fine with, I actually like YouTube and I have a few channels I like to watch, but I feel like he follows all the negative aspects of things and lets them influence him as much as possible. 

In the earlier part of the 2010's there was that phase where everyone thought ""randomness"" or being ""weird"" was the coolest thing since the internet, and I feel like now that he has access to the internet, that's the phase he wants to be in. I hear him say things like ""I never meet anyone like me who's super weird and loves FNAF like me."" I want to just say to him, ""That's because FNAF is dog shit and the community is full of weirdos that aren't the 'good' kind of weird,"" but that was just start an argument. 

The things he is interested in aren't bad necessarily, but the things I try to show him seem to be lesser than the things he likes. Without context that sounds like I'm being stupid, and maybe I am, but how do I explain to him there are better, more enriching and amazing games or YouTube channels etc that he can get into that are objectively more well-made and skill intensive games than FNAF or Roblox? 

I think I'm worried that he'll be an outcast like I was in high school (dramatic, I know). I don't want him to be that ""weird"" kid who tells everyone about a game that died five years ago. I've known a lot of people like that, some of which have interests I really don't agree with, like bronies or furries (no offense to bronies or furries), and I don't want him to be THAT kid, if that makes sense. He's a great kid and he's into some weird shit but I want him to fit in. Sometimes I feel like he plays Roblox so much BECAUSE he knows the fanbase is mostly youger kids that he is better than at the game. 

Am I just being selfish, or is wanting him to get better hobbies a good thing? Hopefully this makes sense and I'm not just rambling.",22Apr2020,1

1064,"
A male friend of mine that I have known for over 7 years (let’s call him Matt) reached out to me when I “broke up” with my best friend. He reached out and asked me how I was doing, etc. 

Now I have known him since middle school and when I first met him I did have a little crush on him. Time flew by, and I sorta repressed my feelings because once we were in high school he started seeing other girls and I told myself that nothing would ever happen between the two of us. When I started ninth grade I was less confident person and to be honest I was self conscious about my weight and basically the way that I looked. I wore baggy clothes nearly everyday, wore the same sweatshirt everyday, always had my hair tied up, etc. 
I am currently a senior. Throughout high school I never really had a romantic relationship and no one ever showed any interest in me. When I started my senior year, I was surrounded by people who were having sex, were in relationships, and both of my two close friends at the time were hooking up with guys. I felt like there was something wrong with me, I thought I was unattractive. 

When I started my senior year, I genuinely wanted to catch the attention of other guys. So I started taking care of my body, wearing a bit of makeup, wearing dresses, honestly I felt good and I started to radiate more confidence. My self esteem was so low that I felt like the only way I could validate that I was attractive was if another guy wanted me. Which when I look back on it, I feel so dumb for feeling that way. But up to that point the furthest that I done with someone else is make out and I wanted to know what is like to feel “wanted”. But unsurprisingly, I did start to catch the attention of other guys. One of them being Matt. 
We hooked up twice and it was really fun.

Although I love Matt and yes I do, although I liked him I would not say that I love him in a romantic way. He is my friend and I love him in a platonic way because he’s been my friend for a long time and he is just a familiar person. But Matt has commitment issues and I don’t really blame him. His father left him when he was young and I definitely believe that this was something that psychologically scarred him. He’s is very good at hiding his feelings and he’s always had trouble keeping relationships. 

I knew this but although I still knew it I still couldn’t change the way I felt towards him. I still wanted to be friends with him. 

This girl name Miranda (again not her real name) she was dating Matt. Since I was close to him I would constantly ask him if it was true. And time and time again he denied it. It got to the point where he would call her crazy for lying. It wasn’t until I really started getting close to Miranda that she told me everything. She would say that they would always text and meet up. She had the screenshots to prove it and that’s when I realized that Matt was a complete scumbag. Like why would he lie about being in a relationship with her it honestly made no sense to me. And when Miranda would break it off he would beg her to take him back. But after about 4 months of dealing with that she finally dumped him. She warned me and my other friends that he is a manipulative scum bag and that she was blind to see it. 

I already knew all of this before I hooked up with him and I did not expect anything from him. I did not expect him to bring it up the next day or for him to admit feelings to me. Because I know that the only reason he did it was because he found me attractive. 
Now fast forward to present time and my current debacle. Matt recently reached out to me texting me nice things and reassuring me that we were still friends and that he still “cared” about me. Now along with being manipulative, he is pretty flaky too and a lot of the things he just won’t show up to plans. 
We were texting and he suggest to hangout. And I agreed because I have not seen him in a while especially during quarantine. On Tuesday he agrees to come over to my house on Saturday at 12. 
Another thing about me is that I am kind of a really prideful person and knowing that he is a flake I honestly felt like he was not going to show up. And I know from experience that it is not worth it chasing a guy. 

So Saturday rolls around and it’s 12 he’s not at my house. I wait till 12:30 and I only text him once: Hey are you still coming over? He doesn’t respond until 3 saying that he was asleep and that he just woke up. Which I know in my soul that that bullshit but hey, I am very understanding and forgive easily. I tell him that he can come over the next day at the same time. And I  clearly told him to let me know if he’s not coming because I don’t like flakes and I do not like being stood up. He says of course! The next day it’s 12 and he’s not there. Great. And I did not blow up his phone because honestly it would have just gotten me more upset and would have just wasted my time. 

A week passes, and I get texts from him at 3 am. He’s obviously fucked up but he texts me saying “you have a fine ass body” “lemme come over and hit that shit”, “I’m into you” “you got some fire shit on your Instagram” to be honest I was kinda into it because I’ve only hooked up with two people total and he’s one of them. He texts me he wants to come over, but he also says “but I’m fucked up rn and u prolly don’t agree” . I low key thought this was funny so I responded. But I did not take what he was saying seriously nor did I tell him that I wanted to hook up too because he was fucked up and also in a way I was trying to protect myself from getting hurt. 

But we go back and forth and I tell him straight up, “why haven’t you come over” and he starts giving me excuses and what not. But at this point, although I didn’t tell him I was down to hook up, I told him to come over the next day and he agreed. 
And I clearly and firmly told him, that if he was not gonna show up that he should at least leave me a text. That’s not that hard to ask for right? If your not gonna show up to something you let the other person know, it literally takes two seconds. 

The next day, no surprise he doesn’t come over, and he left me no messages. And this was kinda the last straw, I didn’t text him asking him where he was because at this point I didn’t care any more. 

But the thing that has been on my mind, really bothering me, and the reason that I am asking for advice is that he un added me from Snapchat and unfollowed me from Instagram. But WHY?!!? I didn’t text him when he didn’t show up, I didn’t blow up his phone, I didn’t insult him nothing. 
I don’t understand why he felt the need to do this to me. Even if we weren’t going to hook up, I genuinely wanted to spend time with him and talk to him and just be friends again. And I am not gonna waste my time asking him why if he’s gonna give me some bullshit response. I just don’t know what I did.",22Apr2020,1

1066,"*Hi Reddit!*

Allow me to cut right to the chase: I am a high school student and I am about to go into university. I have been accepted to two of the best schools in the country, and I am currently in the process of deciding which university to attend, each with their pros and cons. I require an impartial opinion on this matter as I am being swayed in every which direction by family and friends, which certainly is not the best way to foster an objective decision. 

Here are the evaluative positives and negatives of each decision:

**Option A is to stay at home and attend my city's university.** My city's university is a secondary campus to a larger university in a bigger city. Attending this university would mean that I would live with my family for two years minimum and four years maximum with no living expenses. I would still have to pay for a car, however, which means an additional expense. If I had a positive relationship with my family, it would not even be a question as to which option is better. My family is certainly not devastatingly abusive by any means. That said, they certainly do not foster healthy growth and are not a circle that I feel comfortable engaging with. I much prefer living on my own, and being my own person. In that sense, living with my family is somewhat of a hindrance to my growth. We have an extremely distant relationship as is, and that certainly would not change by continuing to live with them. Living with them would only be a means to an end. My father is advocating for this heavily, and while his points about reducing debt make a lot of sense, he is still pushing me toward the path of education that he wants. Not living on campus and attending a smaller university means I lose the university experience and have a much smaller social life. There are fewer clubs and programs here, and frankly, my city kinda sucks. It would essentially be high school 2.0, but this time I have to pay for it.

In summary, attending my city's university means that my only expense for my undergraduate degree is tuition and automobile expenses (I would *basically* have a free undergraduate degree), but at the cost of sacrificing my independence and university experience.

**Option B is to move to a large city that is relatively far away from my family.** I would be moving to a city which, frankly has been my dream to live in for as long as I can remember. To draw an equivalent, it is something of my country's Oxford or Harvard. Everything about this university appeals to me: the architecture, the environment, the student body, the location — everything! I love this university with all my heart, and I got accepted to it! Furthermore, I would get to be fully independent. Living away from my family is something I've wanted for as long as I've been alive. I know that one should not rush their youth, however, I do not feel as though I've truly discovered who I am mostly due to the judgemental nature of my family. Living on my own in the city I've always dreamed of living in would be the perfect opportunity for self-discovery and growth, as well as become my own person. I am not good at writing emotional sentiments, so my words here do not do it justice. However, it would truly mean the world to me to be independent and live in my own space.

This, however, would come at a cost. While tuition is essentially paid for, the living expenses would be large. For a four-year undergraduate degree, it would come to likely around 60 to 62k in living costs. If I work 40 hours per week during the summers, I could likely make around 8k per summer, as well as possibly work throughout the year to pay off debt. Likely, half of that could be paid by the end of my years at school. But, this is still a large expense, and I would still have to pay for my postgrad in full. 

In summary, I love this school and everything about it. Living there is something I have dreamed of my entire life. However, I would have a relatively costly undergraduate degree. 

**Basically:**

*Option A pros: much cheaper tuition, can escape postgraduate schooling with debt under 50k if I finance well. Option A cons: have to live with my family, still have to pay for a car, lose a lot of the university experience.*

*Option B pros: I love the university and the city, I get to be independent and live away from my family, and the education is marginally better. Option B cons: it costs more.*

Here are a few additional points to consider:

* I hope to practice law as an adult and I like to think that I have established a relatively decent path toward doing so. If law does not pan out, I hope to pursue a career in academia.
* I am not American, and my cost of education is markedly lower than the average rate of tuition in the U.S.A. That said, it is certainly not free.
* If I choose Option A, I will still get the opportunity in the form of a postgraduate degree to have the ""university experience"": I just lose out on the first four years.
* The quality of education at each school is relatively similar, but as a whole, that does not *really* matter as it is primarily a pre-law degree in a subject that I am passionate about. 
   * However, Option B school offers an extensive double-major program, which would allow me to explore more of my many interests.
* I do very well in school: my average grade percentage this year was around 95% or higher if I recall. I love school and everything about it, so I am definitely a nerd, haha. 
* I plan on taking a gap year either way and spend it working two jobs to finance my education.

**If you boil this issue down to its core**, it comes to deciding whether minimizing debt should be a student's top priority when going to university, or whether attending university should first-and-foremost be a developmental experience. It can be argued that answering such a question is a personal choice, but I would nonetheless like some insight on the matter. *Is cheaper tuition worth sacrificing an opportunity to be fully independent and explore a traditional university experience?*

I have always desired the ""quintessential university lifestyle"" — dormitory living, campus functions, academic environment, etcetera. My desire for university is more about being truly self-reliant in an environment of like-minded people and less about the traditional ""partying"" experience. For my entire life, I have always desired and been driven towards complete independence, so it's not exclusively a teenage urge for autonomy driving my behaviour. If money was not a factor, I would attend the distant university in a heartbeat without question. However, money is a factor.  

**TL;DR:** I can either live with my family whom I do not get along well with during university to reduce the cost of debt, or I can move away and attend my ""dream-university"", live out my fantasies of being independent, but incur more debt.

I hope this post is not too long, and I look forward to reading your advice. Thank you! :)",22Apr2020,1
1067,"I don't know my neighbours very well, but in the past we do the typical British thing of smile and nod when we spot each other. I only know the man who lives there, and my partner has his number. They have a child and an elderly lady living there too.

I've been worried over the last week, as our walls are thin, and I can hear the man really hacking and coughing. It sounds so uncomfortable. I've also noticed that the elderly lady isn't sitting in the garden with her chickens as often now. 
I'm worried that maybe the man might have covid19. If this is the case, I really feel like reaching out to him (via the phone) and asking if they're okay, and if they might want me to drop shopping/medicine on their doorstep, so that he and his family have the support.

1070,"ok, so to start off, I’ve been having really severe nightmares lately. I didn’t talk about it to any the friends I’m talking about, so there’s no way they’re just trying to freak me out. 

my best friend, I’ll just call her A, started telling me she felt like someone was watching her a few weeks ago. A lives in a nice neighborhood with a security system, cameras, etc, and has several people living with her, so I just told her she’s being paranoid. 

I just kept comforting her and assumed it was just her being anxious, which is understandable considering what’s happening to the world right now. it’s gotten to the point that she has nightmares nearly every night and will call me crying thinking someone’s watching her or coming after her. 

another of my friends, I’ll name him C, told me out of the blue yesterday that he feels like someone’s watching him. I just brushed it off until later that night when he called me saying he couldn’t even leave his room because of how scared he was. 

C and A do not know each other whatsoever, I knew A from elementary and met C by accident. so again, it’s not a monkey see monkey do type situation, as far as I can see it’s been happening on it’s own. 

several members of my family have been calling me about nightmares lately as well. 

this morning, around 4, another one of my close friends, posted something weird on his story. he deleted it later, but I screenshotted it. 

“Anybody else having scary stuff happening at home as in noises waking up at night nightmares feeling uneasy and like you’re being watched” which is exactly what my other friends and family were describing. has this happened before in recorded history?

1073,"I have a upsetting problem involving my stepdad.

For backstory:  He is a drunk. A very angry drunk. He has moments where he will throw insults, call names and toss threats like candy on Halloween. One threat is that he will bring another woman into the house. We've been so close to leaving him so many times because of it. We don't take his threats seriously because when he sobers up he apologizes for all of it. 

The problem is that he might have gone through this time. I have evidence of him talking to a woman and things from the beginning are. . .  heated. Heated as in after almost 10 messages there are pics. . . *those* pics. My mom has no clue he is talking to her. I don't know how to tell her.

1074,"Covid-19 

I'm struggling. Just like everyone else and I'm here in solidarity with you all.

My mental health over all of this has deteriorated to thoughts of suicide. No I do not have a plan. No I do not want to actively kill myself. The fact remains I've been having thoughts and thoughts alone.

No one needs to lecture me on mental health and how I need to seek help. I have help and have been medicated for almost 18 years. I'm active in my mental health, maintain meds, use my toolbox and reach out for help when I need it. That's why I'm here, before things get worse for me.

I've also been a recovery support specialist in a volunteer position in the past ans I had to be certified in my State.
The only reason I say these things is to let anyone know that I'm not just some guy with no experience at all.

I have many coping skills in my tool box but apparently it's not adequate enough in this situation.

My main issue in having is feeling like I'm being asked to choose my life or my livelihood.

Long story short my wife was told she be considered to have quit her job is she doesn't return soon.

I have several serious health risk issues and we cannot isolate if she goes back to work.
Her boss has been hostile and says he doesn't even care if we've got medical documentation.

Honestly I'm not looking for a free ride at all. I just don't know how we should proceed. I mean this is all something that we've never imagined happening.

So I post on r/legaladvice and my post gets removed for a speculation rule. I'm confused on how a question is speculative. Especially if you legitimately do not know what to do or where to turn.

The one comment on my question before it was removed made me feel like they thought I was looking for a free ride. Like I thought everything was owed to me.

I'm just so confused. I've always been told to ask for help or advice. When I do on looked upon like a freeloader. 

Does my life not matter? And why should I have to make a decision to risk my own life when there's no treatments or vaccines that are dependable right now.

I'm so hurt. I feel like I don't matter to anyone but my wife. I mean damn we are both really high risk but I'm the worst.

I'm trying to cope. I'm just trying to figure out a direction to head. I'm just so lost.

I don't even know what to think anymore.

It's bad enough we're down on food and no stimulus or unemployment for the wife yet (I'm disabled) but then her employer starts this stuff and I'm looked upon badly for asking for advice. What can I do to cope and get some possible answers.

I'm looking for serious advice without coming off abrasive. Please I need that. I don't need any additional triggers when I'm on edge of possible.

Yes I'm in constant contact with my mental health provider. Therapy is severely limited right now due to demands and being only telephonically.
Even still they don't give advice on how to deal with a legal or life situation, just how to cope.

How do I get a good answer for my own peace?
Do I just have to deal with my daily stress without no relief? 

I cannot breathe my way out of this or use any typical coping skills..

My stress won't completely go away until I have a direction to go with our problems.

You know everyone has bad moments and moods and I get that. But having no experience with a situation like this I'm at a loss.

I guess I'm just rambling now


I'm hurt, I'm tired boss....


I must go cry.

No pity party bur I just need a good cry. It helps sometimes.

1078,"TLDR: I now dread texting my partner due to their new blunt and upsetting attitude stemming from us not being able to see each other due to the Coronavirus.

imagine you text your partner when you wake up dreading their response. Due to the corona virus and us not having seen each other in months because of the UKs lockdown our relationship has been strained. 

They have said that I should fight more to be able to see them as both of our households have now had the virus and are out of the 2 week quarantine now. I have said no as a) I will not be allowed , and b) they refuse to do things like FaceTime and come over to stand away from each other at a safe distance. They say this is clearly me not missing them and therefore obviously I don’t love them anymore (not true I’ve done everything I can to make sure our relationship is still happy, messaging them in my usual bubbly self each day only to be met with a stubborn , upset and blunt attitude back) I feel exhausted. I even brought them a cake on their birthday and stood outside their house on the doorstep so we could at least see each other, they say while they appreciate the gesture, as I didn’t give them a hug they felt unloved. 

I feel really bad about this but recently I’ve begun to dread messaging them, as I’m scared their responses will be lacklustre, upsetting and downright mean sometimes. I started questioning if I love them anymore (coming to the conclusion I do and that as hard as it is I’ll try to be the bigger person in this situation, sometimes I fail and get angry and upset at them for acting like this when this is a two person relationship) which to me is a really worrying thing, it’s as though this is an entirely different person than I started dating a year ago. They say that my parents ruined our relationship , his birthday and our anniversary (we couldn’t celebrate due to the lockdown) and that it’s their fault and the fact I don’t ‘fight’ to see them shows I don’t love them and miss them which is completely untrue. 

I just want everything to go back to normal but it seems so far away. I’m worried and scared about it. 
But yeah, I know they’re only acting like this because they’re upset and frustrated but I feel taking it out on me every day is a strain I’m not sure our relationship can cope with, after all I too am sad and miss them but end up having my emotions ignored to accommodate theirs.",22Apr2020,1
1079,"Hi everyone. This has been bothering me for a long time and I understand some people have been through this and I really just need some help. 

I'm 22 years old and I have already attended post secondary but I decided that program was not for me, no big deal. I was working at a job I liked after that but got laid off back in December due to slow season and since then have been on EI. I took some open studies courses during that time to keep me busy and now they are finished and have done my final exams. 

I have a program picked out for myself, it is what I want to do. It's two years, and I'll end with a diploma. Time goes by so quickly you know? September is soon.  Currently I'm not doing anything (like most people because of covid) 

Im so scared to go in September even though I know this is the program I want. 2 years just seems like such a long commitment to me. I've always wanted to travel before I pick a career path, that's always been in my mind. If it wasn't for the Virus I'd pack up and go right now. I wanna do cool shit. I wanna go live on the island and work at a low paying job and make friends with locals, I wanna travel to another country for a month, I wanna be able to quit a job like the drop of a hat if I have to, to go do something cool. I havint done anything cool yet. 

If I go to school, I feel like my life will be over. Because then after school I have to find a job. And work for literally the rest of my life 9-5 looking forward to a week or 2 off once a year. It just seems so scary to me. I feel like I'm old already and I havint done anything. 

But then if I don't go I'm not gonna get my diploma until I'm in my mid twenties which is scary too! If I went next September id be working by the time I'm 25.  I feel like that's late going into a career nowadays compared to my friends. 

Another factor is what if I don't go and a second wave of Covid comes, and I won't be able to do any of this cool  shit anyway? Or what If I go to school and travel after, but I go do the things I wanna do and I don't want to stop? Or forget everything I learned in school? 

I wish I thought of this all sooner. I wish I went and travelled already after highschool  and got some more life experience. And now there's a pandemic and the future is very unpredictable.

I've never been someone who has needed sex every single day. I have a relatively low sex drive, and before our daughter was born we would have sex about every other day. Since then, it's more like 3 or 4 times a week.
Ever since we've cut back on sex, he's been acting overly sexual. He's constantly making innuendos and grabbing me, then getting offended if I don't want him to grope me in the middle of the kitchen. Every single time he talks to me, it HAS to be about sex, or talking about my boobs, etc. We can't have a normal conversation anymore.
I've talked to him about this a few months ago, but nothing has really changed. I understand if he's feeling frustrated that we only do it like 4 times a week, but with a 2 year old, we don't have time during the day and then we're tired at night.
I really don't want to re-approach him and offend him, and I don't want him to feel like I NEVER want to have sex. But I also don't want to constantly talk about it.

***Story***: I'm an ex-swimmer, and I've loved swimming ever since I figured out what swimming was and that humans could do it. I was on the high school swim team (which wasn't a good team because we're a small school but it was really fun to be a part of) and even though I didn't have any plans to make a career out of it I never thought I'd give it up. I started having some shoulder issues but be being me I ignored it and swam through it. Cut to me screaming and crying into my friend's lap in the back of another friends car as I get driven home because I fucked up my arm. I went to physical therapy and was diagnosed with double (on both sides) shoulder impingement due to overwork. Physioworks says, ""Shoulder impingement syndrome is a condition where your shoulder's bursa and/or rotator cuff tendons are intermittently trapped and compressed during shoulder elevation movements."" With a history of shoulder problems on my dad's side, of course it couldn't just be a mild case. My insurance isn't great and only gave me about a hundred visits per year. With me needing to go 2-3 times per week you can imagine how quickly those ran out. After round TWO (because the therapy overworked me the first time and landed me back in square one) of what our insurance would give me I was still strength training with 2lb weights, which is absolutely fucking pathetic. There's nothing we can do to get more professional help and I won't increase the work myself because I can hurt myself through overwork AGAIN because I'm still at such an early stage of treatment and I still need way more professional guidance. If I keep hurting myself we might end up in surgery land, which isn't a risk I'm willing to take. If left untreated it can cause damage to tendons and rotator cuff tears. I've seen a rotator cuff surgery, no thank you. I'm able to keep it where it is and not let it get any worse or let any permanent damage happen by doing the stretches and exercises I was left off with, but obviously I'm not able to use my arms to swim any conventional or competitive stroke. Basically, I'm screwed and can't swim like I used to anymore. The title is a little dramatic, I can still use my legs so I can do that mermaid swim if I keep my arms to my sides but that's not really safe to do in enclosed pools because your head is exposed, although it doesn't stop me from doing it when I can get to a pool that is fairly deep and not painfully crowded. I'm landlocked so large natural bodies of water that can be used for swimming don't really exist. If they do they're dangerously polluted from all the farming and factory work that happens out here and it's not a risk even my depressed ass is willing to take most of the time, this water could literally kill you with toxic wastes.

***Question:*** I'm not asking for any more medical advice, just how to deal with the cold hard reality of being land-locked. I haven't really found a replacement for swimming, and cramped shallow public pools aren't really doing it for someone that's used to hours of swimming in a large deep lane. Every time I get depressed about something my brain spirals back to this and makes it even worse, I was a swimmer my entire life and I could always go to the water to make me feel better. Does anyone have any ideas on how to get the fuck over it? I legitimately have water withdrawals, it is so sad. Has anyone else lost their ability to swim? What the hell do you do now in your free time that's as good as swimming?
