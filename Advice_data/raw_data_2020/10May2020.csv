I still think about this. I do not know If I was bad or not but I will tell what happened.

So,this girl (we will call her A) ""entered"" in my life last year. She was sometimes in my ex-boyfriend(B) group. A lot of the guys from that group has fallen in love with A(They were 6 and as far as Im conerned, 2 of this group have wanted to be with her,and one of them is asexual). I didn´t know why but still I didn´t care. Until my ex-boyfriend fell for her too(at that time,we broke up two month ago so I didn´t move on,and B and I were still having physical touch (kisses,cuddling,etc)).

So, B accompanied A after highschool because *she didn´t want to go alone.* She told me that she asked other friends before him and had tried me to accompany her as well(which, I did,some days). She also only went to ask them money if she went to speak with them first. I had the feeling that she was just using them. ""can you tie my shoes?"" "" Can you give me a rubber?"" ""Can you be my table? (At that moment she was copying homework and she didnt have a table)"" ""Can you accompany me until 4 pm because I don´t have anything more to do until then?"" and other stuff. She was also kind of bad, saying things like ""you are dumb"" ""why dont you get your head crushed?""""The gf of X(a friend of mine, wich almost have something with her but at the end they didn´t have a kiss)is really ugly(like it was a competition)"" and stuff like that. I was really stressed out about the possibility of B and A getting together because 1-I wanted to be with him and didn´t move on because B and I were having sex and 2-I didn´t think she was the type of girl which could make him happy(B was really warm with his past girlfriends and she was the opposite). One time,when the tree of us were accompanying her she just said ""Oh he didnt tell you about the taco thing?"" and after telling me she went like ""haha he is such an idiot (with the typical tone of silly girl)"" and you know,even If she went when she needed something or because she wanted to,she had always been next to him. I do not know how to explain it but I had the sensation of fooling around. After that, I spoke with her and asked her. She told me that she didnt want to be with him. Some days later,she spoke with me about a boy that asked her out. she literally told me "" I feel like I am able to tell him everything,as with B"".

So time passes,she is with another boy (let´s call him George). So,the year is ending and I can see that she posted a history in her instagram that went like this ""thank you for being this year"". She mentioned B but not george. I was like wtf. 15 minutes after deletes it and put another one with george in it. After a month,I entered a live that George was doing and said ""Oh,that girl is the friend of my ex"". A girl asked,whom? (refering to the ec thing) and he said ""A,I just broke up with her."" After that,I wrote to him and asked him if he is ok and stuff. He said ""I am"". He also told me that he got jealous because she went to a guys house to drink and that there were only guys and that she told him that she wanted to sleepover. I told him about my impression about them fooling around. The next day A calls me and asked me. I said the truth,and told her ""that was my impression,I´m sorry if it hurted you"" and she said ""we are not together anymore and we won´t get together again,so its ok"". After that she told me about how she had other boys and that her friends wanted her to be with others and that she didn´t know who should she choose.

Time passes and a girl said that they were planning to do a party for valentine day and that if anyone wanted to join it was ok. I didnt have any plans that day so asked her and she said that it was ok. So A was in the group. Her friend literally insulted me and said that I got into their relationship. She also said that I was like the boy from ""you"" because I asked once if she was ok to her because I didn´t see her for an entire week and it was strange because I used to see her everyday. She also said that I was a toxic person and that I had a toxic jealously.

I was really angry at the time,so I wrote to A. I told her that She was a clown,that I expected for her to be alone and that she was basicly a slang.That I only wanted to be her friend in the first place because of my friend (didn´t tell her who it was). The day after she went searching for me with her friends. So,we discussed. She told me that I have an obsession with B and that She even gave me an advice (her advice was ""If you are feeling jelaous between me and B you should not get along with B anymore"" because I decided to tell her that I was jealous about the attention he gave her and that it was hurting me. I had also told her that I was maybe not treating her well like not wanting to hug her because of that and because I was having nightmares about her killing me because of my anxiety(I had been diagnosted when I had a tachycardia attack) and she literally said ""YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT YOU ARE *THAT SENSIBLE""* like if it was easy for me to tell,but I thought that I owed her an explanation so I told her) she couldnt believe I had said that thing. I told her that I couldn´t endure her because of her way of being ans she said "" excuse me,and what about the people who don´t endure you?"" Her friends were also really bad at the moment. A´s friend putted her hand into my chest.I quitted it (maybe a little violent way,but she was touching me and I was really annoyed at the time because it was the 3 of them sorrounding me) and after that she literally calls a teacher (I discovered that the teacher was her friend). I said to A "" You are a s-(didnt finish because I decided to be silent)""

So the teacher goes for me in a demanding way and asks me ""what is your name? Accompany me to the directors"", A said ""she called me a slut and almost hitted my friend"".

So,I ended at the director office. After that I havent speak with A or with B. I just ask myself If I was the bad guy here. This has been chasing me for 2 months until now. I just feel bad because of this,I blame myself for what happened. I would like to stop blaming myself,or,at least,to release this feeling of shame that I have until now.Thanks for reading.",10May2020,1
2,"Okay so me m(15) and f(15) started talking last April, everyday for hours until early morning and then went out for a couple months after that and broke up about september.

And I sit next to her in class and we're mates and still talk we text about 3 days a week but it's just dead and she never initiates its but I'm so hung up on her still over a year later????

3,"My girlfriend and I have been dating since late August 2019 and are quite happy together, recently my girlfriend brought up the idea of starting an onlyfans account in a joking way, sending me a tik tok of an onlyfans creator showing her earnings, and saying “this could be us”

in the past my girlfriend and I have talked about the idea of her starting an account and in the end I decided that an onlyfans account was something that I just wouldn’t be comfortable with. I told her if she wanted to make one that I would respect her decision to do so, but she would also have to respect that Im not comfortable with it and I wouldn’t want to continue dating. This was of course very early in our relationship and im open to re opening the conversation with her. I love her deeply and I want to be open to her thoughts but I have quite a few concerns that I will talk about now

1. The chance of being identified in this community is apparently a big risk. My gf has quite a few easily identifiable tattoos and I don’t know how she would be able to hide those from her audience.
2. I believe she is led to believe that this will solve her problem with money, like it will end up just sending her thousands within days, but she failed to recognize that the person she was referring to in bringing the matter to me has 500k followers that were advertised to. I feel as if she is not going to receive nearly as much as she hopes for this.
3. would this not affect job opportunities? I want her to consider her future as well as her present situation and even if the pay off is big short term, is it worth it?

now of course, i may be very wrong about some of these points, i am not researched in the onlyfans lifestyle and didnt think i would have to be, all i know is that my girlfriend is interested and i feel like she would be happy if i were the person to open the conversation up with her.

finally, I am definitely uncomfortable with it myself. I don’t like the idea that she is selling pictures or videos that (in my opinion) should be special or shared with the person you love (when in a relationship of course). I respect sex workers completely, and I think people who are comfortable with it should go at it, and do what they think is best, but for me as a person, I don’t feel comfortable.

if anyone can help me out with my situation, what I am looking for is advice in how to handle the situation and how to go about our conversation. is it ok for me to feel the way that I do about her wanting to start an account? Is there anything else positive or negative that I should consider when talking to her about it?

TL;DR - My gf (22f) wants to start an only fans due to the amount of money she thinks she may make from making an account but I (20m) am uncomfortable with the idea, yet open to a conversation with her about the idea.",10May2020,1
4,"TL;DR at bottom

So as the title says, I have been sucking my thumb for as long as I can remember and it is a habit I am still working on getting rid of. I am currently 15 and still occasionally do it, but there are nights where I cannot fall asleep without it.

However, I am finding methods of quitting! I put tape around my thumb and index finger at night so i can't do it unconsciously. I also take melatonin supplements so I can fall asleep easier without it. To prevent myself from sucking my thumb during the day I have taken to using bitter tasting nail polish. 

Despite all of this, I still feel extremely self conscious of how my hand looks. The nail on my left hand is much weaker and more brittle, and the skin looks somewhat wrinkled. I dont like holding hands with anyone or showing my left hand in photos (like a picture of me holding something). I even write differently so that it isn't visible to people. All in all I just want my hand to look normal so I can stop hiding it. Does anyone else have experience with this issue? what can I do to fix my hand?

TL;DR I sucked my thumb for a long time and now it looks different, weaker, and overall ugly. How do I fix this and make my thumb look normal again?",10May2020,1
5,"okay so i moved in with my room mate in november. we knew eachother before and we are like sisters. we’ve known eachother for a long time and tell eachother everything. 
I love her dearly but lately i’ve been so frustrated with her. she has a cat and never cleans the kitty litter so sometimes our apartment will stink like kitty litter. she also does no general cleaning. every once in a while she will clean the dishes but majority of the time i’m doing them. since we’ve moved in she’s never done large tasks like wiping down the fridge or cleaning the tub, she won’t clean up after herself like wiping the mess on the stove or even bring her dishes from the living room to the sink. she leaves her make up all over the counter and never washes out the sinks. 

the problem is, is that she’s fully aware she doesn’t do anything around the apartment. she apologizes sometimes, and says she will change but doesn’t. She says she’s depressed, which is perfectly okay and valid but she won’t seek help or anything to help herself. i’ve suggested making a chore list so we can schedule things but she brushes it off saying she wouldn’t keep herself accountable. 
The most frustrating part is she’s not even working, we are both on EI due to covid, so literally ALL she does is watch TV and tiktoks. it’s so frustrating because she won’t take 20 minutes a day to clean up a bit or even clean up after herself. i don’t know how to bring it up because whenever she’s confronted with something she guilts me and just says “i know i’m sorry i literally hate myself, i wanna dieee” or avoids it. she’s so avoidant. i literally don’t know what to do about anymore. 
and it’s really embarrassing because when people come over she tells people “we work really well as room mates because we are ‘messy clean’ people” but in reality i’m just having trouble keeping up with all the chores because i don’t want to have to be her maid. 

what do i do?",10May2020,1
6,"So long story short - I've been in and out of university for around a decade now. I'm about halfway through an accounting degree, and while I'm doing well now, I'm incredibly unhappy. I hate my current job, and I hate the idea of spending my entire day stuck behind a computer. And also, knowing that it'll be 4-5 years until I'm done with my degree, putting me in my mid thirties before I can even start a career just fills me with dread. So I've been thinking about just giving up on it, and going into a trade, probably electricity. I know the pay is significantly lower doing that, but the time I was happiest in my life, I was working with my hands, doing something tangible - not behind a computer screen manipulating a spreadsheet. And it's not like I need a ton of money, just enough to live comfortably, and have the time to do the things that matter to me, such as weightlifting, traveling to theme parks, and that sort of thing.",10May2020,1

I am going crazy I cant take it anymore. Please help me guys.",10May2020,1
8,"Hi guys. So I've recently been having a tough time coming to terms with a loss of friendship I had with someone who wasn't good for me. To add context, around two years ago I developed a crush on a girl and we instantly connected. I thought, despite her having a boyfriend, she would end up liking me back — and she definitely said and did things that one shouldn't do when they're in a relationship. 

I'm not going to lie, I really did try to test boundaries here and there, but I never made a move on her.. and I always encouraged her to make up with her boyfriend after silly arguments they would have. But generally speaking, she talked a lot of crap about everyone and eventually I stooped down to that level.

The problem was, I'd always be that shoulder for her to lean on and she'd constantly reiterate that we were best friends. Best friends but we never hung out other than brief moments in college. Whenever I would try to make plans, she would explain that her depression and whatnot obstructed her from hanging out. Yet, she would go out with her boyfriend all the time.

I understand that she could have just not been mentally able to hang out with me, but instead she would always find a reason not to and tell me that in the future we would definitely spend the day together. Then whenever the boyfriend and her would argue, she would tell me about it and tell me how he's a selfish prick. Most accountable incident was when he was late to her eyebrow appointment and she told him to go kill himself.

Anyway, eventually it came to the point where she was actively leading me on. She would tell me things like how she can tell me more things than her BF, that I am the one who knows her most, how my opinion is the only one that matters to her.. all of this stuff. Her actions, however, consisted of just talking shit about people to me and avoiding seeing me in person despite saying i mattered to her a lot.

I decided to unfollow her. Part of me did this out of mere immaturity, but I know this was one of my few options as we fell out from her actively using her phone and ignoring me whenever I'd try to talk to her. Another argument was when she told a group chat that she had a sixth sense I liked her, to which many mutual friends read the message.. and the last straw was when she just completely ignored me yet again and started saying overall rude stuff. Some examples are - you look girly, you're so weird.

Anyway, after I unfollowed her, she blocked me from everything and I found her Twitter - which was the same username as her Instagram - because I was bored during Quarantine and saw that she called me a psycho stalker' online. I actually discovered her Twitter prior and she found this creepy but, come on, I search up everyone on other social media platforms just to see what they post. Especially if we are 'best friends', this can't be regarded as creepy, right?

So yeah, I confronted her for the tweets she made about me publicly and she tried justifying it by saying that Twitter is 'personal' to her despite me 'knowing her most', and then she persisted in saying I was two-faced because I was allegedly talking crap about her. If talking crap about someone is explaining how they hurt you constantly then I guess I do talk a lot of shit. 

She then was saying how she never meant to hurt me by saying what she said. I'm not exactly sure but I think anyone would be hurt if they were called those things. We ended the phone call and she messaged me a few times later, but now we haven't spoken for around a month and I'm still taking it real hard.

It sucks because other than the bad times, we were really compatible and she completely understood my dark humour. We both had a lot of trauma growing up and bonded over that, and I understood her mindset as I'm very much able to comprehend the intricate thought processes behind people's actions. That's why I'm able to say confidently that she never cared about me, but the validation I gave to her. She used me as a ladder to climb herself up. 

She said she missed me a lot and would hate herself for it during my confrontation, but it simply isn't true. 99% of our interactions would take place online despite us living in the same area. Missing someone equates to you wanting to see them, not rant to them about your failing relationship or how Susan's an ugly, fat bitch. (This is the kinda stuff she'd say about other people.)

I suppose I'm struggling. I also noticed that she made her Twitter private after us making up and just feels like she still has it in her head that I'm a 'psycho stalker'. Being a guy, this really tugs on my self esteem because I tend to identify with how I'm perceived and being creepy isn't a nice connotation to be branded with.

Any advice on how I can move on from the situation? Thanks a lot, guys.",10May2020,1

10,"So I matched with this girl (mid 20's) on a dating app... we're both people who are not promiscuous and looking for a legit relationship...

So we matched and began conversing, we have all the important things in common; faith, values, hobbies etc. We're both down to earth and good looking as a bonus.

Anyways, we're from different states, and she didn't know this at first... yet to my surprise, when she found out, she didn't really want to talk anymore.

That seems like a very trivial, irrelevant thing to say.... I mean for me, if I'm interested in someone, I wouldn't let anything like location stop us from continuing to bond.

I told her that we could talk on the phone or facetime, and she didn't seem to want to... I also told her that, true story, for a few months now I have been considering moving out to where she's at...

Not only that, but I'm also planning on a road trip in her region, and could stop by as I'm passing through... she told me that if I ever move out by her, to contact her.

The entire tone changed and now she doesn't want to converse anymore, 100% due to us living far away.

14,"Last night I was talking with this girl I’ve been friends with a while (decade). We are both in our mid 20’s and met at work. Haven’t seen her in person in some time (like 3-4 years), but hopefully will again soon. Still, things have heated up between us lately. Both of us going through a lot so been there over phone for each other. She knows I like her and I’ve said it outright and I know she likes me for who I am. For the better part of the past month we have talked every day most of the day and send snapchats and stuff. So, progressively have gotten closer over time. She is very flirty especially when drinking and likes talking to me a lot. ( But even when she’s not drinking she seems to enjoy communicating with me.) 

Last night she was drinking and asks for my nudes, so I send them and she loves them, and she said she would have sex with me , but wouldn’t send me nudes back, just teases, and doesn’t want to go on a full date or make anything official yet. 

I am confused as to what my next step is? She is giving all the signs she of interest but seems a bit hesitant. We are more than friends at this point and she seems like everything is going great, but doesn’t want to see me in person? It’s been so long. I’m ready.",10May2020,1

Idk why he couldn’t just say yes or no? Am I crazy? Or did this seem a lot for me just asking a question. I just wanted a straight answer you know?

17,"I am starting to get some existential worry about my life. I am really driven by money. I've never had much but my dream in life is to become mega rich and although I'm very driven, I'm worried that my goals will never be obtained. I'm just too ordinary. I am often perceived as smart but I scraped by at school because I never had a specific career to aim for or the will power to really try and get good grades. I was aimless. I have a good company to work for but I don't think I will ever become exceptional there. I have no killer entrepreneurial ideas waiting in the wings. I can't imagine myself doing a foundational uni course because although I'm perfectly literate I have terrible attention. The last thing I need is failure and a debt. I'm the complete opposite of a handy man. I have some hobbies that can be monetized but I'm no where near that good at them. Nor will I ever be realistically. I just fear that one day my aspirations will be looked back on as some naive fantasy that can be laughed at and I'll have to accept some platitude about being enough as I am. Having never been exceptional and never having achieved the dream life I want. My wife will accept that and convince herself that it was somehow always best this way and I will always envy and become very bitter.

Here's the issue, I don't enjoy it. I used to enjoy doing it, but I feel dull after doing this for so long. I am at a point where CrackedRack will probably be my life's work and I'll be settling down and starting a family while working on this channel.

People have told me, ""I sometimes wonder about you..."", implying that I lack in some sort of intellectual respect. I often find myself wondering, ""Is there something wrong with me? Something I'm just not picking up on?"". Maybe I'm just overly sensitive.

Sometimes I just don't have the energy to have a conversation. I just don't feel like it. So I end up saying very little, and I'm sure people end up interpreting that in many different negative ways. I'm also clumsy, always tripping over things, breaking things (adds to the ditzy persona I've unfortunately created for myself).

I'm gullible, quick to believe certain explanations of things when I ask, for example, ""So what is this tool for?"", even if their explanation was meant to be a joke.

So, my dad got the offer for a better job in North Carolina. He’s willing to live there himself while I finish off my next two years of highschool in where I currently live in New Jersey with my mom. However, if I were to compromise and move to NC my senior year (for 1 year), we’d sell our NJ house and buy a lake house in NC because that’s where my parents are planning their retirement. My parents are nice but the choice to move my senior year is 100% MY CHOICE. Which is kinda scary. 

They been bribing me into moving because im a bit hesitant with really awesome shit like they’d give me my mom’s whole ass car and I’d be able to legally drive it at 16 because theres less regulations. Also, with the lake house since I already have a boating license at 16 I could take the lake boat out and shit. It sounds awesome. Also, I have a higher chance to get into better NC colleges. And, in NJ some shitty things have happened to me that I won’t get into so a new start might help?

But, on the other hand I spent my entire life in New Jersey. I have friends here and they’d be genuinely sad if I left. And, i’d miss them. And seeing them every once in a while isnt ideal. And, since I’ve never moved around before I don’t think i’d be great at making new friends at a new school. Even if i’m only gonna be there my senior year.

I do very well in class and programming is something i'm good at and don't *hate*,but it is something i find to be a bit useless.

But i don't really know how.People just say to follow your dreams,but i need to ground myself in reality and reality here is that working a job i don't hate and can survive on is a priviledge.

27,"Hi Guys, I’d really appreciate if you give me advice on what to do. I can also PM if you have any questions about the girl and me because it might provide more insight.

Firstly, I’ll start off the by calling the girl in this story A and my friend C. This all started when I saw this girl, A on Instagram recommendations and and requested to follow (it may not help that I actually kinda like this girl. A few hours later she followed back. Calm. But then after a month or so, I was messing with C on the group with all my friends and he got really annoyed for some reason with a joke. Also worth mentioning is that in said group chat, there’s just banter all around and nobody means anything as its all just fun and games. He got real mad and started going through my following list and messaged a few girls saying I liked them.

One of them was A. He also doesn’t follow her meaning the DM he sent her goes as a request but he left the message up for around 10 minutes. Nobody expected that she would see the message or request in that specific 10 minutes but then the next day. C tells me that A blocked him on Instagram because he can’t find her on Instagram anywhere not even on my following.

This means she saw the message about me but was surprisingly still following me idk why maybe she knows it’s a joke idk. I for reason felt the reason to “clear the air” and make sure there is no awkwardness between me and A. So I sent the following messages on Monday night (word for word):

Me: Hey, um idk how to explain this \[insert nervous laughing emoji\], my friends are being annoying and messaging random people on my following list. Just ignore and block lol sorry about this.

The next morning, I noticed she read the messages and then blocked ME an hour later. At first I thought she was legit on blocking me but then later on, when I read the messages I sent to her again, it feels like I was asking her to block me which maybe why she blocked me because no person in their right mind would straight up block just for those messages. Yeah, idk if she misunderstood or what.

Any possible way I can fix this face to face or Instagram without embarrassing myself more? Also, I’ve never talked to this girl lmao.

Btw, all this happened on Instagram.

28,"Hey, I'm 22M and had lived on my own for a year and a half but wasn't super happy with my roommate--So I decided to move back in with my parents after they pushed me to. 

I've been living here for a few months and paying monthly for rent, (albeit not very much. Just what we've discussed), and in the beginning they assured I would be able to come and go as I please and basically live my life until it was time to move on. 

HOWEVER, they constantly bother me to come home if I've been gone for even a night, and often get really angry when I don't let them know right away exactly where I am/what I'm doing/when I'll be back. I try to communicate but they get extremely judgmental and awkward if I tell them I'm going to places they don't approve of (such as my non-christian partner's house)

 They also use my space as storage despite having an almost empty room in which they already store things. I've tried discussing these matters with them but it always boils down to me being immature and inexperienced in life, despite having lived on my own and supporting myself currently. The only thing they're providing me is a roof under which to sleep and the occasional dinner when I don't cook for myself. 

I dunno, maybe I'm spoiled and just don't know how to appreciate what they're doing for me but I'm not sure. It's starting to grind my gears and I'm just wondering if there's a decent way to go about it. I'm worried that if I step 'out of line' in terms of what they want they'll shun me like they have my siblings. 

Sorry that was kinda rambly, but any advice would be greatly appreciated.",10May2020,1
29,"The first dream i had was about my aunt being pregnant with twins and i could see her stomach moving around from the babies kicking, then she put a flash light up to her belly and i could clearly see the two babies through her stomach. This dream was pretty weird but my aunts youngest kids are twins so i thought that might be the reason why i dreamed that. 

The second dream i had i was sitting on the couch holding a baby, like a NEW born baby, it still had amniotic fluid and blood all over it. I think i was waiting for someone because my shoes were on and the front door was open. At first i thought this dream was about my 2 year old son because the baby looked similar to how my son looked as a newborn with dark hair and dark eyes, but then my son ran up to me and i told him “no don’t hit, you have to be gentle with the baby”. Right after i said that, in my dream i was thinking “if this isn’t [my sons name] then who’s baby am i holding?” 

Then last night i dreamed i was at my doctors office. I told my doctor i was sure I’m not pregnant but she asked me to lay back so she could do a ultrasound on me anyways. In my dream i was saying “I know there isn’t going to be baby there, i know there isn’t.” Then as she pressed the doppler on my stomach i saw one yolk-sac appear on the screen, then she moved the doppler over a little more and there were two more on the screen. She switched the image to 3D ultrasound and then said yup it’s definitely triplets. I felt scared in my dream, i was asking myself how am i gonna tell him we’re having triplets? Then i woke up. 

These dreams are really weird so i was hoping someone could interpret the meaning(s) for me. i know they’re all pregnancy related but it’s highly unlikely that I am pregnant. I’m not having any pregnancy symptoms, i don’t feel pregnant, and i should be starting my period here in the next couple days. I’ll keep everyone updated.",10May2020,1

35,"Hi,

I would like some advice on a situation that I am currently in. I am 21 years old, I am finishing my junior year semester of college in a few days, and in the past two weeks I have joined a web development team.

I joined the team through a hackathon and decided to tag along as a front end developer, despite my age and limited coding experience. I was excited for the opportunity because this was my first time working on a dev team. I thought of this as experience for my career, so I have put my all to wanting to do this project. The team leader even seem to like my enthusiasm and what I could provide for the team that they made me lead front end dev for the front end team.

So I have been working with them, and I have felt that I do not have the best communication with them. I work with two other devs and I try to split the work between each other.

Overall, I have been getting stressed over the week. I feel that we aren’t progressing. I’m not getting any of my work done for college, such as a final project. And due to the crisis I’m in, my mental health has been deteriorating. I have felt less motivated, I feel terribly stressed with panic attacks when I wake up or go to sleep, and I have been getting suicidal thoughts.

Today, I received a message from one of the dev members saying they were quitting the team. I have not told anyone else yet but it would mean that I would have to do extra work for the deadline on progress coming up. I’ve also have not completed a project for college that is due on Monday and I have to submit homework and a final exam that is due this week.

I can’t quit because I feel that people are counting  me to complete the tasks. But I also don’t want to fail my semester because I have already dropped out of two courses due to stress related circumstances.

All I ask is what should I do? I have no access to any mental help so I need some advice.",10May2020,1

My dream came true the day I made the bench but it didn't feel satisfying at all, not one bit. 

I seriously don't enjoy it, I miss looking forward to playing I always dread it. During quarantine I've done it on my own a few times but not much. I've invested in weights as I've begun Olympic weightlifting in the past couple months. I've been doing so much of that.

I've always been a dedicated person and the fact that I dread to even play the sport which I've wanted to make a career out of just doesn't add up. I don't think it's right for me. I feel stuck, my dad's always been pressurising with it. I don't really have many friends as most of them only like me because of my football.

We go to the same university, but I have never had a class with them and only briefly talked a few years ago. They are threatening to go to the police, but I'm still not sure what for. From what I can understand, she was catfished and she sent out nude photographs before the guy ghosted. Understandably pissed, but that has nothing to do with me, and she thinks I was the guy.   


  
So my questions are:

How can I prove my innocence? My call records show she called me, hers show she called the scammer's #  


Does she have any legal recourse? She says she has police in her family, but what exactly could the charge be? As far as I know, the guy didn't try to extort or threaten, he just ghosted.

43,"So a little background.

I decided to take some time off from school from the Fall session of 2019 through Winter session of 2020 because of a good paying job offered to me late September of 2019. My plan was to payoff a loan that I am the cosigner of that originated in 2017 (the primary lost her business in August 2019 and I am paying for it now to not ruin my credit) within one year of hard work and very conservative spending. I was also going to payoff a credit card with 9% interest that has a balance a bit under 3 thousand dollars.

Five months into this great paying job, COVID-19 hit and I am out of work. I have several options that I am weighing but I have hit a bit of analysis paralysis and hoping to get some input from other folks.

1. I recently recertified my EMT certificate and can go back to working in EMS for the next year and still accomplish my original goal. Albeit it would be 6 months over my original estimate. I would afterwards go back to school and have about three years till I would be done with my degree but I would be doing so with a relatively low paying job.
2. I can possibly find some part time work and go back to school and finish the courses I need to transfer. I would not need to pay for the units because I qualified for a BOG waiver, but I would be stretched extremely thin financially and vulnerable to any type of tumult.
3. My third option takes everything that happens in the first option and replaces regular schooling with going to paramedic school and having a stable job for the foreseeable future. I do live in SoCal and private medics make a somewhat decent chunk of change. Medic school would take me about 6-9 months and I would still be going back to school to finish my degree when I am a bit settled.

My biggest fear with going back to college this Fall is predicated around being stuck with a static class schedule and having to schedule work around classes. This was not a very big concern a year ago because work was easy to find and scheduling around classes was not a concern. Now I would be facing limited hours of work coupled with a pretty heavy load of classes and financial responsibilities.

I am leaning more and more towards option three. I am very pessimistic about the next 12-24 months and I am very apprehensive about being committed to a course of action that would hamstrung me, but I also feel the pull of wanting to be in school and get my degree in the field I am passionate about.

Any of you guys have any good advice for someone that has to juggle finances and work while attending school in this climate?",10May2020,1

45,"Hello. Recently, I (17 F) had a big fight with two (17 F) and (18 M) of my friends (in total, we’re a group of 8 friends). I confronted them both about how it hurt me that they got together.

So, Meredith and Jason got together this January. She knew all of the bad things he had ever said to me, but decided to date him anyway.
Now, our group chat is kind of dead. We used to talk all day, and now we only send each a few messages. I talked to Meredith twice, since she wasn’t active. I told her that I’m worried about her, and if she’s mad at me she can talk to me. Meredith told me that she just deleted all of her social media. Now, Jason sent a message to our friend group saying he was sorry about how he treated me, since I’m his girlfriend’s friend. I’ve been thinking of forgiving him. I just want this to be over. But I also don’t want to be a doormat). 
He hasn’t been active, he’s just reading some of the messages we send.

55,"I know it's normal for a high school aged person to help parents around the house, and I believe it's actually good for these people to have that kind of responsibility. However, I feel my workload is too overwhelming, even though it may not seem like it at first glance.

Im 16, and for someone my age you'd normally be responsible for tidying up counter tops, dishes, sweeping, all these fun things. Sometimes you'd vacuum and such, right?

I have a sister though, and our daily chores have been split up of me cleaning counter tops and her doing the dishes. We're responsible of only those two things.

My chores consist of many things, and not all of them I do everyday but when the time comes for it to be done, I'm the one that does it.

I clean the counter tops, sweep the kitchen, take out the trash and recycle (4 different bins, being plastic, cans, glass, and burnable items,) cleaning the cat box (he's mostly my cat so this one is rather fair.) These things I do mostly everyday or every other day. Then things that aren't done as often, only about once a week or so include mopping, vacuuming, dusting, bathing animals, cleaning the back porch, and tidying up bathrooms (the bathroom doesn't get messy too often.)

There are probably more things I'm forgetting but there's that.

One thing I never realized though was how much more I was doing compared to my sister. She slacks off all the time. The sink is literally always full, to the top and beyond. I have to place the dishes on the counter next to the sink all the time. It gets smelly and disgusting and she always has to be forced to do them even though they're her chores.

""Why doesn't your mom do something about it?"" That's a fantastic question. I don't know.

She never punishes us, barely yells at us for anything, and although I do what I'm suppose my sister never does and I'm the one who suffers the consequences. I'm rather antisocial so I'm on my computer most of the day playing games and stuff when she goes out with her friends, and my dad isn't happy about my specific lack of socialization, so since i'm always in the house I'm the one getting yelled at for her lack of chores. Because in his mind for some reason since shes older and always out of the house, she has no responsibilities in the house.

The dishes are her only chore. Aside from her room. She doesn't do anything else, and wont be yelled at because of the lack of anything else not being done, because all she has to do are dishes, and even then she barely does them until they're disgusting and plentiful.

Now you may think this post is about the work not being distributed between me and my sister evenly enough, but my sister (aside from her godawful absolute laziness of not doing the dishes properly) isn't my problem. It's my mother.

""She's your parent she has the right to give you chores."" I get this fact. however, this woman is a HOUSEWIFE. She doesn't have a job, she doesn't have responsibilities outside of me and my sister. Her job is more or less cleaning. But I'm the one that does her chores because as I said above, shes my parent. I can't tell her no and I cant tell her to vacuum.

And this isn't just a thread about me whining about how my mom gave me too many chores, she herself had given herself chores. She's suppose to be responsible of dusting, vacuuming, shampooing carpets (which she actually does but barely once a year.)

This woman gives herself chores and for some god awful reason all she does is sit all day and play on her phone, and to avoid a pigsty of a house, I clean for everyone. 

My dad yells at me and my sister for making her clean even though it's literally her job, and although this can be something ""stopping my mom from cleaning,"" however she could always get off the couch and clean when he isn't home.

If my mother worked I wouldn't be so upset. I wouldn't be making a thread. If she worked and made money along with my father that's one thing, but she dropped out of high school, dropped out of college, and hasn't been required to get a job because my dad makes more than enough money for all of us. So why doesn't she housewife? Why am I the one who does everything? The chores should at least be distributed between me and her but she does absolutely nothing except a rare casual cleanup, which she should be doing all the time because shes a hecking housewife.

I want to eventually bring this up to her and I already ranted about it to my bf, who is the person who made me realize I'm doing everything in the house while the rest of my family sits and does nothing. And also the fact that my mother is a housewife so I really shouldn't be doing this many chores. (And of course my sisters occasional doing the dishes even though she should do it once or even a few times a day and yet only does them like once a week, and that's pushing it.)

My mother is more or less freeloading off my father which of course isn't bad I suppose, if she were so dang lazy.

I can't focus on school if i'm so focused on when I should take out the trash. I already have issues with getting into school and my motivation is heavily low so simply getting up and doing anything is against my brains willpower. And the willpower I do get is spent on cleaning in my fear of being yelled at for being lazy and selfish because I forgot to clean off a wrapper.

Although I'll take constructive critism, thats not what I'm here for. What I'd rather have is some type of advice on how to handle this issue. Like how to bring it up to my mother without making her feel crappy.

tl;dr my mom has no job and is suppose to be a housewife but almost never does her house wifing duties and instead I'm the one who does them. I feel the amount of work I do isn't fair with the thought that my mom's job is more or less keeping the house in order and yet she does nothing meanwhile I do everything. What's a good way to bring it up to her without hurting her feelings for more or less calling her a lazy slob?",10May2020,1

long story short ,things got toxic (basically  she got overly attached to an unhealthy stage that she forgot herself .I was passive aggressive and kept my my mouth shut so I don't cause pain and just coped ...eventually shit got real and we broke up ... And let me tell you it wasn't a beautiful break up ..though we stayed friends causally trying to admit where we fucked up and what mistakes we did . and you know trying to change for the better .both of us .

Few months got by ,  And she's made progress. a better version of the person I once loved ..

As for me I'm still figuring out how to be a better person.

68,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible, and obviously I am changing names to preserve anonymity, but that doesn't mean I'm not paranoid.

So, I (27/F) have a really good friend (Chelsea 27/F) who I've known for over 15 years now. I met her back when we were in grade school, and we've been best friends ever since. We were part of a close-knit group in junior/high school because we were involved in many of the same clubs and electives. Through it all, we've remained friends despite living far away from each other and other things life has thrown our way. 

At the end of last year, Chelsea was diagnosed with Stage 1 NH lymphoma and it was scary. She had told me earlier in the year that she hadn't felt well, and after going to a few doctor visits, they found a tumor. Then came steroids, chemo, and a whole slew of scans and other things that she had to deal with. I went out to visit her after she had started her treatment, and she was looking and feeling well. It gave me peace of mind because through the process, I would check in with her, and it was sometimes a hit or miss if/when she would respond, but I chalked it up to the fact that, hello, she was dealing with cancer, and I can only imagine how tough that would be. 

During this time, a friend (Joseph 27 M) from our group came to me and confessed that how Chelsea publicized her ""cancer journey"" gave him a bad taste in his mouth. Joseph said that her constantly sharing cancer quotes and memes and documenting every detail about her recovery was annoying when half the time she wouldn't take the time out of her day to answer our calls or texts. To be honest, a lot of the time, instead of us being updated by getting our ""how are you feeling today?"" texts answered, we found out about Chelsea's health through her Instagram stories instead. He also argued that there were many other people out there who were suffering just as much and even dying from cancer, and that it seemed like Chelsea was just wanting more likes on her internet profile. 

Fast forward to earlier this year. Chelsea finished her last round of treatment, and was supposed to have a scan later to see if the treatment had worked to shrink/eradicate the tumor. She told us all when the appointment would be, and so we waited for an update. Days later, after we had all asked her via text, and even attempted to call her, she didn't answer. We were all worried that maybe the news she had received wasn't what we had all hoped and that she didn't want to tell us all. I decided to give her some time. I sent her a message telling her that whenever she was ready, I would be here. Weeks went by, and I was really worried, but I didn't want to badger her, so I waited. Finally, almost a month later she called me, saying she had some news to tell me, and I honestly was afraid for the worst, but she said she had gotten the results back (weeks ago), and that she was cancer-free. I was so relieved to hear the news, but I was a bit hurt that she waited weeks to tell me; however, I didn't feel it was my place to bring that up because, again, I have no idea what her cancer experience has been like. Joseph said that I had a right to feel hurt because we're all good friends who care about each other's well-being, and the fact that she ""played up the drama"" (his words) to tell us good news was kind of shitty. 

Fast forward to last month. Chelsea and I had been in close phone contact, especially since quarantine had been happening. She was scared because she lives with roommates who were still working (she isn't), and was afraid one of them would get her sick. Seeing as how she just finished chemo a couple months earlier, and her immune system was just getting back to normal, we were scared that if she got Covid, it could be fatal. About a week later, she developed a fever that lasted a few days, so she had to be admitted to the hospital. We had no idea this happened until she posted on her IG story that she had been admitted. I freaked out because I assumed the worst, and I called her, but she didn't answer. I figured she probably wasn't in the best state to answer, so I gave her some time. She called me a few days later and said she was at home and that they had tested her for Covid, but it came back negative, and that she had been sent home with some meds. About a week later, I think everything is normal, but Joseph texts me asking if I have seen Chelsea's IG story. Apparently, she had posted that she was back in the hospital and had been tested for Covid again, and that the test came back positive. I can't even express how worried I was, but again, I was hurt that she hadn't even contacted me, and to top it all off, she had posted a picture on IG of some flowers that someone else had sent her while she was in the hospital, so obviously she told other people...

At this point, she is back at home, and I send her a text every few days asking how she is, and she sometimes responds back, but sometimes doesn't. Same as with the cancer recovery situation, I have not experienced having Covid, so I don't exactly know how she feels. Joseph seems to think she may just be ignoring us to ""be dramatic"" again because apparently, he said her Snapchat number goes up every day and that he sees when she's on IG (although she hasn't posted anything since well over a week ago). I'm trying to stay calm and give her space, but I'm over here worrying so much about her, and when I don't hear from her for days, it makes me think the worst. The past few times I have sent her ""how are you feeling"" and ""has your cough gotten any better?"" I either don't get a response for like 2 days, and even then it'll only be a one-word response. 

Joseph says to just leave her alone, and that I'm being a good friend by checking up on her, but that if she doesn't want to respond, then that's on her. He also said that if she has enough time to update her IG bio to ""cancer and covid fighter,"" then she definitely has enough time to respond to any of our messages. Again, I'm trying to give her space, and I don't want to be selfish, but is an ""I'm still alive"" text too much to ask for? Also, how would I bring this up without seeming like I'm not being understanding or that I'm being too crass?

I'm sorry for the long post, but I wanted to make sure I was able to give enough detail to explain. Let me know if you have any questions, and any advice is welcomed and appreciated.",10May2020,1

72,"Not sure if anyone will read this but I don’t know who else to talk to other than strangers on reddit, I am 24 (F)

I have had a group of friends for years from college who I’ve counted as my close friends. I would describe myself as friendly, kind, outgoing and I always go the extra mile to help my friends.  I know I have been described this way by others. My biggest downfall is I know I deal with stress poorly, especially around exams and I know that that probably annoys people.

Over the past week I have been left out of organising houses to live in for the year that everyone else in the group had organised among themselves. When I found out it had been organised, I realised everyone’s groups were full and it was too late for me to join.

I was really hurt by this, and when questioned about how I was feeling by a friend in the group I told him I was hurt. He responded by saying that maybe I shouldn’t count these people as friends as they had found me irritating and annoying in the past, mainly around exams, and that they probably wanted to limit interactions with me now.

I was shocked to hear this, as I feel I have always gone out of my way to be a good friend to people. People message me with questions and needing notes, or advice or help with things and I’m always there for people. I would not say it was a one way friendship where I was constantly messaging people, as these people contact me and invite me places all the time and we hang out outside of work/college all the time (zoom recently of course) 

My question is, I am working with these people this year and hearing this has really upset me to the point that I want to isolate myself entirely and just not reply in the group chat or to individual messages for fear of annoying people further,

I want to work on myself and change how I deal with stress and I will do that, but does anyone have any advice on how I can heal friendships with people I am stuck with but who are apparently intolerant of me?",10May2020,1

74,"So I have met the most amazing girl I could possibly ever ask for and I love her so much. Only problem is she comes from an Asian Muslim family. Being Muslim doesn't bother me at all. I'm not religious myself but I'm not against anybody who is religious. 

The problem is some of the rules her family have. She can't go out her house on her own. She can sometimes go out to meet friends but she has to be back at a certain time and can't go out often. She is 18 and I'm 20. In my eyes she's old enough to go out on her own but her culture stops it. Also just wanted to point out, we live in England.

We are hoping one day we will get married but her parents won't allow it. They don't even know about me and if they did, her parents won't be happy. So she has said we are going to wait until after her parents pass away which seems like a terrible thing to say. I dont want to wish death on them at all. I wouldn't wish death on anyone but I don't know how long they're going to live for and I don't know if I can wait 20, 30, 40 years until we get married. Another key point to this is she can't move out on her own until she is married so we can't even live together until then.

Another thing that really bothers me, is that I have quite a lot of money that she doesn't know about yet. And I would love to take her to places around the world. I believe she would love to travel. But I can't even do that. I've worked very hard to make all this money and I wanted to spend it on traveling and having fun with my partner but this can't happen for many many years. And I want to do all this while I'm young. I also have suggested I would just buy her house out right for her to live in. But she said her parents won't allow it. 

The reason I've put all this on here is I don't know what to do. I'm getting a bit depressed not being able to see her as often as I would like. I'm also getting lots of anxiety as I don't know what the future will be like. I'm also worried about wasting my time making millions if I'm not going to use it. I live a very simple life, I don't even own my own house. I planned out my life years ago. Make lots of money and spend it traveling with my partner and then invest it in the future. But I really don't know what to do. If anyone has any advice or anything that can help. I would really appreciate it. Thanks

I asked my parents a few days ago if I could have it back only on friday nights, saturdays, and sundays, and do all of my home work on mondays, because I don't have school on mondays anymore. This seemed like a reasonable plan to me because it still left a lot of time for school, and a lot of time for me to do school related things. My parents said no, and I would not be getting my playstation back anytime soon because of the ""improvements"" they have seen. According to them I have been a lot happier, spent more time outdoors, and talked to my family more. I have spent more time outdoors and talked to them more, and with my idea that I mentioned earlier, I could do those things on mondays, and them on Saturdays and Sundays I could talk with my friends and therefore have social interaction with my friends and not get as depressed.

80,"When I was a child my twin sister and I had a nanny from birth who stayed for three years, another nanny for two, and then a series of au pairs who only stayed a year at most up until we were twelve or so.

My parents tell me ""all the money you have will be gone as soon as you leave."" Realistically, is this the case? Am I being too optimistic?",10May2020,1
90,"My downstairs neighbor has lived here for about 6 months and the last few have been a living nightmare. He is up all hours of the night stomping and slamming doors. There are also three children, and I understand they can be noisy but at 12am or even 2,3,4 am? I don’t think that’s the children.

I’ve complained to the rental office about this since it is disturbing my sleep but they said they’ve tried calling him and he won’t pick up so they can’t do anything. They suggested I call the police. It’s been a constant issue.

Is that the appropriate approach? I don’t feel comfortable talking to him in person since I’m not sure of his temperament since I’ve never talked to him. Thanks!",10May2020,1
91,"I'm a 25-year old F and I've been living with my parents being a part-time pastry student and I have a side job. I was planning to graduate this fall by taking classes in the summer but those have been cancel due to the pandemic. I had my ups and downs that goes in waves. For my ups, I get to spend more time baking and learning my craft and practice baking and decorating. And my downs are that I feel like my plans have halted and I'm stuck living with my parents longer than I should.

I got back to school at 22 because I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and went on soul searching. I found that I love baking and I wanted to pursue that! During the years I've been in school baking! Before I graduate I'll be going to an internship in Disney World, resorts, or other hotels. I don't have much money in the bank right now but when I get the internship I'll save up to about 6 months before I graduate and my parents will lend some to help get me started.

My parents (namely my mom) wants me to work at Disney resorts and want me to save up and rent an apartment near my job so I won't waste any gasses and that they'll help pay for my rent. It's really telling me that my parents don't want me to leave and said I can stay until I'm 30 and it's normal to live with your parents that long in our culture. (We're Latino btw) 

My brother stayed with us until he was 26 and left to NYC and a year later he met his wife and now they are married. I told them my plans that I'll save up money in my current job and get an internship, graduate, and live with my aunt in NYC and work in the Grand Hyatt. They are supportive but EXTREMELY reluctant and they have every right to be because NYC is the epicenter but I know it won't be like that forever. They want me to stay close and be safe. For right now I want to get out of my comfort zone. 

After my brother left, there were tears they missed him greatly but were happy for him nonetheless. I want my parents to be proud of me and I want so badly to make a life in NYC. Make or break I want to see if I can try. I never really learned how to struggle, me being a woman my parents coddled me a lot compared to my brother-- even though they loved us very much I was always their little girl. Oh and I'm disabled too :&gt; so yeah but still, want to see if I can make my own life without my parent's help and be a self-made woman. NYC is a hard city but you know the saying is""if you can make it in New York, You can make it anywhere"". 

And I been their bunches of time because I have family there so I have connections. I don't know if I should stay in Florida where I have everything close by and my parent's support or just headfirst to the iron jungle.",10May2020,1
92,"Due to the corona virus, my son will most likely be born when only 1 person can go into the delivery room. I've never liked the idea, ever since I was a child with people being in the delivery room when I give birth, I dont like the thought of people yelling, screaming at me and seeing me in pain and seeing my vagina get ripped apart. So when I was younger I would tell my mom I wouldn't let her in (somewhat jokingly) and shed get upset and butthurt. 

Now that Im 8 months, she keeps bringing it up. Getting family members to be on her side with them calling me stupid, dickmatized etc since me and the father  broke up. My mom says things like ""I wouldn't choose a man over my own mother to be in the delivery room, that must be a millennial thing"" or ""I wouldn't choose dick over my family"" and other snarky comments.

I just don't get why she wants to be there so bad, Ive asked her why when I was younger and she never answers the question she just gets mad and says smart comments, when I recently asked her she asked why I would want the father there.

A big part of me wants to go back to school in my home town where my mom lives, where tuition is very cheap (my mom has a college fund for all her children so I’d be covered) and I would have free rent for four years by staying with my mom. I’m doing a very challenging degree so my mom insists that I just focus on school and don’t work. I DO have the option to go to school where my girlfriend lives, but it will cost more than double in tuition, and I will have to worry about rent. My mom agreed to help with rent and tuition there and not to worry about the money, but I still will go into some debt and I still feel horrible accepting the financial help from my mom and choosing the more expensive school. I also don’t like the university in my girlfriend’s hometown. I like the community college but I will be transferring to the university there. But would you be willing to go to a school you don’t like that has more than double the tuition to be close to your serious girlfriend? I feel selfish for being torn in the first place, but a part of me feels that our relationship is so strong we can handle anything and after these four years of me visiting every summer, we will get to live together for the rest of our lives...   what do you think you would do??

95,"Me and a friend who I will call “A” went halves on a barbell for the gym. It cost us $700 and we have had it for about two years now. 

 The bar was at my house but unfortunately I could not find any plates to put it to use while everything is closed, so “A” asked if he could take it to his friends house who owned a home gym(we can call him “B”). He said if I found plates I could pick the bar up. 

 I received a call back from a local supplier about some plates for the barbell. 

When I messaged “A” to let him know, he told me a story about how “B” sold all of his barbells (he had 3) so now they have nothing to use down at his home gym, kind of playing the sympathy card. 

 I was on the fence about spending money anyway, so I left the situation alone. 

 “B” posted a picture of his home gym set up today. This is probably 3 weeks post the initial conversation. 

 All of his barbells were there stacked against the wall. “A” lied to me and we have been close for a little while now. I feel kind of betrayed and astonished they he would blatantly lie like this.

The problem is that i love her, may be a bit early but i'm confident in it, and i trust her and i know that she is good for me, she's the main reason i started to be way more responsible about myself, but i'm afraid of being in a relationship with her. I wish i could tell her that i hate her and i never want to see her again but i don't believe myself even when i'm writing that. I only had one relationship that was actually serious, it lasted about 2 years and it ended up in be getting broke with over a dude she met then she instantly regreted doing it but i decided getting back wasn't a good idea, but it still fucking hurt, and i don't want to be hurt again, i'm also scared to dissapoint, because i feel that i'm a horribe person at core and i've been dissapointing everyone i met until now.

99,"Hi Reddit, I am here seeking solid advice.

Me(20f) has been having issues with my(21M) boyfriend. Since the quarantine, I've realized he's a pushover and tends to do any bidding that his 3 roommates(one being his sister)want or need him to do. These are just some examples of what has occurred: He has let his roommate use some of our sexually intimate things, he let them drink my full bottle of Jack Daniels, and finally, he will drive them around anytime they want while they are high or tripping(I am not cool with drug use). I've been second-guessing our relationship again, because I know if I stay with him, I will have to see the roommates regularly. It has become an issue to the point that I am very certain that he would choose to stay with them rather than starting a life and getting an apartment together. The roommates have been wishy-washy and sometimes condescending towards me, despite my tries to be as friendly as possible.

To top this off, I am looking into going to mortuary school in the spring of 2021, which is a good two hours from where he lives currently. I suggested getting an apartment in a town that is in between both so he can hopefully go to his college of choice, as well as mine. Rather, he shoots me down, telling me he wants to continue with his 'music career' with his fellow roommates and wants to live right down the road from them. I am aware that we are young and I love him enough to let him go and decide what he wants to do, but he never gives me a straight answer. I just worry that if we do get our own place, that he will invite them over regularly and/or he will never want to stay there with me. Please, any advice on what to do would be great. I would have put this under r/relationshipadvice, but I am mainly asking as to what approach to take towards his roommates.",10May2020,1
100,"Sorry, very long post coming though! It is all over the place but so is my brain right now. 
My dad is an active person who is rarely at home and he has been that way since I was little. Then COVID-19 happened. Since March, he has been isolating at home with myself and my mother, only leaving to go on short walks and on the weekends during the day to ride his motorcycle. 
My dad has had a lot of video calls for work which I usually catch pieces of as I work in the room closest to his office and he is a projector, but yesterday he took a call and I noticed I could barely hear him which caught my attention. I fully admit I snooped but only could pick up bits and pieces. His demeanor was very flirty, he was giggling a lot, also a lot of “hmmm” responses like he was acknowledging what someone was saying but not wanting to speak in full sentences. He kept getting on and off the phone with this person. At one point he was telling them about one of our dogs, acting like they had a very close bond, which is not true, he barely acknowledges her most of the time. There were other little things, talking about clothes, making jokes, nothing remotely work related. The only way I can describe it is flirty banter. 

I have had fears in the past about this. It’s always little things, never anything definitive. About a year ago, I was opening some mail and there were two tickets to a concert for a famous female country singer. I thought they were maybe a gift for my mom and I which would have been an odd choice but he isn’t always the best at gift giving. I asked my dad about it and he said he got them for a female coworker and her daughter. 

Another time I was driving home from work and passed a church near our house and saw my dad sitting in his car in the church parking lot, talking on his phone. We do not go to church ever. 

One day he sent me a text by mistake saying he had just left the house and it was ok to call now.

He goes on lots of solo week long motorcycle trips and will be gone most of the day most Saturdays and Sundays riding so if he was fooling around it would be pretty easy for him to do so. 

My parents are high school sweethearts and the only actual transgression I’m aware of was when my dad was still drinking (he’s been sober for 25+ years since before I was born) he had a drunken one night stand and the women stole his credit card and went on a shopping spree at Footlocker of all places. The credit card company called my mom and that’s how she found out. 

Anyways, during quarantine some of those fears have cropped up again. Since we’ve been quarantined, he’s gotten a couple of calls where he has left the house and gone on a walk to take them. Then the call yesterday happened and sent me into a tail spin. On top of that, today I texted him to remind him about Mother’s Day and my phone suggested his number might be “Kaitlin” (not the actual name but another woman’s name). Wtf?! 

Today I dove into figuring this shit out. I was able to log into our cell records since we are all on a family plan and he has been getting calls from the same number DAILY other than a couple of missed days for MONTHS!! I tried to talk myself down that maybe it was a client as he is a consultant. I finally got brave/lost all my marbles and used my google voice # to call that number, more than half expecting it would be one of the companies he works with. Got the answering machine and it was a woman’s voice who gave her full name. I didn’t leave a message, just hung up. 

So now I’ve been internet stalking this woman, figured out they used to work together about 3 years ago. She now works for a different company that he doesn’t have any connection to. She does have a young daughter. However, the woman’s name isn’t the name my phone suggested for his contact (don’t know her daughters name). 

I have hit a dead end in my search and while there isn’t a glaring red sign saying he’s cheating on my mom, I feel sick to my stomach. It sickens me to think I might be right but, at the same time, I feel so guilty that I am even thinking what I’m thinking. I know for sure I don’t want to talk to my mom about it unless I have definitive proof. She asked him if he was cheating about a year ago and he was adamant that he wasn’t, and she believed him. She is so sweet and trusting and always wants to see the good in people. I both don’t want to sew the seed of doubt if I’m not positive and I really don’t want to hurt her, even if it’s true.

101,"Let’s start here, I’m a 19 (soon to be 20) year old female university student who earns about $290 as a stipend from college, I’ve managed to save up about $1300 until now and somehow I still cannot convince myself that I deserve to spend my money.

I bought my own phone and iPad after saving up for about 4-5 months for each device, I am very responsible with money and I know how to spend it but whenever I try to let loose I just can’t.

I feel so much guilt spending my money on things I want but don’t need and can’t seem to convince myself I deserve to be happy, I’m not poor or cheap but my parents do not spend their money on me when it comes to wants (e.g. clothes, makeup, technology, whatever things I don’t really need).

I don’t blame them for it, it has taught me to be self disciplined but whenever I ask them to buy anything for me they tell me to go spend my own money and sometimes shun me for saving up so much, yet when I tell them I bought something they treat me like a child and tell me I always buy stupid things on the internet.

I cannot satisfy them or convince myself that my money won’t go away or disappear and that I deserve to spend it on makeup or clothes and not feel bad, this issue is making me very anxious and I just can’t let it go.

All throughout high school and college I was always with some girl, never really been fully on my own. I went though (almost) all 4 years of college with the same girl, and at first we thought we could do it, but long story short we became too dependent on each other and I realized I need time for myself to reflect and figure out who I am. I never really was friends with any girls during my college relationship because she was quite controlling, very over protective, jealous, and down right didn’t trust me (never cheated on her either).I have no regrets in my breakup, and I’m excited to start a new chapter in my life. 

However, I’ve been realizing that since I only really communicated with one girl for 4 years practically, I’ve practically lost all my social skills with the opposite gender. It’s not because I fear them, I think it’s because I’ve been so used to talking to my gf that I don’t know how to talk to a girl that isn’t my gf.

\*\*Hi!\*\*  


I'm a social work major, along with graduating with an additional bachelors in sociology and very close to my BSW and grad school! Most my professors say I’m incredibly talented, but before I begin clinical practice in any setting, I believe I need to address some things. To describe my functionality as a roller-coasters an understatement, however I remain in honors standing with a 3.6 GPA.  


\*\*Past Diagnosis:\*\*  


I have been diagnosed by different professionals over the course of my adolescence and early adulthood with GAD, PTSD and OCD with all varying levels of insight based upon stress. I also have been diagnosed with MPD, varying levels of SUDS and ADHD, all this concurrent with elevated SI and Passive SI. Also, as a preteen, I struggled with clinically significant Anorexia that was responded with rapid refeeding and medical/clinical intervention. I have been given two psychosocial exams confirming everything above, but as they were administered before 18, it’s been awhile and anything axis two was ruled out.  


\*\*Treatment History:\*\*  


I spent most of my adolescence in and out of Inpatient and RTC settings, however I did attend wilderness therapy and some of the RTC's focused on behavioral interventions instead of the regular Talk therapy and social interventions I was used too. Most practitioners (As I bounced around due to insurance and different levels of care) told me I had treatment refractory OCD. Most of the differential diagnosis came from clinicians trying to describe self-destructive, interpersonal difficulties and suicidal behavior. As this is often not concurrent with moralized OCD, if anything one would suspect my behavior to be incredibly well defined and rigid due in regulation of obsessional content.  


\*\*Past Symptoms:\*\*  


Regardless I did 6 months of residential intensive EXRP for OCD among the 18 months of residential, which reduced my symptoms. My current Y-BOCS score is a 23, oppose to a 33 when entering treatment, however while in treatment and in outpatient settings I stacked up multiple suicide attempts and many other suicidal gestures. I also have intermittently self-harmed along with the suicide attempts, misused substances, participated in abnormal eating behaviors, impulsive sexual behavior and what I would describe as a general recklessness, with intent to hurt myself but not disfigure or kill  


\*\*Current Symptoms:\*\*  


My life has greatly improved since adolescence and I have a level of insight into my obsessional content that allows me too function. However, this previous fall I started college, after some years of community college, I started living independently in the dorms and have struggled incredibly with everything but OCD, which although remains clinically significant, is normalized and addressable. I have some trauma from being gone from my family as an adolescent and self-induced traumatic situations, but none of this explains how or what I’m currently struggling with  


\*\*Overview:\*\*  


I believe I have an axis 2 disorder, most likely BPD. This is not an admission concurrent with morality, its conducive to my internal and external world. In hindsight these past two semesters were a casebook example of unchecked BPD. Whereas I was functional in class, I alienated almost everyone I knew and became dependent on a select few people who I begged not to abandon me, leading to eventual alienation of everyone but a select few people.  


When in a social situation I become almost obsessive with power dynamics, idolization and devaluation. I met a person that on a biweekly basis I would break into tears at the slightest sign of what I perceived as abonnement. The friendship soon turns to love, which was not reciprocated in response I upped my behavior and idolization in worry an attempt to prove to myself that I was lovable. Outside of my relation to her, I acted incredibly erratically to gain attention. I had a few physical altercations with dorm mates that were deescalated by the RA, and other more conventional fights that were setup. I struggled with anger in class and was often passive aggressive or straight up aggressive to my peers. I saw this as a victimization, and it began to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  


I began self-harming again. I hurt myself fighting but refused to see a doctor for three weeks until an intervention by my then friends as I liked the physical pain, I was in. The thought process was that I deserved the pain, so I per-mutated it as much as I could, fighting more and by the time I saw a doctor they said there was no point in intervening because it had been weeks of the injury being abused and it had healed in an odd way that they didn’t want to operate on.  


Compiled with fighting and self harming I also was heavily into substance use. I used over ten different substances on a biweekly basis and had a reputation for partying incredibly hard. When finals came, I was so withdrawn and hadn’t slept for 72 hours that I did not show up and instead received extensions due to all my professors seeing the state I was in. It is of note that I also tripped on an absurd amount of shrooms and acid that, during the come down I walked back to my dorm through a snowstorm still high for 7 miles. That trip was one of the worst experiences of my life.  


Winter break came by and nobody really knew the extent of how bad the semester had gone. Within a few days of coming home to my family I took an overdose as an attempt to kill myself and was hostipilized and spent 36 hours in the ICU. Nobody really knows the extent of damage it did, and I have no idea what that level of serotonin can do. Regardless I was institutionalized which I checked myself out after a few days and then finished my finals which where incompletes, receiving A’s in each one.  


I went back for the second semester, the girl I thought I loved cut me off completely as I lied to her about copying her homework as a test to see if she would still be close to me. The test backfired and I she cut me off.  


I spiraled back into substance abuse, self-harm, erratic behavior and self-hate for about a few weeks. It got to a point where I didn’t think I needed to attempt again because I was going to die from my lifestyle any day from then on. At my worst I was walking the streets for hours late at night of various drugs, barely able to stand up, in very cold weather underdressed hoping that someone would harm me accidentally. This happened a few times, one night blacked out and woke up in my dorm with a broken toe, opposite direction it was supposed to be, a torn shirt and blood on my face.  


That was my rock bottom, after roughly 8 suicide attempts, covered in self inflicted wounds and pretty much friendless and destitute in almost every way. I withdrew alone from drugs that week and then my school shut down from Covid.  


My family has little idea what happened outside of my suicide attempt over winter break. I cut myself off from everybody I knew and spent my days in self reflection and doing my online courses. I occasionally abused substances but have abstained for 2 days and have been up to two weeks sober recently. I’m 20 so I obviously know that I have a future ahead of me, but I need to make some drastic changes to my personality before I can be successful. This semester I did not receive incompletes and got a high GPA despite the substance abuse and behavior.  


\*\*Current:\*\*  


I have been self-harm and suicide attempt free for roughly 2 months. I often feel paranoid and dissociative and sometimes even delusional. As I’m knowledgeable about phycology I administered the BDPSI for the last three months and did my best to answer without any defensiveness, scoring a 40.  


I spend about two hours a day doing dbt worksheets and self-reflection. I really want to be healthy, but I get incredibly impulsive and filled with self-hate, hence the current substance abuse. I’ve tried residential which, I guess I blame partially for my maladaptive coping strategies and I’m fluent in DBT, CBT and ACT.  


Because I found a sort of stabilization and med adherence/ destructive behavior free time, I feel like I can begin doing the work I need to do to recover and return to college without behaving like I did. However, I feel extensively damaged, my mood fluctuates multiple times a day to extremes and I still live with a great deal of anxiety. I’m working so incredibly hard at keeping this upward growth, but I worry that it won’t be sustainable with a pretty intense intervention. I plan on sharing this with my social worker who I’ve been seeing, and I currently feel safe, as to mention my intention of posting is to ask for advice to improve.  


I’ve taken responsibility almost to fault, I’m working on completing ADLS and med adherence and making sure I do at least the bare minimum everyday of therapeutic intervention to keep this growth up. Currently I’m open to any suggestion or insight about my current condition and although I don’t want to over diagnosed, I feel like my whole experience falls under the blanked of cluster b traits.  


Suggestions, Therapies and realizations? I’m stable enough now and want to change as I’m willing to feel worse to make sure these things don’t happen again. I cant say it enough, I want to be functional and productive.",10May2020,1
114,"So me and this person started talking like a year ago over text, we will call them G. We have met in person before like a few times through mutual friends, but i changed schools a little while before G first messaged me. Since we started texting though we havent met up to hang out yet because we had both been pretty busy and live far away from each other. 

A while into texting and getting to know each other i start kinda developing feelings for G but just pushed it aside because we are both the same gender and im still confused on my sexuality and i could not comeout at this point for a few reasons, G is fully out though. Well about 6 months into talking G tells me they like me and i just say that i dont have the same feelings for them because at that point i didnt (i had pushed it out of my mind and didnt want to think about it cause it wasnt a possibility). 

Then G started dating someone about 4 months ago and we didnt talk much, but then they broke up and we started talking again and now im starting to REALLY develop feelings for them. I want to say something about it but i feel like they would tell everyone and out me, and they might not even feel the same about me anymore. also i have this terrible fear that they didnt actually like me and maybe it was some type of sick prank? 

also i should mention that G is 14 and i am 17. Is that weird? Cause i feel like it is. Thats another reason i didnt want to have feelings for them. They seem mature but idk. 

should i tell them i like them? Should i stop talking to them all together or should i just play it cool. Any suggestions would be great.",10May2020,1

116,"So I'm using a throwaway account for this

[[[{TRIGGER WARNING: SELFHARM}]]]

Today my father found out that I (16f) started self harming again, and we had a talk about it. I'm already seeing a therapist about it, and I honestly thought it was getting somewhat better, but the past few weeks have just been really tough, but that's not what I'm here to talk about.

My Dad came to call me for dinner a bit after we talked, ""Hey scratcher, its dinner"".
And I didnt really how to respond to him at the time, its currently pretty late at night and quite a few hours after this, but I'm still pretty shocked and hurt.
I'm not entirely sure how to handle this, or if I'm blowing it way out of proportion, so reddit, please help me in what I should do next.",10May2020,1
117,"I'm 16F and for as long as I can remember, I've had tiny lips. They never were an issue for me until people started bringing them up. Commenting on how small they are, asking why they're so tiny. I really don't know.

My family has no history of plump lips, so it makes sense that I've got tiny lips. What doesn't make sense is why mine are smaller than anyone else's in my family. My brother's lips are more plump than mine.

While I do want plumper/fuller looking lips, I don't want to resort to surgery or anything of the sorts. I'd like to stick to at-home remedies, like ointment from the store or honey. 

I don't really know if it's possible, but I would certainly like to try.

Any ideas?",10May2020,1
118,"I (19 F) feel like some background about my sister is necessary since this is about her. 

My mom has admitted that since day one my (24 F) sister saw me as a threat or competition. She's stolen at least $300 dollars from me for drugs (money I had saved up since a kid). She's hit/choked me constantly in arguments and all around been abusive. But the main issue is from the time she was in middle school to early high school (when I was I  elementary school) she sexually abused me. 

Personally I have cut contact with her and a few years back opened up to my parents and told them what she did.

Even after she dropped out of college and wasted tens of thousands of my parents dollars they have supported her. In the beginning there were a lot of arguments about what I was going to do (if I would tell family members or press charges against her) my parents ended up pushing for me to ""heal"" on my own and that was my journey. At first I told them I didn't want them to have a relationship with her if they wanted to be in my life. They told me that was unreasonable and she's still their daughter, I felt bad and said they could still have a relationship with her. The extended family doesn't know and they said it was impossible to press charges.

It was two years ago that I agreed to them having a relationship with her and since then I feel as if I've been pushed beyond what I'm comfortable with. There's a lot that's happened and stuff they've said but I'll try to give a few examples. 

I was told why I shouldn't tell the family is because I wouldn't get the reaction I wanted ( I didn't have any expectations though). They said people would avoid me because no one wants to deal with those things and people would be conflicted because they love her too.

On thanksgiving they told me a month in advance she would be attending and I had no choice because they had already paid for a ticket. They said I could stay home but she had to go because family missed her. I ended up going because it was family I hadn't seen in years and they refused to cancel her ticket. When I went upstairs for an hour or two to get space they came up and said I was making it about me.

On Christmas we had only an hour and a half to do all the presents before we had to go to my uncle's and she called. I went to the other room expecting a 10-15 minute call that ended up being 55 minutes and by the end my parents started getting ready to go to my uncle's.

Recently I've had a calm conversation with my mother about my sister. She kept pushing that she's changed and in some time I'm going to need to figure out how to go to family events with her. 

I reflected on the conversation a bit and felt pushed into a corner but felt like it may be unreasonable since it was such a calm conversation. 

Tonight and why I'm writing this is because I kind of blew up when my mom and I got into a small disagreement over the virus and she left the room saying ""some things are unforgivable"". At that point I blew up saying that if she felt that way how could she expect me to forgive something I feel I can't. My dad was the only one in the room so we started arguing and I asked if I could see his texts with my sister. He did. For two years he's complained about how bad of a relationship they have because they text once a month and how he always has to initiate it. The content of the texts, to me at least, sounded exactly like the conversations they've always had and as if nothing's happened. The texts also showed how he needed to help her out to renew her licence (he had to go in person with her to the dmv).

I told him he's lied to me, about how bad the relationship is, how she's improved and changed as a person (I said I haven't seen any difference and he did admit she hasn't really changed), and how he feels disappointed in her (there were only bubbly texts). 

He argued he didn't lie and I said they could talk to her and that he shouldn't call her out. 

I argued I had made it clear that I meant they could stay in contact and keep up with her. 

He said no and continued to argue he didn't lie and why would he show me his texts otherwise.


I told him it wasn't an argument and I gave up ground by not telling the family and letting them have a relationship with the both of us and that it wasn't a compromise or middle ground but me giving up space for them. 

He kept repeating that he didn't lie and I was dictating what he could do.

I told him he could do what he wants but if he wants to have a good relationship with her I wasn't going to be involved with them.

We went in circles for hours and I told him it was clear he wanted more than I found reasonable and I was done. I said he had made his choice and I no longer was going to make concessions. 

He keeps saying well talk in the morning but I don't think anything will change. I don't think they'll cut contact with her but I'm serious about not being involved if that's the case. I know I've thrown down an ultimatum but im tired, I feel whittled down, and am done.

Is it unreasonable of me?",10May2020,1
119,"I need advice or something idk.

 My father and mother adopted 4 severely handicapped people and me who is normal body. My parents where in their 50s when they started this journey. They said God called them to it. 

Now first off let me start saying - I understand my siblings feelings. I understand they wish they were never born ""they said this to me"" I understand about everything they say to me.

I have sometimes moments where when something bad happens or anything about the future regarding my family. My siblings pop up into my head. My parents have biological children but they are all in their 40s and i do not really like them what so ever. I've never really liked them at all. I pretend a lot. When they visit I put on my nice charming face but inside i have so much rage against them. I'm very glad I'm not blood related to them.  Just thinking of them sharing my DNA discusses me greatly.

Older siblings do not help us. My parents always had to help them with everything! They are pretty big losers in my book. One older sibling does help out some. Though not to the extent I would think it should be. Being herself a bio child. She pretends she helps a lot but she doesn't. Even when you ask her to help my parents she makes a big sense and or says I'm too busy bye. 

Another reason i dislike her is because shes always had help in life. Her husband and his side of the family and my parents. And she still lectures me about not being where i need to be in life, and im trying i am really really trying but she will not 100% show sympathy or empathy towards me. There was a point she tried to kick me out of my parents house because she got angry with me because i stood up against her finally but it made things a lot worse. 

Im in my 20s trying to get my career going. It is not easy for a young person to be fully independent as it was in early 2000s or 90s/80s/70s. And most of them did not come from a big family like mine or have disabled siblings and prob were an only child and got help like my older sister did. So I get angry when older people at work lecture me about it too when im trying. I just have a very sour taste for middle age people.

My father is in his 70s and old and frail and still thinks hes 20 and will not give up or take caution to things. My mother who is also in her 70s has advanced Alzheimer's disease and always has projects going around in the house and just idk. NOW I adore and love my parents greatly. Just sometimes i feel when they adopted my disabled siblings they screwed me over. But i dont voice it or say anything.

Now my dad bought a huge handicapped van. it is humongous. I'm not 6ft tall and sadly i cannot reach the pedals until we can get the van worked on. We did have a smaller van where i can drive the siblings around and help them go shopping and to the movies. But father got rid of it. It was breaking down. Im angry he bought something so huge. It is like a big buss.  HOW CAN I FREAKIN' DRIVE IT. Living in the south is awful and i hate it. People are not nice on the road in GA. Everyone is pretty rude in the south. That southern charm people always talk about died in the 90s....

Anyway. So my old man takes the kids shopping when I was at work. He fell and hurt him self TWICE! Hes frail and old and already has problems! So when I got home and was told about it. I got angry inside a lot and felt like crying but did not.

I hate to say it but my handicapped siblings are a liability to my parents health and life. I've tried for years to get my siblings somewhere like a apartment or something that is funded by the government. But no! It always goes to those old bastards when they should be in a nursing home not apartments. They been on waiting list it never works out! WHAT AM I GONNA DO WHEN MY PARENTS DIE?! I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS!!!! God forbid my parents live until they are in their 90s! I worked in nursing home I know what its like and how they treat them. I rather eat \*\*\*\* and die then ever put my parents in a nursing home! You think those aids are all nice and lovely. PFT!!!!!! The stuff they say about you and the patients when you're not around.... I hate them all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my siblings have aids but they been low class ghetto trash aids. And they do everything everything half butt. It gets on my nerves. Because; now understand i did health care for 4 years because as a kid I wanted to help people like my siblings and i always made sure i went beyond to help and not half butt it like my middle age coworkers. The aids even refused to help them with some things or say in that ghettoo voice ""oh lawd no not my business cya"" freaking trash scum. When i was an AID/CNA I did everything by the book and sometimes a little more! IT WAS NOT HARD it took like 3mins more of my time but I WANTED TO BE A NICE PERSON! Oh my gosh you think those home aids and business are there to help you?! F that they are there to take your money and make you run dry!  But for the past 3 years i changed and went into the trades field. I'm just so mad about everything right now and mostly worried.

Now my father was a doctor at one time and so the government never not once gave us aid or help us with my siblings not once. So dont think we got special stuff or money or anything from them. I was helping giving enemas at 13 or younger and doing stuff no person could ever ever ever handle. 

I'm just angry my dad got hurt today and sad. And I want to cry. Theres a lot more but i need to stop. It more of vent  that I cannot say out loud. Im just worried about my parents. Sorry.",10May2020,1

121,"My husband and I have had a rocky relationship forever.   We've been together off and on since 1989, we're now 47. He's had a drinking problem for a while too and that's the issue. I love the guy, we have 4 kids and our youngest is 14 next week and our 21 and 16 year old live with us still too. My husband is the best guy sober. He works 12 hours a day 5 /6 days a week. But when he drinks it's the absolute worst. He's not physically abusive (anymore...) but he's verbally abusive. When he drinks he really drinks. If he's off Saturday and Sunday he'll drink a 30 pack of beer. Typically, that's when the trouble starts. I have been a stay at home mom for the last 13 years. I don't have income. I don't want to be with him anymore unless he stops drinking and he has absolutely no interest in that. Drinking isn't the issue, he says. I don't know what to do. Without family or friends and having my kids, I have no idea where to go or what to do.",10May2020,1
122,"My wife has always drank, sometimes a few here and a few there. Since Iv been working mainly from home Iv noticed more than I did before she drinks every day and it’s not just a couple of beers. On average she has 6 a night. This doesn’t seem to impede her judgement and she claims she just likes the taste of it.

We have two children who have grown accustomed to seeing “moms drink” in the fridge. I think that this is wrong and I don’t agree with it. I don’t think our kids need to see mom slamming beers every night regardless of how it effects her.

She told me two months ago that she recently started taking lexapro, which was beyond me because I had no idea what lexapro was. 

Last week I smelled cigarette smoke on her and after finding a near finished pack of Marlboro’s in her purse I finally decided to confront her about all of this.

I feel like a single parent in all of this. She sleeps until 1-2pm everyday when I get up with the kids and get them breakfast and Lunch. I do the yard work, most of the house work when I’m not away on business, and about 50% time cook dinner. I take the kids to the park, to movies, activities, anything I can to make sure they have a great day. They always ask why mom won’t go with us or when she does she usually sits on her phone and scrolls through Facebook. It’s destroys me and the kids.

I brought it up with her and asked if everything was ok. She said she was fine. I asked her why she came home one day smelling like smoke and laughed about talking to a smoker or something. She laughed and said no, just someone at the grocery store smelled really bad and it must have just caught a wiff of it on her. I finally just asked if she wanted to explain the cigarettes in her purse. Then she finally opened up and said she has just been stressed (I try going through my head what on earth could she be stressed about) and I asked if she wanted to talk about it. She said no. I politely asked if she would stop and she shrugged and said “I guess” the conversation led to her drinking and sleeping until 2pm. I asked her if she does this while I’m away on trips and that’s when she blew up. I told her I loved her and I am genuinely concerned for her and want to help. She told me why on earth would the kids be upset that she drinks as long as it doesn’t effect her, and no why I am bringing it up. 

Now, for 4 days Iv been the bad guy. She has kept the kids from me, she took them two hours away from me today and told me I wasn’t welcome to join Mother’s Day get together with her side of the family. I’m not sure what she told them but everyone was expecting me. She has since went and bought an air mattress and sleeps in my daughters room. She won’t talk to me, Iv been calm and collected and I’m just broken hearted on what’s going on. She doesn’t want to talk and the last time I asked if we could she told me to “F off” in front of our kids. My wife doesn’t cuss and it completely caught me off guard.

I couldn’t stop puking, I was running a fever, and I felt fluish. I went to the hospital and was told that I had a small bowel blockage and I needed it removed. It did traumatize me. I developed health anxiety and I do everything in my power to avoid illness. I see a therapist for it (or I was before covid). 

My boyfriend wants to get married (I’m on board) but he is still set on having kids in the next 5 years or so. We are 25 and he wants kids at 30. I don’t know if I want them anymore. It was an easy decision when the thought of illness and discomfort was just a fantasy with no real grasp. Now I know how much I hated throwing up, even after 2 days. I cried and cried and it wouldn’t stop. 

I am trying to compromise on our future. I am open to adoption. He doesn’t want to adopt. He downplays my feelings a lot too.

“It’s just anxiety. Once you get pregnant you will be okay.” 

“I will be with you. You would be okay.” 

“You wanted a kid before. Changing your mind is letting anxiety win.” 

I feel like it’s my body and my choice to make. I told him to think about what he wants, and if he needs to be with someone who can give him that I would understand. I would be sad, but I feel like this isn’t something that can be compromised on.

Who knows. Maybe with more therapy I can learn to be okay with the idea of pregnancy. It still sounds terrible though. I feel like he holds resentment because I wanted them before and I changed my mind. I feel like I ruined my relationship. I want us both to be happy. Advice?

My boyfriend and I (female) have sex frequently, and he knows I’m not fond of anal. I’ve recently moved in with him, and I have trouble saying no to his requests. Today he just spend $450 on me and said “well maybe you’ll make up for it tonight” implying anal. Well, tonight we started doing things normally, and I was okay with it. Then he quickly moved to doing anal. I thought about what he had said earlier and felt like I didn’t have a right to say no. I let him. He did more than just that, he was moving me to different positions, shoving my face and holding me to where I couldn’t move. It felt like I was being raped, even though I consented at first. I could have said no. I could have said “maybe we should try something else” or simply told him I wasn’t comfortable. Now I’m shaking and crying and vomiting in our bathroom while he takes the dog outside and does our laundry (I asked him to do those things while I “use the bathroom”). He is a very kind guy and I genuinely love him, he just took sex a little too far. He is by no means a rapist, and would never think of doing such a thing. But in my mind for some reason it really feels like he did rape me. 

What I need advice on: How do I calm myself down and talk to him about this? I’m too shaky right now to even stand up, much less talk and explain things. And any advice for how to simply say no? Thanks to anyone who can help me.",10May2020,1

Funny thing is, my crush knows I like her or that I used to. Before we were really close and just classmates, word got out that I liked her and she found out. I told her that was a thing of the past because I felt that she would avoid me and think that I was a creep. Instead, we actually got really close and talked all the time over the phone and through text etc. My feelings for her grew even stronger.

So onw day we were having a heated discussion about a topic and one thing lead to another. We both said some things that werent said with the intention of hurting one another but in the end they did. Since then we havent talked for 2 months but I really do miss talking to her.

I've tried to temporarily escape by going to residential treatments to benefit my mental health that has been greatly damaged from this mess at home, but I can't go anymore, because we don't have thousands of dollars to spend on more treatment. I only have one year at home left before I'm off to college. My problem is: my dad and I fight every day. I've walked away from dinners almost every night crying. I tell him that he's yelling at me and he says I'm delusional and oversensitive. 

Tonight he got pissed because I didn't want to eat the trout he prepared for dinner (which I told him originally) because I really don't like the taste of river fish, but additionally, how he prepares it, the whole body and head are intact, as opposed to it just being a slab of fish, and that just disgusts me. Yesterday, he got mad because I was asking questions that he deemed were pretty stupid. Sometimes he slams his hand down on the table, which is a huge trigger for me. 

When I get mad, I tell him ""please stop talking to me"" over and over, but he won't listen so I go to my computer to tune out, but then he gets pissed because he's talking to me, and I'm not making eye contact with him and that's rude. I usually get so agitated after telling him so many times to please stop that I end up screaming ""SHUT UP"" which pisses him off to no end because, as his ""teenage daughter I shouldn't be talking to him that way"". I can't win. It's always my fault to him, and I always have to be the one to apologize because he won't. He gets angry and cold. 

I really want to go somewhere next school year, for my senior year. I do online school, so I just have to find somewhere I can stay for the year. Do any of you know of anywhere I could stay, or what I could do? I just need to get out. I don't know that staying with friends or family would work. I really want to find some program or some way for me to get out.

Hi reddit, I’m not sure if this is the best place to make this type of post but I wasn’t sure which sub would be best for what I’m going through so I hope it fits ok here. I’m not sure where to start other than by saying I just feel overwhelmed by life right now. I am a 25 year old male and I just feel like I have no hope left. About a week ago I got caught racing on the highway and I am facing racing charges. Biking was my escape in life and now I am going to be losing my m license and will have to pay a lot of money in fines once it all goes through court. I drive for a living so I think I may be unable to go back to that job now as well. I owe a lot of money on the bike and I have to go through a lot of steps to sell the bike. Financially I am not in a good place. On top of my finances be in total ruin I am also scared the court may send me to jail. As for my personal life, many months ago I slowly lost a girl I loved to another man, I broke up with her early on in our relationship because she said she wanted to be able to fool around with other people. She quickly found a new guy but after a week of being broken up we got back together and dated for months more, but in reality she was growing closer to him. We reconnected a couple of weeks ago and as soon as I met up with her I felt the same feelings I have always had, they never left and I still feel the same way. That being said she is still in a relationship with him even though she said otherwise when we met up. I know he can provide her more and it is him who she wants. I know that I will not be able to get back what I thought we had, but I still feel those feelings for her and it just sucks that after reconnecting she is still back to blowing me off and keeping me on the back burner. I’m sorry if this post is too long or convoluted but between still missing her and blaming myself a lot for the way things are between us, and my financial/legal situation, I feel so lost and hopeless. I also have been struggling a lot with eating healthy and not just sitting around all day jerking off or sleeping or playing video games and just trying to pass the time in any way possible. I lost a girl I love very much, I blame myself in a lot of ways for how I was in the beginning of our relationship, and I am stressed about money and scared of my punishment for the speeding charges.

152,"Tl;dr at the bottom

Nostalgia is nice, great even, but only in moderation. For me, it does make me blissful, but then I come crashing down when I realize that the 'good ol days' are gone.

Ive always had this issue. When I was in freshman/sophomore year, I was consumed by nostalgia for my middle school years. After sophomore year ended and I went into junior year, I idolized sophomore year, particularly the end (which is pretty much 2 years ago around this same time). I genuinely believe it was the best time of my life. All of my friends and I were really starting to get close, we had a great party filled with enough memories for five, me and my best friend finally started dating after I helped him out of a toxic relationship, etc. Things were, I guess, okay.

I had this issue for the past two years, but it's really hitting hard as a senior now, with the realization that everything me and my friends worked towards for 11-13 years, all the horrible shit we've been through and the amazing highs we've shared, the 'grand finale' to celebrate all of that is gone now due to this pandemic. I think it hurts even more that there's really no one specific to blame or point fingers towards. We missed out on a trip to Hawaii, prom, our graduation is postponed (thank GOD they aren't doing some bullshit virtual graduation), and our last true days of childhood are spent separated, depressed, and pissed at the world.

But anyways, the point of this is the nostalgia. I /know/ I'm looking at things through rose tinted glasses, but everything seemed so blissful back then, especially when I first got into a relationship during that time. It was the happiest time of my life, and I haven't had such a great time since. There's been smaller things - concerts, parties, more friends, crushes to get butterflies over, ya'know. But nothing as good. And despite being a bit excited for college, I fear I'll never have that. I guess I'm just really struggling with letting go of my childhood and transitioning into adulthood, where everything just seems so much harder. No more time for friends, parties, no more certain dates to look forward to (beginning/end of school year, school events, the weekend, etc.) It's all just one slog through work.

I want those days back. I know it's not healthy to dwell on them as much as I am, but it's so hard not to.

Tl;dr: life has never been as good as it was two years ago (end of my sophomore year), and although I know I'm looking at the memories through rose tinted glasses, I still feel like I'll never feel as blissful or carefree again, especially because I'm transitioning to adulthood without any rites of passage all the other graduating classes have gotten.

It's gonna be one hell of a transition.",10May2020,1
153,"Throwaway for obvs reasons. 

I've been with my SO for 12 years. Most of that time was LDR. We had to get creative in getting each other ""off"" through online. We fantasized with each other etc. 

There was a point in our relationship in which normal fapping fantasies were becoming bland so we spiced things up a little. We got into pegging fantasies. After a few years, we wanted more thrill in our ""sessions"". 

We started fantasizing about orgy and pegging. This orgy fantasy involved his close female friends who are twins. yeah..... I actually started this with the intention of spicing things up. I am fine with his female friends and I know he does not cheat behind my back. They have been friends since god knows how long so I trust him. Until recently, I changed...

I became more insecure about how I looked and have been comparing myself to his female friends. He told me we needed to stop and that he doesn't need those fantasies to get off. That he only needed me and me alone.

Now im left with the confusion about my sexuality bc I might be BI? I also like the kink of having an orgy but Im insecure? and jealous?

155,"*this was first posted by me on AITA but it locked my comments*

(Im 17F for reference and my dad is 53)

Hi, I understand that this may be a touchy subject for some people but I need an answer because I don't feel as though I've acted like an ass but maybe I have been.
I was watching Chicago Med, a show about doctors kinda like greys anatomy, about their was a patient who was not vaccinated. I have been vaccinated and so have my parents. I made an offhand comment saying that this person was ignorant since they believed that vaccines have caused autism.

My dad, who until this point I thought believed the same as me, said that it was their body autonomy and that they could do whatever they wanted. Whether they wanted to get vaccinated or not was not my problem. I told him that although I recognized that body autonomy was very important, it was not the same thing because not being vaccinated can infect other people. As long as whatever you're doing doesn't hurt someone else, you can have all the body autonomy you want.

My dad completely disagreed, saying that this was very ignorant of me to say. He started yelling at me and wouldn't let me speak. He basically said that with that logic, the same thing can be said with people who have a DNR (do not resuscitate), since their death would affect someone else. I said that this was completely different since their death, although unfortunate and sad for the family, doesnt really put them in harm's way. 

My father then proceeded to say that I'm acting as if I'm a know it all and because I'm young I cant understand the complexities of the world. That if people didnt want to vaccinate they're not ignorant, thats just their right because of body autonomy. 

I think he's completely wrong but he won't even try to hear me out because he thinks I'm acting like I know everything, which I never said I do. 

I'm not sure exactly what to believe. I always thought that this belief I had was unanimous but it clearly is not. Also, being yelled at especially by a stronger and taller man has really shaken me up, I kinda fel stupid for saying that but being muh smaller I was very scared while he was yelling at me. Is that stupid?

So should I apologize? I do feel bad about being a know it all even though that wasnt my intention.

We have been dating for almost a year I’ve met his parents many times, (maybe like 15?) and I am always polite, but the conversation never really extends past a brief exchange of “how are you?”. I’m super shy, and grew up with the mentality that in order to seem respectful to adults you dont speak unless spoken to, but I really don’t think thats working here. I also act super timid around men due to past trauma with my own father and I really hope it hasn’t led then to believe I’m a rude girl.

I haven’t been able to see them in a while due to quarantine, but I’ve been brainstorming some ways that I could potentially grow closer to them without seeming overbearing. I think I need to take to reigns of the conversation a little bit and instead of how are you, maybe a “what did you do today” or “what are you making, it smells so good!” to further the conversation a bit.

I have been working again for the past week (no clients in the shop, just completing orders for when there are again), and there is a USPS near my place of work. So I’ve driven with my gift in the car to the USPS every lunch break. 

I have gotten as far as the front door and turned around every single time. 

So. I tried again today but unfortunately, I have obviously waited too long, and next day delivery was not an option.

I know this is ridiculous. I know I’m ridiculous. 

Not to be a complete sob story, but some unfortunate things happened when I was little, and it took a really long time to even get to where I am now. I have been suicidal and depressed and anxious and weird for a really long time. I wouldn’t be alive without my friends and especially my mom. I just wanted to do something nice for her and I kind of froze.

I don’t want her to have nothing for mother’s day. 

Would it be odd to deliver it myself? I thought about maybe just leaving it on her doorstep and pretending it was delivered by someone else so she doesn’t feel bad that I drove all that way. But I think that’s weirder than just letting her know that I did.

Anyway we still speak and she was very supportive, I on the other hand threw this back in her face, I didn't mean to do it but through my own ignorance I managed. So I start speaking to this girl and she seems nice and flirty, turns out she was a good friend of my ex and I completely forgot, turns out they were baiting me into talking shit about my ex, she asked how my last breakup went and I told her I was sick of feeling shit so decided it was best to end it, she then reveals who she is, soon as it happens my ex is messaging me telling me how much of a cunt I am and I could only just sit and agree, I'll always regret the way I spoke to her sometimes, of course this wasn't one way but I eventually realised I'm the toxic cunt. As this is all unfolding, she eventually decides to screenshot the whole chat, I found this quite funny, but worried she might use this against me, if she finds out I'm with them she'll tell them I was very toxic, people change and I want to, it's a big relief to finally not have to think about her now as she's blocked me, just gets me down knowing how nasty I am.

2. We always wanted to travel and last year in November we made up our minds about our first travel being New York. (This pandemic hindered that and we cancelled) Throughout the planning, she was unemployed, while I wasn't, but I was also a HS Senior with a part-time job at a pizzeria. I paid for both our tickets because she wasn't able to pay for hers. I looked up the hotels and ALMOST booked a room. All I asked in return for the expenses was for her to plan the activities we'd do. ""Oh, you already planned everything, I thought you could do this too since you're more organized than I am."" So I did. Day to day I put in at least a few things we could've done. The week we were suppose to fly was my spring break, in which her boyfriend's mom asked if she wanted to fly with them for the BF's birthday that week to Texas, our neighbor state. She hesitated for a week, eventually said no. 

3. As I said, she was unemployed, I wasn't. She was short at least 1200$ on her rent. She asked if I could help her so she isn't booted out. Without hesitation I gave her half of what was needed. She survived and got the rest. I was ABSOLUTELY sick of eating work food, but if I didn't eat I'd feel weak to the point where the smell of the cheese and pepperoni would almost make me throw up. So I shot her a message asking if she could bring me food from anywhere since I couldn't order anything (my bank account was in the negatives). She never showed up or replied, but my coworker shared half her lunch with me. I'm grateful for her (:

4. It was a few days before Christmas '19. My dog fell sick on a Friday night. On Sunday after work, after looking up symptoms of dogs being on their death beds, I found one main source, white gums; she had that. The entire night I cried and hoped she'd make it to the next day when the vet would be open so I'd take her in. She didn't. Naturally I was sad and picked her up the next day to help me go shopping for my the children in my family. Most of the time she was on her phone and I was looking around trying to cheer up, looking at the toys and wondering if they'd like it. She was on her phone, nagging me to hurry up and I felt like she didn't want to help me so I grabbed the nearest thing, checked out, dropped her off, and picked up her sister. I had a much better time and she actually helped me with chosing what a kid would like. After she found out I took her sister, she cussed at me and called me a baby about being sad. The next few few days I bought her a record player she's been wanting for the past month to basically make us start talking again. (Happened before - us not talking- except I put a cookie in a baggie for her, and tapped it to her door for her to find later, it worked (:) 


I have officially, finally stopped talking to her because all I wanted was to hang out and that was my therapy. She was the only one I had in my family &amp; friends that knows everything about me. It certainly was really easy since we grew up together, but I don't really want to kindle back because she left me in the dust for her boyfriend &amp; his family, when I needed her. Home hasn't been good, mental health is deteriorating more. I need to talk to her, but I haven't because I felt unwanted. Only paid me 40$ after half a year back, but she can just keep what I worked for myself. She even messaged me a week ago saying she missed me, I just left it on read. The next day she posted a story of her, her bf, his friend, and his friend's gf, at a park a couple blocks from my house. 

My aunt tells me it's my fault for being too nice, and my sister ^^ called me petty for not wanting to talk to her or message her back. So, tell me. Am I actually petty &amp; if I am, should I actually start communication with her again. I also do miss her, my pride is just in the way as well.",10May2020,1

170,"I’m on mobile so sorry for the format etc etc. sorry for the rambling, as well. I’m having trouble organizing my thoughts.

Our pup, Oba, is about 3 to 3.5 months old. She is very healthy and very sweet and playful. She potty trained well, she does great with our toddler (her bff) and myself. She tends to be very calm with the toddler and with me as well as her normal puppy play. Everything has been fine with my husband until recently. She has always been a bit skittish around him, but she does love him a lot. For example if he walks into a room and she’s near the entrance he came through she’ll move away quickly with her head down. But she loves to play with him and cuddle with him. She runs outside with him all the time.

Very recently she has started yelping and on certain occasions biting DH. She only does this when he isn’t letting her do or go somewhere she wants to go or he is trying to take something out of her mouth. For example she was trying to get under the sink today as DH was getting some things out and messing with the pipes. He put his arm out so she couldn’t go in and she helped really loudly. The most recent event was about 30 minutes ago, DH took her outside to potty and walk around. She picked up some trash (it’s EVERYWHERE around here since the stay at home order has gone into place). He bent down to grab it from her while holding her leash and before he even started reaching for her she starting freaking out and yelping and biting him.

My husband (or anyone that we know of) has NEVER laid a hand on her or done something that would make her react this way. I have pulled things out of her mouth and blocked her from going places and she has never reacted this way to me, though she may not be happy about it. 

We don’t know much about her life before we got her. We do know that she was absolutely drenched in perfume and we immediately washed her to get the smell off of her (her poor nose). She was very scared and skittish when we got her and stayed under the couch for maybe a half hour when we got her as well, but I chalked this up to being afraid of being somewhere new. We’ve suspected since shortly after we brought her home that she was not in a great place or good conditions/treatment before we got her. This could have nothing to do with the yelping or something, but I thought it worth mentioning.

I can’t understand why she’s reacting this way because nothing DH has done has been aggressive. Could he be moving too suddenly? We are getting her a harness to wear outside because she pulls and I don’t want the collar to hurt her neck too much. I just find it odd and concerning she’s only doing this with DH (it’s concerning she’s doing it at all, but she doesn’t do it with anyone else). I thought maybe she doesn’t like guys, but she’s never met another adult male before and so I can’t really say. It’s not apparent that she’s hurting when she does this, either.",10May2020,1

173,"One time my roommate said, ""Sometimes I just don't feel any emotions (because of her depression).""

&amp;#x200B;

I was like, ""That'll probably never go away but medicine and therapy can help!""

&amp;#x200B;

Another time in the getting to know you phase, we were talking about our backgrounds. She said she grew up with her grandmother and that sometimes people think her grandma sheltered her too much.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm like, ""And she probably did"" and then I continued talking.

&amp;#x200B;

Another time we were talking about bra sizes and she said her boobs were a double DD and sometimes they are uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

I said ""Yeah my boobs are a C cup and even I feel like mine are too big. I think anyone with above a D should get a breast reduction""

&amp;#x200B;

Another time I was looking in the mirror and I liked how I looked and noticed my roommate looking at me. I said ""SO CUTE"" and walked away. (Does that sound like bragging?)

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, one time we were talking about hair and how we didn't want to dye it. I was like ""Yeah I wouldn't want to dye mine because...beautiful brown hair"" She kinda stared at me blankly and one time she said it was weird that I said my hair was beautiful

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed as the year went on, my roommate was very guarded. One time she was coughing and I asked, ""Do you want a cough drop? I have some"" She's like, ""No I'm okay. I just get lots of phlegm sometimes."" I said, ""You know, there's medicine for that..."" She didn't say anything after that. I also noticed sometimes if we made eye contact, she would glare at me or roll her eyes.

TBh she was kinda messy and would stay up super late and leave her desk light on. She was also way too loud when she got up in the morning. I never said anything because I was trying to be tolerant. We had bed bugs at one point and had to clean out our dorm room so pest control could treat it. I was kinda at my wit's end and I asked her ""Are we getting reimbursed for this?"" She didn't answer and I said: ""You don't know, do you?"" She's like ""Yeah sorry idk.""

She also got super angry during that week and would slam the doors a lot. I was frustrated with the things she did in the room so I went to the RA. My roommate was mad that I talked to the RA first

EDIT: She acted like I'm a terrible person but I offered her one of my dresses one time for one of her auditions (she rejected it of course) and I let her use my tide stain remover pen. I offered her some of my snacks too

Eventually, my college roommate sent me this long text at the end of the year, confronting me for everything I said to her. She basically said I had a condescending attitude, that I was judgmental, and she didn't understand why I wanted to be a psychologist because I ""hate people who have depression."" 

For example, one time (in person) she said, ""I'm not trying to avoid the room or anything, I'm just not here most of the time because I've been working a lot."" I said, ""Oh, I don't have a job because my parents have good jobs, and I got lots of scholarships because I'm smart, or at least that's what people say.""

 She also was talking casually about how she hoped her skin didn't look too oily. I was like, ""let me see."" 

She says, ""uhh no...."" I was like, don't worry I won't judge."" I got close to her to examine her face and looked at her skin and said, ""Oh, you just have large pores. I have small ones."" She also showed me her theatre headshots a different day, because she wanted her top 10 chosen for the photographer to edit. I said, ""To edit this, I would take out the red part on your forehead, and then sculpt your cheekbones, but idk what the acting industry likes.""Those were just a few things she confronted me about in her text. Did it sound that bad? She's a junior and I'm a freshman, so idk why she'd feel intimidated by me.",10May2020,1
174,"Me and my sister are very close. I am getting all A's in all my classes. She, on the other hand, is failing half of them. Now, my parents are technological illiterates so they don't really know how to view her grades.

181,"Background: My friend just graduated university. She told me she got a really good job as a vet scribe. As someone that knows little to nothing about this I am trying to understand how the profession is.

The clinic has her sign a contract that she must work there for 2 years or they will sue her for they paid for? She said it isn’t fair for the clinic to hire someone then they just leave them in the lurch. She signed away her ability to sue them if she gets sick or injured. She needs to show her medical history and vaccine records. She needs to buy her own uniform. Then she is working full-time 4 days for 12-13 hour shifts. The pay is $8 a hour with potential to move up.

Is this normal in the vet scribe profession? She told me she would like a better paying job, but if she wants to be a vet the experience is invaluable. She also can’t quit because she already signed the paper. I’m worried because this sounds sketchy, but I have heard in the medical world of making peope sign no-compete agreements? Is this similar?

183,"I’m so overwhelmed with contradicting information.

Neither political party trusts the other side’s news source. 

There are controversial ideas about what food is healthy or what makes a healthy lifestyle. 

So many conspiracy theories about pretty much every topic from politicians to science. I’m tired of all the debate of vaccines, flat earthers, and Coronavirus. Some theories have traditionally smart people, having a PhD from a prestigious university, believing or leading them.

People with such strong opinions like televangelists, Alex Jones, or rush Limbaugh have so many followers it makes me question if maybe they are right.

Articles, at least on reddit, seem to always invoke anger/emotion and just leave me upset and confused. Their goal never seems to be objective truth.

I never know what to trust. I’m so tired of questioning every little thing I see. Every time I see a logo in a video, I feel like it’s product placement. I’m sure people with harmful opinions aren’t bad people, but maybe just misinformed. I just don’t want to be one of them.

I don’t even know what is right/wrong anymore. There is always a group of people with a strong opinion opposing an idea. Strong opinions seem to easily influence me. I feel I’m going to fall for a conspiracy theory because I’m so gullible.

Even if I try to do a good thing, like say choose the best candidate for an election, I could easily be choosing the wrong person. I have so little confidence in my decisions because I don’t know to believe anymore.

I just want something straight forward where they’re not lying to me to sell me something or for whatever reason. Or they’re not preaching ideas with no evidence/proof. Maybe where they look at both sides of an argument objectively. 

I don’t know. I feel I’m going crazy.

TLDR: no information seems real to me anymore. Don’t know what to trust. Just want logic and reason to prevail, but I don’t seem to have those qualities.",10May2020,1

I gave her a reason, because I didn’t like it and I felt like it was going behind the other two people’s back. Even though she told me a thousand times that it wasn’t.

186,"I’ll get straight to it. When covid hit, the coffee shop I was working at closed. Myself and the other baristas were furloughed. Now with restrictions easing, the owner has reopened, and here’s where it gets complicated:

1. I am collecting unemployment. And due to the fact I previously worked full-time for a long tome before working p/t at this coffee shop, so i’m collecting a livable wage bi-weekly
2. I’m the only one who can work, the others are unavailable for various reasons
3. After speaking w the owner, she agreed to pay me under the table until business picks up so I could keep collecting unemployment 
4. As expected, business has been abysmal in the few says we’ve been open so far
5. Owner has applied for small business loan but has not been approved yet

SO, the owner asked if I would be willing to work for less than minimum wage in the interim; which I feel conflicted about. I want to help her out, and I empathize in how hard this must be for her. But, I feel like we’re each doing each other favors here, but, well, I’m not really sure.

190,"I’m 19f, this quarantine has given me a lot of time to think. I’ve realized that I have a lot of anger, and resentment towards my mother. When I was five my family and I move to the U.S from PR. A year later my mother started to work at a factory where she found the love of her life. (I have no anger, or resentment towards him, he’s a really nice guy and my mothers decisions are not necessarily his fault.) My mother moved in with him a year later (45 mins away), and left me with my grandmother. She would come visit me about three times a week; I remember how hard it was for me when she told me she told me that her visit had come to an end, and she would be leaving. I would cry, and beg her to stay, but she would keep walking. She wouldn’t even turn around to look at me. Pretty soon I got used to it, though. As I grew older she visited me less and less. After I turned 18 she barely ever came to see me, now that I’m 19 it’s rare for her to visit me. She’s been in my life only because she is my mother and she’s had to be; whenever I’d get in trouble in school, needed money for food, or clothes, or any necessities she would take care of it, but when it came to being an actual mother (showing affection, love, caring, compassion) she would leave that to my grandmother. Her way of showing me love is to buy me things, then throw it in my face whenever she’s angry with me; I become the most ungrateful child in the world despite me not wanting what her money can buy. I don’t really know my mom, if I’m going to be honest. I know her favorite color, that’s about it, though. I’ve realized that she does feel bad for not being a mother, but she tried to make me take responsibility for her decisions. She always tried to say that I could’ve moved in with her at any point in my life, but my answer has always been “why should I?” It was her decision to move away from me and leave me with my grandmother. By the time I was old enough to make the decision to move with her, I had already started school, and had a lot of friends; I made my life where I live (the place she moved away from) why should I give up my life for her mistake? For whatever reason my entire family thinks that she’s a good mother? They constantly throw it in my face that she buys me things. I don’t want her to just buy me things, I want her to show me love. Although, if she tried to show me love now I would shut it down; I think it’s too late for her. Her abandoning me as a child so she could live her life affected me. I don’t know how to have a real relationship with someone because a girlfriend to me is someone who can fill the void I have inside of me, I stalk people because despite having so many friends I feel really alone and knowing a lot about someone gives me a distraction from my life - I can pretend that that person is my girlfriend and they love me unconditionally, even though they have no idea I’m there, and lastly, I don’t really know what love is, or how you show it, or see it. Simply, shes fucked me up. On top of everything, I feel like she doesn’t want me to live my life in the way that makes me happy. I can’t sleep over at a friends house, I can’t go to parties, I can’t go to Philly and spend a day with my friends there - keep in mind I’m 19. She says that even though I’m 19 I’m not old enough to make my own decisions. Overall, she’s very toxic, and I can’t wait for the day that I can move out.

It has been a rocky relationship with me and her due to my brother’s personal problems, but my mom and I have always been able to maintain a close relationship with the kids. My brother has many issues, including addiction, bipolar disorder, and antisocial personality disorder and it is someone that is impossible to keep any relationship with. I understand her frustration with him and his inconsistent, erratic behavior, however, she has always tried to turned the kids against him, except when he would pay child support and suddenly everything was fine. The kids love their father regardless of everything he’s done. 

My brother eventually stops paying child support, so she ceases all communication between him and the kids. He ends up gets arrested and later deported last year for a past conviction. Upon getting deported she allowed the kids to talk to him until he texted and called her drunk one day yelling obscenities. The kids did not hear this conversation, but she seems to have told them and they no longer want to talk to him. I do not condone my brother’s behavior, but I believe it is unhealthy to affect their kids’ long-distance relationship with their father.

&amp;#x200B;

When my brother got arrested, she allowed my mom and I to have regular visitation with the kids now that he was out of the picture. Things with the kids remained great. The 11 year old would call or text me almost everyday, up until January. He goes to a class trip and texts me throughout the day about his experience, then for about a week, he goes radio silent. I became concerned but he ends up calling me a week after saying he just didn’t want to talk. Understandable I guess. After that, three of our scheduled visitation weekends were canceled because they had plans. I later found out from them that they stayed home those weekends without going anywhere. First time, I let it pass but the other two times, I wondered. Calls and texts in this time remained irregular, but when we did have visitation, they were perfectly fine with us at home. 

&amp;#x200B;

The stay-at-home order takes effect in March so home visitation stopped, but she allowed us to pass by and drop off food and other goodies for them because they are always saying they are starving at home (their mother and boyfriend rarely cook). Last time I saw them was at the beginning of April, when we delivered a check to their mother with money sent by my brother. When I informed her of this beforehand, she never responded. Two weeks go by, my nephews don’t answer calls or texts until one night when the 10 year old tells me he would rather text than call now. Also his mom is only allowing them to use their phones on the weekend because they wanted to bond more with their siblings (they have one older brother, 13, and their mother’s boyfriend’s son, who is 5). I understand restricting phone use during the school week, but the reasoning did not make sense considering 14 never leaves his room and 5 is always with them (to their admitted resentment). Two more weeks go by, 9 calls me and we have a normal conversation. 11 refuses to get on the phone but he responds to me in the background. I asked 9 if he wants grandma to make his favorite food and he excitedly yells out “Yes!” Then 11 says, after a pause, “we already have food here.” 9 then says “oh yeah… we do.” Their mother is known to be in the background during some of these speaker phone calls so I assume they received some instruction to refuse us from seeing them. I understand precautions during this pandemic, but 9 had mentioned that they had guests over a few days before that and they also never ever refuse food from us. The timing for it to happen now was strange.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks later, yesterday, I call 11 and he replies that he will call later. He didn’t call, so I called him again today. He ends up sending my texts saying he does not want to talk to me for a long time because I “treat him like crap and treat 9 like he’s a baby.” I asked him where this suddenly came from because I’ve barely spoken to them in two months. 11 then says that he is growing up and no longer needs to talk to me often. I am “only his uncle” and that he shares his feelings with his mom and her boyfriend only. He also claimed that everything I do is only in hopes of me getting a “reward” and that I only care about myself. That gutted me because that couldn’t be farther from the truth. These are kids that used to privately voice how the boyfriend would It also did not sound like he would write things like that. I refuted those claims and he ended it by saying that he will not see me for a long while and to “stop texting. Done.” That “Done.” sounds like the way their mother speaks so I am not sure I spoke to my nephew for that full conversation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am frustrated and sad. I have been going back and forth on whether I should text their mother directly, in a civil manner, and ask what I did. I’m honestly afraid of her responding back with a hostile essay saying how I have wronged them and how we should not see or speak to them again (I have received long texts where she would blame and take things out on me about my brother).  Based on timing, my suspicions are that, deep down, she does not like how close the kids are to me and my mom compared to her, despite her own admission that they see me as a father figure, and that she was also not happy that my brother sent money I’m sure she needs in this difficult time, of all times. Since we are no longer seeing the kids regularly, she probably figured this would be the best time to cut ties. Should I let some time pass by before I ask her to please speak with them or should I actually question her about 11’s accusations? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My very close nephews have gradually reduced communication with me over the last few months and weeks. They no longer want to talk to me because I allegedly don’t treat them right despite there being no issues beforehand. I suspect their mother wants to cut ties with my side of the family due to anger toward my brother (who is thousands of miles away) and jealousy toward my relationship with them. Do I message her next week and ask about my nephew’s statements, or should I give it some time before asking to speak with them, without raising questions about the situation?",10May2020,1
193,"Maybe this isn't the right sub b/c its not that serious of a relationship but anyways, here goes:

I asked my lab partner from last semester out two months ago after we had lunch and she accepted my offer to a date night ""as friends"" (I included the as friends in my proposal). She had to reschedule a few times for legit reasons, but Corona prevented us from ever going to an event together. She told me that ""if I ever needed a date, hit me up :) ""

I've stayed friends with her for two months because I still enjoy talking to her, and though my feelings aren't as strong as they once were, I definitely still have them. I'm hesitant to let her go as a friend because truth be told, I don't have many girl friends, and. her offer seems pretty good, if we return in the fall. But, I also know that she wouldn't invite me if she needed a date. Yet, I'm definitely more desperate for a ""date"" to save face than her.

We're not that close of friends, maybe like a 4 or 5 out of 10.

TL;DR: Want to move on from a girl,hesitant to stop talking to her because I still enjoy our conversation and I might need to accept her offer to be my ""date"" when we're back on campus

I have done my best to work on my friendships/ family relationships during the break up and I genuinely feel fine to survive on my own but most nights I still feel this insufferable loneliness where I miss him so much.

201,"I’m 19f, this quarantine has given me a lot of time to think. I’ve realized that I have a lot of anger, and resentment towards my mother. When I was five my family and I move to the U.S from PR. A year later my mother started to work at a factory where she found the love of her life. (I have no anger, or resentment towards him, he’s a really nice guy and my mothers decisions are not necessarily his fault.) My mother moved in with him a year later (45 mins away), and left me with my grandmother. She would come visit me about three times a week; I remember how hard it was for me when she told me she told me that her visit had come to an end, and she would be leaving. I would cry, and beg her to stay, but she would keep walking. She wouldn’t even turn around to look at me. 

Pretty soon I got used to it, though. As I grew older she visited me less and less. After I turned 18 she barely ever came to see me, now that I’m 19 it’s rare for her to visit me. She’s been in my life only because she is my mother and she’s had to be; whenever I’d get in trouble in school, needed money for food, or clothes, or any necessities she would take care of it, but when it came to being an actual mother (showing affection, love, caring, compassion) she would leave that to my grandmother. Her way of showing me love is to buy me things, then throw it in my face whenever she’s angry with me; I become the most ungrateful child in the world despite me not wanting what her money can buy. 

I don’t really know my mom, if I’m going to be honest. I know her favorite color, that’s about it, though. I’ve realized that she does feel bad for not being a mother, but she tried to make me take responsibility for her decisions. She always tried to say that I could’ve moved in with her at any point in my life, but my answer has always been “why should I?” It was her decision to move away from me and leave me with my grandmother. By the time I was old enough to make the decision to move with her, I had already started school, and had a lot of friends; I made my life where I live (the place she moved away from) why should I give up my life for her mistake? 

For whatever reason my entire family thinks that she’s a good mother? They constantly throw it in my face that she buys me things. I don’t want her to just buy me things, I want her to show me love. Although, if she tried to show me love now I would shut it down; I think it’s too late for her. Her abandoning me as a child so she could live her life affected me. I don’t know how to have a real relationship with someone because a girlfriend to me is someone who can fill the void I have inside of me, I stalk people because despite having so many friends I feel really alone and knowing a lot about someone gives me a distraction from my life - I can pretend that that person is my girlfriend and they love me unconditionally, even though they have no idea I’m there, and lastly, I don’t really know what love is, or how you show it, or see it. Simply, shes fucked me up. 

On top of everything, I feel like she doesn’t want me to live my life in the way that makes me happy. I can’t sleep over at a friends house, I can’t go to parties, I can’t go to Philly and spend a day with my friends there - keep in mind I’m 19. She says that even though I’m 19 I’m not old enough to make my own decisions. Overall, she’s very toxic, and I can’t wait for the day that I can move out. She thinks that she deserves some kind of award for doing what a mother should do (by that I mean that she thinks that being responsible over me is going out of her way as a mother). Tomorrow is Mother’s Day. I’m going to have to see her. I have anxiety, and I just don’t want to wake up tomorrow.",10May2020,1

I thought I should probably tell my parents so I could figure out how to pay taxes and make sure I was doing it correctly. Up to this point, I had been telling them I was streaming video games. When I told them I had made $60, they wanted to know how I could make that much from streaming games. So I told a pseudo-truth and told them I was “dancing” online for money. My mom started sobbing, and told me that I couldn’t do it anymore. My dad was reasonable, but agreed I couldn’t do it anymore. If I continue, they will shut off my internet and phone service. Please keep in mind, they thought I was dancing fully clothed, and still had this reaction. I don’t know what they would have done had I told the full truth.

210,"My mother, without exaggeration, causes nearly all of the problems between the people in my home. I'm an only child, 16 and female. My parents have an age gap of 11 years and have been married for 17. It's just the three of us living here, along with a cat. I would definitely consider my mom to be a toxic spouse. She's always complaining and refuses to see positives in a lot of situations. My dad is very talkative and has a lot to express, so he's always talking to us about whatever is on his mind. Sometimes, she listens to him with enthusiasm or at least, understanding. Far more often, however, she begins to act passive-aggressive towards him for simply speaking of something that doesn't interest her. They disagree politically and religiously (didn't when they got married, she only got into it in the past five years or so) and she's always squeezing those topics into their conversations. As soon as he says anything contrary to her opinion, she begins dismissing everything he says and acting like he's said something stupid. She taunts him and picks on him until he blows up, he yells and curses, and then, she starts treating him like a child for getting upset. She's hit him on multiple occasions; sometimes she's been drunk and sometimes she's been sober, and it's been few and far between. 

I'm always trying to fix what's going on here. My dad comes from a huge tangle of step-parents and step-siblings, and he doesn't want that for me, which seems to be a pretty big obstacle for a divorce. Even without that, the pandemic makes it nearly impossible for them to separate anytime soon. If it wasn't for the pandemic, actually, I would probably never even be home because this is so hard to live with. So, I feel the need to at least get things to be a little bit more reasonable and loving around here, because all of the negativity, hostility, and tension is really wearing on my mental health.

Again, my mom is our very biggest source of problems, and I've tried to explain to her that a lot of the things she does contribute to the horrible emotional environment in our house, but she ALWAYS takes it as an attack, even if I tell her that I mean no harm. She uses all of her little tactics to make me mad and I eventually give up. I know deep down that she can change if she really sees the problem, but any time we call her out, she plays the victim.

221,"Here’s some important context: I’m a transman, I started testosterone a few months before I turned 27, I got a bc implant in my arm at 28 when I started linking up with gay guys. I’m currently 30. My fuck buddy is 29 and I’ve been seeing him for barely 2 years, he is gay but doesn’t really view me as much of a guy, and pretty much told me “I’d give up my gay life style to be straight for you if you gave up being trans” as some kind of stipulation to be in a relationship, he doesn’t understand my trans identity, he thinks being LGBTQ is some kind of result of experience and not being born that way. 

Well some how I can’t be trans and be in a relationship with him because his family, but I can be trans have have his babies. He admitted he thinks about getting me pregnant all the time and that he’s just really been wanting to have kids. Did mention that it’s not something he could let himself think about too much before because surrogates are expensive. 

I got enough feels for him to be fine with being involved with him for the rest of my life. I don’t know my future. I thought I’d never want kids but it’s been on my mind since he mentioned it 3 months ago. I’ve had talks with romantic interests about kids in the past and never felt like “I want kids/I want your kids”

He says I’d be living with him while preg/when hypothetical baby is born. He says his health insurance would cover the baby after they’re born and the state would cover me while pregnant. 

There’s no doubt he could afford this, he’s good with money and he is career driven. We’d have a really beautiful kid. 


One of the main reasons I refused to have kids was because I personally couldn’t afford it and never been with someone well off in their career to consider it. I’m not really where I want to be in life, I live with my parents, the pandemic took away my job, my career isn’t taking off and I’m in some hefty student debt and by the time I pay it off I’ll be too old to have kids. 

I can’t help but wonder what my future could look like if I changed paths a bit and had a kid. My family would be thrilled. I won’t have to regret later not having my own biological kids. 


But I can’t help but feel like I’d be an idiot to remove my implant, pause my transition, and get pregnant and have a kid with someone who I’m not in any kind of other commitments with. But to him, he wants a kid enough that everything would be taken care of. That child would be provided for in ways I wasn’t and in ways my siblings kids weren’t provided for. I know both of us would be loving caring parents and this child would be planned to be brought into this world.

229,"So Mother's day is tomorrow, needed to vent/get opinions. Quick back story: my mother and father are both emotionally abusive and manipulative. All my life my dad has been a drunk that drives his kids at 2 in the morning home from the bar, and my mother has been the one to let him. My relationship with my father is now non existent. My family doesn't like it but doesn't argue much because they witnessed his outward behavior. My mother on the other hand is the perpetual martyr. She says and does heinous shit   but the does the dishes at family gathering so I guess everything cool now. This is something I have noticed ever since I was little. I could go on forever. 

My latest problem is this, my mom has this discussing obsession with sharing her half baked ideas on social media. Now I don't care what you believe in as long as it is factual. I happen to be a Democrat and as well an atheist. My mom knows I am a ""liberal""  (she uses as a slur) but not about the atheist part. She shares all the time on her social media catchy headlines that she sees involving conspiracies and truly believes them. As annoying as it is to see she believes the ""liberals"" are laughing in Congress about all the people dying of corona virus, what is really unbelievable is this shit she is sharing about ""Plandemic"". And calling me and telling me and my husband need to stop being so ""hunkered down"" and build immunity to corona virus. Well, my husband has lung complications and a compromised immune system and my MOTHER is on anti suppression drugs because of her kidney replacement. So little to say I was pissed that she was actively advising people to do this and doing it herself. I told her I was offended she would share this information with me and try to persuade me and scared she believed it herself. She was INFURIATED that I was offended and ""how dare I talk down to my mother and belittle her"" ect ect. This is always the road she goes when I don't agree with her. The call doesn't last long and ended with her hanging up on me. But the main point I made to her was what if you are wrong? I told her ""approach this with the lenses of what if I am wrong"" if I am wrong I have been wearing a mask and being quarantined for no reason. What if you are wrong? You are endangering yourself, your husband, your in laws, your daughter and you son in law at best... At worst we could die... Are you willing to gamble my life that you are right about this conspiracy. Like I said the call ended with yelling and her hanging up on me and we haven't spoken since. 

But... tomorrow is mother's day and I don't want to engage with her negativity but more importantly I want to drive home that this delusional thinking is hurting me and her. I fear if I do not engage at all O will get bombarded with calls and text from family she has complained to about how much of a horrible daughter I am. Especially since everyone in my family sees her as a saint and is like minded. 

I just want to change my phone number and move away. My family is destroying my adult mental health. I can't change my horrible childhood, and have been in years of therapy to come this far. 

What do you guys think of cutting your hurtful parents out of your life?",10May2020,1
230," I need help deciding what to do and if outside of my original idea, how to go about it.

Necessary  backstory, I was originally on a good track for getting away. at  18-19ish I had opportunity that provided me with a free ride to college,  everything needed was covered. Books, tuition, test fees, etc. Only  thing that wasn't covered was a place to stay, so I was with family. I  was attending for audio engineering since I genuinely love music and  don't care enough to make big money, as long as I can live comfortably  to afford even the cheapest of food and even out of those tiny homes. I  don't want to go into details, but family has always been abusive in  some form.

Things got derailed for  college and has a result I'm now without funding for college, don't  have a degree. I ended up having both feet shattered while I was  attending college, while in recovery my ""dad"" got a job in a completely  other state that doesn't have the same program that I was qualified for  that allowed me to attend college for free. I followed him and the rest  of the family due to not having somewhere else to turn to for having a  roof over my head since I still was in recovery mode and didn't have the  strength in my legs to handle more than maybe 30 to 60 minutes of  walking a day due to atrophy from not walking for 3 months while my feet  healed.

I'm now in the situation  where we live in the country on 5 acres, about 30 miles from town, I  personally don't own anything like a car, motorcycle, etc. since I've  never been able to obtain work that financially allows me to afford it. I  own three bicycles, but do not have the strength and endurance to ride  to and from town on my own yet. Any job that requires me to be on my  feet for any decent amount of time, such has retail and food service  absolutely kill me because I have arthritis in my feet from the  incident. I also have severe scoliosis where I have two curves in my  spine, bad enough that left lung is smaller than normal, extra pressure  on my heart, so carrying heavy things such has a very loaded backpack is  a royal pain.

I'm trying to  decide between just loading up a bike and leaving since I'd honestly be  comfortable with living out of a bike, or if there's honest to goodness  work that I can do full time without destroying me physically and can do  where I can step away from family to do, but still not rely on having a  car for so I can save up to do the so called normal of getting my own  flat.

I've heard countless times of ""get a desk job"" and I'd love to if there honestly were any that I could actually get to.

If  it helps any, I know how to do basic electrical engineering, soldering,  programming, can play piano, violin, and viola at basic levels, know  photography well enough to get decent shots and am trying to make a  photo book currently, and can even fix and build computers, though I  tried doing that in the area and would only get maybe 1 person a year  asking for help on that.",10May2020,1
232,"I know we’re in a pandemic blah blah blah not the point. I (23F) have never had a lot of friends and as my state is opening up I’m starting to realize that. I see everyone hanging out with their friends and SO’s doing fun things and it makes me sad. I’m dating someone- he works nights (one week on and one off) this being his on week I’ve realized that I’m really lonely. Before we started dating I would go out on tons of dates to distract myself from not having friends obviously I don’t do that now. When we first started dating I had 3 jobs and barely any time for anything and the loneliness wasn’t so bad. Now because of covid I have one job and I’m the only one in the office all day. I don’t really know how to make friends at this age. I’m not in college and everyone seems to have these tight little groups and I’m never involved. Even with the friends that I have had I always feel like the background friend. I’ve never really been close to anyone and sucks way bad. I hate feeling dependent on my partner for social interaction and friendship. This has been a trend in all my relationships and it really really takes a toll and I’m trying to fix it. He wants me to have friends and obviously I do too. I do tons of things alone. Before we met I worked really hard on myself to become okay with being alone and better myself because that’s what everyone says you should do and the friends will follow- they haven’t. I go to the gym, hike, travel alone. Hell I even went to Disneyland alone. I am okay doing things alone that’s not the problem. Doing everything alone all the time gets lonely.

I don’t want this to hurt my romantic relationship, I don’t want to try and force friendship with people (which is how I feel with all my current friends-it feels very forced). I just want to know how to cope with the crippling loneliness better or how to make friends. I don’t know. I’m just lonely and don’t know what to do. We will be moving in together in the near future and he has a huge dog that I love &amp; I’m so excited to have someone to be around even if it’s a pet. I don’t want this to ruin my relationship only to go back to tons of dates because that’s still just a distraction from the real problem.",10May2020,1
233,"I am a 20 year old female.

Previously, I was employed at a sort of holiday retreat facility. I can't go into much detail without revealing too much. But all the staff were accommodated at the premises itself as it was located a bit away from cities and towns. 

Anyways, I've had a rough past and getting that job was like the turning point of my life, in a good way. That's why I took it so hard when we all lost our jobs because of the pandemic. 

I started binge drinking and partying. Which was something I really put an effort to stay away from. But my depression from the job loss led me to behave in that manner.

I had a fuck buddy of sorts there. We will call him Shawn. Shawn was a married dude but I still slept with him regularly. Immoral, I know. But I'm not here for judgment about that. We saw each other couple of times a week, sex was the best I've ever had, we only texted each other when the need arose, and didn't hang out outside of the bedroom. 

Anyways, while I was on my drinking spree, I may have blabbered a bit about Shawn to people. And I told the wrong guy about it. This guy went on to tell EVERYONE about it and the story went viral. 

I never said anything bad about him. I didn't even share the fact that he's married. I just kind of talked about how hot he is and how much I love having sex with him. I didn't put him down or anything like that.

Anyways so everyone found out about me and Shawn and everyone was talking about it. 

Shawn was really pissed about this, mostly because people from his hometown also worked there and found out about this, meaning that his wife would also possibly get to know. 

He screamed at me and told me he didn't want to see me anymore.

And I was okay with this. I knew I fucked up.

I became the most hated person on the premises. Everyone was ganged up against me. 

I stopped drinking and stayed out of everyone's way. I didn't bother him, or anyone else.

And then a little over a week later, he texts me out of the blue - really casually. Asking me how I am, and all this small talk. He asked to meet and that he had something he wants to talk to me about.

I was very sexually frustrated at the time. I thought it was a booty call. So I said alright and agreed to meet him. I know I'm stupid but I wanted him so badly at the time that I agreed to it.

So I went to his room. It was entirely dark there, pitch black. He had a roommate, but we had fucked several times while the roommate was sleeping in the same room. Which was also stupid, I know.

We talked for a little bit and he was getting all close to me. We started to have sex. 

Halfway through, I knew something was off. Somebody went into the toilet and at first I didn't pay attention. I thought it was his roommate getting up to pee or something. But whoever who went into the bathroom didn't shut the door behind them and the room was flooded with light, which was when I knew that something was wrong.

I made Shawn stop. And when I looked across the room, I saw someone else sitting there. But not the roommate - another guy. We will call him Kyle. Kyle was sitting there and just watching us.

I freaked out, obviously. 

Long story short, Kyle was sitting there the whole time trying to take videos of me naked. This was all as a form of revenge / punishment.

They did not show me the videos, but there definitely were videos as they let me hear the audio of it. 

Later on they told me they deleted it, but there is no way of knowing for sure. 

Anyhow, I don't think they would leak it because no matter what, it wouldn't just be me in the video. Shawn would also be in it and the last thing he would want is to be exposed.

It's been over a month since then, and I can't stop thinking about. I know that I behaved very stupidly and with very little self-respect. And I know I was in the wrong too.

But I can't help feeling like I deserve what happened to me. That's what I think of every day. That what happened to me was something I deserved. I feel ridden with anxiety all the time. 

It's disturbing to me how so many people were in on this plan and that they all collectively hated me enough to do something so drastic to me. I don't feel safe. I feel like the most terrible person ever and that for so many people to come to an agreement on such a thing, I really must have deserved it.

Some days I just want to die. There was nothing romantic between me and Shawn, but now I can't even stop thinking about him. I hate myself more and more every day..

And I just want to hear someone else's perspective on this.

Thank you.",10May2020,1

238,"Hey all,

I tried to do some googling around this subject but didn't get a lot of practical advice from it.  I'm going to do some journaling on it as well, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.  

For as long as I remember, I've always had a crush on someone.  Not a specific person, but if there's ever a point in time where I'm not liking someone, I generally tend to develop feelings for someone quickly.  When I was younger, I was shy enough to just simply pine, but recently as I've become more outgoing and brave, this has put me in some pretty uncomfortable situations, where I end up involved with someone and then feel guilty when my feelings aren't as strong as theirs, among others. I feel like I have a lot of thought processes to unlearn in order to change this fact about myself, and I have an inkling of where to begin, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.  Have you had experiences like this?  What would you do if you were in my shoes?  I'll do my best to answer any follow-up questions in the thread.

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing I'll say on this is that I feel like my energy is better directed elsewhere.  When I'm thinking about a crush, I'm not being creative (making art, music etc.), which is something I've always dreamed of doing.  I want to become more creative, but I feel like this behavior or trait or whatever you might call it is getting in the ways of that.

He’s lost weight before when he was in high school and I know his intention is to do it again, but he can’t bring himself to exercise and eat better cause he says he’s tried “everything”. He feels self conscious about the way he looks when he goes out with me. He feels ashamed that a “pretty girl” like me is out with a “fat guy like him” (it honestly breaks my heart :c) He says his preference is thin women, he doesn’t feel ashamed of having that preference or admitting that it’s what initially attracted him to me;  that I should be allowed to prefer a thin man, and he wants to be that thin man for me. I constantly reassure him that I love him no matter the size. I try to be as patient and supportive as possible and don’t pressure him to lose weight. However, I’m starting to get frustrated because he’s getting bigger and it’s starting to affect our sex life and in turn, his confidence. I really don’t want him to gain any more weight.

My grandmother initially let them stay so they could get on their feet at least, but with kids at my house, and others who I protect, I can't let someone using a virulent drug continue to stay here regardless of their circumstance.

241,"I moved out of my parents house in July 2019. I got a 1 bedroom apartment with my fiancé (now husband).

Anyways the apartment doesn’t fit all of our belongings. I paired down a lot. I still have items that belong to me at my parents house and my mom brought me some storage bins. The plan was to fill up the storage bins and put them in my grandparents house in the attic (my parents never sold the house and my dad sleeps in the house thats another story) which is completely empty. 

Well, I allowed my sister to sleep in the bedroom because I felt bad she had a bedroom in the basement that was really cold and got really hot in the summer. When I went to get some my belongings last week (i had to get my fan, my husbands broke and we cannot put the AC on until the apartment maintenance removes the AC cover)  I noticed my old bedroom was trashed. I counted 5-6 soda bottles, some water bottles, she took up her TV to play with our old Nintendo game cube, they let the cat stay in my room with a tray of cat litter and she used one of my decorative bowls that I brought for Halloween (it says “Boo” on it and the inside of the bowl is orange) as a cat drinking dish. My Jewelry box was opened and one of the storage bins that my mom gave me to put my stuff in (I promised to empty the room out after the Coronavirus pause is over) had her clothing inside.

Now I know I should of got everything out of my parents house last year but with my job, my husbands job, my husband and I don’t drive (he has a medical condition and I was in a car accident that scarred me from driving), I felt bad asking my dad to help me all the time so I thought taking stuff little by little would be better and i got about 75% out but I guess I was wrong.

Anything I can do? I just want my stuff to be respected and I planned on painting my old room and making it into a nice guest room for my mom but clearly my sister didn’t respect my stuff and trashed it (although i got some stuff out last week). My parents were okay with me clearing it out after the Coronavirus was over with but still I felt hurt :/ She clearly is using my boxes for her personal use when mom got it for me to pack my stuff to put in the attic at my grandparents house.

But I can’t draw well from my imagination or without a picture in general. I can use multiple mediums really well too as long as I have a picture, such as acrylic paints, graphite, charcoal, and ink.

243,"I’ve always had this problem and it has continually gotten even more humiliating as I grow older, I am f(18). Every time I have to talk about something that is stressful to me my eyes start welling up and I can’t do anything to stop it. The thing is I know that those things aren’t that bad, they aren’t that stressful just kinda something that’s at the back of my mind a lot. For example i got my driving g1 license kind of late compared to everyone else and I am dependent on others to get me places. I have to complete driving school (which I can’t do now cause of corona) to be able to shorten the wait to get my g2 license to drive by myself and even then I have to wait till after I start uni to go get my g2 so the timing of everything kind of stresses me out. It’s not that bad though and I’m sure I’ll figure it out at the time but tonight I was questioned by my dad about it and immediately started getting quieter cause I could feel tears coming. He started asking me what wrong which made me start crying and then I had to keep trying to explain to him that I don’t know why I’m crying.

Another time I cried because my parents forced me to put a massive plant in my room that blocked one of my closet doors from opening and took up a bunch of space in my room. It was so embarrassing and I don’t even know why I cried? Sure it bugged me a bit but like it wasn’t anything terrible. This also happens when I feel embarrassed or frustrated, I don’t know what to do about it. It’s completely out of my control.

244,"Since being sent home from college and stuck in quarantine, my  sleep schedule is completely ruined. I’m up all night and asleep all day.  I usually fall asleep around 6 am and wake up around 2 and then go back to sleep at 5 and wake up at 9 and stay up the rest of the night. I have a history of bipolar depression and sunlight and going outside helps a lot with it. But all I want to during the day is sleep and then as a result I’m up all night and the cycle continues. Usually I’d I was having this problem I would just not sleep and go on with my day, but there’s nothing to do and nowhere to go now. So it’s a lot harder to stay awake all day.

245,"She is a famous singer and actress living in Los Angeles. I've been obsessing over her since 2018 and I've been thinking about finding a way to talk to her or meet her. I actually love her, believe me. But I just want to find out who she really is. I've heard lot of rumors about her. I wish not all of them are true.

I want to know basically everything about her. How she behaves privately, which people visit her house regularly, how many guys she had sex with, etc... But her private behavior is the most important one to me. It would show me who she really is so I can decide what to do about her.

About her house location, I know some old addresses in Los Angeles and Tennessee already but she has probably sold them and moved away already. But she is still in North Hollywood somewhere so i will find her again. It's just a matter of time. But let's assume that I know her house address, what is the best spying method that I could use? Should I sneak inside her home and plant a camera or mic or something? If yes, then how do I connect the mic or camera to her house's power system so it could work for a longer time? Or hire someone to do it all for me just like someone would hire a Hitman? 

There could be lots of options. What is your opinion on this? Don't be afraid though it's all about information. I just want to know things about her that no one else knows. That's all. What I do after that is another topic.",10May2020,1

I'm 27 and I have the chance to take a job that will allow me to travel all around the world and live in the countries I want to explore, this is my dream and my passion. However, I am in a blossoming new relationship with a girl I have had a crush on for years, and she wants us to get a place together. Who knows, this might lead to our marriage.

I feel this is a classic topic that a lot of people have to choose in their life, and usually the saying is ""I gave up on my dreams for XXX"". I am a rather unorthodox person, so doing crazy moves isn't against my lifestyle at all; and if it wasn't for her, I would be long gone.

252,"I feel stupid and feel like it’s FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS but .. 

Last year it was really rough family and friend wise and I feel like I have to give a little bit of backstory for it to make the most sense.. 

In January of last year my family and I were not on good terms because of dumb stuff and it was all just toxic and too much for me. I had friends named Britney and Julian (fake names) but Britney and Julian are siblings and I would tell them about my toxic family because it would come up sometimes and they OFFERED for me to stay with them. At first I said no because it wasn’t that bad and i would spend the night at their house sometimes but then it got to the point where i had to leave my house. Long story short it ended up now working out because of their dad doing stuff to me and they basically kicked me out. [Also I feel like i should mention this also because it is part of the reason why we are not friends, but on more than MULTIPLE occasions they would be racist to me and let their friends be racist to me and not have my back (All of them were Latino and I am black)]

After all of this I have MAJOR trust issues when it comes to my friends I can’t take anything they say seriously and i feel like if they don’t talk to me for a couple of days that they hate me and is talking about me behind my back.. I have no reason to think this but i just can’t really trust people anymore.. I have recently just distanced myself from them because I don’t want to be a bother. BUT there is TWO things 

1. I have about 6 ish friends and one group of 3 want to move in together with me and the other group of 3 want to move in together with me BUT i don’t want to move in with them (well i do i just don’t trust them because of what happened in the first situation) but i am looking to move out with roommates. 

2. My friend told me her mom doesn’t let her out and so she can’t hang out with me BUT i see her hanging out with other people on her story so i can’t help but to feel like it’s a bit of discrimination towards me because i am black (which also could be just from the first situation)

255,"Hey, so I’ve been having this issue lately. My family has always driven me absolutely insane, but before, I could handle my anger much better. 

Recently, it takes very little to set me off.  One minute I’ll be having a regular conversation and the next someone says something and I go crazy. Most times, looking back, I understand why I got angry, but not why I blew up. I know that’s probably confusing, so let me explain: 

For instance, earlier tonight I was in my room (which I share with my grandmother) and I was looking for a bra. I was saying that all of mine have gone missing. She responded that that made no sense to her because she had found bras in the room that I had said weren’t mine. I got angry because I felt like she wasn’t listening to me or understanding why I was upset (something that I feel quite often around most of my family). I blew up and left the room. 

Now I’m sitting here thinking, I understand why I was upset, but I don’t understand why one comment set me off so completely that I couldn’t control myself. I’ve always been able to control my emotional outbursts, but lately it feels like I can’t.

257,"I (18M) currently live with my mother (40F) while I finish high school and move to study at Texas Tech. To give a quick backstory, in a previous (now deleted) post in this subreddit that my mother has been suffering mental breakdowns during quarantine almost daily. It all started with just random mood swings, but now it has come to the point that she tries to hurt herself with anything she can grab on to (whether it's with a knife or with her bare fists). At this point, I have been restraining her as long as I can, but it's starting to wear on me; I am having a harder time to either work or study for my college finals and she is planning to move out from my life ""for my sake.""

Tonight, Saturday May 9th, I come back from work at 11 P.M., and the first thing she wants to do is talk for 35 min about how she is sorry that she hurt me all these years and that she can't compensate the damages she has done (she is very vague with her words, so I do not know any specifics). 

At the end of her talk, she said that to call work tomorrow (Sunday May 10) to tell them I can't show up; the reason being is that she wants to spend the whole day with me, whether it's going to and eat, or go to the park etc. This wouldn't be a problem, until she said that after going to court on Monday May 11 (unrelated reason) she wants me to go with to a place with her. When I ask her where and why, she said ""You don't need to know, I think it would make you upset if you found out. Just know that I will make it up to you after going to court.""

I am currently 19, employed but not enrolled in schooling at the moment (I plan to eventually). My mom has been controlling so much in my life it’s actually frightening. She made the choice for me that we were moving to Colorado without letting me even give my opinion on the matter. My boyfriend and I have visited each other quite a few times now and we are literally perfect for each other. We talk about our future together and that we are gonna get married and all that. Well, for the past two years I have brought up an idea I had about moving to Canada and she kinda just brushed it off. Keep in mind my bf is in Uni and will be enrolled for at least another 2 years, that would be 5 almost 6 years long distance. But now I’m very serious about moving there to be with him. I will enroll in classes and get a job. His family, I consider more than my own. We would be living in a Uni campus with people my own age. Where I live in CO there is nobody my age. I have one girlfriend here that lives 45 minutes away and she’s 23 years old. My mom just casually texts me and says “I have been thinking about you moving to Canada a lot lately and I don’t think that’s the best for you.” Which made me super super upset I had never been that upset/angry at her before, ever. I was scared to open up about it but did it anyways and she said it was not fair to not let her know why I was upset with her and assumed it was about Canada.

259,"Years ago, my husband had a small hookup behind my back. This was 2 years after I just had my son. We didn't know this til now but the woman had a daughter. It was a hookup and my husband didn't plan to start a real affair so she had no way of contact to him. 





We found out 3 months ago. The oldest daughter of the woman called us and tried to explain the situation. She said that she was curious and didn't want to bring the actual girl into it (which I tried to scold her for being so nosy and rude to the girl). Of course, my husband also got curious and asked about his daughter. She is 14 years old and is the youngest of the family as well as hispanic. We had a whole fight but let it go after a week. My son was angry that his dad betrayed us like that though. He still is partially angry but I tried to calm him down.





Everything was fine until issues started coming up in the girl's home. We had to take her in about a month ago. My son was very mean towards her on the first day. He would insult her and I would always step in and put an end to it. I tried my best to be civil with her. Having her here felt like a constant reminder of what was wrong with our family. My husband tried to help her warm up to us but she was very shy so it took a while for her to open up. Because of how quiet she was, I thought I could just ignore her. What messed up my plan was I had to put her in a room with my son for the night. Before I slept, I checked up on them and saw them as far as possible from each other. If she moved farther from him, she would have fell off the edge of the bed. He was all the way against the wall. The next morning, she was in his arms as he had it wrapped around her. It left such a heavy weight on me. I don't know why but it just made me feel so awful. As the month went by, they grew noticeably more and more closer. They were like gum to each other's shoe and it grew harder and harder to ignore her. 





I had snapped a few times at her, putting my own family against me for a short term. My husband knows how I feel about the situation but he keeps telling me to mature and be an adult. I want to be nicer to her but I just really don't like her. I don't want to say hate as it is a strong word but I am not very far from feeling that way. Thing is that she knows. She would try to avoiding being in the same room as me and at best, avoid being alone with me. I don't want her to feel unwelcome or hated but I just don't know how to handle these feelings. I just want her out of my house.",10May2020,1

They also are close to a divorce which is probably another reason why she went. Therefore, he’s living completely alone.

I live in downtown Chicago and he lives in Missouri so I really have high rates here currently. It scares me to visit him but he asks constantly and keeps saying he’s lonely and I feel like a horrible kid. I’ve been pushing off visiting for a while now and told him I might come next week but now that it’s closer I’m anxious. I know if I ever got him sick and he didn’t make it (he’s 67) I would literally never be able to forgive myself. Part of me feels like it would be fine but part of me is horrified what if it was my fault. I try to explain my worries to him but he’s not scared and underplays the situation imo with “You’re not sick, are you?” “You’d be showing symptoms” “You haven’t really been going anywhere” “I’ll be fine”.

I know he takes me not coming so personally and I don’t want him to be sad or lonely. I’ve suggested we can call and stuff but he doesn’t want to.

264,"I'm 18F for reference

Recently, maybe in the last two or three months, I've been obsessive about small things that use to not matter to me. Things I didnt even think of before now cause me literal pain.

For example, theres this setting on insta where you can track your activity and how many minutes you spend on there and I've been obsessing over it since the beginning of april. For some reason my brain has been telling me that if I go over the weekly average of 10 minutes, something bad will happen. Of course I know that this is completely insane but I went over the limit today and I completely panicked and thought something bad would happen to me. I know that this is not normal but idk what to do.

Also, at the beginning of the year I've been obsessing over my weight. My weight has to be an even number or I feel myself start to panic. Again, I know this is irrational but I cant help it.

There are so many more instances. I can't move forward with an activity even if theres one small mistake that means nothing. I am constantly showering, almost everyday because I feel the need to be constantly clean or else I panic. 

I know all of this is not normal since I spoke to my friend who says she has never done any of this. I dont know how to help myself because if i don't one of these things I mentioned, I feel sick and feel as if something bad is gonna happen.

So, can anyone tell me if this is normal or just caused by stress since I'm still in school during quarantine. I also live in a very stressful home with two not so nice parents and I've been forced to spend more time with them. Maybe it's this. Idk.

He’s still the most perfect guy I’ve ever dated, but he recently re-kindled with his girl best friend. That’s perfectly fine, and I was very happy for him. I knew he missed her. He has other girl friends and they are so nice and I adore them, but this one is different. They originally fell out because she ghosted him, after spending a couple hundred of dollars with him. I never knew the whole story, but I’m worried that he will get hurt by her again. He reassured me that she’s changed. Now that she’s back in his life he seems to prioritize her over me. For example today he wanted to bring her a drink and abruptly hung up on me, and lied to me about where he was. As soon as he got into the car he told me the truth. He just went into her work and gave her a drink. I was hurt that he felt like he needed to hide something from me.

We’re all in our mid/late twenties. I’ve known her since 2013, and him since 2014. I inadvertently introduced them, and I have been around them both separately a lot. Her husband and I haven’t always gotten along. (We both actively disliked each other for years, but ended up being ok after a while.)

They are very fun people and love to travel, so I think they want a free place to stay while they explore Seattle and see other friends. I’m mostly fine with that and would enjoy seeing her anyway. 

My concern lies in that I know her and her husband love to have sex in as many places as possible. They proudly list off the number of places they’ve done it. 

I don’t have a guest bedroom in my apartment, so they’d be sleeping on my large, comfy sectional (or a blow up mattress if I buy one). And there’s close to a 100% chance they’ll have sex. 

Is it wrong if I’m hesitant to let them stay with me, because the thought of her husband’s pale, freckly naked butt touching my furniture grosses me out?

(And if I kindly ask them to not have sex on my couch, they will want to do it more.)

Should I just lay down multiple sheets on my GOOD CHRISTIAN SOFA and pray to the couch gods they at least use a condom? Should I tell them a hotel would be better? (They 100% have money for it.) 

It may be irrational, but I’m just uncomfortable with it.

268,"New account for this, I normally would never but I'm really desperate. My girlfriend of 4 months has been out of the country since lockdown and it was a struggle communicating on FaceTime right away. It seemed to just make us miss each other more, but we kept talking on and off, until I brought up the fact that I wasn't sure I was going to be able to keep that up until the fall and was thinking about seeing other people. She told me that it was okay if I was really lonely and had a one-night stand. A few days later I got a message from an acquaintance saying that her friend was into me, and I always thought she was really cute so I thought I might. Unsure about this, I tell my girlfriend because she said she wanted to know if anything did happen, and she tells me that the person who reached out to me had embarrassed her before and she wanted to break up with me because I told the girl about how our relationship was stressed. I feel really bad and after a few days I reach out to her to apologize again and we start talking regularly again.

Then I moved back to school and in a moment of weakness hooked up with the one girl that my girlfriend didn't want me to. I didn't tell her for several weeks, until three days ago.

She pretty much immediately broke up with me. I panicked and was trying to explain and she told me several times it didn't matter what I told her, she couldn't let me change her mind. I have never been manipulative to her in any way, and everything just seems incredibly hopeless right now. I've apologized too many times now and have told her that I wanted to change. She told me that she believed that I could make that change but she didn't want to do that with me anymore.

Tonight I realized that, in the conversation we had about when I talked to her, she ended it by saying ""and if you hook up with her I'm gonna kick your ass"", and i told that I was actually still thinking about, and I think this is really makes me confused because her response definitely didn't seem like she would immediately break up with me on the spot if I ever told her that we did. she seemed to take it understandingly. but I see now that is incredibly foolish. It's very clear how hurt she was and it eats me every day now... I knew that this period of time would be really fucking tough but I never thought that we wouldn't be together when it was all over. I really don't think I would have ever done this if thought that was the reality.

Is it worth bringing this up to her at some point or am I simply hopeless in this situation. We've only been dating a few months but we have a lot of the same friends and go to school together. I can't tell her this any more than I already have but I would really do anything to make this right or make her feel better.",10May2020,1

About two months ago, she adopted this second dog at the pound without coming to me about it. I wasn't mad about it because I love pets so I was fine with having another dog around the house. The problem is that for whatever reason, my girlfriend has been treating the old dog like shit relative to this new dog. She'll do things such as take the new dog for walks and leave the old dog locked up in the crate when I'm not home, even though the old dog is house broken and the new dog isn't. I would understand this favoritism if it were a brand new puppy, or if it were a well behaved dog, but it isn't. The dog she adopted is about the same age and much worse behaved than the dog we've owned for 3 years.

Anyways I just thought I was different in his eyes and that he actually liked me. he moved on to college &amp; I was still in high school yet he still managed to talk to me. we had such a deep connection idk what it really was. we ended up hooking up TWICE &amp; after the second time (idk if it was something I did).. he completely ghosted me. now this actually kind of hurt because I was so used to his attention &amp; I was just mentally &amp; physically attracted to him. we still kept our snapchat streak, however, a couple months later he ended up getting a girlfriend . We still barely talked &amp; yet the times we did, sometimes he would subtly flirt with me. anyway it’s not like he hasn’t flirted w me before while being in a relationship. (what a player) so I decided to move on &amp; let go. A couple of months later, he officially ends the streak.. &amp; every single time I would try and take my mind off of him, he comes back and sends me a snapchat randomly. whatever. Now he asked for a streak again &amp; honestly I’m just annoyed &amp; there’s so many things I wish I could say to him just to clarify things but I’m not doing so out of respect for his relationship. All I want is clarity &amp; closure. so I need advice to fully accept this and just move on.


TLDR; this guy I have strong feelings (&amp; I’m sure he felt the same about me) for somehow keeps coming back into my life even though he has a girlfriend. I desperately want to move on &amp; accept that he is no longer part of my life in that way. pls help!",10May2020,1

279,"So, in a few months time when courthouses are open in the US again, I will be coming into a large sum of money. Enough to put me through the college of my dreams on both degrees I wish to go for. My father passed when I was younger and since his passing, I made it my job to take care of my two sisters (one older and one younger) as well as my mother. By the time I graduated high school, I hadn’t made any plans for college because I told myself I needed to take care of them. My mother was never too mentally stable and was very abusive to myself and my sisters as we aged. So much so that my older sister has excommunicated herself from the rest of the family. 
At that time, I knew she couldn’t support or take care of herself but now she’s got her own money and is marrying her cousin, so I don’t feel like I need to take care of her any longer. My younger sister is turning 21 in July and everything seems okay for me to make my move.
So my plan is to use the influx of money as well as what I have saved to attend the college of my dreams in Florida. I currently live in New York, and this will be a drastic change for me. Also, the college I plan to attend doesn’t have on campus housing so I’d need to get my own place.
I want to be as ready for this change as possible and even though it’s a few months before I have the money, I want to be planned and ready and I need help.

How should I go about a move from New York to Florida?",10May2020,1

It was at the end of 8th grade I wasn’t really a momma boys to her anymore because I realized she tries to act like as if she is my real mom, she is overprotective, and annoying, she always accuses me of stuff I don’t do.

281,"So there is this girl named “Sarah”. “Sarah” came into my friend group when I was in college, and sorta during high school but not really. (Were 22/23 now). Sarah &amp; I have a history of being friends/not. Basically she’s always been around &amp; I have taken her under my wing a many of times, but we have all the same friends. We got into it a few months ago, because she said I said something that I didnt to my very best friend &amp; I got PISSED bc sarah always tries to come between my best friend and I. Sarah &amp; i ended up in a screaming match on the phone (immature, I know). However, Sarah &amp; I have a long history and I do care about the girl (even thought i shouldn’t). We have the same friends &amp; I don’t want there to be a conflict. AKA if we’re both going to a party, Sarah will is usually not go if I’m there. I want to be good terms, so would it be dramatic if I called her and was like “Im sorry for our past, let’s agree to be cordial” so it’s not awkward? 

I also just kinda want to be friends in bc she makes my life interesting lol. 

Other possibly relevant details: I am outgoing &amp; confident, but sarah is shy &amp; meek. Both of us are really involved socially though, although I am closer to most of our friends. She’s always talking shat on me, and I know bc everyone tells me. But I know it is only cause she literally has nothing else to talk about, and I lowkey don’t mind it bc I know shes not a bar person. Sarah is also like 9 months - year younger than everyone, and more immature so I’ve always pictured her as a little young person &amp; not held her to the same Standard as everyone else. She’s a super emotional a person and very vulnerable, but also very very feisty &amp; always in an argument. However, She’s toxic and I’ve tried just having her fizzle out of my life, but it’s not gonna happen. The community is too tight-nit. So I almost need us to be in good terms bc of a “friends close, enemies closer” kind of thing, I just am scared she’ll yell &amp; scream in my face &amp; I’ll seem as if I’m making something out of nothing",10May2020,1
282,"My roommate left our apartment in mid-April to stay with her family until quarantine is lifted, but I chose to stay at the apartment. She said she will continue to pay her share of the rent during the months she isn't here. So my question now is about the utilities. We still split all the month's utilities in half for April, since she spent at least half of the month at the apartment.

May will be the first month she has fully not been living here, and I'm trying to figure out the fairest way to split utilities. I do know I plan to charge her for half of the wifi bill, since that is a set amount each month. We vaguely discussed this before she left, and she said she would be fine with paying for it. 

The remaining bills are for electric and gas. Both of those are charged based on use, and I don't want to unfairly charge her for those bills when she isn't technically using anything. I guess technically some of those electric/gas bills go towards heating the entire apartment, including her room/our shared area, and not just ""my"" room etc - but part of me feels like since she isn't here at all, I shouldn't charge her at all for the bills that are based on use, like electric/gas. But that also means I'll be having to pay for both of those bills by myself, and it isn't exactly cheap. And also because this situation is ""unprecendented"", I'm not really sure if it isn't unfair to charge her.

I'm also not really sure if this is something I just need to sort out with my roommate, or just a ""do the right thing"" kind of scenario and not charge her. Any advice? Thanks!",10May2020,1

284,"So my filipino mom has a tendency to shout whenever she gets irritation. I'm sure she doesn't think too much about it and thinks what she's doing is normal (my sister sure acts like it is) but whenever she does it but i can never tell her anything about it because she just thinks I'm being a bratty child whenever i do. Most of the time, the object of her irritation is me and my sister's ""incompetence"" when it comes to house work. She keeps on saying ""You won't survive a day alone once i die if you stay like this"" and ""Once I die, i bet the both of you will stand on your own filth considering how lazy you are"" and ""How are you gonna survive in the real world when you're like this"". I know i personally have a long way to go when it comes to being self sufficient but no matter how many times i look at her, i can never see her as a proper adult i should look up to. I love her and I love how caring she is and how those frustrating words comimg from her mouth probably come from a place of love. But like i said I just can't see her as a proper adult to look up to. She says the most important thing in life if you want to survive is being able to interact with different people properly. She says that but she herself has massive temper issues. She constantly barks at service employees whenever she's in a bad mood. She let's her temper get the better of her all the time and she doesn't know how to deescalate problems, instead she let's her pride and temper get the better of her, making the problem worse. She says we won't survive a day without her but she probably doesn't even know how to send a proper email without us. 

I also hate how I practically can't say anything to her. Whenever she disagrees with an opinion i have, she always just tells me im wrong without listening to my reasons. She then chalks it into ""adults knowing better"" and whenever i try to defend my point, she shouts me and calls me bratty. I admit, I haven't been the best child, I used to talk back to her whenever she doesn't agree with me, but for the past 2 years I've been holding back. Whenever she says something I personally disagree with, I'll tend to stay quiet to avoid conflict. I hate how she doesn't want to admit that she's wrong sometimes. A few years ago, she'd cuss at me all the time. She'd also call me ""a demon who needs his horns to be cut off before it's too late"".  

I love her but i just hate how she's like this. I don't think the way i typed this out doesn't give her attitude justice. 

My mom's had a rough past. She lived most of her life in poverty without a proper adult figure to look up to. I think that's a reason why she thinks being responsible at home is so important. There was never an adult to tell her thr proper values a person should have. She also experienced a bit of violence from my dad (who btw also cheated on her). My parent's marriage has been in the rocks for a couple years now and even though they're already seperated (for 7 years now) they still fight a lot. 

Sorry for the long and uncohesive post but I'm just so frustrated. I wanted to vent out a little bit and i think this is the only place i can do that

I drink alcohol regularly, both of my parents are alcoholics. Id say I never had a problem with liquor, except when I was 18. Excessive binge drinking with cheap vodka used to be entertaining to me, but I dont drink like that anymore and haven’t in over 2 years. But since I turned 21 about 2-3 times a week I drink a six pack or more of some higher alcohol ipa beer. Id say average of 14-20 drinks a week

I constantly fantasize about trying drugs I have close to no exposure too. I’ve had pain killers prescribed, not really abused ever, besides one time drinking lean, and one time with vicodin and a beer. 

But sometimes find myself wanting to be messed up beyond whats easily available. I’ve tried cocaine just one time, and again find myself thinking about this substance, I have essentially no experience using besides one time.

1. I was 15 years old.
2. All my smoking equipment wasn’t 6 feet away from him.

292,"TL:DR- I hate my job, it's nothing like I expected and makes me miserable. I'm thinking about quitting to go back to school so I can change career paths entirely, but I'm not sure if that's the best decision.

This may be long and a little bit of a rant, but I would like some advice. I'm thinking about quitting my job and going back to school for a 2 year degree. A little background information: I'm 27 years old, no kids, not married, still living at home, not in debt, and have a BA in psychology, minored in criminal justice. I've only had 3 jobs. The first was part time in a grocery store while in college for 2.5 years, second was full time in a daycare after graduating; I did that for 3.5 years. I quit my second job last summer without having another job lined up because I felt like I had burned out and dreaded going to work every day. I had all of my student loans paid off and about $25,000 saved up, so I figured I could afford to quit without having something else lined up. I spent the first few months after quitting really not doing too much. I relaxed, I rested, I traveled a little bit and just enjoyed myself.

Last October, I started looking for jobs. Out of all the jobs I had applied for, only one called back, and that was in February this year. I was excited about the interview. I was starting to get a little bored at home and feeling pressure to go back to work. I had a few days to prepare for the interview, and in that time I did everything you're supposed to. I researched the organization, practiced interview questions, and came up with a list of my own questions. Unfortunately, I feel like everything has been going downhill since the interview. I arrived for my interview, and they seemed slightly unprepared. I was greeted and interacted only with the assistant, and she didn't seem too sure which position I was interviewing for. She gave me forms to fill out, and told me that when I was finished, I could take them to the vice president who was in her office. The assistant then left the office. I thought that was weird, but understood that they were all busy working. I was sitting near the printer in the office so quite a few of the employees came by to get things they had printed. No one said anything to me or really even acknowledged me even though I had looked up and smiled at some of them. I believe that interviews are a two way street; the employer should be making sure the candidate is a good fit, and the candidate should be doing the same. I didn't feel like they were making the best first impression, but put that thought/feeling to the side. I finished filling out the paperwork and went into the vice president's office. She got up and closed the door, and we basically started the interview. It started off okay. She gave me some background information on the organization and explained the open positions. After some time, I noticed that as she was talking her eyes would sometimes be closed. I didn't think much of it because some people gather their thoughts better with their eyes closed. Then she started to slur her words, her voice would trail off a little bit, and what she was saying didn't make too much sense. I thought maybe it was me, that I was mishearing her or didn't understand the jargon. It was not me; she was actually falling asleep. It happened quite a few times and sometimes she would only be asleep for a few seconds, other times it was longer. Sometimes she would pick up where she left off, other times she seemed confused when she woke up. It was clear that she had health problems, but I didn't feel comfortable addressing it and she didn't say anything about it either. I had gone through some of my questions, but by the time we had gotten to my questions, she was falling asleep more frequently. I chose to just skip over the last of my questions so we could wrap things up. I finished a couple more things with her, she said I should hear from her in a couple of weeks, and then I left. I knew I had done well during the interview, but I wasn't impressed with what I saw from the other employees and especially the vice president. I didn't want to take the job if it was offered. I went home and kept applying for jobs.

About two weeks later, they called to offer me the position (case manager). The position that I interviewed for and eventually accepted was not the position I had applied for. When they offered the position, I asked for a day to think about it. I weighed pros and cons and decided to at least try it out even though I had a bad feeling about accepting the position. I don't consider myself to be an anxious person, but the night before starting I had terrible anxiety and this feeling like I was making a huge mistake. I chose to ignore those feelings and just figured it was because I was getting used to not working. Fast forward to now and I wish I had listened to those feelings. I am completely miserable. I went through a few weeks of ""training"" and I am now expected to know quite a bit and work independently. The vice president that I interviewed with is also my supervisor for the time being. I feel like when I try to reach out to her with questions or for guidance, she either ignores me or gives me a very vague answer. I don't see her around the office much so most of our communication is by phone. There has been one woman who has been more than helpful and if it weren't for her, I think I would have already quit. She has been pretty much the only one that has been willing to take time out of her day to help me with my cases and answer my questions in detail regardless of how many I have. Overall, she's the only one I really feel comfortable taking questions to. In the time that I've been there, I have found it to be very unprofessional and certain things have come out that should have been in the job description or mentioned during the interview. I honestly feel that I could handle the work if the training and work environment were better. I dread going into work and have been very stressed out because I feel that no one is really helping me to learn my role and responsibilities. The biggest thing that has pushed me to want to leave sooner than later was when I asked a program assistant for help. She had an attitude with me, refused to answer my question (even though it was within her abilities to help me) and made it very clear that she couldn't and wouldn't help me because I needed to be taking my questions to case managers. I left the room, but I heard her complaining to the other program assistants that I knew nothing. It was embarrassing and made me wonder how I could learn this job when I only had one person willing to help me. I've never worked a job like this where the people are so unwilling to help. I've trained other people in my past positions and would never dream of treating them the way that I've been treated.

I don't see myself being able to grow and thrive in this type of environment and I'm trying so hard to find a new job. I've applied for numerous other positions, but I either don't hear back or I get the standard rejection letter. I absolutely hate my new job, and I'm very tempted to quit without something else lined up. I try to remind myself to be grateful that I have a job, especially now when so many people have lost their job or are having their hours cut, but I truly feel miserable and spend a lot of time crying, which isn't like me.

Right now, I'm starting to rethink my whole career path. I’m thinking maybe it’s time to pursue something else. I’m thinking about going back to school for an associate’s degree (or 2) so that I can start exploring entry level human resources, marketing, business or logistics positions. I feel that I have some advantages that I can use to my benefit. Even though I live at home, I am in no way a freeloader or taking advantage of my parents. I pay all of the utility bills here, cover all of my own expenses, buy groceries, cook, and clean. I would like to move out and hope to do so as soon as I can but I don’t make enough and, for a variety of reasons, prefer not to rent an apartment. Because I’ve been able to stay at home, it has reduced my expenses and allowed me to save up as much as I have. In the time, that I wasn’t working, I barely went into my savings. I still have more than $20,000 saved. My original plan was to use that and put it toward buying a house, but I don’t think I’m ready for that because of my current employment situation. I’m now thinking that I should use some of that money to go back to school. If I go back to school, I will quit my current job and maybe take on something part time just so I have an income while in school. To anyone that has read this whole thing, thank you! It was long lol. But aside from that, what do you guys think? Am I overreacting, should I try to stick it out in a job that makes me miserable? Is there anything else that I should take into consideration before deciding one way or another?",10May2020,1
294,"I (20F) am from a line of nurses. My mom is an ER nurse, my grandma is a retired nurse, my aunt is a retired nurse, my mom's cousin is a nurse. I believe my great grandma was also a nurse but I'm not 100% certain, it seems to have been mentioned once. 

Once I start college, my mom got really excited about the idea of me also being a nurse. She kept talking about how she could help me with the material, and how we'd have something major in common then. And at first, I WAS going to be a nurse. Wound care specialty. But then an obstacle with schooling happened, and that idea was scrapped. I quickly found something I liked better: clinical lab science. To say the least, mom was disappointed that I had scrapped my nurse plan. She tried not to show it, but I could see it.

Now that schooling is online due to the virus, I've been having trouble with my classes. I don't learn well online at all. When mom learned of my new issues, the phrase ""well there's always the nursing program"" has come out of her mouth at least twice, and other variants of have happened even more. 

I'm a hospital pharmacy tech right now, and all the stress of work, virus, quarantine, and school have been negatively impacting my mental health.

So when we saw each other my old feelings came back for him. We never said anything to each other that day or the days after when would see each other. One being I was scared to go up and say something to him and the other being that he would give me looks as if he was annoyed/mad at me so I didn't bother him. Months later I go onto FB and DM him just a simple ""hey, how are you?"". Weeks past and I forget I dmed him until one day I decided to go onto FB and check my messages. I look at the dm that I had sent him and I saw that he had read the message but never responded. After seeing that he didn't respond I think it's time to move on from him.

There were a lot of bad decisions on my roommates side. And I wanted to live alone. About 3 years after the woman in the relationship messaged me. She wanted a night out with the two of us and I went and things got weird. She wanted to get drunk and hook up with ransoms. I was concerned because she was still with my old roommate. Anyway she left the bar with someone who wasn’t him. It had been a long time I don’t know their arrangement. Anyway the next day she asked me to lie to him. Which I did because I was put on the spot. Don’t worry I told her it makes me a garbage person because I love him too. But after this I cut her off. I know she went to rehab, but she did that before and cheated on my old roommate then. She found me on Snapchat and asked why she couldn’t find me on Facebook. So should I ignore her? Or should I explain? She’s a really nice girl going through a really tough time.

310,"My entire life there’s been so much pressure on me to be the best in everything I do, and do a lot. I was required to play tons of sports, play instruments, do art, do additional tutoring outside of school, etc. Starting when I was 2 years old I was shuffled around from school to gymnastics practice to tennis lessons to swim team to tutoring day in and day out and it was exhausting doing that for 16 years. When I got to college, I was still under a lot of pressure to do well in school while balancing clubs, Greek life, and a social life. Because of all of this, I’ve always been super hard on myself, and see any minor mistake as a failure on my part and I completely shut down and tear myself apart. 

Last week I graduated with my bachelors degree, and because of covid-19 I’ve had to move home for a couple of months before moving to moving to the city where I will be starting a post-bac certification program in the Fall (which I’m super excited for!)

313,"TL;DR - coworker that i’ve been “talking” to. friends all think he’s a douche. can’t tell if i actually like him or not. trying to figure out if i should wait and see where it leads or cut it off now while there’s no real feelings.

So i’ve been talking to this guy that i work with for about a month now. We also text almost everyday. Sometimes he calls me babe, bb, or b. From the very beginning, my other coworkers have all warned me to be careful because they all think he’s a fuckboi or douche. And i’ll admit, that is the impression he gives off, but he’s actually very interesting to talk to and fairly intelligent as well. We’ve hung out casually once and also hooked up recently. The hang out and hookup were both nice and we both enjoyed ourselves. Things were going good until he hit me up for nudes last night bc he was horny. I’m not gonna bash on ppl that send nudes but it’s just really not my thing. So I said no and it’s been a bit awkward since then. He didn’t persist or question it after I said no. But i saw him today and I couldn’t tell if he was avoiding me or if i was subconsciously avoiding him. I really like talking to him. I think there’s some chemistry there and definitely sexual tension, but i dont know if it’s gonna go anywhere. I don’t know exactly what he wants and tbh I don’t know exactly what I want either. What i do know is that I don’t want to just be a booty call. I’m probably fine with a friends-with-benefits type situation as long as it is actually that. Equal parts friends and benefits bc I do really like spending platonic time with him too. If he only sees me as someone to fuck then I’d rather just cut it off now while there’s no real feelings. And then again I think, if he ONLY wanted that, why would we have talked everyday for a month about other things? And why would he pick me just for hookups? He’s definitely an attractive person and there’s no way he has trouble getting girls, but tbh, i’m mostly average and not “easy” so if he really was just looking for someone to fuck, why wouldn’t he pick someone hotter and easier?",10May2020,1

friend A and C are just friends from sports and we aren’t particularly close but still close enough to trust them. me and friend B used to be super close but we have drifted since. 

so last night i got a text from friend A asking for a picture of my face. i sent one not thinking that it was a huge deal and asked her why she needed it and if it was for a tik tok. she said no and i didn’t feel like asking anymore because i was tired and wanted to sleep. today i texted her and asked her why she needed the picture and she told me she sent it to someone. when i asked her who she sent it to she kept saying that i didn’t know that which was even more concerning.

i give up on friend A and switch to asking friend B if she knows anything about this. friend B says that she knows but once again won’t tell me a username or anything helpful. 
friend C starts texting me asking why i needed the username even though i never texted her about it. they were both very concerned about what i was going to say to this guy. at this point i’m freaking out because the girl that sent the photo has a reputation of talking to a ton of guys so i didn’t know if some pedophile had my face. 

after some 30 mins of asking friend A finally gives me a name and tells me to not text him. i decide to text him and tell him that he had been “catfished”. thank god he was some normal guy but what if he wasn’t. the back story on him was that he was friend Cs ex boyfriend and they couldn’t let him know that it was them texting him. 

basically i’m just wondering if i can really be mad because yea i sent that picture and yea it was a normal person. if i can be mad does it even make sense to be mad at friends B and C because all they did was refuse to give me a username and they were just sticking up for their friend.

318,"Greetings,

not sure if i should post this in r/relationship_advice instead but here we go.

so i moved to do a masters degree in another country. i had a crush on a girl. befriended her. after several months i'm now pretty certain that she is not interested in me romantically. even though we are on good terms, there are signs that she wants to keep distance. i don't really mind that my feeling is not reciprocated, but i'm not sure how to proceed.

she rarely initiates conversation and she keeps her replies short whenever i do. we always go around in group. she is not very motivated when i ask her to hang out with me. i think the people in my circle know i'm interested in her (they show signs), so i assume that she herself must be aware of it too. i asked her to be my language tutor and she accepted. i ask her questions from time to time but she just keep the answer short to the point that i don't want to bother her anymore. i asked her to a meal as a mean to repay her tutelage a few times but she never accept my invitation. it feels bad to just keep asking.

she probably wants to keep distance because she doesn't want to lead me on and give me false hope. perhaps she wants to keep me around as a friend. however, the thing is, this whole dynamic makes it difficult for me and her to even have a decent platonic relationship when communication is almost non existent. 

it is not difficult for me to forget about her and move on. after all, once we graduate, it is likely that we will not see each other again even if we keep in touch. it is a shame because we could have helped each other a lot, but i suppose i can live with that.

so my questions are:

1) does it even make sense to keep being friend? she doesn't even want to talk to me. should i just cut all contacts and disappear? i think she probably wont realize that i'm gone

2) do i even bother to tell her how i feel when i graduate?

3) do you still keep in touch with unrequited crushes?",10May2020,1

I will go out with my friends sometimes and get drunk like any teenager but the next day she'll like be actually mad at me which I can understand but still, I'm just having fun.

I've been living in a house with a few housemates for a year now and we have a next door neighbour who's kitchen window is directly opposite to our kitchen window, i would see him with headphones on cooking and doing the dishes (exactly the same as us) for this entire time but never once acknowledged each other or made eye contact etc but that changed last week when he spoke to me (and all of my housemates individually) on our doorstep when coming back with groceries. At first he said 'hey neighbour' and inquired about the beers in my groceries, it was a hot day and i thought hey awesome sure you can have one, we're locked down and he's just having a chat while smoking, so i gave him one and wished him well... and then he said 'i've missed you' which freaked me out a bit. i laughed it off and went inside. (we're in our 20's, i'd say he's early 30's)

Since then he's been out in the front street topless singing passionately to himself and whenever we're in the kitchen he frantically waves at us to get our attention and does things like blows kisses (we've not had a conversation longer than a couple awkward sentences on our doorstep while looking for keys). 
I was making a cup of tea at 7am and he's waving to get my attention and comes out into his back yard and waving his arms... he seems to do this every single time were in the kitchen now and i feel uncomfortable even washing the dishes. 

i thought perhaps he's going a bit nuts being isolated due to covid, but that wouldn't explain the OTT shit he's doing all of a sudden. i don't know man, its just weird.

I’m in the military, enlisted. “In a nutshell” of how enlisted ranks work, e1-e3 are automatic. Once you have a certain amount of time of being that rank you’ll get the next rank, it’s literally guaranteed. E4 and above you have to have a certain amount of time in the current rank in addition to having good physical scores, “good” at the job amongst a few other things. 

I’m currently an e3/ lance cpl. My time in grade to pick up cpl is coming up soon, within 2-3 months and my higher ups have already started talking about my promotion. Due to my physical fitness scores, having a few LOAs(letters of appreciation) division being very pleased with my work etc. it’s pretty much guaranteed at this point for me to pick up cpl as soon as my time in grade comes up. 

Here’s the deal though. I’m getting medically separated from the military due to epilepsy. At first when this whole thing was being diagnosed I was still very eager to pick up cpl, just as everyone else is. But once I was actually given the diagnosis literally everything went down the drain. My physical health went down the drain but mainly my mental health. 

My chain of command hasn’t handled this whole situation in the beat of ways, not even remotely close. My company gunny at some point accused me of faking it to “milk the system “ my doctors have constantly ignored my concerns. Currently my neurologist is ghosting me Etc. As you can probably imagine, this has taken its toll on my mental health. 

Recently all I want to do I sleep. It’s seriously hard to get up in the mornings and go to work, sit at a desk with my head throbbing. At times I’ve gone weeks without eating a single calorie. I’m so far deep into depression and people started to notice. 

I feel like if I were to accept said promotion to cpl/NCO they’d idfk hold it against me if it makes sense? “Don’t make us regret this” or “you’re an NCO now, act like it” etc shit like that having more responsibility and being in charge of others when at the moment I can’t even find a reason for me to keep breathing, feel me and my chain of command doesn’t have the best rap record with my medical case. 

On the other hand, so many want to pick up NCO. Like it’s literally everyone’s dream to rank up but especially from junior marine (e3) into NCO (e4) and there’s been so many that have been passed up for that promotion for so many years and me here I am getting it exactly at the time I meet my time in grade which is really rare. On the other hand, think about the most taboo thing you can think of, now add a few “no no” points to that and that’s how it is in the military to pass up a promotion. It’s kinda of a “are you stupid?” Type of thing. 

But yeah. I’ve tried asking for advice from military people but all they hear is “I’m passing up a promotion because my command has been a bitch aka you’re trying to make em mad and you’re just fucking yourself over at this point” I’m like “did you even hear anything I said? Like for me to try to fuck over my command would actually require me to give a shit and at this point I sincerely don’t even have enough will or strength to take another breath of air.",10May2020,1

339,"I’m 19m my brother is 16m. I’ve had to move back home from college and since I got here in March, he’s stolen from me:

Multiple items of food that I have bought/were bought for me

$40

my Xbox and Xbox controller 

and MY FUCKING UNDERWEAR. 

I’m done with it. 

He smokes all the time and our parents aren’t good about stopping him from doing it and they’re especially not good at holding him to punishments. So $40 magically disappears from my wallet right when they catch him smoking again and they go through his whole room finding a bunch of paraphernalia and somehow my mom still doesn’t think it’s him who took it and refuses to do anything about it because she “cant prove he took it and doesn’t want to start anything”. I get told to hide my fucking wallet from a thief in the house that I live in. 

Then they catch him smoking AGAIN and take his Xbox so he steals mine- which I bought with my own money when I left for college, the one he uses we all chipped in on 5 years ago- which I had lent to our other brother (17m). I get the Xbox back quickly but the controller is nowhere to be found. So the little shit tries to pin it on our brother who very clearly didn’t lose it. 

I ask thief brother every day for 5 days where he put my controller and he keeps saying “I don’t know where your fucking controller is you probably lost it!”. I keep pestering him and my mom says she “doesn’t want to hear about it anymore” and starts getting cross with me for bringing it up! Then he says “I saw it on the table upstairs, you must have left it there, retard”. So I go upstairs to look for it knowing I absolutely did not leave it anywhere because other brother had been using it. I can’t find it so I tell him to show me where he found it. Lo and behold, he pulls it out from a pile of his clothes on the floor in a common space. It’s missing both the batteries and the back casing and is covered in Cheeto dust and crumbs. Just like all the other Xbox controllers he has. After some yelling and digging through his absolutely fucking filthy room I find the backing. The next day I go to play my Xbox and the controller won’t connect to it. I go into his room and well would you look at that. He’s connected my controller to his Xbox. But yeah, sure, I just left it on the floor in a pile of his clothes. I mentioned it to my mom tonight and she just sighed and said “I’m tired”. So he gets no consequences. Once again. 

Our mom works a really stressful high-level job and is the sole earner for our family. Our dad and thief brother don’t have a great relationship and I’m definitely the favorite child of his so if I go to our dad about stuff like this he yells at my brother until our mom gets mad and then our dad gets mad that our mom is mad. My mom is the only one that can resolve conflicts but she doesn’t want to resolve them and I don’t feel great about putting extra stress on her. 

But I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna kill him if this keeps going on. He came downstairs tonight wearing my underwear! I do my own laundry! Where did he get my fucking underwear!",10May2020,1
340,"I come from a very poor town, that I didn’t even realize was that poor until recently.  I’m 17, most likely suffering from undiagnosed ADHD which has led to an existential depression.  This does not matter anyways because the one doctor I have access to says I do not have it.  I have little to no memory of my educational career.  I have always struggled in math and it has only gotten worse since I started skipping classes about 2 years ago.  The school I’m in now is an alternative school for truants and other deviants.   
People seem to think that I am smart, I agree.  I just can’t nail the things I’m scared of, like math and detail oriented tasks.   I’ve had no help and everything I know is from Wikipedia, Reddit, random chapters of books, television, and intuition.  I also have no willpower or self-discipline. 

I say all of this because I’m scared of failing a placement test or college in general. I applied for a community college because I think it’s a great way to feed my head, but the placement test is giving me anxiety.  I only know a bit of algebra, and I can tell that I should be ahead.

347,"
I’m moving to Baltimore to attend a graduate program at Johns Hopkins this fall. I’ve lived in SF for 4 years now and my entire life is here. 

Some important details: 

1. My boyfriend and I currently live together, so I will not need to sell anything if I don’t want to. He will keep the major furniture (bed, sofa, TVs).

2. I’m only there for a year as the first year of the program is 2yrs of classes and the 2nd year of the program is a residency anywhere in the US, however it’s very likely I will be back in the Bay Area to complete my residency. At this point we will likely move back in together. 

What should I bring with me? I love decorating and making my apartment cozy but I will no longer have an income and will only be there for a year so should I just furnish my apartment with the cheap bare minimum? What makes sense to bring with me other than clothes? My boyfriend does cook (don’t get me started) so all the pots pans silverware are all mine. I have an instant pot and a air fryer that I use atleast 5 times a week- should I get new ones there? I’d say my total budget for furniture would be $1500 max. 

Let me know your thoughts!!",10May2020,1
349,"So this has been about 9 months in the making. I'll try to not be too specific but I think it matters to the situation how this started. So I(F) work for a thrift store as a supervisor, and at this thrift store we have a contract with a large warehouse production company, that if they have people on workers comp, they will send them to our stores to help transition them back into work as 'volunteers'(they are getting paid by their company, just not by us). We get people that come and go all the time, but not without us trying to convince them to come work for us, because I had worked for the other company previously and know how strenuous it is, and they're known worldwide for treating their employees terrible when it comes to this stuff. Well since I've worked at the location I do, we've had two people to come work for us instead. One of these people decided they liked it with us instead and the store manager for whatever reason decided to hire them. They're gone now because they refused to do the job they were given. The other still works for us. Let's call him Jay.
Jay came through the program around August of last year I believe and me, him, and another guy who was through the program as well hit it off quickly with keeping each other entertained while working. We would all talk about anime, games, women(I'm pansexual) and other stuff. Well I'm the ""you tease me, I tease back"", kind of person. Which quickly got the other guy talking about how me and Jay totally liked each other. Well I'm all about teasing but I'm hopeless at reading people and at doing anything when it comes to my own feelings, plus I had, what I thought, was something else in the making(instead I was ghosted), so I really didn't pursue it. On top of that I didn't think there was any way that Jay would ever like me(I have bad self-esteem issues). Well soon after I had convinced Jay to come work for us. I think he started actually working for us late September/early October. We talk all the time about random things and continue to tease each other.
Fast forward to January and I really am crushing hard. Something really shitty happened to me at work and I was really upset and gained the confidence to ask if he wanted to go out to dinner just to get my mind off things. So this day goes down like this; he comes back to the store to pick me up at about 530pm because I don't drive. We sit in his car deciding where to go and get there at about 7. We spend dinner mostly talking about anime and our favorite scenes. We leave at about 745ish, on the way to my house we share some stories about fucked up people we've dated and whatnot. We get to my house and sit in my driveway for 2 hours just talking about random stuff. And by random stuff I mean some very personal sexual conversations. Ant the end of the night I make a statement(while refusing to look at him) asking him if he knew that people ask all the time when we're gonna start dating already(which is real, my coworkers wouldn't leave me alone about it). His response was fair. He said it wouldn't happen because he had done it before at an office job, and after they broke up her next boyfriend was so paranoid that he was gonna try and get back with her and jumped him one day after work.
So I get the not dating coworkers thing but the reasoning behind it is very situational. There's like five other guys that work in out store and they all have barriers. Not that that is a problem for me but it just would never happen for with any of them. And I'm already so shy that I was scared shitless trying to be HIS friend the chances of me even dating anyone else while we worked together if we broke up is very much slim to none. Well I decided I was gonna be bold and give it one last try, and the day before valentines, I got him a few of his favorite things and wrote an extremely heartfelt letter about just trying to give it a chance, and some simple facts/statistics that would help my case, I even had the support of the store manager so that couldn't be a problem. We'll he tells me no but if I hadn't worked with him or been his boss it was a possibility.
Here's where I'm stuck. I took it like a champ and we're pretty much the same as before all that, but even though he said that, and I've had like two months to get my mind off him and be away from him(after a month of being around him before all this but after the confession) I'm still literally dreaming about him even if I haven't thought about him in two weeks. And I'm talking about the type of dreams that don't leave you for at least two days. I'm also in charge of cross training him in depth for who knows how long starting next week.
Any advice, or suggestions are welcome. Is it normal to be taking this long to get over someone? Does my intuition know something I don't? I'm i just helplessly screwed? I've been trying what my best friend suggested of trying dating apps but I just can't get into it.",10May2020,1

I despise people who are better than me in things I am interested in. (But only a little nothing serious.)
Once I get drunk I cannot stop talking and constantly trying to prove myself worthy or better. It really annoys me because, everyone hates that type of behaviour. My friends never admitted they do, but 99.99% of people do hate that behavior. I am fully aware of the face that I can't control myself when I am drunk. So I need to resolve some issues whils sober. I just decreased my attention seeking, but how do I eliminate it? I like drinking and having fun with my friends at club whre I cannot talk, but during parties at home it is terrible.

354,"For context, I have some sort of mental illness, I was diagnosed with moderate depression and generalized anxiety but my therapist thinks it may be bipolar or schizophrenia.

He's now 18 months old and we live together now but during her pregnancy is when things first started to get odd.Her ex was very controlling and basically give her an ultimatum either stay with him and work on things or he just wouldn't be around for their son, she gave in and he became the legal father of my son the day he was born. After he was born it only took her 2 weeks to figure out he wasn't going to change and she started sneaking over to my place so I could spend time with her and my son. About 3 weeks of this and she was ready for out son to meet my family. My family lived about on hour away so our trips down there at the time were very limited. Our 4th visiting our family her ex-husband found one of her old phones and found out she was with me and he kinda went crazy. He longed into her Facebook and started messaging me from both his account and hers. He started calling my phone threatening to kill me and started messaging my family all at the same time. We apologized to my family and rushed back home. After that night she packed a few things to go live with her sister and asked me to come over that night.She had me stay over one night originally but ended up calling to ask me to come back the next night. So I packed some clothes and just kinda never really left. Her sister refused to charge me rent at first but after three months I had officially moved in.Since I've moved in we've had our share of arguments and our up's and downs but things have been good but now I do kinda feel like some of the wounds from everything that did happen during her pregnancy haven't healed idk I still feel hurt and idk how to talk to her about it because it was such a complicated time.Things are still complicated to be completely honest. We can't really share our life on social media because of her ex and his family, their son can't see his dad because as of late he's on a downward spiral and has become even more unstable.We have to completely avoid certain parts of town when her ex is out.

361,"So my ex and i have dated for 5 years and have been separated for a while and we recently got back together and broke up within a month. When we first met he seemed super nice. He told me he loved me one day after meeting. Our relationship basically started out of no where, in which we have never met before n didnt get to know eachother n just started out in a relationship. 2 weeks in he showed signs of jealousy over any of my guy friends and any guy who would talk to me in a normal conversation. Throughout the time we've dated he was always in contact with his ex and multiple girls on instagram. He made me delete mine multiple times. He hit me about a month in, on accident n then afterwards he would continue to hit me when angry, or tell me to hurt myself because he told me i disgusted him. After every abuse i took him back and accepted his apology. After a year of on and off again relations with him, we broke up for 5 months. Then he called n i answered and we got back together. Basically he stopped abusing me physically, but would still tell me to hurt myself if he was upset at me. Ive blocked him everytime and changed my number twice since ive met him but he always found a way to message me through stalking me on instagram, snapchat, or email. He continued to message me every single time on fake accounts telling me how sorry he is and to take him back. I thought he could change because if you want someone or something bad enough you can become a different person by putting in effort. Recently we got together for a month and i decided to end things. He doesnt seem to put effort into seeing me when we are together and makes me hate myself when we are together as well. While we were together i told him i didnt feel close to him and so we started talking about how he feels as though sex is important in a relationship and i agree. I believe sex is a great way to feel closer to one another but i didnt feel comfortable enough to have sex with him anymore so we didnt for about a week. One day i talked to him about it and decided i wanted to try and feel closer to him, so i decided to allow myself to have sex with him again, and while we were having sex he decided to say ""are you sleeping with someone else because you dont feel tight"" i was hurt and automatically told him to get off and take me home. I was crying so much and i felt disgusted of my body and how i allowed myself to try and feel intimate with him when he says things like that. He calls about 300 times every week maybe more. Not exagerating. He doesnt show me anytime of care for my feelings when we're together but whenever we're apart he tells me he's made a mistake, that he feels guilty, that he loves me, and wants to be with me and doesnt want to see a future without me. I know that he cares for me and i feel bad whenever i see him cry but i feel gross being near him and i feel gross even talking to him. When he grabs my arm i cringe and start yelling at him not to touch me because it grosses me out and then he continues, then after 3 or 4 times he stops. He sends me emails to tell me he cant move on and that he loves me. I believe he loves controlling me and being able to manipulate me because i did have feelings for him but he says no he loves me for who i am. I understand that we've gone through a lot of shit together but do you think he loves me for me or just to having control  overmy life again? What do you think i should do?",10May2020,1

363,"My mental health has been plummeting. That is to say, I’m miserable, irritable, constantly thinking about self harm, I’ve been suicidal, binge-ate, stopped eating, lost friends, dropped hobbies, and hurt people I care about. 

I’ve always been the most sweet and loyal person, calm, compassionate, and merciful. 
However I’m now quick to anger, and fast to lash out. I withdraw myself from people and have even cut some people out of my life. I’ve permanently damaged friendships and found myself the villain of the story. 

Jealousy, anger, judgment, and hatred are rising up in me, things that usually aren’t much of a problem. I’ve put other people down and been an asshole lately. 

I have PTSD, depression, and anxiety, so I’m not sure if any of that could set it off. I think all three of them play a role. 
I also come from an abusive home, so I may be starting to imitate my abusers behaviors. 

Also before this spiral happened I had a friend ghost me on all forms of contact and call me a terrible person for no reason. Even though I genuinely did nothing wrong at the time, I believed what he said and have been slowly becoming exactly what he said I was. Maybe it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I also got cheated on by somebody I loved and trusted more than anybody else, and that has damaged me so much it’s not even funny. I loved them with everything I had and they left me for somebody else. I can’t help but see myself as replaceable, and something that nobody will want me after they realize I’m not good enough.

I’m trying to do the right thing but my decaying morals, wisdom, patience, and health is getting tiring. I hate myself so much that suicide seems like the best option. I’ve made plans multiple times lately, thinking everybody would be better off without me. 

All of this self hate is because I can’t stand this new person I’ve slowly become. I want to be the same great guy I was before, that was known for helping and loving rather than anger. 


How do I bring myself back to who I once was, and learn to overcome my self-hate? I feel like the longer I dwell in my self-hatred the worse of a person I become. It’s like my self-hate is making me into the person I don’t want to be",10May2020,1

366,"I am 20M (almost 21!). And I don't know what I'm doing with my life. Formalities aside, this is a big issue that I'm currently dealing with that gives me serious anxiety. 

To give some backstory, I graduated high school 3 years ago. My senior year in high school I joined the national guard thinking it was what I wanted to do. I ended up hating it. I initially thought it was just because being in the military is hard work, but I realize that my fellow soldiers loved every bit of it, even when we got smoked. And I just never felt the same way. 

So I got discharged from the military. I proceeded to go to college at an expensive university for forensics because I thought it was interesting at the time. But once again I grew bored of it and then ended up regretting my decision. I started to perform badly in my classes and hit a really dark place. Long story short I bombed my first semester. 

I tried to shake things up by switching to a small community college just taking general education classes. But after a little while I started to doubt my reason for being there. I realize that all my friends and colleagues that were going were passionate about what they were doing. And I was just going because it's what everyone else was doing. I could never really figure out what I wanted to do or what I was passionate about. 

I moved out of my dorm room and moved back in with my mom. She's been pretty supportive but she's a big advocate for me going back to college, Even though I've stated multiple times that college just isn't for me. 

But now I've hit the point of no return. I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. I have no idea what I want to do. but I know that I don't want to spend the rest of my life in my mom's basement. I Feel like a complete failure. I Just don't know what direction to take or what to do. 

If there's anyone out there who's in a similar situation as me, or just had some good advice, I'd love to hear it. Thanks in advance.",10May2020,1

368,"I miss having a bf. Mostly because I miss having some one to touch sexually. Like surprise him with blow jobs, or rubbing his dick throu his pants when I notice it’s hard, and the feeling of when he randomly sticks his hand down to rub my v. All those little sexual thrills you get. 

But I’m too crude to have a bf, from what I hear. So I guess I’m asking is how the hell do I seem nicer? Or like show that I’m nice? Like I’m nice I just have a hard time showing it and it just feels weird too. Plus I still come off as rude when I’m nice ugh",10May2020,1
369,"Alright to start I will say that in high school I was an average/good student who participated in sports and that always wanted to go to pursue a 4 year college education. I applied to a bunch of schools and and got in all but I believe one or two of the probably around ten schools I applied to. I picked a school and was going to be a civil engineer similar to my father’s and mother’s father’s engineering based careers. I was excited for college, sure nervous, but at the end of the day enthusiastic. I mean hey one of my best friends from high schools  dorm was down the hall from me so I wasn’t really going alone so it seemed like a cake walk. Like I said I always wanted this for myself. The excitement didn’t last long unfortunately. The day after I moved into school I got a text from my older brother and I knew exactly what had happened. Our recently ill grandfather who had been fighting heart problems his whole life had passed away that night before. I had known this man my whole life, hell my parents named me after him, it was hard but I went to the funeral and went right back to school that night thinking it would’ve been what he wanted, he was a really hard worker, no bullshitting. Now back at school things already got worse. My school messed up my schedule ultimately forcing me to drop my English class right off the bat and start my math class 2 weeks late. To make a long story short I became depressed maybe not emotionally but just the stuff like not being able to fall asleep until 4am every night and waking up at 11am every morning. My grades were terrible and I got way out of shape. I became angry or bitter and felt like less than I was. I felt like I had lost my academic skills and I felt like nobody around me could understand me. I ended up not returning to school for the spring semester and worked at what I now see in hindsight was a sub par job, crappy work and minimum wage. I felt like I deserved so much more than that yet felt too stupid for college. Okay so where does all that terribly explained information leave me now? Well thanks to the coronavirus I’m no longer working that bad job and am going to start working at a golf course which I had a great time working at last summer. I’ve been able to clear my head a bit at home in quarantine and now I’m ready to make some money again but I’m still lost. My problem is I have options and I’m afraid I’m going to pick the wrong one. Here are my options. My stepfather and friend in the national guard have been so helpful in expressing that they think I should join the military more particularly the air force which I think could be great: lots of benefits for myself and future family and good pay for my expensive but very important to me hobbies being stuff like cars, bikes, fashion, computers, music instruments, etc. I would also gain lots of discipline and get to travel. Now my second option would be to go back to my college with a new mindset to do it the right way this time, I’d live with my friend who goes there who I mentioned earlier and if I really invest myself in it I know I can do it in a healthy successful way. The only thing that scares me about this is that I will be having a minimal amount of income for hobbies while at college and I would have well a lot of debt to pay off after. If anyone wants to help me understand why I feel the way I do and help me weigh out my options it would mean the world to me. If you have other suggestions besides college or the military let me know. I just want purpose and structure in my life again. 18M",10May2020,1

371,"My boyfriend and I have basically been dating for 3 months but we only made it official a month ago. We facetime every day, for most of the day, and it's honestly been amazing. Every day that we say goodnight I get the urge to say it. Yesterday was our three months (we decided to count before we made it official) and I really wanted to say it. We have already been sending each other cute post basically saying I love you, but we have never said it of our own volition before. I really really want to, I just don't want to rush things. I wouldn't consider us 'still in the honeymoon phase' but maybe we are. I don't want this to just be some spur of the moment thing, I want it to be special. I want it to mean something.

372,"Before I get into this story, I just want to say a few things; This issue takes place on Mobile Legends; probably one of the most toxic games. I also want to say I don’t want a friend to always side with me. Like if I’m wrong, let me know, that’s a true friend to me. My friends will also be referred to characters (they’re fictional) from the game:

Friend in Question: Alice
Close Friend: Hanabi 

So this has happened about three-four times already but I’ll tell the recent one that happened. I was playing MLBB as a support; Estes specifically and this person thought I wasn’t healing and doing my job. Even though I had 10 assists out of the 14 kills my team got altogether. This person was insulting me and such, telling me to go kill myself and you know, typical toxic chat in competitive video games. But the hero who was bullying me was actually in a squad with two other people. His friends join, throwing insults upon insults on me. I did not think about it then because I was too busy arguing with them and focusing on standing my ground but it was basically me vs. three boys bullying me while my friend stayed quiet. Later, we both are in a Discord server and I ended up telling the crazy story to Hanabi in the general chat who wished she was there to argue with them. Then Alice chimes in and says “Yeah I was there, all three of them was attacking her.” 

So I agree and we wait for Hanabi to reply who then asks “Wait, you was there? Did you say anything?” 

After Alice replies no, then she’s like “What? Three people was telling her to die and you just let her take the heat?” I didn’t think about it until HANABI said that. In fact, that’s when I realized Alice does this frequently. A group would attack  her because she isn’t really a good player and is always feeding and I was always there to shut them down. But every time it happened to me, she never says anything and just moves on to another match. I usually wouldn’t really care because maybe she is too afraid to speak up like some people. But she always shut down her friends who are in the wrong. She also defends her other friends who gets bullied in MLBB. Alice never defends me. At all. After Hanabi said that, she leaves the topic saying “I don’t think I would be comfortable letting my friend get bullied like that.” 

This has left me upset and questioning our friendship. I know this probably isn’t a big deal but, I don’t know, this really has been bothering me for three days now. Was Alice in the wrong? Am I overreacting too much? Should I let her fight her own battles because she is very well capable and mind my own business? 

Is she really a friend or am I being dramatic? All advice and opinions are welcomed, thank you.",10May2020,1
373,I have been really hard on myself lately about how I look and it’s starting to effect my health. I feel horrible about myself and my stomach aches all the time. I am not over weight just a little belly but I feel 400 pounds. I need to constantly go to the bathroom to check. I deprive myself food until I can’t take it (around a week) then in the middle of the night I gorge myself until I have the urge to throw up. I have tried to stop but I can’t. I want to exercise but I end up crying and feeling disgusting about myself. My boyfriend has been asking me to send nudes and I hate it. It makes me feel so bad. I hate every one I send. Then he says somethings sometime that just stabs my insecurities. I hate sending them with a passion. He has no clue that I am like this and I’ve hid it the 2 years we were together. Any tips that people have learned about maybe feeling a bit better about myself? Maybe writing prompts or activities? Also maybe telling my boyfriend without going full blast of nuts on him? He is quite a dense lad when it comes to hits. I need to stop but I can’t say no. I have this weird thought about putting others before myself.,10May2020,1

Then, she told me to post a wish on Facebook. And I said, why for? I already wished you just now. And she just started mumbling about I have time playing video games rather than wishing her.

375,"I’m on mobile so sorry for any errors. I don’t know if I should be posting here or under relationship advice but regardless I need help? Over two months ago my mom and I got in a huge fight over me going somewhere during spring break. Idk how to link it but if you scroll down my page it explains the whole situation. Basically my mom told me if I went anywhere for spring break she’d disown me. For some background, I’m 21 and in college paying for it on my own. I more called her out of respect to tell her what I wanted to do and was willing to compromise my plans but I wanted to do something for spring break as I’ve never had trip in college. So what did I do out of spite? I went on a trip with my boyfriend to Tennessee. Haven’t spoken to her at all but I still talk to my dad and brother. Don’t get mad at me, I know it was a dumb decision and I should have self isolated bc coronavirus isn’t a joke. Recently my dad has been calling me to help out with issues regarding our family restaurant and she’s in the background telling him to ask me things. It’s been getting on my nerves and with the stress of finals I’m just very annoyed and I don’t want to deal with them. I don’t know if there’s anyway for me to forgive her unless she sincerely apologizes but hell will freeze over before she does. I also don’t think I should apologize as I did nothing to warrant her being so rude to me. I know she’s trying to protect me but instead of saying it 100x better her logic was to threaten to disown me. I want to go home to see my other family and introduce my cat but I don’t see a way to do that successfully without having to talk to her and I think it will only end badly. I feel like I just have so much anger and resentment built up towards my parents about how they raised me and if anyone brings up the spring break thing then it’s going to become a screaming fight. I was thinking of just ignoring her as I suspect she’d do with me or she’d just be mad about my kitty. Tbh idk what advice I’m trying to ask for. To repair my relationship with my parents? How to go home as it’s been over 4 months? How to just get over it? How to cut off my family? Idk but some advice or just good jokes so I can feel better as I’m feeling rather blue and lonely at the moment with everything happening. It’s not like she can take away my Tennessee trip as I’ve gone and been back and if she disowns me then oh well.",10May2020,1
376,"Last night, I (57F) was in a grocery store.  (Yes, mask, as well as a couple of rubbing alcohol infused paper towels to wipe off cart handles, doors, whatever else.)  I witnessed a manager treating an employee horribly... verbal abuse and she all but admitted entrapment in a way and I really feel like management and/or corporate need to know.

For clarity, the manager will be HB (Horrible Boss) and the employee will be PB (Poor B*stard).

I was bagging some salad-type produce and I became aware of a strident voice, yelling at someone.

HB:  FYI... the trash is to be out of this are by now.

PB:  I...

HB:  FYI... the TRASH is to be OUTTA HERE by now.

PB:  Don't you make announcements about that?

HB:  Yes, every night but I didn't tonight.

This pissed me right off.  She neglected to say anything, yet it's entirely his fault.

Then, as quick as snapping your fingers after screaming three quarters the length of the store at this guy, she guffaws with the two other employees, two young men, whom she was less than six feet away from while her mask was dangling around her neck.  I didn't hear what was said to cause that.

I hate drama, I really do.  I'm too old and tired for it.  But, I had to talk to this guy.  I just wanted to let him know that the only thing he failed to do successfully was read her mind.

He was a large guy, maybe 30-ish.  I figured if he was gonna be okay, he'd just laugh at my observation and that'd be that.

Y'all... he was a *puppy*.  Such a nice guy.  A big, soft guy physically as well as emotionally.  

Me:  Are you who that woman was yelling at about the trash?  (I was probably a little closer than six feet away because I wanted to be quiet but we were both wearing masks and never did get close to each other.)

PB:  You saw that?

Me:  Yeah and I just wanted to make sure you know that the only thing you didn't do correctly was read her mind.  Man, she is *awful*.

PB:  Oh, thank you...

Me:  She even said she didn't make the announcement tonight, yet she's yelling the length of the store at you like it's your fault.  It's not.

At this point, he quietly vented a little.  He didn't tell me anything I couldn't have guessed.  I could tell just by her demeanor that she does it all the time and can become worse.  I honestly don't think she even saw me when she started yelling at him, so confident she seemed in getting away with this behavior.  I doubt she'd have acted differently had our eyes met, even.

As the guy is getting it out, I'm telling him that I just had to let him know that this scene was bullsh*t in an outsiders eyes (too) because I knew that had I been treated that way, I'd have felt like utter garbage for days and I didn't want him taking her load of crap to heart, then home with him.  

I asked if it would help him if I were to call a day shift manager tomorrow.  He nearly swooned and answered affirmatively.  Vigorously.

Also, this conversation last a few minutes.  Toward the end, along comes HB again, this time with her mask placed under her nose.
She reminded PB that he needed to get the lights turned off before a customer strolled up and had to be served since everything was clean and shut down.  

Her being the kind of person she seems to be, I can see her trying to write him up for not shutting the lights off soon enough.  I want it known by the upper management that it was my fault, banking like a well-shot pool ball off of it being her fault for being so nasty. 

So, how do I do this as effectively and safely as I can?  By as safe, I mean how much of my info can I trust the store with?  I want to make sure they know I'm not just a troll or kidding but I also don't want this person (she's like a mid-level mgr) being able to get my info.

Do I call, go there, call corporate, email, what?

TL;DR:  Saw reprehensible behavior from a manager toward an employee and would like to know the best way to make sure something gets done about it.",10May2020,1
377,"Been getting a lot of anxiety past few months about the fear of missing out, haven't been invited to parties for 4 months now and I feel really disconnected from everyone except for close friends.

When I go on snapchat, I always see these people from other schools having fun at night clubs and beaches, I always think to myself ""Damn wish I've been there, all the cool shit, I'm missing out."" And it just got worse overtime, I've grown jealous and felt uneasy with myself when I'm in normal social interactions, always feeling like its not cool enough and not worth my time. People always tell me these cool stories about the time they were in this party or that but when I am there everything just seems normal and often under my expectations, the only true fun I had in those parties were the first times I've been to a nightclub and a party and I didn't have any expectations back then. But the second time I go to those types of events, it just felt blunt or wasn't cool as the first time. 

I came to the realization that the fear of missing out is bullshit, sure you're ""missing out"" on that party, but if I were there things would been nothing out of the ordinary, just a party, alcohol drugs and all that shit. There is always a cost to everything, if I go there and it isn't cool enough to my expectations then I'll feel like I've wasted my time and if I don't go, I would have the feeling of missing out.

383,"Hello everyone, all of this has happened yesterday and today and it feels like so much I just really need advice for this please. Okay to start it off I’m a thirteen year old boy. My sister is 16. And my bro is 19. Yesterday him and my dad were talking and it got heated for a second. Not an argument just a slight disagreement. My mom jumped in and started screaming at him for no reason. This went on for an hour of just intense screaming. Most of that time was my mom telling him to get tf out and to just leave. My dad told both of them they need to get away from each other for a while. Well, my mom goes to the garage and my brother just leaves without anything. I got a text from him about half an hour later saying he loves me and my sis so much and that he’s leaving the city for some hotels and eventually find a place he can reside permanently. I was broken. At this point I started balling at the thought of my brother being gone. I didn’t think my mom could be so heartless to him out in the middle of covid-19. Mind you my mom has been talking about kicking him out to my dad for months now. My brother is a good kid. He payed for all his schooling, tuition, car and car insurance. He had a full time job before he got laid off because of this pandemic. He did one bad thing which was two weeks ago he took shrooms in our house at 12 a.m. and yes he’s an idiot for doing that but he learned his lesson. Anyways my mom has been acting strange sense yesterday. I gave her my Mother’s Day card early to cheer her up and all she said was “hmmm, thanks.” Unenthusiastically. This hurt a little but it’s not the point. So today my dad has been talking to me a lot about how he never meant for my bro to permanently leave just momentarily until things pass. He feels awful and is very upset with my mother. He talked to me today asking how things would be if he and my mom got a divorce. I obviously said yeah as long as my mom has a stable job and a stable house as well. I don’t want her to be on the streets of course. And despite all of the things that have happened I love my mom to bits and would do anything for her, my whole family included in that. I just need advice in this situation please.

Well by the beginning of this year in 10th grade I weighed 216 and now the year isn’t over with and I weigh 157.5 pounds. So here’s my tips for kids my age who struggle to lose weight!
1. Walk everyday.
2. No soda(quit cold turkey)
3. Drink lots of water.
4. Don’t diet, eat whatever you want just less of it if that makes any sense.
5. Running, once your stamina is up enough to alternate from walking to running, you can do this everyday and see results.
6. Push ups.
7. Set realistic goals( example: lose 20 pounds in 2 months)
8. Be confident.
9. Stay focused.
I promise you if you just follow these steps and work hard you can see results, I’ve lost 100 pounds in a years time!",10May2020,1

389,"I don’t know how to start this other than the fact I truly think I have a chemical imbalance in my brain or something. I don’t necessarily want to get on meds but therapy has NEVER worked for me.

I have had some troubles with mental illness over my life. I grew up in a unstable addict household for most of my life. My mom was mentally checked out and my dad abused every drug out there while maintaining a somewhat normal life so now one believed us for a long time. I do know I have trauma from that and have gone to therapy to process it and help me understand it. 

I’ve been in recovery from anorexia for almost 8-9 months now. I tried an IOP program but it didn’t really work for me. I found being around other ED patients I wanted to get worse.

Ever since then, I’ve just had a hard time staying happy. I legitimately feel like I have things to worry about, or to be sad about, but not as crushingly depressed as I consistently am. I cry 4-5 times a week over extremely minor things. I would say previous to quarantine I was getting upset a little less but not much.

My brain just can’t turn off. I tend to over analyze things and never can just turn it off (unless I’m high, which I hate doing because I hate being reliant on any drug, even something as tame as weed). 

I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal, but i would say I’m passively suicidal. Never do I plan my death but I do often think about it. 

It’s hard for me to be fully positive. I honestly feel like with every extreme high is an extreme low.

I know I need something to change. This runs in my family but I’m quite at a loss of what to do. But i am so tired of being so god damn depressed about everything. My life has MASSIVELY improved over the last few years. I hold an adult job, go to college, have no worries about debt, live on my own, etc. Theres nothing TO BE upset about but at the same time there is everything to be sad about.

Here's my problem:

I live in a rural community and we very rarely even get a car to drive by at night.. but for the past few nights something strange is going on. A vehicle with a flashing yellow light, such as an emergency one on the top of a vehicle, comes to my driveway and slowly drives by our houses and through our driveways. I can hear them nearby for 20 minutes driving, so I'm assuming they're doing this to others as well.

Can anybody answer this or give me some explaination as to why this is happening?

I really doubt it's the government or anything, since this is happening at 3:30 AM sharp every night.

Any help would be appreciated to answer this question as I think it's some sort of thief or criminal. Thank you!",10May2020,1
391,I feel like toilet brushes are better than toilet paper. I do t know why it’s just something about the toilet brushes that make my butt feel nice. It may take a while to clean me but it feels SOOO much better than toilet paper some of my family members say that I’m insane to do so and others call me sick. I get bullied at school for using the brush but I tell them to try and they say no that that’s gross I don’t know why it would be gross. I mean it feels amazing I know if other people try it they would like it but since basically everyone in the world thinks otherwise they say it’s not normal. And it’s also better because after your done you could just wash it off.,10May2020,1
392,"So, my (21m) girlfriend’s(20f) mom just had a biopsy of a mass in her left breast done, and she’s waiting on the results to come in. Cancer runs heavily in their family, so there’s at least a little bit of a chance it’s metastatic breast cancer. My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years, lived together for two, and have 2 dogs and a new travel trailer that we bought together. With everything that’s going on, we’re both out of work for a while, but have filed for unemployment. If this test comes back positive, she wants to move closer to her mom which is completely understandable. The only issue is that unlike Oregon, Southern California doesn’t have very many RV parks. The ones that I’ve been able to find are around $1,000+/month for a space, and job availability is sparse down there right now. What should I do?",10May2020,1
393,"Okay so someone started following me on social media a couple of months ago. We started talking about mutual interests etc and we we're semi-friends??? I think. But 2 days ago they just unfollowed me and they didn't respond to a dm I sent them. They still post tho. 

We didn't have an argument or anything. It just happened randomly. 

I still follow them tho, but should I unfollow them too? It seems like they don't want to interact anymore and I don't wanna upset them but they won't even answer a ""hey how are you"" so I don't even know what I did wrong. 

They didn't block me tho so I really don't know what to expect? Like, if I did something wrong that annoyed them so much they stopped talking to me they would block me right? 

Like I get that I'm overthinking this

So far, what I've been doing is staying up all night and the sleeping during the day, going in the backyard (I haven't been able to as much because it's been getting really hot), or hiding out in closet-forts that my brother and I have built because our parents can't get into them.

I can't bring myself to try and make friends because I don't see it going anyway good. I'm a huge cynic because of experience. I don't bother with relationships, never had one, only been used, and never want one even. Just the very occasional feeling of wanting one, but then it's so little it doesn't push me to make an effort. It's like I've been subconsciously damaged. I won't say I'm suicidal, but, I really don't have anything I'm living for. 

I no longer care what people think about me or if I'm a loner, but I personally have no real zeal or goal. I'm just living as the days come. I'm not an intentional loner. I've tried being social, but every time I'm accepted, it's to be used. No one is genuinely interested in hanging out. So I'm more of an unintentional loner. In fact, most times I'm accepted for their amusement. More reason why I've stopped caring what people think about me. It just gives me suicidal thoughts.

397,"Hello everyone,

As the title says I am admin, for work,  of a FB/ig page, which has disappeared over night. The page was pretty big, with lots of money spent on adv through the years and over 800.000 people following. 

No one received warning from Facebook (for infringement or whatever). Editors have been removed and admins (3 people) were removed and our personal accounts suspended too. Now they asked me for a copy of ID and I'm waiting for review. The page can't be found anymore. 

Has anyone experienced something similar, does it look like it was hacked or taken down?

Since I have no access to my personal account, I can't go to business manager where they supposed to help ""paying pages"" and I can't find anywhere else how to speak to Facebook and ask about this!

Hope to find some help here...

398,"I live with my girlfriend and her family comes over a lot. I’m cool with her family and like them most of the time but they are the type that talks a lot of shit, likes to crack jokes and start unnecessary drama. I would describe myself as a composed quiet person that likes to keep to himself but I do have an edge to me that doesn’t like to be messed with. 

Sometimes her family goes a little too hard on cracking jokes because I’m the quiet one of the group that doesn’t say much but I always just stay composed and try to let it slide. I also know that when I do decide to say something I don’t hold back and I’m worried that I might take it too far. I’m starting to get bothered by some of the shit they say because they’re talking about me like they really know me as if they’ve been around me their whole life and try to clown on me for being quiet and it’s starting to piss me off. They’ve only known me a couple years and have no idea that I just keep my mouth shut most of the time out of respect for my girlfriend because otherwise I would have let them have it a long time ago.

399,"Hi there Reddit! Due to our ages, me and my boyfriend do not live together and are quarantining separately with our families. He went through some trauma in middle school and early high school and shows significant signs of PTSD (most prominently night terrors and flashbacks), but has never been diagnosed. When he experiences episodes of shaking and talking in his sleep, I am there to hold him and soothe him. Our regular hangouts helped keep him happier and made his emotional state a lot better. 

With school stress, loneliness, and lack of any physical touch, he has gone downhill from when we used to hangout. I am a huge believer in social distancing and am terrified of the virus, so naturally I refuse to visit him for the safety of both of our families. 

How can I help him? How can I make this easier for the both of us? I don’t want our physical safety to come at the cost of his mental well-being :(

401,"I'm 25 and I still live in my parents' house and share a room with my 22 year old brother. He's a university student, I work.

I want to move out because I want to have a private place to live in. He's in the room all day, especially now during the covid crisis. There is no other place in the house I can be alone.

But moving out would mean that over 50% of my monthly pay would go towards rent. I don't know if that's worth it. Especially since I have a job that seems stable but I'm not sure if I'll be able to perform well enough to keep it long term. So there is a risk that I'll have to get a less paying job in the future, meaning 2/3 of my pay could be going towards rent.

412,"This is a long one, TL;DR at the bottom

i’ll have to give out some context beforehand:

I’m a highschool aged Swede living in the Netherlands, i’m also epileptic and diagnosed schizophrenic, so you can imagine that school is pretty hard for me. In Dutch highschools, there are ”levels”. The higher level you are, the more intelligent you are in the school’s eyes.

Last year my grades weren’t the best and my attendance was rare. That had to do with the fact that i was constantly having seizures, had to miss out on a lot of school to get medical help, and my psychotic episodes were at a peak worst. I was trying my best to study.
Instead of only bringing me down a level or making me repeat the year, the school decided to do both. Make me repeat at a lower level. From what i read, that isn’t even legal.

Sounds reasonable? A lot of kids that had even worse grades than me or intentionally missed out on school got better treatment. My mom was really sketched out and decided to make me move schools.

Fast forward to this new school and the new school year, my grades are now one of the top best (i was in the same year but lower level, so i already knew the material pretty well) but medically, i got worse.
In the span of three months i was once again having uncontrollable seizures, was put in a psych ward due to attempted suicide, and tested positive for corona which left me bed bound, in near critical condition and isolated for a long while.
My school told me that if i did not complete 15+ assignments, tests, etc. until 15 May, i will be moved to an even lower level, which won’t allow me to pursue my dream job.
I begged and cried to my school to let me get one more month to prove that i really have the dedication to study and said that i can’t control my health, but they won’t budge for now.
I’m seriously considering suicide again, i don’t know what to do.


TL;DR: Dutch school is fucking me over, my health is getting in my way of graduation",10May2020,1

416,"I just want to put a disclaimer on this, I have always been very grateful to my parents and have never felt like they owed me anything, this whole situation just makes me upset. 

Okay, so I am a 16 year old girl, and my parents wont buy or help me with a car. So this whole story starts with my aunt wanting to give me her car, she lives very far away and said I could have it if I fly to her and drive the car back. A few weeks later she calls me and says the engine is failing and that the car is basically dead. So I’m obviously pretty disappointed. Next, my grandpa dies and leaves my two older brothers a brand new truck. My two older brothers go to college and are living together next year, but neither them have jobs or do anything at school, so this truck is basically just going to sit there until they need to drive it home. This is the part that makes me especially upset, I came to my parents trying to negotiate a car and they completely shot me down. (I feel this this is the part where some of you will call me entitled) I’ve always had the best grades, we are from the east coast but live in the midwest and I am the only hope that will go to a good school on the east coast and move back there, and both of my brothers have bad grades and both have been on academic probation before at college. I had a job before both of my siblings, I started working the minute I turned 15 because my parents didn’t want to fund my social life and they didn’t want to buy me clothes anymore. My parents still shell out spending money for brothers and pay for all their clothes, while neither of my brothers work. When my oldest brother got his license, my dad went and bought a new car so that my brother could drive himself and my other brother around. My brothers are only a year behind each other in school so both of them always had rides from each other. Both my parents work full time jobs, so they can’t drive me anywhere, I do lots of stuff after school, I have a job, and I have a social life. I thought this was unfair and my parents really don’t care and say that’s what I get for being the youngest. I just want them to meet me halfway for a car or something, it’s just unfair to me that my brothers were handed a car in high school and college and now that I need a car, they find the idea of helping me buy a car funny and they just straight up make fun of me and say I will never be able to save enough money to buy something decent. 

My family is comfortable, both my brothers go to college, my parents have good jobs, new cars, and we live in a nice house. Its not like my parents are struggling, they could at least help me pay for a car. 

And before you guys ask why I hadn’t been saving money when I first got my job, my dad had promised me a car back then, so I’d have to start saving right now. 

Please give me some advice! Thanks in advance",10May2020,1

419,"So I (24F) been dating my bf (23M) for about 2 years. We have lived together since January and are quarantining together. 

I HATE dirty dishes, but I’m okay leaving them in the sink for a night or two occasionally if we’re too tired/lazy to wash them after eating. I also hate leaving my kitchen messy and dirty for longer than a couple days. He doesn’t care. He will touch raw meat and then rinse his hands for 2 seconds without soap and then go and touch other things. Or sometimes even not wash his hands at all. When he washes dirty dishes, he doesn’t use soap unless I tell him to, which I find disgusting. And when I tell him to use soap, he gets mad. He also doesn’t fully clean the dishes.. and we are staying at my parents house right now so I would appreciate it if he actually put some effort in to clean. 

I have also made every meal for the past week by myself and asked him to help, but he just says “you can’t handle making dinner alone? That’s too overwhelming for you?” and calls me incompetent. I can of course handle making dinner on my own but it’d be nice if he would fucking help sometimes. I can’t trust him to do anything on his own. I can’t trust him to wash dishes without me checking them after he’s done. I can’t trust him to cook raw meat I can’t trust him to help me. He knocked over a bag of trash earlier and just walked by it instead of picking it up. We use coasters on the nicer tables in my house and I have told him about 20 times to use one, but he still never does. If I ask him to handle grilling the steak while I cook the rest of the dinner, he sometimes says yes but then will FaceTime friends or go on his computer and doesn’t even pay attention to the steak and then it gets overcooked. I just feel like I’m babysitting and that these are all simple, normal adult responsibilities that he can’t handle. And I feel like I’m the one doing all the cooking and cleaning. 

Ok Sorry that was a rant.. those are just a few examples, there are plenty more. 

How do I explain to him that this is not cleanly? He thinks I’m being ridiculous and overreacting but I wish I could find some science that says you need to clean your dishes to get bacteria off. Idk I thought it was common sense but maybe I am overreacting or something. 

TLDR: my bf doesn’t care about cleaning dishes thoroughly enough to remove all the food. He doesn’t care about cleaning his hands after touching raw meat. How can I help him understand that he needs to be more careful and clean? Especially since we are at my parents house right now.",10May2020,1

421,"Getting straight to the point, I’m feeling conflicted over whether or not I should back out of potential relationships just because someone I know likes the person that I want to ask out too. 
The past couple of females that I’ve liked have all been connected with my friends or people I know in one way or another, and whenever I’ve brought it up with my friends within the circle about my feelings towards said female, one of them has come out and told me that they feel the same way too. Now, usually, the case is that they’ve known the person for longer. So, I generally tend to feel guilty for ever even having the feelings, as it makes me feel like I’m betraying my friends in some way if I were to follow through with them. I tend to just let them make their moves instead, and don’t ever really get a chance to tell the girl how I feel as I don’t wanna break the “bro code” even if it doesn’t work out between the two, if that makes sense.
The pattern has been repeating itself for a while now, and it’s starting to make me think; should I really just keep letting my feelings be thrown away because I don’t want to hurt the people around me? Or should I worry more about myself, and pursue relationships regardless about how the people around me think? 
If I could get you guy’s advice on this, I’d really appreciate it.",10May2020,1
422,"I'm a 24M who live with my Mother and my little sister who is six years old. We live in Canada while our Dad works in a different country most of the time during the years. Recently I've noticed some alarming traits in my Mother's relationship with my sister and her ways of parenting in general. To give you guys a little bit context, My Mom puts lots of time and effort on my Sister's education, in fact her entire life revolves around taking care of her and making sure she gets the best education. My Sister goes to private school and on top of this also takes lots of extra curriculum classes outside of school, which includes the study of our home language, English reading comprehension, Math, Violin, Dancing, computer coding and a bunch of other bullshit.

Things start to go wrong when the whole mess started and my Sister had to take all of her classes online at home. My Sister usually enjoyed these classes when they were face to face and have other kids around, and she really hates sitting in front of an ipad and interacting with teachers who are not physically present. So a few days into this online class mess she started to lose patience and constantly refused to attend class, or run away from her room during the middle of the classes. Now i believe anyone with a right mind and common sense can understand why a Six-year-old kid would hate online classes, and would let the kid off the hook if she really hates it. No, not for my Mom. She sees it as a ""deterioration of behavior"" and ""loss of concentration"" and blames it on me for introducing Pokemon games to her. She forbids my sister to play pokemon game with me, and scolds her hysterically when she shows reluctance on attending online classes. Now I believe there's a distinction between parents who adopt strict parenthood for their kids' own good, and parents who are strict on their kids because they project their self-worth solely on their kids. It is more and more clear to me that my Mom is the latter. For her my sister is the major source of self-esteem for her, and she has massive mood swing depends on my Sister's performance at school. She's happiest person on earth when my sister finishes her homework quickly or gets praised by teachers in school, and she can be frighteningly hysteric when my sister does not meet her education standard, she would start banging doors, and yelling at her face. This pattern of behaviors is becoming more and more evident and severe and I'm worried about my Sister's well being.

I'm no expert on parenting but I can tell that yelling at a six years old girl and force her to do things she doesn't like is not helpful and appropriate. Now I've raised this point to her multiple times and tried to talk some sense into her, but every time she takes it as a personal attack and gets incredibly mad. My Mom has been mentally unstable and depressed for years and honestly I don't think she's got the right mind to parent a kid. I've tried to help her and to get her back on track, but she's too stubborn to take in any of my words and insist that she's mentally healthy. I recently graduated from my University and will move to a different city for work this September. I'm really worried to leave my Mom alone with my sister, since the major source of her mental sickness is loneliness and disconnection from the real world, and I really don't know how she can remain sane when me and my Dad are not present with her most of the time.",10May2020,1
423,"Myself and the other half are having a massive falling out over our neighbor (77 YO) complaining about our noise levels in a semi-detached house with walls which you can faintly hear voices on the other side (if they had a deep voice).

My other half wants to play music from their speaker bar in the garden when the sun is out for a couple of hours every week or so. She is mindful however that their volume is at a level in which you have a normal conversation without having to raise your voice and it is not before 7am or after 11pm (typically afternoon time).

With that said, our neighbor will complain that the noise is still far too loud and that she has to close her conservatory windows/doors and is still able to hear it.

Because of this, my other half feels paranoid that she is being too loud and cannot be comfortable in her own home. Bear in mind, that there is a lot of stress going on outside of the home, so she wants to feel comfortable in our house.

I'm stuck in the middle, I don't want to have bad relations with my neighbor but at the same time, I want my other half to feel comfortable in our home. To be sure that our music wasn't too much of an issue, I investigated myself and closed all doors to the garden, put on the TV and it was fine, I could not hear a thing, however, my neighbor says that they had to put their TV on ""97"" to be able to hear it. I'm also aware that my neighbor could be picking faults in order to maintain a totally quiet house (but I'm sure that this is me being cynical). 

I'm struggling to find a solution for both my other half and my neighbor, here are two solutions:

1) **Completely on gf side -** Tell the neighbor that music in the garden at a level where you can have a casual conversation is fine, especially on a bank holiday (VE day). So they are just going to have to suck it up and put up with it - it's not like we do this every day? just every 1-2 weeks (nice weather etc.). 

2) **In the middle (compromise) -** Go to the neighbor's and say that we will turn it down to an even quieter volume and ask to hear it for ourselves to judge if it's too loud on their part. (they could have hard furnishing which can amplify the sound, so I'm told).

3) **Completely on the neighbor's side -** Tell gf that we should instead use wireless headphones to listen to music. If the neighbor can hear our music that's a step too far.

Any advice, would be appreciated, thanks.",10May2020,1

425,"I’m 20 years old, and my brother is 17 years old. Is it normal for my parents to have clear favorites? My parents and I used to have a rocky relationship when I was about 14 years old. I used to call my parents bad names and break things around the house. Eventually, my parents sent me to boarding school for three years. Since then, I stopped misbehaving. I’m polite to my parents and help out around the house. My brother is not that helpful, and he spends most of his time isolated in his room and struggles with school, which is why I’m puzzled by the favoritism. When I’m around my family, I feel like an outsider because my parents are much warmer towards my brother. This gap in our relationship began developing when I went to boarding school. Because of these preconceptions, my parents side with my brother when they do not know what’s going on. For example, my father yelled at me for my brother's racket downstairs at night, even though I had not gone downstairs the entire night and was reading a book. Fortunately, my father realized this mistake and was sincere. Unfortunately, similar instances keep occurring.
At boarding school, I did not see my parents for months, and we were hundreds of miles apart. To connect with my parents after boarding school, I have been trying to relate by engaging in their interests. For example, I was reading their favorite books and classical music. I have also tried to make them proud, for instance, by getting a solid 4.0, completing a marathon, and joining the SGA. None of these bridges the gap. I’m starting to feel that this is all in vain. Therefore my questions are how best to bridge the gap in our relationship and get rid of the preconceived notion of being the problem child?",10May2020,1
426,"Feeling unwanted in my relationship

Need some advice on how to handle a situation. Been in a relationship for 3 years which is pretty great, we get on well and share a lot of interests. We live together and have fun when we go out together.

However, for the last 6 months or so I’ve been feeling so unwanted by my SO. He makes me feel loved but I don’t feel wanted. He doesn’t tell me I’m beautiful or sexy and I always seem to instigate sex, and on the rare occasions he does, it isn’t passionate like he’s not tearing my clothes off, more like we’re just lying in bed.

I’m quite good looking, he’s really good looking, but this just makes me feel so insecure and ugly like he’s not attracted to me.

I’ve brought this up with him more than once and it ends in an argument. He says the way that I feel is in my head and not to do with him, he’s never said he finds me unattractive so it’s my fault I feel like that. He doesn’t seem to get that every now and then I just need to be built up by him and feel like I’m sexy and attractive.

I’m not sure what more I can do here, he hates it when I try to talk about it. Generally, the relationship is happy but I’m not sure I can sustain feeling so unwanted even though I feel loved and we have a lot of fun together.

427,"If you want to skip the backstory an profiles, scroll down to TL;DR

FRIEND is a 26 year old guy who I've known for 15 years. We have been best friends throughout high school and beyond. He was socially awkward and bullied a lot, so I was there. As he grew, he became a bit more withdrawn into the world of gaming and now spends every waking hour at his PC, in his bedroom of his mother's house. He neglects his own health, hygiene and sleep, doesn't go outside for anything other than the work commute and picking colleagues up to taken them home, even if he wasn't on shift. He's selfless in many ways, but it almost seems the root of that is self loathing. He ""won't change until [he] gets a girlfriend"", but the catch 22 is that he's not doing anything about finding love or helping himself.

Now his MOTHER is anywhere in the neighborhood of 50 and 55 years old. After an abusive relationship with FRIEND's father, she broke it off and lives alone with FRIEND. She caters for his every need, because he won't look after himself. She will cook his dinners and do his washing, because he won't. She will often ask him to help with chores, but he either complains, tantrums or straight up ignores her. Once in a blue moon, he does a chore. MOTHER can be a bit nagging because of this and definitely has a tendency to talk a bit too much, so I can see why FRIEND would try to escape the conversation, from his perspective.

Recently, MOTHER fell from a ladder and broke her arm and damaged the nerves in her leg. She's now on a single crutch and an arm cast. She's nigh helpless and yet, FRIEND does very very little to help her. 

Now I consider myself to be FRIEND's best friend and have been there for him through everything, but by extension, I have also done the same for MOTHER. I text her regularly and we call to chat. As we speak, I am organising to drive 100 miles to collect a parcel for her. I've helped that small family countless times physically, emotionally and financially. In return, when my relationship collapsed and I was forced out of my home, MOTHER gave me a roof over my head. FRIEND didn't show his face to me once during that time.

So now we reach today.

What can I do to help FRIEND come out of this constant rut? How can I get him to look after himself? How can I, by extension, get him to look after his own mother? Is there someone I can speak to, an expert perhaps? What advice can I give MOTHER?

Best but employees do not earn commission. Our sales numbers are tracked but they really focus on credit card application and they typically get pretty upset when you’re below average for the month, especially with one of our managers who isn’t the nicest guy. It’s not necessarily policy to offer a card when you can tell a customer is questioning the purchase financially, but it’s a good way to get fired if you purposefully avoid offering it, and they will know you are. Now I’m only in high school, but Id say I know a fair share of good financial strategies and the do’s and dont’s and one of the number one things you should 100% avoid is irresponsible use of a credit card or owning one in general. One may say that some applicants are aware of the pros/cons of a credit card or they may be aware of what they’re doing, but I can say with 100% certainty that not a single customer that I have had apply for a card cared about the consequences of having a credit card or making minimum payments, etc. I love my job and it’s great to help people decide what computer to purchase or answer any other questions, but it’s very tough to keep handing out these life ruiners like candy to vulnerable people.",10May2020,1

I have a narrow social circle with my family members &amp; 3 best friends. I don't go out much except for work and music lessons.

444,"I had been dating my girlfriend for 8 months. She’d never felt this way about a guy ever, she constantly bragged to her family about me and posted me on social media how much she loved me. She had everything that I would want in a girlfriend: caring, supportive, athlete, family loving, good sense of humor, and i’m 6’5” so her being tall is very compatible. We saw each other three times a week, facetimed a lot, usually her calling, even though we are on very busy schedules- I am an engineering student, she's a Division 1 swimmer. I treated her well and fulfilled her needs but I didn't break my bank account for her if that makes sense.

After her college swim tournament ended in a different state, the guys and girls team had a party in the hotel rooms with alcohol involved. We had just said our goodbyes for the night, I knew she was going to celebrate, but the boundaries we have are exclusivity. I can’t control her and worry about what she does when i’m not around. When I was out with friends, I had heard from one of my girl friends on the team that she was drunk and was hitting on guys trying to hook up. I brushed it off, didn't believe it, and just went about my night with my buddies.

Anyway, they landed back in LA the next day and she called me about 20 times over the course of 4 hours. When i called her back at nighttime, she was just bawling her eyes out and admitted to cheating on me. I didn’t say anything after that. I was devastated. I just let her keep talking and eventually hung up. I couldn't sleep at all that night. The morning after, she texted me saying “i’m broken to pieces because i ruined something so good” and “I was falling in love with you and the consequence of what I did is one I will never forget.” I went no contact. That made her feel even more devastated. Her roommate said she was skipping classes and crying a lot. I couldn't describe the way I felt. She’s roommates with my best friends girlfriend and she was 100% on my side and despised her completely. My ex went on to call her a shitty friend for telling the truth. My ex continued to send notes back to me in my clothes from her dorm, confessing her love to me and all this other stuff to try to get my attention.
Now, this part I completely regret doing, and this may have cost me the friendship of my best friend of years and his girlfriend (my ex's roommate). After three weeks of not responding to her, I gave in and discussed the possibility of mending things and possibly seeing her when she came back to school in the fall. I told her she lost my trust and will have to let me do whatever I want if she wants me to give her any attention or any possible ""second chance"" down the road. She hit me up occasionally and I didn't prioritize getting back to her because of school and she got mad because I ""didn't want it as much as her"". I explained that giving me time is not too much too ask for after what she did. Last Sunday, she called me up and we talked for about ten minutes, I joked with her about a few things that she did not find funny at all.
The next morning, she gave me a long text about how my intentions are wrong and i'm only talking to her to play her and get back at her. Then, she went on say I lied about little things all the time during the relationship. First time she ever mentioned that. The only response I gave is that you can't even compare the two and that she's deflecting. She went on to attack my character and say something like ""its really a character issue and I just want to know why you lie so much."" The last thing she said, to which I did not reply, is ""You can't blame me for needing to think about this first. I don't necessarily want to be with someone who lies about everything. Like I am sorry but just speaking what im thinking here"" She says that after she cheated and lied about it, lol. She lied about the cheating. She said she got really drunk and kissed someone else on accident.
This last part is a very important part of this message. My best friend and girlfriend have completely abandoned me and lost respect for me for talking to my ex again. Also, my best bud met with me and pointed out that I exaggerated and lied about little stuff over the last few years, adding fuel to the fire, and said he can't be close friends with me anymore. I really regret my decision to talk to my ex after she showed her true colors. I was just so hurt and confused, I gave myself time to think about it and felt that giving her a chance to earn my trust back in the fall, while I explore other options in the summer wasn't a bad idea. Was it selfish to go against what my friends wanted or is it my choice what I choose to do in my relationship? Now, I've lost a best friend, who thinks I am a pussy, his girlfriend who thinks that I betrayed her after she turned against my ex for nothing... 


My heads been hurting every second of every day thinking about this. I really want my friends back and want to know the best way to end things with my ex. I gave her an opportunity to talk to me again, and after a couple weeks, she pins me for lying occasionaly about insignificant things. So that's over.

What would i do with $10k? Even tho im working and making an income, it doesnt get me much ahead, just to get along. I could pick a job that pays more, but its difficult due to these events happening in the world right now. $10k is an amount that would let me fully concentrate on improving my mental state and hopefully bring and give back value to people.

I have been working on my disorder, written down many aspects about food, thought process, things/activities to avoid, triggers etc. Im trying to stay aware about tics and what/when triggers them. There is no cure as they say, however i believe there is cure for everything, its just not found yet. So thats what im trying to work on, make a guide or write a book about it. $10k would give me freedom and full focus to do it as i could actually quit my job and do something that would hopefully benefit other people as well.

It's hard enough to get work done as it is, since I feel I never have enough time, but with my dad constantly needing something, it breaks my whole work flow, and I end up snapping at him and my mom even though I don't mean too, it's just that it's so stressful trying to juggle both without fucking up my studies or neglecting him and when I get hot headed I just feel like shit afterwards.

I've become such an angry person lately, some times it feels like I'm just a ball of stress waiting to unload, I always feel erratic and I just know things would be so much easier to handle if I kept a clear head at all times and focused on the things that needed doing instead of being irritated and overwhelmed all the time.

Anyone have any tips or advice for my situation.",10May2020,1
449,"So since the beginning of March(?), my entire workplace was sent home.  However, to be honest, my job doesn't have much to do (since my work is more people oriented). In terms of what I'm required to do, I am doing fine, and then some. 

So with my work done early, I'm finding myself on the computer play video games a lot.  I'll be on from the afternoon until midnight.  Quite frankly, I really enjoy it and I feel like I'm getting pretty good.  I've even met some friends that I play with. I'll take breaks throughout the day (go for brief run, cook or run errands). But I'll get back on the game right after.  So after a while, Ive been feeling... Idunno...Guilty...? I just don't feel right. It just feels like I'm wasting my life away. Part of me says I'm just trying to pass the time... 

I guess I was just used to the 9-5pm grind, and playing games (bc I have nothing else better to do) just feels weird.

459,"**Introduction** 

My father moved abroad to England with next to no personal assets and has worked 50+hrs a week for 30+yrs while being married to my schizophrenic mother as well as simultaneously raising 5 children. Most of whom are undisciplined and unable to look after themselves as he was stretched so thin parent-ally. One child has developed severe mental illness but seems to have improved fairly. While another seems to be developing mental illness currently. My father has managed to pay off the mortgage for the house and has a decent level of savings. He is now completely exhausted, mentally and physically. I am not sure how much more he can withstand until he completely breaks.

**Background On The Family** 

**Mother**

My mother has quite severe schizophrenia, she believes that my father is an \`imposter\` and that my real father had died long ago and had been replaced. Over the years, she has attacked my father on multiple occasions on levels that pose a real threat to his health. This is a threat that is multiplying as he ages, he is currently 60yrs of age. She also verbally and mentally harasses/abuses him over pointless things. He has always stuck by her, hoping her condition would improve. And that she would at least accept him. Currently, he is not even able to sleep in the same bed as her, due to feeling unsafe. There is not a lot of extra space in the house, and so now he does not even have a proper room to himself to seek respite. I offered my room, but he does not accept - as I need to study for university. Understandably, he wants the best for me, this is just in his nature.

**Fourth Eldest Brother** 

To make matters worse, my fourth eldest brother who is mentally ill, has returned home looking for refuge. Previously he had left the house and had been living in hostels or been homeless. At the peak of his mental deterioration, he had entered a completely catatonic state. He had been storing his urine in plastic bottles, for unknown reasons, and had neglected his own personal health and therefore the health of my family in consequence. As mentioned before, there is a lack of proper space, and so the two are sleeping in inadequate arrangements downstairs in the living room/spare room. Currently, he poses no threat in terms of violence, although he has in the past and had also hurled massive amounts of mental abuse towards my father. At the moment he is providing no cause for concern, although this will not last indefinitely.

**Third Eldest Brother** 

On top of this, my third eldest brother in his early to mid twenties seems to be deteriorating mentally also. He has been completely isolated for the past few years in relation to family and recently to his friends. Before, me and my other brothers were possibly naive and or ignorant to his mental health. It is quite clear that he some level of mental illness now. He spends his time and money smoking weed alone in his room and acts hostile to me and my brothers and is extremely withdrawn. He had been working and can somewhat look after himself, although his personal hygiene is quite hideous. He will not communicate with any of us properly, and quite frankly, he makes me feel very uncomfortable.

**The Rest Of The Family** 

Besides those two brothers, there are three more including myself, all of whom I would consider sane. The eldest brother is fully self sufficient. He had been working full time before hand and can completely look after himself. The issue arises that he would like to move in with his long time girlfriend ideally and start his own life but I know he will not press the issue. Ideally I would like for him to like with her though if possible. But this is not likely as he must contribute economically to the household to look after my family. As well as maintain what order there is left. The second eldest brother is extremely irresponsible and is currently in a large amount of debt, which is simply becoming worse due to the current climate. But he is otherwise self sufficient.

**Myself** 

I am the youngest of the five siblings, almost 20 years of age. Currently, I am studying Sports Therapy at University and am nearing the end of my 1st year. It is quite enjoyable although I honestly find it bizarre how many individuals there are who seem to have no interest in higher education. I have made some good friends and have some decent memories. I consider myself academically competent, but I lack intrinsic motivation and am not particularly industrious. 

Characteristically, I am introverted, and am becoming even more introverted, perhaps understandably. I enjoy my own company, I like to play video games. I do have friends, but I find it difficult to make many friends. I attempt to avoid any unnecessary drama and so prefer less friends generally. But admittedly I can feel quite lonely sometimes. I have never been in an intimate romantic relationship, and I do not think now is a good time to enter one to be fair. I have a fairly strong relationship between my two eldest brothers. I am not particularly close to my father. I do not have many memories of him as a child. In the past I held a lot of frustration towards him. But as I have become older, I completely understand. We do not really talk that often, in terms of small chat. Quite honestly we do not have much in common. But every interaction he has had with me, has been overwhelmingly positive. In relation to attempting to make sure that I am heading in the right direction. I have not quite understood this in the past, but I am completely aware now. He holds unconditional love for everyone in his family and feels as though it is his duty to do whatever he can in order to improve their standard of living, without acknowledgement of the possible degradation of his own standard of life. I suppose this may be seen as naive. Personally I hold nothing but respect for him nowadays.

**Thinking About The Future** 

Looking towards the future. My father requires some rest. He has waited for my mother to accept him as his husband, but this has never come to fruition. He will retire soon, he will be unable to look after the family economically. I am not sure if my eldest brother can become the \`man\` of the household. I worry financially for my family. My father deserved to be looked after well. At the moment there is not really anywhere for him to stay in a comfortable arrangement. He would like to go back to his home country where he owns a decent house in the future permanently or on a temporary vacation. The issue being he would be alone and the country is dangerous in comparison to England, especially for someone who is relatively rich as he would be there and he would get lonely. Not to mention the current quarantine. I want to live an independent life. I want my other brothers to also. But realistically, my 4th eldest brother and my mother will always require economic assistance. As well as living assistance. 

**Conclusion** 

How can I assist to enable my father to enjoy the remaining years of his life?

The main issue is this: he may not have space to live at home safely in the future where he would be cared for. He is also unable to return home alone and look after himself as an elderly man. There is also the issue of his retirement - he is hesitant to retire; as he is unsure if the bills can otherwise be paid for. I do not think my mother even receives any income from the government even though she is completely incapable of looking after herself.

I am sympathetic for the rest of my family, especially those who are suffering mentally. But my father is the most selfless man I have personally interacted with; if I was him, there would be a real possibility that I would have abandoned the family. My father deserves some rest, especially when he is too old to look after himself. 

I have contemplated my situation with true intent to conjure some sort of an action to mitigate the possible negative outcomes of the future. But personally I have come to the conclusion that things are more likely to get worse than they are to improve; that is for my family. It is entirely possible that I may live a somewhat normal life independently, while leaving my family in disarray. It would bring me great sadness for things to come to that.

**A Cry For help** 

That pretty much concludes my situation. Honestly, I do not think I have a clue on what to do. Or what can be done. Or if anything can be done. And so I seek help in the best place possible - the internet.

My only train of thought is that I work as hard as possible and attempt to buy/rent another house in the future close to my family home where I can look after my father and work.

I would appreciate some sort of constructive advice. Especially if any of you have experience with family members with mental illness.

**Concluding Remarks** 

\- Thank you sincerely to any of you who have taken the time to read the entire post

\- Apologies for the long post, I could not think of a way to condense such a strange situation into a more digestible piece. I attempted to structure this.

\- I doubt things will get much better for my circumstances. At the very least, please use this to encourage yourself to treat your friends and family and strangers more positively

\- Please practice social distancing but take care of your mental and physical health",10May2020,1
460,"Hi all, hope you can help. 
I live in England now but used to live in Ireland growing up. I have/had a friend there and we were really close through thick and thin etc even when I moved to England for uni a few years back. 
She had a child when we were just leaving school and we took very different paths in life but remained close. When I got pregnant last year she and I had our first big argument - it doesn’t really matter what about, but I felt she crossed a line so SO badly that I cut her out of my life. I was having a difficult pregnancy, i didn’t need the drama on top of so much upheaval (moving during pregnancy, health issues). Honestly, it was a really bad argument and we just couldn’t reconcile our views at all.

It’s been a year since we fell out, and it has honestly taken me a nearly a year to calm down, and she did message me congrats when my baby was born and I equally congratulated her on other good news....  but that was it. Now I really miss her. 

I have no idea how she’s getting on, how she’d feel if I got back in touch, and I’m scared to approach her because it’s been so long and I don’t know how to.

462,"TW: rape, self harm, suicidal ideation

Hi,

So, I (22F) was raised in (and still live in) a household which is a bit complex. My mother is “alcohol dependent” whereby she will be sober during the day (and honestly, sober she’s one of the best people ever), but get blackout drunk at night. When I was growing up, she was very verbally abusive towards me when drunk and royally fucked my mental health up. My father worked long hours, and would get home around the time where she would be getting a verbal beat down from my teenage self because she’d just provoked me. He understood the fact that she was an alcoholic and that she was cruel towards me, but he’d basically just accepted that she won’t change and would pin the blame on me and tell me I was overreacting, as if trying to stop me from retaliating. 

It didn’t work (because it was a stupid way of dealing with the whole situation) and now I’m left with faint feelings of resentment and distrust towards my father. I love him so much, he is in every other way the best father I could’ve asked for. But I genuinely don’t feel like I can trust him with how I’m feeling or like I can talk to him about my trauma. 

I suffered through what I call the “seven year silence”, where from the ages of 12 to 19, I had severe depression and anxiety, and I didn’t tell anybody. I was self harming and borderline suicidal, but nobody had any idea because I kept it completely hidden. When I was 17, I had a mental breakdown at college and I told my teacher I was suffering from suicidal ideation. The college got me in contact with a mental health clinic for adolescents and my father came with me to the initial appointment. He listened to me tell the therapist that I had been self harming and wanted to kill myself. All he really could say was that he had no idea that I was in that position. Nothing else came from that initial assessment and everything kind of just went back to as it was. Silent. 

I was raped 5 years ago. It took me about 2 years (around the time the whole Brock Turner story came out) to realise I’d been raped, and I slowly started to tell people around me what I’d experienced. I know this is a bit fucked up, but I posted my story on my Facebook before I’d told my father. I really just didn’t feel like I could tell him. My mother had told my father about the Facebook post, and he called me up asking why I hadn’t told him. He sounded devastated. One of his biggest fears is failing as a father. I didn’t know what to tell him except that I was sorry. 

My relationship with my father has grown as I’ve graduated from university and he now sees me as an adult (even though I’ve essentially been an adult since I was 12; with my mother being unable to be a parent at night when she’s drunk, I essentially helped raise my younger brother). He’s started to open up more to my mental health issues and will ask me questions about depression and anxiety and different psychological theories (I have a psychology degree and eventually want to become a counsellor, so I know about the theories in depth). He’s shown me that he wants to be there for me and will listen if I want to talk to him about things... but I just can’t. There is such a huge resistance in me when it comes to talking about my trauma. He’ll see that I’m in a depressive episode and ask me if he can do anything to help, whether it be to talk about it or whatever I need. But I just shut down and say I’m fine. I don’t do this with any other person, it’s just him for whatever reason. I still can’t talk to him about the rape incident. I can’t bring myself to discuss it with him and I don’t know why. 

I try not to label things as gender specific issues, but to me as a female, my rape experience is very female orientated and I just feel like as a male and as my father, he might not be able to full comprehend my experience or might try to minimise it or play devils advocate. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to talk to a partially emotionally stunted (but trying his best) father about trauma?",10May2020,1
463,"I know this isn't really serious or important and Im sorry. But it is to me. Very..So my problem began like 4 days ago. My friends were planning to meet up (despite the virus) in a park. I wasnt sure about this but I really missed them so I agreed. For some weird, unexplained reason I thought it was suppost to be in the next week, but they mey up 2 data ago. So a day before the meeting I was watching a movie and I werent online (I didnt think I would need to be 24/7 online but OH WELL). Suddenly I got a text message from one of my friends. She seemed panicked and serious in it so I checked Messenger and there was a whole ass drama there. People canceling because of certain reasons (serious ones). But my friend just couldnt understand. She was furious and she said that ""she feels like everyone abandoned her"". So I texted her to see wth is happening. She started to blame me for misundertaning the date of the meeting and for not being able to drop everything and travel 50 km by bus during the pandemic. In the middle of texting she just stopped displaying my messages. I tried contacting her multiple times but she just wont dispay them. If that wasnt enough, she invited our ex friend, who did some bad stuff and hurt me a lot. And IF THAT WASNT ENOUGH, the rest of my friends started completly ignoring me, for example , they were having a nice conversation on our group chat, typical stuff, and I decided to take a part in that too. That obviously killed the mood as they didnt respond to me and didnt write anything in like a day. I know it may look so overdramatic and childish, but what can I do if they act like this? They mean a lot to me because they helped me during the hard part of my life (narcisistic parents and stuff) and I just dont understand why are they acting like that out of the blue. I even thought about texting them that if they dont respond untill the end of the day, its over. I wont wait like a dog for its owner until they miracously decide Im worth their attention.

First of all I’m someone with triple nationalities. Which means I have citizenships to three different countries. I have an American, Japanese and New Zealand citizenships. I did not naturalize for any of them, and I automatically got those citizenships through my biological father, biological mother, and my adopted stepfather. 
I was born in New Zealand and raised in Japan and the US. My mother and I moved to the US when I was ten, after she got remarried to my American Father. My biological New Zealand father abandoned my mother and when I was born. 
So I never lived with my biological father before. I saw him once every couple months until my he and my mother got divorced. After the divorce I saw him once every two weeks. After moving to the states and till now (23) I saw him once every one or two years.
My American father was the one who cooked for me, took me to school, took me to my sports clubs, stayed up late to help me with my homework, and just you know, raised me. 
Many people assume just assume that I’m from New Zealand due to my very Caucasian features and due to the fact that I was born in NZ. They also assume I know everything about NZ, and if I do something weird, blame it on the fact I’m from NZ. 
And all of that really hurts. It gives me a painful reminder of my biological father that I don’t want to be reminded about. Especially now after something that happened recently that hurt me and his new family quite a bit.

471,"So I found roommates over Craigslist last year and am renting a room from them. One of them owns the condo, the other is the owner’s live-in girlfriend. We got along well for a year and they often said I was the greatest roommate they ever had.

So I have been living with my mom during the pandemic and kept paying for my room that I am not living with. At the end of April I said I was going to move out. The owner said okay, let’s count this as my 30 day notice. Instead of me sending a full month’s rent and them sending me my deposit when I move out, I just needed to pay the rent minus the deposit. So I sent that money.

Just days later, they said they found someone new who wanted to move in. However, the new person wants to move in halfway through the month. They said they are moving my things into the living room. I’m mad, as I did not give them permission to go into my room and start touching my things and moving them. I said I paid for the whole month, so if they want me to move out just halfway through the month I can but they would have to give me back half of the month’s rent. The live-in girlfriend said I was being petty, that I am not even living there so what’s the big deal with them moving my belongings to the living room so that they can let a new person into my room. I am upset because I am still paying for the room regardless of whether or not I am living there and I already gave them the option of giving me back half my final month’s if they want me to move out a month early. They are essentially renting the room out to two separate parties simultaneously.

I am considering not giving them the keys back until the end of the month as a form of malicious compliance, but at the same time it screws over the new person and at that point it IS petty and Not really worth the fight. At the same time, what they are doing is downright illegal and it’s dirty how they suddenly pull this underhanded stuff the moment they realize they can’t get any extra money off me.

For years now, my aunt who was never married or had children expects my sibling, cousins and I  to wish her a happy mothers day. I don't like to wish her mothers day because simply she's not my mother and will never replace my mom (not that I think she's trying to). She get's really in her feelings when I don't wish her mothers day. But mothers day is the one holiday I take serious because my mom did a lot of sacrifices for my brother and I. Now, my aunt has done stuff for me and I really appreciate it I truly do but I just can't find myself wishing her mothers day. I think another factor on why I don't like to tell her is because she takes advantage of my mom. My aunt lost her corporate  job in the first recession and moved in with us. Today she is a vp at an international bank but she still lives with my mother and pays less rent and hold money over my mom who makes thousands less. My mom did not move out because I went to college and need the financial help. Now that I have graduated  and work she (my aunt) is trying to make mom sign the lease for another year. Which I find absolutely no need. I spoke about this to my mom and she understands my pov and mentioned I should just get her a card that mentions being a great aunt.  Any advice?",10May2020,1
474,"I've recently moved into a new (student)appartment complex. I live on the ground floor, so I've bought some chairs to sit outside. My neighbour started using them. At first he asked, but this now evolved into asking on Facebook messenger, not waiting for a response and just taking the chairs. I kind of want to tell him to wait for a response first, as it seems impolite to me to just take something that ins't yours. I do however not need the chairs most of the time, and didn't need them when he took them. I want to send a message saying that I don't mind that he uses them, but that I would like for him to wait for a response first.

476,"So here's my situation formulated very briefly:

I grew up in an abusive household with mentally ill parents. At 17 I moved out and rented an apartment (where I live the government gives you welfare if you're in a situation like this and are still a student). At 18 I graduated from high school. Currently in my first year of university (still 18 years old) but I've decided to drop out because of a wrong study choice. Now I want to work full-time and to eventually combinate this with part-time studies whenever I figure out what I want to study.

Now, the moving out at young age has taught me a lot of skills not everyone of my age has and that could be an advantage for the job (administration work in a lawyer's office). I also feel the need to mention that I've been to university for a year because otherwise it sounds like I haven't done anything this year. But I don't want to make it sound like I'm emotionally unstable/accentuate the fact that I have had a rough childhood/live in poverty/have no motivation to study/am too dumb for university/etc.

So how do I mention this in a way that highlights the good things? Or should I just leave it out altogether? Any advice would be very much appreciated.",10May2020,1
477,"I (23f) need to get over this overwhelming feeling of disgust everytime my mom or dad (both around 65 years old) picks their noses. I get so grossed out, like I even get nauseous sometimes. I'm thinking this probably started when I saw my dad with his booger still on his finger and I realized he doesn't wipe his hands properly... ever. There are times when he needs help on his laptop and when I touch the mouse, the texture is rough (and a bit sticky) and I realized it was because he uses the mouse right after he picks his nose. He doesn't use a tissue, nor wipes the goo off his fingers and it's so disgusting for me. My mom also always has this habit of picking her nose *even when at the kitchen table*. I know they're both ageing and this is probably why they're less conscious about these things, but I'm going to be the one taking care of them while they age, and I really want to know how to deal with this. Wiping poo off their butts is okay, but when they pick their noses, I get extra nauseous. Same when they *visibly* pick their teeth- without the slightest hint of consciousness. And my dad when he picks his teeth with the toothpick... he blows off the thing he's picked. So... where does it go??? 

Please I need advice for this. I've become grumpier because I get grossed out by this. I'm starting to think maybe I've developed OCD that's why I'm feeling like this? I think I've become a neat freak. :(",10May2020,1
478,"Seven months ago my fiancé and I took in my mother to help her through a difficult situation where she lost housing due to no fault of her own. We had all agreed that her staying with us was temporary until she found a new apartment. A few weeks maximum. 

Problematically, she doesn’t make enough to rent any apartment on her own. Her credit is shot (a few points above the worst score possible), she has no savings, no friends, and no significant other. As a PhD student, I don’t make enough via my stipend to help either.

She has severe bipolar disorder AND a substance abuse disorder (she is a long term recovering addict.) Her behavior and interactions with us are toxic. She is chronically irresponsible, manipulative, and disrespectful. I have often attributed these shortcomings to her illnesses, because despite these flaws, she’s still my mom, and is actually a decent person when her moods are stable. She and I have been through a lot together. 

We have attempted to go through government housing processes to help her to find her an affordable place to live... but the process has been so drawn out (since February), that we don’t know if we can honestly handle more delays. Many of the delays we have encountered have been her fault (like not having a birth certificate or letting her only valid ID go expired for 5 years... and then there’s the pandemic, too.) 

Our landlord has (understandably) slapped us with a violation of our lease due to her staying with us for so long. My relationship with my fiancé is majorly strained, as we are cramped in a small apartment with an unstable individual that can snap at any moment. My PhD studies are majorly disrupted, as she is staying in my only work space, not to mention the fact that I’ve been sleeping on a couch for 7 months while she sleeps in my spare room (my fiancé has horrid sleep apnea so we mostly sleep apart.) 

She doesn’t clean up after herself, and contributes minimally to apartment costs. She is unwilling (and understandably incapable) of working more hours or taking a promotion. She has also brought drugs into our apartment several times, which we have expressed is unacceptable. 

The housing authority has told us 45+ days just to hear if she is eligible, let alone waiting for in-demand housing to actually open up.

With all this in mind, we have respectfully asked that she find a new place in 4ish weeks. No negotiations. I feel super guilty about it, but I cannot continue this lifestyle with no end in sight. My PhD supervisor has been understanding thus far, but I know I need to find a solution and make progress or I will lose everything I’ve worked so hard for. 

What (in your opinion) is the proper way to handle this? 

Maybe my judgement is being clouded by my emotions, but it’s very hard to just kick out a loved one. I know she cannot handle a roommate (and vice versa.) 

Any advice for this situation is appreciated.",10May2020,1
479,"(19M) hello everyone, in the meantime, I hope you are all well in this bad period
I have a problem that I can't cope with,
to give some context, when I finished high school I immediately went to work with my father in the office, at the beginning I liked to work because I found him freer than in school, then after several months I started to like the job always less, I was almost depressed by the lack of a goal, I was (do I really have to do this for my whole life?).
with this quarantine I had stopped going to work, for legal and health reasons and it has been a long time since I have been feeling so well, the fact is also that I do not have a good relationship with my father than with my brother, so no longer having to seeing them in the workplace and outside made me feel really good.
in this time I tried to be productive and learned different skills, I trained, I improved, and I understood that the work I was doing was really oppressive, both for the workplace, for the people and for the type of work.
so to get to the point, I really want to leave this job and prepare to go to university, to take a different path and to separate myself from my father's overwhelming environment, the problem is that he will surely take it badly and there will be discussions and I don't really know how to create as little fuss as possible.",10May2020,1

485,"Before I start, I don’t need insults I just need advice but all are accepted lol

 So I think I’m attracted to my cousin....

Let me start from the beginning, my family lives in Virginia and my cousin and I have always had an amazing relationship like we’re very close. and this one thanksgiving in 8th grade she wanted to “reward me” because she heard about me winning my mma competition a year earlier but she lives in Virginia and I live in Florida so we rarely saw each other at first..... anyway she put on some song she liked or whatever I forget, but she sat me down and began dancing on me, little did I know this would be my first lap dance. It was fun we both were laughing and then.... well I got a boner and she sat on my dick and asked me “ ummmm what’s that” and I being the horny and confused little bastard I am said “um well you know this is what happens when guys are around pretty girls” and she smiled and said “wait what” and we both awkwardly laughed it off and went our separate ways for the next couple of days I was still there for thanksgiving trip. 

That situation stayed in my mind for years and it ended up coming back to slap me in the face when she came to visit in Florida for thanksgiving my sophomore going into junior year. But the slap wasn’t for my past perversions, it  was for not calling her??? Thank god she “forgot” and I was safe!!! She then jumped on me knocking me over hugging me and kissed my cheek and said I missed you cousin! Fast forward a couple days into the trip it was late and I was doing what all teenage boys do at night.... that’s right playing Black Ops 2 Zombies with my boys, when she knocked on my door and asked for me to come outside I did, she was sleeping on an air mattress just outside my room and she just wanted to “talk” so I sat on the couch next to the mattress and said “what’s up” and she said “I dragged you out here because I was lonely... but I want a massage gimme a back massage” and I eagerly said yes because she’s what’s been in my head up until that point. And I began giving her a massage, she then said “hold on lemme put on some music” and she put on literally a sex playlist, and said “ okay keep going”... I asked after massaging her upper back “ok where next” she whispers extremely erotically “ lower”..... sweat beading down my back and blood swelling in my groin I gulped in anticipation and anxiety and said” ok well I’m going to need you to take these of then” in a joking voice and she reached her arms back and started sliding her tight little shorts and panties down her fat ass.... the open area where we were was pitch black but I could see it perfectly.... it was glorious, the first real one I saw, and my mouth was watering profusely so I started massaging her ass and lower thighs and asked nervously “ where next” and she said “lower” again in that same voice..... now at this point my raging boner was melting through my pants so I spread her ass and began eating it she tasted like strawberries😭 and she started moaning and I just wanted to fuck at this point like she’s beautiful I love her I wanted to make love to her, so I whispered “let’s go downstairs” and I rhythmically asked in between coming up for air and she whispered back “ we’re cousins” in a distressed manner so I said fuck it and just kept eating and enjoying my time, i continued on for what felt like an hour and then I heard creaking on the steps suddenly I was pulled outta nirvana and reminded that my aunt was downstairs preparing our turkey for tomorrow, so I darted my tongue in as deep as I could go for a few more seconds then kissed her forehead as she rolled over in a drugged looking state she looked like she was sleeping but had a smile (did I eat her to sleep)👏🏾 anyway she looked satisfied with her back massage and the next day and rest of the trip went normal except we were a little distant. 

Now fast forward to now it’s 2020 and my dad kicked me out of the house during a pandemic but I don’t care I’ve had daddy issues forever so whatever, I had no where to go and my older cousin the sister of the one I’m in this situation with texted me to see if I was alright, I said yeah I just got nowhere to go and she said come home (Virginia) and be with us for now, so I setup shop in my grandparents house and the first time i see my cousin..... she looked incredible, ass bigger 4 cups sizes bigger fuller lips smaller hips and just overall so goddamn sexy... she again jumped into my arms and said “ wait are you living here now” in an excited voice and I said yup, and she pushed me over and we were on the floor her sitting on my lap and she smile just looking down at me and said “ we’re gonna have so much fun cuz” and she layed down on me and smiled and we just layed there on my air mattress but to everyone else it’s just those too back at it again they’re inseparable, and we are it’s just we’re both also horny and quarantined..... ugh idk anyway I know about the saying give an inch take a mile but she’s given me feet bro like for example she’s since I’ve been here asked for multiple massages and quote “decided to warn me about her period” was that so I don’t make my move if any during that time.... I need answers man I’m going insane like I love her like a little sister but I also want to fuck the shit out of her and I’m 60/40 that it’s mutual.... I just need to know if I’m not alone or maybe advice or something.... ughhhgg

And no this isn’t made up I can’t wrap my head around why anyone would think that, all I know is all of the above is 100% real and I’ve been pondering wether or not I should dick down my cousin since I was fucking 12!!!! Ughhhhh😫",10May2020,1

488,"

My boyfriend (21M) and I(20F) just broke up and I’m having second thoughts. We’ve dated for almost 2 years. At the beginning, everything was so natural. After a year or so, I was still happy to be with him but it was different. It felt like we were just going through the motions and we would have a roller coaster of very high points, and very low points in our relationship. But what he would always tell me was the only thing that mattered was that we loved each other. 

Anyways, we got into an argument and we basically both let out the things I guess you could say we “hate” or resent each other for. I told him that I thought we should break up because I can’t trust him (bc of past issues), I said that we have differences when it comes to religion, morals, music etc.( all minor things that were never a big deal, but we compromised and respected each other’s opinions) and there have been red flags like anger issues, alcoholism, depression etc.. He told me how he feels like he’s missing out. He said that he thinks about what could have been if we never met and how he could do whatever he wanted or that he cut off all his friends for me (which I never told him to do or gave any reasons to do so) and how he could talk to girls and that he turned down so many girls because of me. 

What he said wasn’t much of a surprise to me bc the entirety of our relationship I’ve deep down felt like he didn’t really want to be with me. I thought it was just a stupid insecurity of mine, but I can’t explain it, I just knew something wasn’t right. 

Now, I’ve never had these same feelings he had. Being able to talk to lots of guys doesn’t excite me or drinking and doing drugs, all which he was doing before we dated and as soon as we got together, he stopped. I always thought it was weird, but he assured me that it was all for the best. 

But on the flip side, I don’t get why all that stuff is important to him. I’m one of those people who think that you’re lucky if you meet your soulmate at a young age. I love that two people can basically grow up and become adults and figure out life together. I thought that’s what we had. 

After he told me how he’s felt like he’s wasting his 20s it hurt me, but like I said, deep down I sorta knew. Anyways, I still love him and he told me he still loves me and he wants to be able to love me as much as he can, but I think either timing might be off or are we just not meant to be together? Did we make the right decision splitting up or was it just a stupid fight that we could have worked through?",10May2020,1

Once, he came in while I was talking to a friend (SPOILER: He was eavesdropping.) about how I don't like to make my bed.

I am feeling kind of violated at this point, so I brought it straight to my Nana, who told me I was ""being sensitive"".

That was 2 years ago.

In the past, he had an issue with alcohol, getting to the point where my Nana threatened to move out. Ever since this corona stuff started, he stopped drinking entirely and has become a ticking time bomb. 

His mother, we'll call her Mary, recently moved in to stay with us. She complains about everything we do. Whenever I or my brother are playing the piano, she gets upset.

495,"First time posting something of my own on Reddit but i’m in a slight pickle so i could use a second set of eyes or two. For the sake of being able to follow the story and protecting names, i will refer to my buddy as Eric and his girlfriend as Erin. Here’s the basic run down, Eric and I grew up together but over the last few years had different friend groups so we grew apart. We’ve only recently became close again a couple months back. Eric has been dating Erin for close to 2 years now, not really sure exactly when they started dating but i know we were still in high school when they met. Eric and I have just finished our freshman years away at college but Erin is still a high school senior, a year below us. About 6 months back when i was still with my previous girlfriend, she had told me that she heard of my buddy’s girl being unfaithful while he was at college. there were no names or specific events to go along with the claim, just simply that “she may have been cheating”. At the time that i heard this, i was not very close with my Eric and since the information was purely a rumor i decided not to reach out. If i had seen some sort of concrete evidence, I of course would have said something, but I did not want to stir the pot without something credible. Recently, maybe a month ago, my now ex told me that my buddy’s girl has for sure been messing around with another senior guy at high school while we were away and that apparently she was “sad that Corona brought everyone home early because now she doesn’t have her fuck buddy”. This information comes from a girl  in Erin’s year at high school and is 99% credible. I have been contemplating telling him for the last month since learning this information for a couple reasons: 
1. again, no specific events or physical evidence even though the information is credible
2. I don’t believe he has any idea and now that we’re stuck at home, he has been with her a bunch and as far as I can tell they’re happy right now. It sounds shitty writing it out, but I have been hurt by girls before and i thought that since they’re home, they can enjoy the time together and I’d assume they’d split for college since she was strongly considering a school very far away. 

This all changed as i found out a day or so ago that Erin is now going to Eric’s college officially. i’m assuming that they will be staying together. 

My question and ask for advice is this: do i take this information to him? and if so, do i do it as soon as possible? I feel awful because i know that this information is not my decision to keep quiet because of MY opinion on the situation and MY past experiences. Also a concern, quarantine has been rough on a lot of people’s mental states and loneliness is wide spread. I’m not sure how this information and a break up would affect him right now. I’m not exactly sure how Reddit works lol I’m a noob but if someone could respond with some advice I’d appreciate it. Thanks!

496,"Ok, posting this here as yes I'm a trans woman, but it's not strictly just about me being transgender. Because the thing is, before the lockdown (in the UK) I was getting laser hair removal on my face and was due an appointment at the GIC-gender identity clinic, but had also recently restarted doing taekwondo and had started looking for volunteering opportunities.

But with the lockdown, no more laser hair removal, the GIC staff have been moved to corona virus responsibilities, there's less voluntary opportunities (especially of the sort I was looking for) and my taekwondo club has moved to online only, videos etc, which isn't the same anyway, but being visually impared (not fully blind but partially sighted) I could see the videos apart from small details, but it's really not ideal.

So yeah, right now I'm looking for ways to move forwards, be the person I want to be. I know there's things like eating healthier, excersising etc etc, general vague goals, but those are, yeah vague and general and things that I'm already slowly but kinda surely working towards.

What I would like to do is present with regards to my appearance more how I feel inside. I don't even mean this just in a gendered way, if I had the confidence and skill (which I'd get through practise I guess? ) I'd totally wear goth makeup, which obvs isn't necessarily a gendered thing. Or I'd try dying my hair at home (since salons are closed and I can't visit family ATM), sure it could go wrong, but I know people who it went wrong for and they still lived on after.

But obviously there is a gendered aspect too it too. Again if I was more confident I'd wear more gothy women's clothes, and in general clothes that are more obviously womens clothes, not even all the time obvs, but right now I just wear jeans etc etc.

I have taken out the rubbish (I live in a tower block) in a skirt, late at night, and the couple of people I bumped into at that time didn't really make an issue or even mention anything. But I have been harrased quite a few times and even hit (though not hard) a couple of times in public, though I'm pretty sure this has been mostly due to me being visually impared actually, certainly the harrasment has been, people accusing me of faking etc etc. Obviously most people don't give me any problems with regards to what I wear or me being visually impared, but I do suffer from anxiety (take meds) and being harrased and hit has affected me even if it was more due to my visual imparement, not due to me being transgender. So I'm still petrified of people's reactions, I get vivid images in my head of my skirt being ripped down and being laughed at, I know this is pretty unlikely obvs, but knowing this doesn't stop me imagining stuff like this.

So sorry for the long post, but hopefully the detail will help with giving me advice? xd hope so. So yeah, any ways I can motivate myself to dress more how I like? To wear skirts and stuff throughout the day, not just when I'm taking rubbish out at night and motivate myself to experiment with my makeup, make it more gothy? And/or any other ways I can move forwards right now? Besides vague things like eat healthier, excersise more etc etc? Thanks in advance for any advice :) .",10May2020,1

498,"My father was recently Baker Acted by law enforcement after threatening suicide. He is 73 years old and has been in and out of the hospital recently due to alcohol and medication abuse. Unsure if he may have dementia on top of that but he definitely had been abusing Xanax and Clozapine from a dealer he was buying from. 

Somewhat shortened story of the situation. Three weeks ago, he asked me to clean up his living room after a break in. There wasn’t one and was upset when asked if there was a chance it was him. A week later I was worried after not hearing from him for a couple days and found him on the floor. He stayed in the hospital for five days for a UTI and a degenerated muscle issue from being on the floor.

I took care of him for a week and a half. He lives alone and has nobody else to really help besides my girlfriend. He was making slight progress but still acted weird during the nights. I cannot tell if it is sun downing or that is just when he would take drugs. At this point he stopped drinking, or so thought.

We had started making daily visits because home health care had been doing a great job in helping him. He had already been trying to cancel some of those appointments but I made sure they still happened. I did his grocery shopping, tried to buy him an Amazon Echo Show 8 so I could drop in on him. Just generally tried to do my best to care for him while work a job.

A day and a half ago, the day of my girlfriend’s birthday, I stop by to bring him toilet paper. Place is a mess again. I find him propped against his dresser. He is just yelling that he did not drink and that he knows I think he is lying. Of course, I find a big bottle of gin on the floor he must’ve hid in his kitchen. Pills were everywhere. He apparently tried to remove a tooth the night before because it had been giving him pain and was taking everything.

I at first started setting him up with a dentist but then he began saying he will kill himself to save us the trouble and to stop the tooth pain. Get this? I convinced him the day before to give me his gun for “our protection” because I did not think he needed a firearm in his state.

I called the cops and now he is at the hospital under Baker Act. My plan is to take his cat to the vet and see if she has any problems. She may have some issues and I want to make sure she isn’t suffering. My dad would not let me do this before and ignored symptoms she had because she “is fine”. My friend and her boyfriend are going to adopt her for the time being after being screened. I told my father this and he is okay with it.

I am just unsure what they will do after the 72 hours. He needs to go to rehab or a nursing facility, not back home. He will not make that choice himself but he needs to. Even if it is temporary to get his life together because I cannot pick up the pieces every time while he is on a path of self destruction. He is a hard man to convince about anything but I love the guy. He pushed pretty much everyone away in his life.

I am afraid when he gets back that he will just buy everything he needs again (cops took everything) and just overdose. I cannot be there because I already took off so much time for work. I am going to let the hospital know this as I had already told them at his prior visits. It makes me feel guilty to not take care of him but I cannot afford to do both, otherwise that puts financial strain on my girlfriend and I.",10May2020,1
499,"I’m really sorry for the length, but I put a very short summary at the bottom if it’s too long to read. If you have any questions or need clarification just ask:

I don’t know anyone who uses reddit, but my sibling knows I’m on here and I wanna be a little careful. 

So my family dynamic has been very toxic for a very long time. My sibling has admitted several times to me that they’ve been jealous of me ever since we were little and pretends to be over it now, but continues to this day to treat me like crap and make me look bad/patronize/be hypocritical at my expense any chance they get when upset with me or otherwise really. My stepfather made me out to be the devil’s spawn during most of my childhood, and the only reason he’s stopped the last handful of years is because I’m older and brave enough to verbally defend myself. My mother has a lot of issues and has been very abuse to me basically since forever (smashing my games with a hammer on two separate occasions, throwing out all of my toys when I was around six, randomly hitting me when she’d snap at, for example, the way I was brushing my teeth in front of her because it was disrespectful. I’m not kidding). She also never sides with me in any situation and makes everything to be my fault—she even told me years ago that she believes I’m a liar because my stepdad would always lie about what I did or or didn’t do and she wouldn’t believe me over him. I’ve essentially been made the scape goat and the black sheep of my family. 

Although none of them have ever apologized or taken any responsibility for anything they’ve done, I’ve been able to mostly move past it to get by and have a relationship with my mom and sibling because I love them despite everything. Things with my parents have also gotten a little better. However, a couple days ago I got into a disagreement with my sibling over their SO being over the house five days a week for about four hours on average hogging the entire downstairs of the house (this also got on my stepdad’s nerves and mom keeps saying it’ll end soon, so I don’t think I’m overreacting) It escalated to me addressing the way they make me feel and how they treat me, and that night I proceeded to cry for two hours trying not to be heard in the kitchen. 

Next morning they come around trying to act all sweet and clueless and give a non-apology, once again not taking any responsibility. I told them it wasn’t okay and they refused to leave the room until I wasn’t mad at them anymore (I was never mad to begin with, just sad and upset). My mom heard and decided to barge in to fix everything by suggesting I make plans more interesting to entice them to want to hang out with me over doing other things. To clarify one of my biggest issues with how they treat me is that they always find time to do everything under the sun including hanging with other people but can’t find more than five minutes to be with me even when we make plans. 

And no, I am not kidding that this is what my mom suggested. 

I then asked why being with me isn’t enough and cry/screamed for them to leave, to which they finally complied after laughing/treating my feelings like a joke/overreaction, which took at least three whole minutes. They always laugh like that btw anytime I’m upset or have a problem related to them or the house. 

I wanted to make my mom and grandma cheesecake for Mother’s Day and succeeded by myself after my sibling refused to help after agreeing because they bake and have a good recipe (and then lied about it). They’ve been very petty since yesterday, lying about how I left the kitchen and ridiculing me for stupid things any chance they get to make me look bad. My mom asked if they could make a syrup for the cake to involve them and once again try to fix everything but it’s just not gonna happen this time (although I’m pretending to be okay with it so things aren’t weird for my grandma). I was thinking about it until they went out of their way to make a ton of noise this morning to wake me up, which I now only realize they’ve been doing on purpose whenever they’re mad at me. 

I can’t deal with this anymore, but I won’t have the means and it wouldn’t be practical for me to move for at least another year when I finish school. But I just don’t know how to navigate living here if the relationship continues this way and I continue ignoring my sibling. I’ve dealt with too much crap from literally every person I’ve ever had to be around, and now I have to put my foot down with my family or I swear I’m gonna lose it. I’d really appreciate any advice for how to stay sane and mentally/emotionally healthy for the next year until I can finally try to move out. Thanks for reading this incredibly long post if you did.

TLDR: I have a toxic family and I’m putting my foot down. How do I stay sane until I can remove myself from the situation? I just don’t feel I should have to forgive and forget constantly just because we love each other. Nothing ever changes and I’m always the one who gets blamed.",10May2020,1
500,"I usually stay at home just to avoid people or crowded place where i can be tired of. I used to be very talkative and extroverted but from early this year i Totally became introverted and talk less. I think the less i communicate with people the harder to have conversation with them, i found less and less i have conversation with people since i dropped out and i have no one to talk with daily. My usual routine is just wake up and work out for couple hours and doing nothing until i go class(only 7pm to 10pm it's not school but course for my university exam). Even in the class i have a hard conversation with classmates or i pretend to be sick to avoid the conversation..i kinda upset for me not being so social and lead the whole conversation while classmates are laugh and make jokes, because i used to be the one who makes jokes and always be the funny person. I obviously don't like getting well with them but it's still upsetting me that i'm not getting attention anymore. So go back on topic, when i meet friends or people(mostly random strangers idk why i always tend to meet new people) i get too excited first and then when i spend time with them like 2 hours i get so exhausted and tired like i haven't slept enough so from then i can't just focus on spending time with them. I tell myself i'm gonna sleep when i get home and when i finally get home i sit down on bed and scroll reddit or instagram..ugh i Am now obviously i was all exhausted talking with people and even felt like i had a fever today but when i laid down on bed i realized i wasn't tired at all like i can't even try to sleep.

503,"So I am at the two last years in school at the moment.
It's called the ""Abitur"" and it is really damn hard especially for someone who is not that bright either tbh.
The problem is that I have to take care of my brother daily for 2 hours minimun while I would say the average is 3 to 4 hours.
It is pretty hard to try to do school stuff or find time to play video games myself because I have so many things to do.
Especially while I am in quarantine this situation got a lot worse because we have lots and lots of school stuff to do and honestly I just kind of feel depressed because I can't do anything for myself.

When I am in the very last stage of Abitur I thought about moving out to my girlfriends family but I am pretty sure that my family would be very angry, not just at me but also at my girlfriends parents etc.
I would instantly take this chance if my parents weren't crazy enough to call  the police or whatever.

What also really pisses me off is that my siblings (16 and 15) very rarely have to take care of my brother but every time I try to speak about it, even in an extremely calm manner, I am immediately shut down.

You don't know how much of a toll it is to take care of my brother so often while my parents are in the living room just watching TV and my siblings are just chilling in their rooms.
They COULD take care of them but they just don't want to because my little brother wants to play with the Ps4.
My mother sometimes says that I should bring the Switch and Ps4 into the living room but I paid for these things myself and if they get destroyed by my 5 year old brother I would have no chance of replacing them anytime soon.
My video game consoles are also very important to me as it is really a way to use my Noise Cancelling headphones to escape reality for just a second.

Some unnecassary background info you don't really have to read:

My brother often plays GTA5 and also wants to play my Animal Crossing account.
He insists that he uses my accounts as I progressed in these games pretty far.
It's really annoying that he completely destroys my interior design in Animsl Crossing or just buys Garages with my money in GTA 5.
He is also VERY LOUD when playing video games so trying to do homework beside him is impossible.
If I use my headphones he is pushing me to get my attention.
Seriously these are moments I just get so frustrated with but I just try to calmn down and not show my anger as my brother just meant the best.
He is always really happy to show me if he manages to do something in these games.

Another note: If I argue with my parents too much they don't just scream at me they would straight up take everything away from me as a punishment of arguing woth them even if I am 18 YEARS OLD.
Lastly it is not rare that I get mentally and physically abused if I try to argue with them.

Last note: We live pretty much in a village and my family became friends with a millionare or something.
He takes a very weird liking to one of my sisters and this is going for 1 year now.
Because of that my sister often gets money from him and now literally has her own car, license (while I don't even have that), literally hundreds of T-Shirts and easily 20+ shoes and 20+jackets and 20+ jeans, a Macbook Pro, iPhone X and a very own apartment in this building where we live in with her own washing machine and everything.
While I share an apartment with my other sister (I mean the youngest one she also has many clothes as sometimes my mother forces my older sister to take her with her to shopping trips and that millionaire buys her many things aswell) (my parents have their own one as these are really small), I only have 3 jeans, 3 jackets and one of them was given to me by an uncle, 5 T Shirts and 5 Pullovers that fit me because they aren't 5 years old.
That being said I work in our school as basically a homeworker help for little kids and earn 100 euros a month.
Compared to my sister who wears Gucci and Versace etc this is really shitty...


I am sorry for such a long text but I just need advice and someone to talk to.
I feel my GF is pretty biased of course and always supports me and that's why I ask you guys.
Even if that millionaire part sounds like it is fake I swear on everything it is not. It is actually as fucked up and pedo like as you think it is but my parents just don't want to see it.
I really just want to get out of this situation and I really don't know how.",10May2020,1

Hi so my brother is weird and sick and it scares me. He like to watch my every move...

Today he locked me out my iPad and my iPod my iPad is a little more updated than my iPod.

Now the activation lock is on I went to unlock my iPod and the password is changed. I dont know what he wants with my pictures and its kind of scaring me he is weird. One time he managed to find out the password in my phone and went through all my things and i know this because I went outside and left it on the charger and when i came back home my friend called me and she said i rejected it and i didnt even have my phone. Also my phone was open in an app I didnt have open. What's wrong with him? Why is he so weird? I tried to tell my mom and she won't believe me she just thinks I messed up and forgot the apple Id and passwords.

But my concern is why does he want my pictures? Why is he a creep? Why does he want to invade my privacy in the creepiest ways ever? it's weird and it gets weirder by the minute.

512,"I'm using a throwaway because she knows my real account.

I'm 27M and she's 23F.

I met her a year and a half ago. Let's call her N.

N and I met through making music. She has a beautiful voice and plays multiple instruments, so I was very interested from the start. I must admit I was mostly only attracted to her physically at first, but that quickly changed.

We started hanging out a lot and found out we have even more things in common. She's very sweet, funny, smart, beautiful, charismatic...She speaks and everyone around her stops and listens. It's amazing to watch.

N has been my favorite person since the day I met her.

However, she was always secretive about her past. Particularly, about the people she spent time with. She doesn't have any close friends besides me at the moment. All her most important friendships and relationships ended badly and ""it was her fault"" that they ended.

One day, we were walking together when we bumped into someone from her past, a girl she dated (she's bisexual) and the girl literally broke down crying right in front of us. Later, N simply told me that they had a difficult break up. I didn't want to push since she looked very shaken.

We drunkenly slept together once in December and we became a lot closer. She started sharing more things about herself and I could really finally sense that her walls were going down a bit.

With quarantine, we haven't seen each other but we've been texting a lot. A couple of months ago she confessed that she liked me, but she didn't want to ruin our friendship. A week ago, I asked her to be my girlfriend on facetime. She said we'd talk later, hung up and ignored me for two whole days.

On the third day, N came back and told me we couldn't date unless she told me the truth. She said she was diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder when she was 17 and she's been going to therapy since she was 20 (3 years now).

My first instinct was to not believe it. She is obsessed with being polite and maybe she thought telling me ""no"" would be rude.

She seemed so caring and sweet, always taking into consideration how people would feel before she did anything. She'd try her hardest so that everyone in a group felt comfortable and heard. She mostly kept to herself too. That isn't what narcissists do, narcissists like attention. And she cried when watching movies and puppy videos. That's empathy...

But after my initial reaction, I started seeing some things. How much N changed her personality depending on who she was with, how important it is for her to be liked by everyone, how people with different opinions aren't worth her time or attention, how exhausted she would get after supporting me when I had emotionally difficult times. So extremely exhausted, almost like she was forcing herself to pretend she cared. How easily she could stop caring about people she seemed so excited about days prior.

The fact that she has no close friends, only acquaintances who will laugh remembering how she ""slept with X and Y on purpose to break Z"" or how she ""cried on command to get free drinks""...

She's been so good to me. My life is better since she's been in it. I don't think I've been manipulated, I don't think she's been lying to me. I don't think she's been manipulating others since we met either. I think she's trying to improve and get away from whatever she did in her past. She looked genuinely upset over her ex who broke down, but I don't know if it's because she cared or because I witnessed it and she thought that would affect the image I had of her.

But I'm scared. Because I genuinely love N, I'd take a bullet for her. I'm extremely attracted to her, but I'm also okay staying as a friend if that means that by keeping ""distance"" it'll be easier to help her. And, of course, I don't want to get hurt.

I'm already hurt she didn't tell me about this before. I know it's her business and she doesn't need to share that if she doesn't want to, but I almost feel used.

But I didn't feel used before knowing this. So maybe I am judging unfairly.

How do you get diagnosed at age 17? That means there were signs so big before 17 that her parents made her go to therapy.

I really want to be her boyfriend and I think she wants it too, but I don't know what to do. Everyone always has the worst experiences with narcissists and end up traumatized like her crying ex. But she's been going to therapy and she makes me so happy.

Has anyone gone through something like this before? What's your advice?

TLDR: I've known this girl for a year and half and things have been great. I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she told me she is a diagnosed narcissist that has been going to therapy for 3 years. I realized then that many weird things from our past started making sense with that diagnosis. I don't know what to do.",10May2020,1
513,"Hey. 

I’m a college freshman currently attending Tsinghua University in China. We’re currently nearing the end of my second semester in college, but I’m still struggling with the language barrier. It’s incredibly frustrating because I feel like I’m not learning anything. 

I’m Chinese American, but that doesn’t mean I can suddenly read, write, and communicate at a college level in Chinese. I already translate all of my readings and homework prompts, complete the assignments in English, and then translate my work back into Chinese for submitting. It’s exhausting and time consuming. 

I guess my family can see me as a failure for giving up on becoming fluent in Chinese. I don’t care. I actually want to learn in my college years.
So, I need some help. What are cheaper college options? I’m open to the idea of attending online colleges or supplementing my learning with online courses. It’s good as long as it’s cheaper than attending a traditional college. 
It’ll be tough but I’m leaving the option of completing a degree in Tsinghua open, while I’ll actually learn through online courses.

This isn’t the first time I’ve thought about transferring. But I want to have a path in mind before I discuss this with my mom. I need some help with finding online college courses that I can take.


(btw the degrees I’m interested in are International Relations and Public Policy——I like history, environmental science, and journalism, so ideally I could minor in something related. And I suck at math.)


——-
some background I guess
Tsinghua, I’m told, is basically the Harvard of China. Which is why my family basically decided for me that I would go (I was rejected by my ED so I didn’t have any strong reasons to refuse). Aside from the prestige, I had two actual reasons for attending Tsinghua. One is cost. Going to Tsinghua University for four years would cost less than one semester of my sister’s tuition at BU (so less than 29,000 dollars). Second, being in China means I would spend more time with my grandpa, who has been diagnosed with lung cancer again (he’s 81 and doctors have found a small tumor behind his lung). These two reasons are why I’m hesitant to going back to America for college.",10May2020,1
514,"[24F] Okay so this is gonna be an angry ramble but I'm at the end of my fucking tether.

About 10 years ago I was obese, I was getting bullied at school for being fat and had a few health issues. 

I lost the weight after being told I needed to to have any chance of recovery from an illness I was suffering. I was a healthy weight, I was confident and I enjoyed life. 

Then something happened which I'm not going to get into, and I gained all the weight back.

Now I'm a fat greasy slob and for the last 6 years I've been goading myself to lose the weight. 

I start, then I never follow through. 

The frustrating thing is I've done it before, it was a simple case of calorie counting and getting exercise, back then I was walking to school. 

But it seems to be on a weekly basis now where I'll tell myself that I'm going to start eating healthier balanced meals and walking more this week, and then that night or the night after I'm back on the takeaway, and that's not even in moderation. And I haven't even left the house.

I think my only victory so far has been getting off and staying off soda and drinking just sugar free juice/water.

I've even gone to therapy to see if it's an underlying stress or frustration stopping me. That didn't help. 

I have goals, things I wanna do and I want to be my healthy weight for them, like, it sounds daft but I wanna dress up as one of my heroes from when I was young and go to a con, but that hero is a special forces operator and I'm not doing them justice if I'm going there fat. I loved those two years of my life. I was sporty, people respected me, people were attracted to me. 

I wanna be that cool powerful and hot girl I used to be when I was younger and lost all the weight. I wanna be able to rock climb again without carrying the extra weight. 


I'm not looking for unrealistic here, just healthy. Because I'm not healthy now and I'm sick of saying 'i used to do so many great sports' I wanna be able to say 'j do those sports'


It seems like I've tried everything to get myself in the motions but I just sabotage myself every time. 

Like last week, I did a weekly shop. Got some nice healthy food, separated it off into portions and then STILL neglected it for takeaway each day.

 I've tried setting a routine, but they get thrown out of the window pretty damn quick.


I'm sick of it, I need advice on sticking to the fucking plan and not sabotaging myself please.


And I'm not interested in the 'healthy at any weight' 'body positivity' or 'love yourself as you are' bullshit.

Body positivity works great when it's things that aren't an active risk to your health, my obese mother just got diagnosed with type II diabetes, all my family immediately pointed at me as the person who was going to get it next, despite my refined sugar intake being a fraction of theirs.  But I am at risk and I have to accept that and change it.

I'll be body positive about my stretch marks and surgery scars.

Not interested in fad diets either, need a healthy lifestyle I can stick to long term!

Advice on stopping self sabotage also greatly appreciated!",10May2020,1
515,"We all yearn for those friends who we actually resonate with, not the 'social media' superficial friends. The type of friend we can call up at 3am when we need help. The type of friend who stands by us at the highs as well as the lows. Do you have any more insight? So far, I have tried the following:

**1) Be yourself.** It's all about vulnerability. It is less about changing yourself to meet the ideals of what you think someone else would like, instead try to be unapologetically yourself and you will attract people who genuinely value you for you.

**2) Reach out.** Comment on people's Facebook posts or reply to people's Instagram stories - both great ways to reconnect with old friends in an engaging way. 

**3) Friendship apps.** These are so good! Everyone is actually open to making new friends! I have used a lot and my personal favourite is [Serendip](https://serendip.co/) \- it matches you with people who resonate with your personality. Others include [meetup](https://meetup.com/), but probably better for post lockdown! 

**4) Video calls.** Scheduling catch up calls with existing friends is a great way to strengthen your bond. When we can't meet in person due to lockdown, a voice or video call has much more depth than a text message.

I don't pay attention to their reaction, but it's their presence and the fact they are paying attention to me which is giving me feedback and making me feel validated. The few specific people I've notice change as time goes and as people become more significant to me. I've tried grounding and keeping myself in the present but I keep drifting back to that ideal place where I am being payed attention.

518,"We aren’t a couple. We live long distance. We have been intimate and we talk a lot. He (M35) has his dark days. Usually doesn’t reach out. We hadn’t spoken in a few days and at 1:30 am he actually texted to tell me he was sorry he has been distant but he is struggling. I said I was there for him and we can get on a call and not talk. He sent me AudioSlave - Like a Stone. 

I asked if he wanted to call me. He said he wants to but he can’t. I said I understand. I asked if he wanted me to call. I called and must have accidentally video called him but he answered. He couldn’t talk. He said.. god, what did he say.. something like, “I’m done” or jeez I can’t remember. I started to cry. He said he had to go. He said he would call me tomorrow. 

I texted him that I understand he is struggling but I want to talk to him tomorrow and to send me another song. He sent another song about depression and suicide and told me to pay attention to the lyrics. I sent him Into The Ocean by Blue October. He saw that message. Then after a search, I sent, “I am worried about you and I want to help. I am here for you. And I love you. I can’t even begin to imagine what you are going through but I am here and we’ll go through this together.” He hasn’t received the message or been online in 30 min. It’s 2:30 am. 

I don’t know where he lives exactly. I don’t know his friends. He is in therapy. His doctor recently lowered his SSRI dosage. 

I (F34) have depression and BPD and while sometimes I want to not feel and just get completely blasted on pills and booze, I don’t understand being suicidal. 

Did I handle this okay?

Today I tried to show continued interest and support. Normally when he has dark days, I leave him to it. He never messages me to tell me he is struggling and this time I think he did it for me but now I messed up.

After reading online I got some ideas and suggestions of how to handle people who are suicidal and it said not to leave them alone so in my attempts to be there as much as I could long-distance I attempted calling him. I sent him a text message telling him that I will be calling and that I’m only a phone call away he replied it doesn’t help I tried calling him again and he hung up on me and when I tried once more he got pissed off he sent me a message and said that I am ruining his phase (poor translation) and not to call. It was a pretty abrupt message to which I simply replied OK and that I was only trying to help but I won’t call again.

I didn’t mean to make a mistake or anger him. At the same time I am also partially in shock and somewhat hurt and I’m trying not to take this personally. I just also feel that he could’ve told me in a nicer way. I won’t reach out again. And I think because of the way I made him speak to me he may decide that whatever is starting between us can’t continue. I inadvertently pushed him. I have no intentions of pressuring him because I understand that he doesn’t work under pressure and that he’ll come to me eventually but honestly this was an attempt of suicide prevention on my part. A tear trickled down my face. I’m trying to just process this effectively. I don’t think I will hear from him today or for the rest of the week as he is usually busy during the week. He did so well in reaching out to me last night to tell me that he was sorry he had been distant and I turned around and fucked it up.

I think he has now blocked me on Facebook messenger. He hasn’t read my last messages on Viber saying I wont call again. He likely blocked me everywhere. How badly did I mess this up?",10May2020,1

526,"My\[32F\] friend\[37F\] has been going through a long and drawn-out breakup. She's made lots of positive steps and I'm really proud of her for finally cutting contact with him and moving on. We've had cocktail and movie nights, gone abroad together and regularly talk on the phone.

But her behaviour has become increasingly reckless and I'm not sure how to help her anymore. At any event she will get near-black-out drunk, disappear, hook up with as many guys possible, and wake up the next day not remembering what has happened or whether she used protection. I haven't always been there but she calls me upset and anxious afterwards wanting to talk about it. I'm encouraging her to work on herself, give up drinking, focus on her hobbies and watch TV/books to regain her independence, or use apps if she wants to date guys. But she gets restless, the cycle repeats and I'm so scared of what might happen to her. She is receiving professional help and apparently their advice is for her to talk to her friends and family.  


Just before Coronavirus she got herself into a dangerous situation so I was kinda relieved when lock-down happened. But she has been messaging and even meeting up with some guys still. I know that she is lonely and so wants to iMessage daily and have phonecalls a couple of times a week. But I am far more introverted and need a break from these long conversations where I feel like I'm wasting my breath. I think she only reaches out to me to temporarily distract herself and because I have more free time than our other friends. The last time I saw her, she was messaging guys  and kept asking me how to reply to their messages while I was trying to talk to her about an issue I was having.  


I have recently started to push back and explain I don't have time for a call whenever she wants to, which is upsetting her. I feel like a terrible friend and want to have a proper conversation with her face-to-face about this - possibly after speaking to our other friends who are either keeping their distance or encouraging her sexual exploits. I'm not sure how to approach this conversation, especially as the next time we meet will probably be at a party.

527,"I’m sorry if this is all over the place, it’s only just happened so I haven’t had a lot of time to gather my thoughts. 

I live in a bad part of town. It’s basically a run down apartment complex, only a couple of white people. I’m used to it because I’ve lived here my whole life, you just learn to stay out of the way. 

I (f20) live with my girlfriend (f26) on the second level out of three in my complex. These are new(ish) neighbors, they moved in a few weeks ago but we don’t quite know who all lives up there. Our previous neighbors were terribly loud, stayed up all night, and had lots of physical altercations late at night. This is relevant because none of this is unusual for where I live, the apartment is cheaply made so you can hear everything above you, especially if they exist loudly. 

Our leasing office is full of ladies who don’t care about anything. We’ve made little complaints that have never been really dealt with. 

Our new upstairs neighbor stays up late at night, but isn’t usually super loud. I think they are having family over for a couple of nights, because it’s been stomping all night. This morning, I get up, I hear what I think is crying but I can’t really tell, it’s too quiet. Soon after, I hear stomping, yelling and definitely a young child screaming. The following twenty minutes I could hear an adult male yelling at a child and the child sobbing. I don’t know if the child is being hurt, there’s lots of commotion. 

It eventually stopped and I haven’t heard anything since, but intense up whenever I hear commotion or yelling, hoping I don’t hear the kid cry. Now it could just be that the boy did something to get in trouble. I don’t know for sure. What if I hear it more later? It’s upsetting. I don’t want to be someone who ignores something questionable, especially with a child. However, I’m naturally kind of paranoid, and I work with young children, so I’m very protective over them. 

Calling the cops isn’t much of an option as we are the only white people on this section of the complex. I feel they’d definitely think it was us, and I’m worried for retaliation for snitching. 

I could make an anonymous call to the leasing office but those ladies don’t do shit and again, worried they’d figure out who called. I’m really hoping it was a one time thing. It was just very loud sobbing and the yelling was so aggressive and it went on way too long to be okay. 

Is there any options for me in case if it does happen again? Or do I seem to be overreacting?",10May2020,1

Likewise, my mother is listed as being 33, and the lady who is supposedly my mother should have been 29 years old.

531,"TL;DR my sister upsets me and mom often because of the way how she talks. My mom talked to her about it several times but she always shrugs it off. Should I seriously confront her about this?

So basically I (20yo) am living with my sister (29yo) and my mom.
Whenever my sister talks to mom or me, it often ends up an argument because of the way how she talks. It happens especially between her and mom, like there’s a 80% of chance that my mom will be upset with her.
Usually, it’s because of the way she talks. she talks in a quite straightforward way, but sometimes it comes off rude, impolite and even unnecessarily hurtful. My mom often addresses her about this but she always brushes it off.

Personally, I can see why my mom gets upset with her. For instance when she wants a trash removed from the table, she could ask ‘can you put this trash to the bin?’, but she rather yells ‘seriously hurry up and get this trash off the table already’. She saw I haven’t taken a shower yet (because I was busy doing my homework), she yells ‘seriously you haven’t showered yet? Disgusting’ instead of asking why I haven’t taken a shower yet. She talks little better when talking to mom, but still in a way that upsets her.
Her tone kind of sounds in a condescending and patronizing way. Mom and I don’t really like it and my mom often confronts her about it.

The thing is I feel like she actually talks like that in a lighthearted way, so she doesn’t really mean to upset us. She’s sometimes actually a sweet person and is a responsible person and generally has good morals, which I admire. Obviously she loves our family, but it’s her tone that always makes me and mom upset very often. Maybe we’re too sensitive, I don’t know.

So when my sister and mom get into an argument regarding her speaking manners, I’d like to explain to my sister why mom gets offended and how she should speak. But here’s a thing: I’m afraid to take mom’s side because my sister is the only family member that I have come out to (yeah.. I’m part of LGBT). I fear my sister might think I’m betraying her in a way when she did a favor for me by keeping my gender identity secret to the rest of family. 

I’m particularly worried about this because my mother was mentally unstable a couple of months back. She’s  so much better now, but I don’t think the arguments she keeps having with my sister will good for her. This is another reason why I want to kinda take mom’s side when there’s an argument.

So... what do you think I should do? Should I take my mom’s side when there’s an argument or should I not take anyone’s side at all? Should I seriously confront  her about it (although my mother does it all the time)?

Throwaway account bc of things and may delete later!
I got ‘hired’ a call type (scam tbh) job I won’t specify details for early this year and only started working during the pandemic. Every day has been a struggle and I’m getting paid under the table. It was supposed to be weekly but at this point I’ve only gotten paid for one week and now I’m past the second pay day and my boss is on their day off today. I should have been paid a couple days ago, though I’m not sure what the commission rates were like for the past week. Each day I’ve done what I was told wrt adding on to what I say to the people I call, but it still seems like it’s not enough and I get reprimanded for ‘not putting in enough effort’ and blamed for people not picking up when I have them scheduled for an appointment. The hours aren’t terrible but I believe I made it pretty clear that I would not be working after my shift yesterday. However, this person is extremely confusing and I find myself unable to assume simple things and constantly ask questions in an effort to be diligent. This person does not always answer but has also stressed that it’s unacceptable if I do not respond to 3 messages (which, iirc, didn’t actually happen). This past week I was asked on /both/ of my days off to work my second shift hours, with one day promised extra pay and not for the other. I didn’t take the second. Last night I had sent a couple of longish messages which they decidedly did not read. I am tired of being told I’m not putting in enough effort when the stress and hoops to jump through make me physically ill. Honestly, I’d like to get paid for the full week of work I put in, though I may get told not to expect the ‘full amount’ because i didn’t put in enough ‘effort’ (read: meet an hourly call quota every day when it takes time to speak to people). This person also already had the conversation of letting me go a few days ago with me and told me not to work the next shift, then half an hour into said shift time, contacted me asking me to work. Later that evening I got told I wasn’t putting in enough effort. I am determined not to be pushed into working this morning, starting in roughly an hour from when I post this. As it’s this person’s day off, I don’t expect to be contacted, but I’ve definitely been wrong before. Luckily I had been scheduling for tomorrow bc no one wants to talk on a holiday so I don’t feel too bad. I was told not to schedule two days out in advance anyway :) I feel I’ve been a detriment at this place against all things and it’s not a great feeling, so I’m done.

TLDR as best I can
I don’t know how or when to ask my boss to pay me for my week of work and leave this job. I feel I made it clear I was fine not working after my last shift yesterday, though I’m not sure if they actually understood that. A few days ago, I’d been let go then called back later that same day to work. It’s their day off, I want the pay ASAP, and I simply want to leave and not speak to this person any longer. I will not be working today. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!",10May2020,1

539,"TL;DR: was living with a friend, he screwed me over, and was becoming significantly more toxic. Cut him out of my life. Let a friend move in with me shortly afterwards, he screws me over, thinking about cutting him out of my life too.

Hey all. I’ve been having some issues with my roommate pretty much since the day he moved in. Before he moved in, I considered him a very good friend of mine. But now, not sure if I can continue being friends with him after he moves out. Here’s the deal: 

I was living with a friend, D, from November 2019. Also someone I once considered a very good friend. I had been staying with him in the city because there were plenty of jobs here and none where my parents were at. I was paying bills and everything was fine. After D and his gf both got settled in around early January, D let me know that I no longer had to pay bills so I could save up for my own place. I got him a job with me in which I would earn a bonus after 90 days of his employment. He quit only a couple weeks away from said bonus. Then him and his gf got super sick for like a month, needed some help with bills, and asked to borrow enough to cover bills, about $320, under the agreement that I would get paid back. So I said sure, no problem. Mid February rolls around and I go visit my friend K up north for the weekend. D’s gf messages me on FB and tells me that I need to pay bills. I told her right back that no I didn’t because D told me I didn’t have to anymore. And it was left at that. A couple weeks goes by, she messages me again while I’m work saying I need to pay bills, I asked about the money they said they’d pay back to me and she said I was never getting that money. D owes me that plus an $80 gaming headset his cat chewed up. So I went home and packed all my shit and left. I then slept in my car until the end of May 2019. Signed my lease and moved right in.

About a month after I move in, at the end of June 2019, my dad hosted a surprise birthday party for my mom. So I went and hung out for the day. Sometime in the afternoon, my friend, K, calls me up, informs me that he discovered his gf of 3 years was cheating on him. He told me that he kicked her out immediately but would need somewhere to go once his lease was up at the end of august. He only needed to stay for maybe a month or two while he was waiting on another friend out west to come get him. So I said ‘sure, no problem’ because he’s a very good friend at this time. But I told him this: ‘since you’re only gonna be with me a month or two, I’m not gonna make you pay bills, but I would like you to cook and clean instead.’ I asked this of him because I was working 2 jobs at about 70 hours a week so I had no time for any of that, and I didn’t mind supporting him for a short amount of time if he’s moving on soon to improve his life. I did get him a job so he could earn some money before his move out west. But then after 3-4 weeks, friend flaked on K and didn’t end up coming to get him. 

Flash forward to middle of December 2019. Roommate is still living me but didn’t do what I asked of him for the past 4 months. I quit my second job for various reasons and tell roommate he needs to start paying his half, which he does no hesitation. I told him he still has making up to do, whether it’s paying me back or doing all the cooking and cleaning he was supposed to. And he says no he doesn’t, now that he’s paying bills. He also either doesn’t want to do the little things I ask of him, like picking up after himself or keeping the living room clean, or doesn’t care. 

Also during this time, blew 2 engines in my car which my parents covered and obviously expect me to pay back, and K has also said he’d split the costs with me, since he was also using the car. Blew transmission cooler lines, which I had to bitch about 2-3 times before he started paying for oil changes to make up for that. 

He does have some mental health issues, which obviously I’m not faulting him for and it probably is the cause of the little things that he doesn’t do. He says he was in the lowest point in his life when he came to me. But, I was also at my lowest when he came to me as well so I’m not willing to accept that as an excuse. He considers me one of his best friends, but his actions over those 4 months showed me otherwise. 

We’re not even gonna talk about the previous almost 10 years in which I footed nearly every bill and paid for nearly everything, even at times when he was working and said he had money to help out. 

But I basically broke my back helping this guy out and basically got nothing in return. And if I were to kick him out right this second he’d owe me about $5k before I could consider being friends again.

Am I an asshole or am I in the right here? There will probably be fallout because we have mutual friends but I’m at the point in my life where I don’t really give a damn either",10May2020,1

542,"This requires quite a bit of back story. I have always slept walk a lot. I have often woke up in the middle of the night doing really weird activities, such as washing my hair as I still had clothes on in cold water or cooking eggs. I have also often woken up in the morning and couldn't find my phone even though I was certain that I had plugged it next to me, or with bruising or cuts on my arms. 

I also often am absent minded, forgot what I was doing, wat someone was telling me, misplaced things (I even have a specific thing to make my phone ring and a location tracker cause I lose it so frequently). But I also I lose keys, shoes, clothes, jewelry, books. My house is small so it is hard to do that. I have always blamed my inattentiveness and my frequent daydreams that I have, which are really vivid and so realistic I often forget where I am. 

Never thought anything about it, until a few days ago I have found an old folder of mine, with papers inside. There were drawings of people and places and names on the papers which I don't remember drawing or writing - in my hand writing. And other papers have descriptions of the names and the people who have the names to them. It's really weird and I am half freaking out. It's like I wanted to write a story or create people, but I don't remember doing so. 

I am also not as good at drawing as the drawings are, so I don't know how I did that or don't remember doing it. I don't know if I did it when I was sleep walking, or when I was daydreaming. Apparently I am perfectly functioning when do both, I have conversations and talk to my parents to the point they don't know I'm distracted or am not awake. I only find out later when they mention I did or talk to them about something and I have no recall of that.

546,"I’ve had a volatile relationship with a man ( long distance) We were friends for 4 years. It was a roller coaster vacillating between just friends and love feelings. I grew attached to him. He’s moving on and I’m sad and scared. We talked every day for 4 years. I feel used a bit sexually and just being there for him. It was very one sided. He’s on the autism spectrum, so he never really expressed well. I just can’t be friends now, if ever. He’s said some pretty awful things and last night I said very awful things. I think I was just pushing him away. Sometimes there is no saying sorry. It’s just over and I’m sad. Is there anything I can do?",10May2020,1
547,"I have trouble forming relationships with men, as I have past trauma of my father cheating on my mum which eventually caused me to think that all men cannot avoid infidelity. 

I try to have relationships, but it’s not that I find it difficult to trust them as an individual I just have internal issues which essentially makes it hard for me to build anything with someone.

I am currently in a relationship. He seems to be a good man, and I do believe I am in love with him. 
However, my trust issues urge me to break up with him to avoid heartbreak &amp; complex situations. I can’t live thinking every man is a cheater, otherwise I’ll end up being single.

I have taken a long while in the past being single to redeem myself and stop having trust issues however this doesn’t work. I need genuine brutal honesty from men so I know good men actually exist.

550,"
Two friends of mine recently got together and have been doing the classic shit of distancing from the group, barely engaging with anyone else, declining going out.

I'm happy for them but also, I'm not. I understand it's natural but it also hurts because because in no time I ""lost"" two friends, because they're not there anymore.
Especially in this difficult time, at times I needed them around, I felt we used to have a group that mutual supported eachother. I feel like I was thrown out like yesterday's garbage.

There's an extra layer that is, one of these friends I considered a close friend and there was some heartbreak in the beginning, because the other person wasn't available at the time. I stood by his side and supported how I could. Now I feel our friendship meant nothing, like I was replaceable the whole time.

This upsets me and I'm agressive sometimes, have been more distant for a while.

I don't know how to deal with this. Ideally, I would like to keep the friendship but I don't know if that's even possible. I can't just pretend their behaviour isn't affecting me. 

I never went through this. Anyone has any advice?",10May2020,1
551,"So i'm currently a high school junior stuck in quarantine. My sister and her husband came over in early April and are going to stay for another month. My family Chinese and has pretty high expectations for me in going to a good college. I've spent a large amount of my time studying for school, working jobs and internships, applying for summer programs, having counseling sessions, doing individual projects, etc. The thing is, I usually live alone with my mom, and even though shes really controlling with my actions, (like how I need to clean, put the plates, the correct order of adding types of cat food, etc), she lets me  do whatever I want for 1-2 hours a day at night, which I usually spend playing games or watching anime. This however, has changed ever since my sister came over, since they kind of banned it. To avoid this, I've been waking up at 3 am to play till around 4-5 am and then study till 6 b/c that's when her fiance wakes up and we go for a run. However, they caught me recently and made me stop. It's just really stressful because they make me study all day till I sleep, and playing games has been a way of stress relief and motivation. Their argument is that since my brother was addicted to games in his youth, it distracted him from his studies and he failed a large amount of classes which made him delay many years. They now talk about how he used to work trash jobs, how even though he has a really good job right now, hes going to lose it because he doesn't work super hard. A big difference however, is that he used to play all day and not study at all.  On the other hand, because I've been told that ever since I was a small kid, I've always maintained the high standards for everything academically related. I have done better than my siblings in grades, standardized test scores, course rigor, extra-curricular, but they tell me that I will become a failure in life if I even do anything related to games, like watching twitch or whatever. I don't know. I just feel like I cant do anything I really want, especially with Covid-19, where games are basically the only way I can talk to my friends.",10May2020,1

553,"So I've recently been to a new doctor that I've seen for a few months now and it's been a bit of a confusing situation. She's a great doctor and knows her stuff. She has the ability to turn confusing medical talk into layman's terms. On top of that she's amazing, caring, wonderful, nice, smart and always available for an appointment when I need one. She's been treating a few of my health issues, and has followed up with my issues, prescribed me medication when I need it and sent me to specialists when needed as well. It's been hard finding a new doctor that's competent in my local area, especially one that follows up.

But the issue and problem is that I have developed a crush on her that has grown as time went on. Not only is she wonderful in all areas that I described earlier but she's also insanely pretty, with the most gorgeous eyes I've seen, charming at certain times, very young and about my age. From what I can tell she's not engaged or married. She's into fitness because she has one of those pricey Garmin exercise watches and I've lately been more into fitness. When I first saw her I was a bit taken back by her looks but I just kept telling myself that it'd be fine and I can be okay with this. But as time went on her wonderful qualities as a doctor and a person has made that crush grow. The more I keep thinking about it I don't know if I could ever fully tell her my medical problems like guy issues in the future if I ever need to disclose that type of stuff. I know that she doesn't feel the same about me because she always keeps things strictly professional and always keeps the discussions on medical issues. The only personal question she's ever asked me was if I was married and if I was living with someone, which are both typical questions doctors ask. I think she might know I have a bit of a crush on her because every time she gets close to me I blush a little, I breathe a little faster, I can barely keep eye contact for 5 seconds or more and she can tell my heart rate goes up. When I first laid eyes on her I was literally stunned for like a few seconds just because she was gorgeous. Yea it's silly I know.

She's also just starting out and needs the patients and I don't want to hurt her feelings if I switch that it's due to her competence, because it's definitely not that. She gets a lot of negative reviews on ratemds, I don't know why. I've always had perfect treatment from her. So her getting new patients is a bit of a challenge for her. Her office is usually a bit empty. So should I stick with her? Should I keep her as my main doctor and just go to a clinic when or if I have guy issues pop up? Any advice?",10May2020,1
554,"So, three months ago, my dog died. I’d rather not go into it, but I’ll just say that it did cause me, and still is causing me an incredible amount of sorrow. In the immediate aftermath of that happening, I just stopped talking to my family after noticing my mum having a normal conversation the next day. I mean, I obviously didn’t blame them, but closing myself off from the people in my immediate surroundings was a way for me to still exist in a semi-apathetic state and not fully consider that Primrose was eternally dead.

So it’s now been three months, and I guess Quarantine is somewhat lonely without being able to physically speak to anybody normally. I don’t really know what to do though, it’s been so long that I’m accustomed to speaking in short monotone angry sentences whenever spoken to. I’ve never really liked almost universally recognised events like Mothers Day, but I do feel somewhat bad about not getting my Mam anything too.

558,"There has been a bird nest in / building in my neighbor's wreath for several weeks. The wreath is about the same height as me and the door is extremely close / perpendicular to mine so there are birds flying around my head every time I take out the trash/ go to my car etc. I haven't said anything about it because I don't want the nest to be disturbed and anything to happen to the baby birds inside. However, today while opening the door, a bird literally flew at my place and almost flew inside.  I quickly shut the door and thank god it didn't get in. While it was super startling to have a bird fly in my face, I'm mostly worried about one getting inside.  I do have a patio and sliding glass doors where I could hopefully get it to fly out, but it would certainly be stressful and the bird may likely die trying to find the way out. 

I've barely left my place due quarantine but I do have to take the trash out, and I'm not someone that can let trash collect without taking it out. Cleanliness is important to me in my home, so I can really store it to take it out all at once. I don't want to say anything to property management because I know they will get rid of the nest.  I really don't want the thought of having a momma bird coming back to no nest and no baby birds. It will weigh on my conscience too much to do that. What should I do?

565,"So I've been writing on a script for a comic for a long time now (almost two years), and at this point, I've come to hate it. I consider it to be somewhat mediocre, but also not necessarily bad. Honestly, I think, the issue isn't the script, but just the fact that I've read it so many times, I pretty much know the sentences that are going to follow all by memory. This makes it hard to objectively rate the script for myself.

Because of that, I've been collecting some feedback from others, and the general feedback has been - to paraphrase - something like: ""it's good, but, there's this underlying issue."" Depending on who gave the feedback, the underlying issues would some times be different. With every now and then, there being some slight overlap.
This makes it hard for me to actually judge the feedback, and what I should do with it. 

The feedback would often times sound to me like- If I'd tell my Gf something like this: ""You're really pretty, but your boobs are too small, there's something wrong with your nose, and there's this really odd looking mole on your forehead, but besides that, you're really pretty and fun"" Like, what?

566,"So, guys, I am here. I never thought I would end up in r/Advice. I bet you’re surprised why I’m here. The almighty King Duncan is asking for advice from the world WHATTT!!??? This is serious guys. I need your help. I’m having a dilemma/ mid-life crisis. By the way, sorry for the formatting, I’m writing on my phone. Before I get into the story for you guys, let me give you some background info on everyone in this story. 

King Duncan -- The King of Scotland. I like to believe I’m loved by many people that are loyal to me and I’m loyal to them. My feelings about this change as the story goes. 

Macbeth -- My loyal army general that has always impressed me and never let me down. He is benevolent and I think highly of him. His skills in war are unmatched and I one day plan to give him what he deserves. The throne. 

Lady Macbeth -- The wife of Macbeth. I’ve never really talked to her but she always looks up to something. Kind of like a witch but I shouldn’t assume too much. 

Malcolm -- One of my two sons which I’m still contemplating whether I should give the throne to him.

Donalbain -- My other son that I’m also considering giving and not giving the throne once I step down.

If you guys follow all most Reddit posts, you will surely know that I posted a post on the r/Betrayal subreddit talking about how one of my previous noble men had betrayed me for my enemies because he was a coward and power-hungry. Now, I think I spoke too soon about something in that post. See, in that post, I talked about another one of my noble men, Macbeth. Now I recommend you go and see my other post to get some backstory but basically, he’s my best fighter and army man. He has never let me down and fights off enemies with ease and twice as much force as they have. He is truly, a great warrior. In that post, I said that Macbeth is not selfish, not a coward, and especially not power-hungry. I’m second-guessing that part. Let me get to the story.

This was all right after I had heard the news about the betrayal and after my Reddit post. I was back at my main castle with my sons and a few other of my men when Macbeth and Banquo, his friend and fighting partner entered. In the beginning, it was all good until I mentioned something. I told them that my dear son Malcolm will be the next Prince of Cumberland as he has done some extraordinary things that I’m proud of him for. When I said this, I saw a shift in Macbeth's face. As I glanced towards him, it was like I could see in his mind. The surroundings turned black and purple and it was as if Macbeth and I were technically talking. This is where my suspicions and plans come into play. Following my recent defeat of loyalty with the previous Thane of Cawdor, I had started to replenish my loyalties to people and rethink the relationships I had with people closest to me. I had not thought of Macbeth being unloyal to me as I have trusted him for so long but then the comments on my last post and some thinking got me wondering. What if Macbeth and the Thane of Cawdor are a bit similar? They were both loyal to me, great friends until I gave another person a great title and both had been on the same journey. I’m suspicious of Macbeth. What if he really is like the previous Thane of Cawdor? I must be overthinking it but I can’t get it out of my head. When I looked into his face and read his mind, I could feel the feeling of distrust and betrayal in him as he felt left alone as I gave my son the title of the Prince of Cumberland. This is my problem though, Macbeth knows I trust him and respect him. He should know that he is much better than the previous Thane of Cawdor will ever be and I will give him what he deserved. Naturally, I told him that I would like to stay at his new castle in Cawdor and enjoy some of his hospitality. 

When I got to his castle, I was welcomed by him and his wife, Lady Macbeth. I came along with a few others but that is not important here. They both gave off a weird vibe. The castle was strangely cold even if it was lit by hundreds of fire torches, the stones countered it with cold darkness. We sat down and had dinner meanwhile I was glancing over at Macbeth and his wife. The others were having a pleasant time as usual. Macbeth would constantly give his wife a hesitant look and she would glare back at him and smile at me. I knew they were up to something. That’s why I’m here in this subreddit. I need advice. 

So I’m here. On my bed in Macbeth's castle, the Castle of Cawdor and I’m posting this right now. It’s about to be midnight and I feel weird. They were giving me some weird vibes at dinner and with the history, it doesn't feel right. Macbeth doesn’t seem the same anymore. So what should I do guys? Should I talk to him, give him the throne, not give him the throne? I don’t want to lose another loyal friend. Not again or else it's over for me. I’ll leave a short TLDR and comeback in an hour for the comments and advice. 

TLDR; I’m facing a mid-life crisis as I don’t know what’s going on with my loyalty with my men and who to give my throne to. 

Edit: After hearing all your advice, I’m choosing to give him the throne. Now I know it’s not what you guys said but I think it’s right. Macbeth deserves it and I will give it to him. I know my sons should get the throne but as much as I want to keep the bloodline going, Macbeth deserves it.  I will give him a lengthy speech tomorrow telling him everything I’ve seen and how I feel. Hopefully, he will like the news that when I step down eventually, he will get the throne. I can’t wait. See you guys tomorrow and follow my posts so you can see what happens. I’ll post the results tomorrow on r/Results!

572,"Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak there has been a huge focus on hand-washing and hygiene - also on making sure you leave home only for essential travel or exercise.  I was living away from home at university when the outbreak started to worsen where I live, and the place I was staying at asked everyone to move home if possible - which at least allowed us to avoid paying rent for the rest of term.

I have been living at home since late March with my parents and so far nobody has gotten sick - however my step-dad in particular is acting very irresponsible in this situation.  He leaves the house multiple times a day exclusively for buying cans of beer which he then drinks and leaves the house to buy more, and every time on re-entry he makes excuses to not immediately be washing his hands - this leads to him touching door handles, cupboards, bannisters and pretty much anything else you unconsciously touch in a house.

My fear is that this is a surefire way to spread a virus if you've made contact with it, and so I try almost every time to call him out on this behaviour - but both of my parents turn on me in this situation (despite the other taking the pandemic seriously and practising good hygiene), ""Oh give him a break he's only just come in"".  I try to explain it to them but he instead comes up with excuses to not wash his hands, he starts to touch things in the house and doesn't even think about cleaning them after he eventually does clean his hands ten minutes later after going to the toilet - the usual line is ""I'll wash them upstairs"" despite there being two sinks right in the front of the house.

I made an issue out of it today and my mum starting shouting at me and said that she hadn't brought me up to be so disrespectful.  The man has a whole host of other disgusting habits too on top of this and the drinking - but I try to stay out of these issues, as my mum is usually an apologist for all of them.

However, I feel like this issue in particular could have an impact on my health if he were to bring the virus home - and I am struggling to find ways to resolve this issue.  What could I try to better communicate how serious these sorts of actions can be?

574,"Hello. I'm currently 23 years old and an army veteran that recently got out (relevancy will be stated later)

Ultimately what I want to do is become a doctor. However, what I'm currently interested in as a hobby is learning the Japanese language. I've never had a hobby that I've enjoyed and felt so motivated to engage in. So naturally, I looked into options to further my Japanese studies. I found out I can go to one of many Language Schools in Japan, and learn Japanese full time. They aren't actual colleges where you gain a degree, buy you spend about 6 hours a day Mon-Fri learning Japanese in Japan (and it's decently cheap. 13-16k for 2 years).

I really want the experience of going to Japan and studying Japanese in Japan. However, my mom says that I should finish college and get my bachelor's degree first. The thing is, I feel like I've wasted my life and haven't done anything interesting or fun so far. I spent 4 years in the army and only got a spine and wrist surgery out of it. Not exactly the travel experience the recruiters told me would happen.

And this isn't really a matter of priorities either, I have legitimate concerns as to why I should go to Japan first. For one, the more Japanese that I learn on my own, the less that will be left to learn in Japan. If I go to college for 4 years, plus the 2 years I've already been self-studying, my Japanese could realistically become too advanced for me to get anything out of the study trip and I'd basically be paying to sit in a room and relearn everything for 4-6 hours a day. And I'm most definitely not going to stop studying Japanese and just wait.

I also thought about opting in for their shorter programs (it can be as little as a few weeks, or a full ""term"" of 3ish months depending on the school). But I really want to get the experience of working in Japan as well. The language schools usually set people up if they want to work to find part time jobs so they can have some sort of income while they're in Japan. It's something that I think would be a really good and unique experience, getting to use the language in a job setting. 

Another thing that I have considered: I might want to go to university in Japan if I like it enough. The language schools, in addition to finding work, help in enrolling in universities and usual have ties to certain schools for preferential treatment. If I get a degree first and then go to language school and realize ""whoa this is awesome. I want to stay longer"" I can't, because I'll already have a degree. The way the visa works is that you can only go a maximum of 2 years to a language school, and then you can go an additional 4 years for university or whatever schooling you want. But if I go to college in America now, I'll use up my GI bill and will have no need for or ability to gain a second degree (let alone a foreign one).

I really value my mom's opinion on things, which is why I'm asking about this in the first place. I could just straight up tell her to get fucked and that I""m gonna do whatever I want, but idk. Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe you guys can open my eyes to something that I'm not seeing.

Any questions or further clarification needed, please ask. Any information will be much appreciated.",10May2020,1
575,"My mum has stolen all sorts from me, from expensive makeup to everyday household items.

One day, my father starts to threaten to kill my mom, so I snapped after 23 years of this kind of abuse, I just couldn't take it anymore. I lost it and just attacked him. I broke his nose and he ended up in hospital. So after that, I couldn't live at home anymore. It was too much.

I've always been quite close to my uncle, so he said he'd love to have me. I lived with him for over 3 years and he helped me through the hardest times of my life. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today typing this. 

I had a bond with him that I've never had with anyone in my life. We thought exactly the same, enjoyed the same things and had some of the most incredible conversations. We were absolutely inseparable. He was the father that I always wanted and I was the son he always wanted. I even got a tattoo of his name and ""father"" on my arm, to which he broke down crying when he saw it. It was the nicest moment of my life honestly.

The only problem with my uncle is that he was an alcoholic for over 20 years. When i was living with him, he didn't really drink and limited himself to 3-4 drinks. It cost him his wife and kids, so he learned to control it now (I'd like to think). It was never ever an issue when I lived with him. He liked to have a few drinks while watching a movie and even I would join him too. It wasn't anything wild at all.

However, he's been on and off with a woman for the past 10 years. She's a shocking alcoholic and an even worse person. He has told me that he doesn't like her or want a relationship with her but he finds that he's trapped now because he feels sorry for her. 

She was always jealous of our relationship (to the point where she blocked photos of me in his house). Any time I would want to do anything with my uncle, she would get upset and threaten to hurt herself. She genuinely is psychotic, I can't stress that enough.

After finishing college, I moved away for work, which my uncle told me he found quite hard. I used to travel home once a month to see him and we'd keep in contact on the phone. However, when I wasn't there, she started calling to him more often and they'd end up drinking till all hours of the morning. I started to see a change in him. He slipped back into drinking heavily.

His life with her was now just drinking every day. After months of this, she pressured him to get engaged and he reluctantly said yes (about a week before hand, he told me he never ever would consider it). He was probably afraid of her mental state if he said no.

So when he told me, I was absolutely shocked. Seeing my uncle who i love more than anyone succumbed to this just because of alcohol. He then gave me an ultimatum and said if I don't start to get on with her that he couldn't have a relationship with me anymore. Honestly, I couldn't do that. She was pure evil and she was using my uncle for money and alcohol. He even knows this himself and has said it to me.
He knows she's horrible but just can't end it. It's because they're both alcoholics at the end of the day and that suits him.

So, I told my uncle, that I couldn't do that and that she hurt me too much to have a relationship with now. Some things are just unforgivable. As a result, I haven't talked to my uncle in over 6 months and I'm missing him horribly.

I know it probably is better in the long run to move on and get away from the both of them because of their drinking, but I'm absolutely struggling. I miss him so much and I'm up and down every second day. I feel like I'm after losing my father and best friend and I don't know what to do.

Sorry for the long post, but I'm just confused, sad and anxious about the whole thing. Any advice on how to move on from this would be greatly appreciated. I feel so lost.",10May2020,1
577," 

I am 26 and like many, I have lost friends over the year. As a kid, I had the same group of friends but naturally as we got older, groups changed but there were no hard feelings. I think when you are in school, it is easy to have friends because you are in the same classes. When I was 18, I became friends with 3 guys and a girl who I consider now to be my best friends. The 3 guys are gay, which I suspected at the time but had no issues with. Me and the girl friend of the group often laughed at the fact that we were looking to have 3 gay best friends when most girls only had 1. We ended up all going to separate universities but kept in touch and see each other sporadically over the years. In my final year of university, the girl friend of the group came out as a lesbian. I had no idea but was happy she had made the realization and was happy.

3 years ago, I moved to another country by myself with a major time difference. It was challenging to maintain my friendships with all 4 due to time zones and I feel, lazyness on their part. I understood, that securing a phone call with them would be challenging due to their schedule and the time difference, although I would love a phone call. I would write messages to them but they were sometimes ignored and often responded to weeks later so It was difficult to maintain communication.

During my time away, as I was by myself I tried to make new friendships. I moved into a house with other travelers, similar ages and in the same situation as me. We all instantly became friends as it felt like school again when you naturally become close as you close together. However, the friendships soon fell apart when one of the housemates ended up lying to us, moving out not paying rent, having tantrums (I think she had some issues), shouting, and just ended up being a bit crazy and not someone I would want to be friends with. The other housemate, who I was closer with, had a mental breakdown and ended up in a pysch ward. I ended up taking care of him but have since realized this was a lot for me to take on alone and in doing so myself care went out the window.

Because of these two separate but traumatizing events and people it has really messed with my head and my ability to connect with people. Before this , I was so open to meeting new people but now, even though I realize it is stupid and not true, if someone genuinely wants to connect with me and be my friend, I feel like I cannot trust them , make excuses not to go places, hang out with them and develop a friendship but instead I self sabotage and isolate and stay at home.

I am now back home and realize that my best friends here, although I love them, because I am not gay I find it hard to connect with them. In my eyes, your sexuality should not affect friendships but with them, all they seem to talk about it gay related things or gossiping.I n my eyes, with friends, you should be able to tell them your feelings but any time I do with them I am seen to be over sharing or the joke of the group. I feel like an outsider at time

Now I am begging to feel like I have zero friends and I cannot connect with anyone. Does anyone have any insight or advice? Or perhaps had something similar happen to them?",10May2020,1

579,"we were talking for a month, and started dating for 2 weeks after. he broke up with his ex, but insisted we be together, he fell for me fast and that we were meant to be: soulmates. he told me so many sweet things i’ve never heard of, and to this minute he says he doesn’t take it back. just yesterday he told me it’s not working out for him, he doesn’t feel romantic for me anymore the past 3 days and he started missing his ex. that night, he started dating her again. 

bit of background, we met online and he lives 3 hours away. the distance was stressing him out, and i have complications with my family with me going out, i’m practically on house arrest. i’m an adult, btw. 

he told me things like, he never felt this way for anyone else especially this fast. he didn’t love his ex (now girlfriend) and she was bad for him (she wasn’t good to him) he insists it’s none of my fault at all, i’m perfect but apparently we’re too alike which i never found to be a problem at all, he does all the sudden when he started missing her. she lives close to him, too.

how do i move on from this? i still have his stuff, and i bought him something expensive that’s still processing, i couldn’t keep it for myself because it’s something that reminds me of him.

I am 26yo man. 2 years ago I moved to Europe. With touristic visa which expired ages ago. So I have no status in EU. No, I am not African refugee.
My first place was Spain. There I spent my first year. And there I met wonderful Italian girl. Later she suggested to move to Italy and get married there. So ‘our problems will be solved’. I agreed. And now it turned out she’s psychotic bitch. My life became nearly hell. Whatever I do (even in sex) she always complains, she never accepts anything I do. She even hiding tobacco from me so I won’t smoke (while she smokes). We are both smokers. And if I say anything she replies with ‘go away to your home country if you don’t like anything’. We are married, but we never went to issue papers for my legal stay. She took the ring off my finger (how many people you know who’d do that?’)
I’d call it abusive relationship. Of course not a physical one cos I am bigger and stronger. 
I really don’t know what to do... there’s no way I’d go back to my home country. I hate it with my entire soul. 
I don’t mind homeless life, but I am in fucking Italy and I don’t speak Italian. Even worst I am in the worst part of Italy where nobody speaks English.

I haven’t been too well the past couple days (not the virus, don’t worry lmao) and I don’t know if that has anything to do with it or if it’s just because it’s around the same time as last year or whatever but if anyone has any advice on what I can do then I am very open to it.

585,"My eleven month old son was severely injured by his father when he was five weeks old. It took me a long time to actually believe this had happened, but after some time, I've adjusted. Then a few months ago he pretty much admitted to it.
Because of the nature of what happened, we both lost custody, which I gained back in March. Now that I know the fuller story of what happened, I grit my teeth every time someone asks my son's last name, which is his father's. 
I've been looking into it, and since I have sole custody and father doesn't even have any parental rights, it seems pretty easy. The only issue is my ex's family.
This is causing a TON of issues. Not just the name thing. My ex's mother refuses to even entertain the idea that her baby boy could've done something like that. Every time she gets visits with my kiddo, she makes remarks about how much like ex he is, how she can't wait for when ex gets custody, ""ex is going to love bringing you home"" etc... I've kind of let it slide, because frankly, I get it. For a few months, I was in the same boat. It's hard to wrap your mind around someone you love hurting someone else you love... But ex is going to prison soon for what he did. And I'm talking like, 12 years, attempted murder kind of charges. 
I know I have every right to change my son's name, but I don't know how to go about doing it in a way that is still respectful to the other side of the family. But they're easy to anger people.

This year I chose Art, because I want to pursue Art as a career, and Music, because Drama and Dance are terrible in comparison. (Drama puts you with completely random, unhelpful people, and Dance is Dance). Music's end-of-year topic is Bands - we have to form a band with some classmates and then perform 1-2 (already existing) songs. Due to the coronavirus, we must do this at home. We need to compose a video of us all playing together by early July. This is incredibly stressful because:

* The only instrument I have experience with is the piano, and 2 other people in my group only have pianos.
* The bass guitarist and drummer's instruments are in some way damaged, meaning they can't play properly.
* The rest of the year group voted for 'little to no teacher guidance' (why?????) meaning we haven't got any ideas on how to make our songs.
* I'm the only one in our group who is actively trying to spur a conversation on what songs we should play

593,"I (19/F) consider myself to be extremely sensitive. For example, if a stranger I asked for directions tells me the way in an annoyed manner, I will think about it for *days.* Ditto if my friend's chat response is too short. Or if some random person on the internet tells me that my opinion is trash. Basically anything even slightly hurtful will f me up for an unexplainably long time, sometimes even in a physical sense (I have a heart condition).  
I have been like this ever since I can remember (the heart thing is newer), and it makes my life so much harder than it could be. I want to be able to share my opinions, tell jokes, be loud, ask if I need to, all without knowing that a potentially rude answer will ruin my next few days. 

I feel so pathetic, I *know* that usually these rude tidbits aren't against me, these people just had a bad day or something, but it doesn't help... And even if they are against me, I should be able to receive criticism if I deserve it, but I just can't think about it rationally if said criticism is in a rude manner (if it's in a civil style, I have no problem).

594,"The day before Mother's Day, my family and I (20F) were sitting in our lounge room watching a TV show when my mum pointed out how my hairstyle made look like a grandma and that my glasses didn't suit me (the hairstyle comment has been going on for about a week now, the glasses comment since the day I got them around 2 months ago).
I'm very sensitive to criticism, especially when it comes to how I look. Recently, I started wearing this new hairstyle, similar to my mum's, and I thought it looked great on myself because it brought out my highlights and with my glasses, I thought I looked nice. 
The night before Mother's Day, mum brought it up, and I became defensive straight away, saying that I liked how I looked and I felt comfortable with it, so I'm fine with it. She argued that I don't look presentable at home, and that I should put more effort into looking decent. I retorted by saying that I'm at home, the one place I am comfortable, I can be myself and should be myself without judgement, especially with my parents of all people. Mum spoke back with things like how I stay in the same clothes the whole day, when she wears something different twice a day (I mean, come on, I'm at home, no one is going to come to meet me, and if they did, I'd change into something suited for that). I kept trying to stand up for myself but mum argued that I'm always so nice to everyone except her, that we'd never get along, and that she's accepted it now. 
This escalated way too far, even my dad got involved, my boyfriend (20M) was brought up into the conversation, and in general, I was very, very upset because I hate arguments. 
I ended up staying inside my bedroom, gave mum her present at 12am (which she liked), hugged her and went to sleep, but I was still upset. The morning after, I woke up feeling like crying and nauseous. I avoided my parents and just stuck to my normal routine, but I did help out with cooking lunch for mum. Neither myself, mum or dad spoke to each other the entire day. 
At the end of the day, dad messages me saying that I've ruined mother's day from my lack of communication or care. He argued that they've done a lot for me (I wholeheartedly acknowledge this) and that I've made it the worst Mother's Day yet. 
I replied back saying that my issue was with my mum's acceptance of me, and that the argument was upsetting and I'm not over it. He hasn't replied after that.

So yeah, I ruined Mother's Day... I don't know what to think right now, my mind is all over the place, it's been 2 days and I've barely spoken a word to anyone, not even to my boyfriend, who's starting to freak out a little because I'm always bubbly and happy and smiling but right now I'm the complete opposite.

So me and girlfriend has been dating for 3 months now, but sometimes something happens that makes me question weather I’m being a good boyfriend. I think I’m being too clingy, she has these sad moments sometimes and I wanna help but I think I’m asking the wrong way. Usually when this happens she’s on insta talking to one of my friends so I assume that she’s asking him for help(he’s gay so I doubt he’ll try to make her cheat on me) but it just makes me feel like that she doesn’t want to come to me for help. It makes me feel like I’m failing as her bf and it makes me sad. I also think that sometimes she ignores me but I think it’s just her needing sometime to herself idk. Sometimes I feel like she doesn’t want to be in our relationship, only times when I feel like she’s angry at me and I feel a sharp pain in my heart. I text her everyday but I feel like I’m just getting more and more annoying to her.  Again it’s just me overthinking...

598,"Where to begin? I am the youngest of three with two sisters, the oldest being the point of focus for this. She is my half-sister(same mom) which is only important for clarity on part of this matter. I love my sisters. They both chose to seek their adult lives at an earlier age than myself and our closeness quickly faded as they weren't around as I came into adulthood(which for reasons not pertaining to this may have been for the best). They have come to hate me, resent me, despise me, envy me, or SOMETHING. I am clueless as to what the issue is and as much as I may try to be kind, helpful and respectful of them they always seem to take issue with me.

My oldest sister has only been back in my life for the past few years and it has been an ordeal. In that time I have learned she struggles with an alcohol addiction. Whatever, we all have our problems and I want to help. Problem is, this leads to tons of bad relationships with men who beat here. Being that I am her brother and I care about what happens, this leads to me being called upon time and time again to handle these things. At the start I showed up everytime to help her. I would calm things down and remove her/him from the situation and report it to the police as well. She hated me calling the cops but I told her if this happens, the cops will be involved because, short of me killing them, it is the only way for her to take the steps she needs to keep them away from her. She gets mad saying she loves them and I shouldn't have intervened even though she called me to do just that. I've tried discussing things when she is sober, offering her help, trying to help her build a stable foundation, offered a safe environment to live in, etc. She refuses, she doesn't need me or our mother(who has done all she can to help, too); She can take care of herself.

She only seems to reach out to my mother and I when she wants/needs help. She only comes around, it seems to do laundry or wants beer money and she prefaces it with just visiting for a few days until she finally asks for what she wants and it really hurts, especially my mother, because we just want to love and help her. She disrespects me constantly when she is drunk or hurting, and even worse does the same to my mother. When my mother had a widowmaker heart attack she showed she cared to some degree but disrespected my mother by taking her boyfriend to mom's house and even bringing him to the hospital when it had been plainly stated mom never wanted him near her or her home ever again. She pulls the race card and says we don't love her as much as the other family because she is half black. She says we are never there for her when in reality we just do are best to be available without enabling her. I mean, when her father passed, we were there for her even though we both thought he was a schmuck because she had no one else. I set that aside because at the end of the day, he was a human being so he was capable of love and compassion and all of the good of humanity as much as he was the bad and I knew he loved his daughter and wouldn't want her alone in all that. I care for her not just because she is my sister, but because she is HUMAN. She doesn't see that. She just runs from us until she claims she wants help again that she never accepts.

She has had a hard life. I know it, I've seen it, and my heart hurts for her but it is largely self-inflicted and I have no idea how to help her or get her to someone who can. I know it has to start with her but I don't see that happening and it scares me. She is intelligent, beautiful, and can be so loving and I want more than anything for her to find peace in her life, but I don't see that happening.

I'm tired of being afraid for her life so often. This is a lather, rinse, repeat scenario and I fear I'm growing numb to it. Case and point, while I was asleep last night she apparently called 5 times and left a couple voicemails in which it was painfully obvious she had been drinking demanding that I come over RIGHT NOW because this ""bitch"" was threatening her life. I don't even know who the hell she was talking about this time. She hasn't been around in months. I can't check on her because after something like this she avoids me at all costs. The voicemail said she called the cops, so I left it and I know she will be mad but what am I supposed to do? We are in quarantine, I have others' health to think about, and quite frankly I'm so very tired. 

What do I do from here on out? How can I help? How can I get her help?
Am I making the right choice staying silent on this one? Should I break quarantine and go check on her? I'm just so lost and so tired and I am a trainwreck myself and not so sure I'm in the best position to make clear, appropriate decisions on situations such as these. 

I know this is a vent and extremely loaded but I have no idea who else to reach out to. I expect no answers or comments but all are welcome. I just needed to(fervently) type out my thoughts.

Much love to all of you.

599,"In recent years my mother has become very toxic. She used to be careing and kind but nowadays she never says a kind word to anybody and just complains about everything and everyone around her. This of course has gotten even worse with the recent corona outbreak and the events connected to it. 

My step-dad is constantly reinforcing her and sharing every opinion she comes up with. He's the most shallow person I ever met. He literally can't uphold a conversation about anything meaningful and just repeats the same empty and hateful statements my mom blurts out.

I got a brother but he's probably on the spectrum. The words we exchanged in 20 years would most likely fit in a book with 30 pages.

The only good relationship I currently have in my family is the one to my grandma. We share a special bond because she's an extremely worrysome person and sometimes she gets nervous about the smallest things. I'm the only one who doesn't ridicule her for this. Also she likes to ""gossip"" about the toxic rants of my mom. 

A few days back I made up my mind that I would get a job and move out, since all my friends already lived on their own and I haven't been happy in this living situation for months or even years. Today on mothers day I even announced it since I didn't want to make the same mistake as some of my friends did and just suddenly disappear. Oh boy did this not turn out as I thought it would. 

My mom said nothing and just looked on the floor while my grandma tried to convince me to wait a few years longer until I graduate from uni. Then I noticed my granny was fighting back the tears and it obliterated my heart. She then excused herself to the bathroom and I know she was crying in there. It was really awkward afterwards. 

When I drove my grandma home she basically hinted that she hoped she would have died before I moved out and I felt even worse after that. I guess I underestimated how immensely important I am to her and she thinks she won't be seeing me anymore when I move out. After I dropped her off I sat in the car for half an hour and just cried before pulling myself back together.

I am so conflicted right now. Moving out already  is kind of scary and this experience certainly didn't help. It just breaks my heart that my grandma is probably sitting in her living room right now and crying.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? If so, did it turn out to be the best that you moved out/stayed?",10May2020,1

Everyday something I did was wrong and he’d yell at me and punish me. Every little thing meant something with him. I’m sure there’s more, but I’m so used to being gaslighted and hurt that it feels normal. 

Now that I’m talking to new people, I’ve noticed I don’t know how to have a healthy relationship anymore. I overthink everything. I’m not sure how to be normal now. 

What do I do? I just want to be happy",10May2020,1
601,"Hi, I hope this is the right subreddit for this.

So I want to order something from the internet without my parent's knowledge. Even thought I know they wouldn't mind me ordering stuff online, I prefer them not knowing about it.

I thought I could go to the post office to pick up my package instead of having it delivered.

How do I make sure my package won't be delivered to my house?

Do I need to phone the post and ask them to keep the package until I come to pick it up?

I thought maybe some of you had some similar experience or something, all advice is appreciated!

602,"My sister who is 29 has had about 3-4 psychotic breaks within the last 4 months. They have been rough enough that my parents have been so concerned that they have let other family members know and tried to get them to help but she became paranoid about them and started to lash out. She is currently refusing all treatment options right now...also refusing to consider moving away from my parents which we have tried to get her to do more often. My parents haven’t been as helpful and have enabled her behavior by not pushing any progress or sticking up to her. Also they are foreign so mental illness is new for them. 


Idk what to do at this point.

2 options:
1. Wait for covid to calm down and have a convo with my parents about giving her an ultimatum to get treated or leave the house. We would help her find a job and apartment. 
2.  Convince my parents to admit her to an outpatient facility and force treatment based on a serious threat the next time she has a break.

We are both still quite young (both 15, both 13 at the time we started dating) and I honestly can’t get over her now even though I was the one to break it off as I could see things were just getting worse. She was my first real relationship, first kiss, first love, I lost my virginity to her and she lost hers to me. I thought as time went on the feeling of missing her would go away but instead it’s got worse, much worse. We blocked each other on all our socials and I honestly just don’t have the courage to try talk to her again. We both said a lot of shit that we didn’t mean (Atleast I did, I’d like to think she didn’t mean some of what she said too) it’s not even like I really want to get back with her, I just need help getting over her. It gets more painful for me each day and I really can’t see when it’s going to get better.",10May2020,1
604,"My (26m) gf (22f) wants us to go celibate. She was a virgin when we met a year ago and since this quarantine, she's been with her parents and their strong religious views and she recommended that we go celibate. I can't say no because then I won't be ""respecting her body"". She also thinks that because I spent the majority of my 20s being free and out there with sex that I should take this time to reevaluate what a healthy sexual relationship should be.

Regardless, its been a few weeks now and I'm literally dreaming about the freakiest things, I'm moody and aggressive (granted I got stronger in the gym with that aggression lol) but I'm ultimately lowkey frustrated often in the day. Masturbation and porn is not in the question because I swore it off after it would mess up my real intimacy with women but I don't know what to do. 

Its also revealed a lot about female friends I've had though. I would share with them how frustrated I am and they would ""offer to relieve my tension"".

605,"I just turned 18. This doesn’t sound that serious relative to other stories, but it’s been with me my whole teenage life even though it’s restricting.

Now my mom was restricting in not letting me go places or stay out at times even though I literally never caused trouble, but she’s pretty much took them off since I turned 18. So, I thought she would lay off more inside.

I’ve never done anything to showcase “ I can’t be trusted to help”, I can be a slow learner at times but that’s it. I haven’t gotten in trouble in school or outside before. 

So, Inside, is a different story. If I try to do anything on my own or do/learn most of the process, she comes out of nowhere and pretty much does it all for me. Washing my clothes, cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, etc, all those type of household things. I’ve  never been able to do anything by myself, and if I do, she’s watching me like a hawk which makes it harder to learn. And if I do go to get to learn, she gets annoyed because when I’m learning it takes her longer to finish up her job than if she was doing it by herself.  So she just gives me the most basic part that I already knew how to do. She also gets mad if I mess up, which is another reason she keeps me to the basic stuff. 

The thing about all this, is that because she tries to do everything herself, is that she gets mad at me for doing what I want to do and not working as hard as her. But that makes no sense to me, as you willfully choose to baby me but get angry when You’re  working more because of it. She doesn’t ask for help either, and when I ask her if she needs help she says it’s ok, the things that you would’ve been able to do I’ve done already, then complains “ I’m the only one doing work”.  If I want to learn something without her stress, I have to do it in secret.

It’s trickled into college too, because my dream college was a dorm, but she told me “ I’m not ready to live by myself or in a dorm”, and when I asked her more, she implied I can’t do anything by myself. And I had a angry meltdown because she’s the one keeping me from doing anything by myself, and people in college make mistakes as well.

I honestly think her doing all the work, while it gets her angry, makes her feel better about herself. And I kind of understand, because I don’t like asking for help and I rather do things by myself. But I don’t get angry at people or feel better about myself for doing thing myself.

It’s also led to me feeling guilty when I’m relaxing, or not helping around the house.


I know it sounds like I’m complaining about having it easy, but I want to learn so when I go off by myself I don’t have to struggle. It’s one thing to just watch someone do it or read on google but never practice it.

I don’t know how to talk to her without her getting angry or trying to make herself feel like a victim. And the times it has worked she doesn’t change her ways.",10May2020,1

There's three reasons why I think they're bastrds.
1. They yell at people visiting our house (ie delivery drivers, service workers etc) parking on our shared driveway that they are parking on ""their side"" of the driveway.
2. Speaking of sides, the neighbour's wife's mother decides to pull out all the lavender bushes on ""our side"" of the driveway.
3. The neighbour's wife poured a whole bucket of water on my cat when she was in their front yard fighting a different neighbours cat.

So I've already confronted the neighbour about the bucket scenario and he just made up some bull sht excuse about how his cats keep getting bitten from the neighbourhood cats, that's why he did it and how water won't harm them blah blah blah. I get it, like that sht's serious but 1. That doesn't explain why you poured water on my cat and 2. A bucket of water is quite excessive.

(she probably didn’t belong there i agree) i understand the pain and probably the fear she has of the institution and being assaulted as a women. that shits crazy. i that regard, us males have it much easier. but i am starting to not care about it because about every other time we talk it comes up as “i had a nightmare about it, or i’m doing a tiktok to promote the awareness of sexual assault. i like the idea of the tiktok but honestly it just feeds into the whole i can only identify her with that occurrence she talks about all the time. idk what to do. i want to be good to her but i’m starting to not to care. am i being an ass? i’m just kinda exhausted with her at the moment. what triggered this feeling was that recently she was like about to kill herself i think. she was texting me and sending pictures of her crying and stuff. but honestly i really hate this about her. she always complains about her life on snapchat and cries on her story. she’s just getting on my nerves just regular friend stuff. could you guys maybe share your experience? maybe it can help me be better for her.",10May2020,1

I wanted a regular mom all my life so badly. 

I say all this to say is it even worth trying to rebuild a relationship when nothing has ever changed? Part of me wants to move on from her like I would anyone else that didn’t treat me properly, but the hard part is the fact that it’s my mom so i’m torn on what to even do.",10May2020,1
613,"Got into an argument with my ""friend"" (idk if he still is because we never talked again after that.) and it started off with me not getting a knife behind a guy in csgo because Frank (we'll call him that for now.) killed him before i got into knife range. Obviously i got upset because i was in discord literally telling him ""don't shoot him ill walk and knife him"" three times. He kills him, i get mad and call him retarded. Obviously we're friends so i expected him to take it as banter kinda how greek and tyler used to talk to each other. At first he was laughing at my expense and i just kept insulting him, calling him stupid for not listening to me. Suddenly, he snaps back, which i expected. But unlike most banter; he, in my opinion, went too far. He suddenly goes on on how no one plays with me in our friend group because I keep commanding them to do shit and get mad when things don't go as i want it to. Fair. But then he follows up with how anyone i will interact with will never put up with me and that no one actually likes me. I get it. He was mad and now I'm going to have to get my ass blasted for not reading between the lines and checking if i was getting on to his nerves. Sadly, even if I know I had it coming i still got hurt because in the past i opened up in our friend group that jokes or insults about not having friends and being alone really fucks with me. I tell him that he's insecure that hes shit at the game and how he's coming at me with personal intent. He proudly says that it is his intent to fuck with me with those personal insults and I tell him that it is also my intent to make him feel like shit because he sucks dick at games.  We played normally (albeit awkwardly) after that sudden outburst and left the discord call after that.   


We were supposed to play minecraft with the whole group that night and i was the one hosting so i ran the server but didn't join because i was upset. Obviously we aren't that childish to fuck up the whole groups fun just because we played csgo with just the two of us and had an argument. Fuck Frank but honestly props to him for not twisting the story and not turning the whole group against me. One of the dudes in our group messaged me telling me that he's sorry for what Frank did and that he didn't mean what he said based on me telling my insecurities with them. I just said that I might just not play with them anymore since there were alot of past experiences where banter just turns into going too far into personal stuff. I told them that I understand why Frank got mad but I want to just go away and not play with them anymore.  


On to the main point. Sorry for the long ass wall of text. Now i can't enjoy my shit. Opening Spotify to listen to my usual bands? Nope. We used to listen to that on discord with music bots. Playing csgo alone? I get sick to my stomach and end up playing like shit. Play league ranked alone? Same as the last one i feel like shit because theres an obvious elephant in the room or should i say lack of elephant in the room. My friends are gone. I left them. I don't know what to do. Will this pass? Honestly regret just suddenly ""ghosting"" them but I really am still upset that Frank never said sorry and my pride isn't letting me reconnect with them again.",10May2020,1

615,"I'm a 14 year old boy incoming 10th grade in high school :) 

So, I live with 2 siblings, both older than me. I'm the youngest and contrary to popular belief, there is no benefit to being the youngest in my family. In fact, I'm the underachiever of the family so that alone doesn't sit well with my perception of myself. Another thing that really affects me are my siblings, and sometimes my own parents.

There was this one time where, before this whole quarantine thing, me and my 2 siblings and mom were out for lunch (dad's a doctor and is assigned in another part of my country). I brought up ideas for where I wanted to go to for college to pursue game development as my course and career choice. After I brought up a school of my options, my mom immediately shut down my idea and my 2 siblings ridiculed me. My mom says the school isn't credible for where it's located (i was so mad when i heard this) and because she doesn't know it. I was filled with rage but at the same time wanted to cry because when I flipped out at my siblings my mom took their side. It was non-stop ridiculing from my siblings at that time.

That's one of many times my siblings ridicule me for having new ideas. Now, my issue is that I can't try out new things without the fear of my siblings ridiculing me. Like, for example, working out and exercising inside the house. I'm a bit of a slob so I really wanted to try working out to atleast balance my productivity and laziness. Problem is I wake up at around 10am-1pm everyday and by that time both my siblings are well-awake. I've tried exercising earlier last month by waking up at 6am but I've had some personal problems since then and haven't been able to wake up at 6am due to a very inconsistent sleep schedule.

Among the many other things I want to try are instruments and singing but again, I can't bring myself to learn on my own because of the ridicule I might receive from both siblings.

TLDR: siblings often tease me for ideas I have and aside from that I'm an underachiever so that already brings my self-esteem to an all time low. How do I build my self-confidence so I can finally try out new things and be a more productive person this quarantine?",10May2020,1

But I've also come to learn that her mom says she doesn't like me and that she tells my gf I'm manipulative(my gf and I have both discussed this and decided that I'm not). There was also an incident where she took my gfs phone and read my texts when I was considering ending the relationship (because of her mom), and called me a lying bitch and mimicked what I said. This is all stuff my gf has told me. Her mom says 'fuck you' to my face(as a joke haha but not really), shes called my mom an asshole to my face, and my gf and I are rarely allowed to see eachother without her being there making both of us uncomfortable. 

Basically her mom wants to be my gfs top 1 priority, and has pushed nearly everyone else that shes been close to away, and I think that's what shes starting to do to me, because she sees me as a threat to that. 

My mom doesn't know I'm gay and if I told her how toxic my bffs(my gf) mom is I wouldn't be allowed to be near her anymore. I'm trying my best to fight against this but I'm starting to think its useless since I have so little power, and at this point I'm beginning to fear for my own safety. I really really love my gf and we have plans to move in together after hs, but I'm not sure if this is just a lost cause. Help?",10May2020,2

638,"I don’t know how lucky I am but I’ve survived many situations where the majority of people have died. 

First time was when I survived a knife attack, I escaped with only a massive scar across my face where it had to be stitched back. I’ve survived a car crash where I was hit and my car flipped and rolled multiple times. Amazingly I only came out with a few grazes but if you saw the images of the collision, people have died in less serious accidents. Yet I’ve managed to escape with barely a scratch. These are only some of the situations where I’ve narrowly escaped death when the majority of people in that situation would have died. 

I’ve realised ive become apathetic to almost everything. As if I’ve lost my personality I had as a kid/teen and I’ve become fatalistic, not caring about life or death. People I grew up with now say I’m a loose cannon. I can’t describe it but everyone has changed how they behave towards me. I don’t know if I’m going crazy or something is genuinely wrong with me. I feel like I’m an accident waiting to happen. I genuinely can’t get my head around it. It’s as if the realisation of death has changed how I behave and act because I know nothing lasts forever. I can’t value friendships because I’ve gone through so many. I only see things how it can benefit me, I can’t see the emotional side of things. I never form emotional attachments to people I associate with so it doesn’t matter to me about how they feel or if what I do affects them because it doesn’t affect me personally.

652,"I want to help my girlfriend heal from the traumatic life she’s lived but I don’t know where to start. She’s been to therapy but doesn’t find any help from it. 

Her dad was physically and verbally abusive to both her mother and her. He was a drunk and the alcohol is what eventually lead to his death. She can’t forgive herself because the last words he coherently heard her say was that she hates him. She has since forgave him and misses him but what tears her down is that she will never be able to let him know that. She believes that she trapped her mother in the relationship with her father because she was born. All of the abuse, dark times and anger in her family, she rests the blame on her shoulders. 

Recently, it seems that her emotions regarding her father have worsened. She wanted the anniversary of her father’s passing this year to be normal for once. She wanted to be able to live a normal life for that day and not find herself crying all day. But because she tried to make it normal, it seemingly has made her overall emotions worse. She has been struggling intensely with her emotions.

656,"I don't really know how to better title this. Basically, I spent quite a bit of time working with a woman. We had a great professional relationship and during that time I really started to develop feelings for her. Many of our co-workers commented how I am basically the male version of her or vice versa. During this time I never made a move on her or let any flirting get too strong. I would have loved to but she was engaged and soon to be married to someone who lived in a different state, they would be reuniting soon as well. I would never consider myself a homewrecker and honestly it would not have been fair to her if I had made a move. I don't know for sure how she felt about me, she likely thought of me only as a friend but obviously asking her to throw away a good relationship that has a high chance of lasting for the smaller chance of giving us a shot would be irresponsible regardless of how much she may or may not have been interested in me.

However, since then I have moved away and her husband joined her, they are having their first child now. To be honest, seeing the pictures of the wedding and everything did send me into a bit of a depression but I am doing much better and I am really happy for her. I still talk to her occasionally over various social media platforms strictly with the intention of remaining friends.

As for me, I have a pretty unique personality and I can confidently say finding someone I truly like and am liked in return is unfortunately pretty rare. I am trying not to compare other women to her but so far she is the only woman I have truly liked. I am moving again soon and once I do I will be more interested in dating again, I am hoping that will help as long as I do not keep holding her as the 'gold standard' because I am not sure I will ever find that again. Maybe there is no good advice here but it at least felt good to talk about it.

I didn’t really think much of it at first i guess, we’re friends and not seeing each other isn’t going to hurt us. But the last few weeks I’ve tried FaceTiming her, or asking if she’d want to go on a hike with me or we can walk her dog or something together, but still be “distant”. I miss her haha. Every time I’m greeted with a “maybe!” And then it never gets brought back up. 

She’s a pretty popular girl, she’s got a lot of friends. I don’t. I’ve got a handful of people i could trust if i needed someone, but that’s it. 

Yesterday i was telling her about something’s going on in my life that were bothering me, venting i guess, wanting to have some of that “best friend comfort” feeling and she just said “that sucks dude sorry. This movie I’m watching blah blah blah” and changed topics completely. The. She mentioned how she’s feeling sad about not being able to see her friends, so i offered to FaceTime and we could talk and she said “idk I’m gonna watch a movie and see if that helps” so i said ok. Then she went on to tell me how she just got off the phone with another friend and they talked for hours. She’s alway FaceTiming other friends, calling them, making time for them. She talks to her other friends all day long, and with me i feel like it’s more of a forced conversation. I don’t know if I’m just jealous or what. But we went from talking all day every single day, about everything and nothing at all, to hardly talking. And when i try to talk about serious things i feel like I’m met with half hearted sympathy or like she just doesn’t care. 

I want to tell her that i feel left out of the loop, but i don’t know how to have that conversation. I just am worried that this friendship has run its course and i don’t know what to do.

668,"Long emotional post, my apologies.

My paternal grandmother died on April 22nd. My cousin has made all the arrangements and is planning a small gathering to place her urn next to her parents at a local cemetery.
Grandma knew the end was coming, her health was deteriorating and made the decision for a dnr. She passed in her sleep in the nursing home.

Growing up I spent a lot of time with her. Practically lived with her as a teenager. She adored me and I could do no wrong in her eyes. And I loved her so much too.

In my mid twenties a lot of horrible shit went down with my father. It actually happened over my entire life until then, but Stockholm syndrome and whatnot, so a lot of it was normalized until my boyfriend started coming to me saying, "" hey, this isn't normal.""
So after I told my father to leave me alone, had to get a restraining order because he's a psychopath, I gradually cut everyone from his side of the family out of my life out of fear that he'd manipulate anyone I talked to and get to me through them (which he successfully did through his sister a few times) I've gone through a lot of therapy but any time he's brought up, or the thought of him arises it's like PTSD and I become I mess. I'd seen him once in the parking lot at Walmart as I was driving off and had a complete breakdown. It's insane the amount of panic and anxiety that goes through me in regards to him. I wish I could just frigging handle it.
My aunt still reaches out on occasion but I rarely, if ever, answer because of this.

She called to tell me grandma had passed and that she was unsure of any details, that my dad had messaged her on Facebook to tell her. My half sister (not my dad's bio child) ,who really has no relationship with my dad, he had also messaged her and told her to let me know I can attend any service cause he won't be there, which immediately raises red flags that he's trying to get me to go and that he'll be sure to show up. 
I'd told my boyfriend I didn't intend on attending any service if there was to be one (didn't know there was a plan for one at this point), that I would pay my respects on my own to avoid any chance of seeing my dad.
My cousin called me the next day but I didn't answer cause my immediate fear was unknown number so it might be my dad. Finally checked the message from the number two weeks later.
I called my cousin back, she'd gotten my number from my aunt.

Here's where I'm having a bit of a crisis, my grandmother understood why I didn't come around, one of her last wishes was for my father not to be around if that meant I wouldn't attend the service, that she wanted me there more than anything. She valued my feelings over her own child. My cousin doesn't know the full extent as to why I've stayed distant. She'd asked my father and he told her he'd screwed up bad. And even though he'd told my sister he wasn't going he is teeter tottering with my cousin saying he isn't going, then that he is. I told her my dad had gone to jail for 30 days for child pornography, left out the extent of what had happened to me out of it. She didn't even know he was a sex offender. So I'm guessing aside from my father, grandmother and aunt, no one knows why I've disappeared, just that I want nothing to do with my dad. I'm still completely blown away that this is a secret, these people have kids and grandkids of their own, you'd think letting everyone be informed so they could protect their families would be #1. Which kind of validates my separation from them.

My mental health has been fairly solid the last few years, but in just a few days I feel like I'm circling the drain because of this. 
I know the appropriate thing for me to do is to stick to my original plan of going to pay respects on my own. After talking with my cousin then calling my uncle, I've realized I've really missed some of the people on that side of the family and am struggling with wanting to go now to be with people who knew her too so we can mourn together and have the support of one another. If it weren't for my father it wouldn't even be a question. After voicing my fears, without going into details because I'm not quite there yet, my uncle and cousin have said I've got their full support, but they both are hoping I attend, my cousin also said she understands my apprehension but she doesn't feel right telling my grandmother's child he's not allowed to be there. She said she'd try to coordinate as best she could to avoid us being there at the same time and that other members of the family would ensure that I felt safe and comfortable. I feel horrible burdening everyone with all of this under these circumstances which makes me feel a bit guilty if in decide not to go cause they're willing to deal with my emotional turmoil aside from the loss so our grandmother so I can attend.
My boyfriend thinks it's a horrible idea and he's generally right when I'm too emotionally charged to make an objective decision. I'm still struggling so hard with this though. I don't know what to do. 
Am I completely nuts for even entertaining the idea of going? How do I reconcile the guilt if I don't go?
Thanks to anyone still here reading this.

Also I asked her if we could have a threesome, not that I would want to but just wondering her response and she responded with “no because Id be jealous or maybe the girl would want you” also I asked if I could have sex with a girl as well and she wouldn’t allow it. Should I let her have sex with another girl to fulfill her fantasies or should I just leave it at that? She’s understanding if I would say no but when she brings it up I feel as if she wants to.

678,"We have been together for ten months. Once, few months after we started dating, I was really down and depressed, so I went talk to her (WhatsApp). She told my I should get an occupation. I attend to some classes, acting, piano, english, voice acting. Quite a full week, actually. She answered I needed one that payed, a job. Because I'm an adult and must have my own money (I'm 24 years old).

I finished college one year and a half ago, to be a History teacher. I can't find any job since then. Only communitary classes. Most of places I applied to didn't even call me for an interview. Went to few of then only. Almost nobody that graduated with me has a job now. The unemployment here in Rio de Janeiro is quite high, around 12%. Applied for the town hall, there were doctors with long term experience trying and three vacancys.

I told her all that, she said I can't get a job because I don't want to, and could get it I tried enough. She said I say getting a job is hard because I'm rich. She also said my college friends are rich. My psychologist, who already graduated in the course my girlfriend is studying, said it's difficult, and also for their area. She said she's also rich.

This has made me feel really sad. I'm still hurt by it, and I think sometimes I'm rude with her because of that. I asked her to apologize, as this should fix everything. She replied she wasn't going to apologize, because she didn't say anything wrong and still believes the same thing.",10May2020,1

Little background info I'm a 17 year old female with anxiety and depression. 

I've been extremely depressed this year. I have barely gone to school, barely gotten out of bed and have had more nervous breakdowns than usual. I don't have many friends and the ones I do have all have a social life outside of me. They have a group of friends. They're busy and they're living life. I cant go a day without texting them because not having their attention makes me feel physically sick. But none of them understand that. I love them all but I want something more. I know this is probably just mental illness speaking and it's a horrible thing for me to say but it's true.

My family is great. Honestly I love them. My nan is probably one of my best friends. But it wasnt always this way. We used to live in a horrible situation. My parents had two babies within the space of 3 years when I was around 6. Both were unplanned (as was i) and we became broke. My parents worked long hours. My father had to take care of 3 children under 10 during the day and then go straight to work at 6:30. Only getting off around 4am. So he was angry and exhausted constantly. My mom worked from 8am-6pm and then had to take care of 3 kids for the evening. So our house was not taken care of. My parents were stressed and tired. So they had no time or energy to cook for us. From the age of 8-11 the only home cooked meal I had was when I had christmas dinner in my grandmother's. (Just realized I was rambling, apologies)  
We never spent time as a family but within the last few years my parents got their shit together. We moved and they both have better jobs. But I dont know how to interact with them. I mean, I have time now. I never did before. We were always active and now i find it impossible to just... Exist with them. So our relationship isnt the greatest. 

I feel like I'm slowly fading away from everyones lives and if I try to kill myself I'll either die and be unaware of sadness. Or. I'll wake up in hospital and they'll remember me. They'll care. That's all I want. I want people to care about me as much as I care about them.

681,"Hey guys, {M28]


I feel like my problem is a problem that many of us have, but I still prefer to have your sincere opinion on the subject.

Basically, I met this girl at work and we quickly got on well.  The kind of person that everyone loves, at first glance, because they are extroverted, smiling, and they give off something positive that you automatically want to share.

We got along very well - always talking to each other, we tried to see each other at work every day and from time to time during the weekends...  I quickly met her sister.  same style, a little more in control of her emotions, but just as interesting.

In my friend's team and in my team, we were gently laughed at by people saying that we were not friends and that it was more like flirting.  But (I think)she and I didn't give a damn, even if it was sometimes embarrassing.

By a happy coincidence, a couple of months later,her sister found herself working in the same team as me ( seating next to me) which was something great because we were going along super well as well...

Obviously I suspected that our relationship would change with my friend, because her sister disembarks, finds herself working with me ... necessarily we did not have exactly the same freedom with my friend, because her sister was there and wanted to be part of the thing with us. However, we had agreed with my friend to keep moments for ourselves.  the sister however did not understand why we were doing the things this way, thinking that we were a trio.  

After a few weeks we did our best to do things differently.  occasionally together, occasionally with my friend, occasionally only me and her sister.

However, I obviously preferred spending time with my friend, and when in the evening we had a drink together, I was sometimes relieved that her sister could not come because we could speak a little more freely.

As I worked with her sister, she sometimes drove me home by car after a drink in the bar.  We took the opportunity to exchange in the car once arrived in front of my house, and this, sometimes for several hours, late in the night. 

I guess at this point in history I'm a bit biased - I hope you can read between the lines and make up your own mind.  I would say the climax was the evening spent with my friend in a pub - I saw a lot of bonding between us.  I even wondered if there was more than friendship ( from her side)- On my side, however, it was clear that it was only friendship.

After that, I feel like my friend and I have lost a bit of our connection.  Little by little, we no longer saw each other every day but rather several times a week ( work related at first but then it was like that without having an extra load of work).  And thereafter, once/twice a week and occasionally on weekends with her sister - never alone. 

I then tried to see what was wrong putting the topic on the table - because I obviously felt this change.  For my part, I had a lot of stress with this situation, certainly, and for 2 months, when we went to the restaurant (with my friend alone for the lunch break / with the two sisters on weekends) I could no longer eat.  probably related to stress - I had the feeling that I was loosing control on the situation and my body reacted that way. 

several months have passed thus.  Now I feel like our friendship has changed - with the two sisters.  we are still friends, of course, but with my friend we only speak once a week, 2 third of the time at my request.  with her sister we continue pretty much normally but this is certainly due to the fact that we sit next to work. The exchanges are however more polite.  less intimate.

I suspect you are going to tell me to give up and accept the situation as such.  I tried, I discussed to find a solution.  I did what I had to do.  The problem is that I work next to her sister and that I cannot move places for the moment.  So I'm in this weird situation where we all keep seeing each other, we're having a good time - but I have the strong feeling that our friendship has weakened and is now a lot less intense.

thank you for those who took the time to go to the end and give me their opinion on the subject.  I have no questions in particular to ask you, but I would really like to hear your opinion on the situation.",10May2020,3

My maternal aunt (on my mother's side) lives by herself and she hates my guts because she hates her sister (my mother). I look like her and it bothers her. My maternal aunt tried to steal my inheritance and failed because she lost in a courtroom. She will never speak to me again because she thinks I don't deserve any. The only thing she cares about is money and nothing else.

My father is somewhat difficult to deal with. He is permanently unemployed, he stopped looking for work after several rejections because his psychological problems. He is always pestering me. He drives me crazy. My father lives with me. I take care of him. He doesn't appreciate it. The problem is he is 61 and he doesn't qualify for retirement money yet. I can't finish college. I can't do anything with my life because my life is tied up all the time with non-stop family problems. I can't go dating because he gets upsets. I can't adopt a pet because he gets jealous. I can't go on vacation by myself or visit with my friends because he gets over protective and insists he should tag along. He is a control freak and he doesn't like it when I complain about my lack of freedom. I think he is a little jealous because I got a modest inheritance and he didn't. Sooner or later, he'll qualify for his retirement money and I can move on, but I honestly don't know how to handle my father in the long term?

My second cousin is crazy and she is a bi-polar. She sometimes calls me in the middle of night, talking about personal problems, relationship problems, her boss, her ex, and she doesn't care about anyone else's problems, she is upset with me for a variety of different reasons because I don't call her enough, etc. The lockdown is driving her crazy. She accused me of behaving like an overgrown child, with emotional problems. I told her that was nonsense. She is the one with emotional problems and not me. Her behavior is getting out of control. She is jealous because I got a modest inheritance and she didn't. The source of her problems is she has bi-polar and she isn't capable of moving on with her life. Should I change my phone number and not tell her??

I am 31 year old adult woman. I can't deal with my dysfunctional jealous family anymore.

I really want to have a shot and put myself forward for this award, however, these awards are meant to be nominated by a member of staff and it explicitly says on the website that student are not to get involved with the nomination process. 99% of the time students are nominated by their personal tutor as they have supported you throughout university and know all your grades, achievements etc. However, due to strikes at the university when I joined I was never assigned a personal tutor which means another member of staff would have to nominate me.

I recently won a national award for women in STEM and also a scholarship from a professional body. However  I don’t think anyone at the university knows about this.

697,"Just a few minutes ago, I got a text message from my friends boyfriend saying that they were planning a graduation party for everyone who missed out on the regular graduation. I’m torn because, in light of recent events, I’ve kind of distanced myself from this group of people and I’m not sure if I should go or not. 

For more context, this group was made up of people I went to school with. They ended up primarily becoming my friend because they wanted to set me up with my now ex girlfriend of four months. We broke up about three weeks ago, and, since having broken up, every single person from that friend group has seemingly fallen off the face of the earth until now when it comes to answering texts or phone calls. It’s like, once I broke up with my ex, I broke up with the group.

It turns out, however, that my ex girlfriend used some hardcore manipulation and emotional abuse, and everyone in the group was aware of it but never said anything about it to me or to her. Since then, I struggled with this feeling of betrayal and made the unanimous decision that, if they were going to treat me like I didn’t exist, then why should I bother even pretending like I exist with them. If that makes sense. 

But now I’m invited to a graduation party, and I don’t know what to do. I know they’re all going to be there, and I guess I’d be able to handle that for one more time. But, knowing my ex will be there, puts things into a different perspective. The pain of the heartbreak, all be it much needed, is still a tad fresh and painful especially after coming to grips with and recovering from the toxicity and abuse.

Over the last year we've been paying more attention to our credit scores, and we've been seeing a little improvement. The problem is age of credit for us. Shes 23, I'm 25, so theres not much we can do about it.

Next, is the fact that he never wants to do anything. When we first started dating, we did things, left the house and went on dates. Now on our days off, all he wants to do is play video games. I ask him to do things, I give hints of things I want to do, but he ignores me.

Sometimes life is just hard

When you just want to find somebody you loved and at the end you found out the only thing that love you is just yourself

The older I grow, the more I see experienced (which life really hits you hard) I might not the most outstanding girl in this world but everyday I strive to go through all the suffer I had

The most heartbroken thing is when you don’t even get to acknowledged by your love ones especially your own parents because you turn out to be just a loser in this society (where you are not smart and pretty enough)

People always said that beauty does not mean anything and I don’t agree with this statement. Is just wrong stop saying that. It turns out everyone in this world like beautiful things and of course this is nature. Who does not like beautiful and magnificent item? Just ask yourself would you choose a rotten apple instead of a sweet juicy looking one? That’s what life is. I had a lot of friends, but for real ones there are only a few. And so for the people I love. Sometimes I wonder, who will be my soul mate in this life? Will I even have one? I believed that everyone had a guardian that are looking for them. I am just a girl who truly wants to find a soul mate that will willing to spend his time and do something together. I don’t want a rich guy, I just want someone who can love me for being who I am, cherish me and make my day be happy as always. However, sometimes people have different perception of views. Some people favours about having lavish life and aim for a high status in life. I don’t really mind my soul mate have to be (a doctor, a dentist, or other professional job) I believed that no matter what he is, as long as we live a comfortable life and be happy. That is all that matters. When people don’t look up to you and say something mean, u will doubt yourselves sometime. Like they will just said in front of you that people won’t look up to you cause you are not that outstanding/pretty. I tried not to bother them and laugh with it but deep down i was really hurt by their mean comments. This make me thinks that Am I really that ugly? Am I really not that pretty? Am I such a loser that no people even propose to you before?…. Negativity and mean comments start making myself questions myself. Just have lots of deep thoughts recently and i just want to find someone to chat with...",10May2020,2
706,"I have a summer job at a day camp. I'm in a supervisory position at the camp, and as part of my duties, I attend monthly meetings throughout the year prepping for the summer. This year, though, with everything going on, our last 2 meetings have been virtual.

Here's the problem - we have a meeting coming up in about a week, and my boss wants it to be in person, meaning about 15 of us will meet at the camp. About 3 weeks ago, my boss asked if we'd be comfortable meeting in person at the next meeting. Most people gave sort of ambiguous ""We'll see"" type answers, but I said I would not. Last week, my boss called me personally, insisting that there was no pressure for me to come if I wasn't comfortable, but in the conversation he implied that I was being overly cautious and that it was important that ""if we plan to open camp this summer, we need to start acting like we're open.""

For context, my boss at camp has made some comments and posts online that imply he is sympathetic to those protesters who feel that being encouraged to follow safety precautions can be likened to oppression, a take I firmly disagree with. He generally seems to think that the response to this event has been an overreaction, and that the country's main concern should be reopening the economy. I personally have been staying home completely except for biweekly grocery trips (following all recommended precautions) and solo walks, and in general feel that it's better to be safe than sorry. I live with my elderly mother and my brother, who is an essential worker. Because he is at work every day, it is a possibility that I have been exposed at home, and I don't want to be responsible for spreading it. I also personally know people who have died as a result of the virus, and maybe am a little more sensitive to this issue than other people.

On one hand, I know that the risk isn't huge if I take the proper precautions, that there are many essential workers who are asked to take much bigger risks every day, and I want to keep this job. On the other hand, on principle I feel it is wrong for our boss to ask us to take this unnecessary risk at all, and I feel some responsibility to take a stand about this. Should I go to the meeting?",10May2020,1
707,"My family always eats meals together whenever possible, every dinner during the week and every lunch and dinner during weekends and holidays. The last few months I’ve started eating in the family room instead of at the table with them, because I have a heart condition that makes my really dizzy when I stand up, walk and eat, and eating causes the worst dizziness to the point it feels and looks like I’m extremely drunk or sleeping or unconscious. I eat in the family room because I have a reclining chair that I can recline when I get dizzy and that really helps. When I eat in the kitchen, I often end up with my head on the table unable to move or speak. It’s very uncomfortable and sometimes depending how exactly I lay my head down, it gets difficult to breathe. Then I have to either stay like that for at least 30 min till the dizziness passes, or try to get to my recliner without walking into too many things or falling. My family knows that, but they miss me at the table and get sad when I’m not there. Should I go to the table and suffer to make them happy or stay in my chair? I’ve tried telling them to eat in the family room with me, but they won’t do that more than once or twice a week.",10May2020,1

712,"So last week I turned 30, and instead of being happy and celebrating, I spent it alone in my apartment ignoring the few texts/calls of happy birthday wishers. I've lived basically the loneliest life imaginable thus far. Never had a gf, still a virgin, and back in college finishing my degree. Obvs I had bad self esteem and/or confidence issues that put me in this spot. I only have a few people I would consider ""friends,"" but even they haven't wished me a happy bday so that should tell you how close I am with them. 

I'm just extremely disappointed in myself to allow myself to hit rock bottom when I had so many years to change things up. Every year that goes by I tell myself its too late to change anything. When I was 25, I told myself the EXACT same things. I just feel completely hopeless and even if I thought change was possible, I keep telling myself its too late. Part of me wants to close the chapter on my non-existent twenties and start fresh now, but the other part of me thinks in order to have a good 30s you first needed a good 20s. 

My biggest problem is in order for me to change my life, I have to accept that I wasted it up till now. That's an extremely tough pill to swallow. And I'm afraid of not being able to change anything bc of how deep of a hole I put myself in. My life will never be as good as it could have been, and to have a life at say 30% instead of the 100% if I made changes 5-6 years ago is not appealing. 

Like I have all these things that I want, and to 99% of people it comes easy to them, but for me it seems impossible to attain. Like a gf, job I'm happy doing, social life, being close with family. And to have those things I first need to change myself - I can't be miserable and unhappy and expect a girl to fall in my lap. But bc I have NONE of those things, I can't be happy or confident. See how fucked I am? So any advice you can give will be appreciated. Thanks",10May2020,1

I only sleep once a day for 7-10 hrs and between 12 AM to 7 AM generally.

my father has been complaining it to me that i must not remain awake after everyone else had slept as turning on lights all the time will cost a huge electricity bill, which cant be the case because if he actually cared about the bill he would have been turning off the AC and other things when not needed.

Today, he comes to me and says that in any circumstances i am not allowed to wake past 1 AM and i can think whatever reason i want to for that (since i told him that i didn't had lights on yesterday). My mother thinks that i do this because i wanna copy my well-settled cousins and wanna live like them.

My question is how do i tell them that i need some space, some time alone in silence when nobody is around me, that i cant even study when they (my father,mother, brother) are around. i dont want them to think that i wanna be away from them because i really dont and i do want to spend time and talk to them. i just need some time. Also, I dont see the point in waking up early for now as i dont have any online class so i can peacefully study or do anything else at any time.

Dont get me wrong they are really understanding and supportive most of the time. so i dont wanna break their hearts.

They prolly think that i am into some fishy stuff that i dont want them to see.

But last night she brought over this guy that she knows I don’t like cause when he comes over he doesn’t leave for like two days he smells like shit and all they do is party and be super loud. So she invited him over last night (said sorry when she told me cause she knows I don’t like him) and he came over, I hid in my room as I don’t want to be around the partying. As the night goes on I’m just laying in bed not able to sleep the music and their talking is loud so I ended up leaving to go hangout with a friend maybe make time pass.. as I’m getting ready it’s all silent but then I hear her moaning (their in our living room) so I slammed my room door.. then it happened again and I can hear it through my room cause it’s next to the living room so I banged on the wall.. they just laugh at me so I just grabbed some of my stuff and left to go watch a movie with a friend.. I came home like two movies later and they’re naked on the couch staring at me.. I just felt uncomfortable as I cannot even go grab water or eat food cause it’s right by the living room. So I went back to my friends house (2am at this point) I slept there cause I just felt uncomfortable &amp; couldn’t sleep. 

This is not the first time, plus I have made it very clear that I’m not happy about when he comes over and the drinking cause I don’t want to be tempted to drink. I just got home again and they’re in the living room just watching movies.. I am going to leave to go to my moms house cause I am legit just stuck in my room cannot go study at the table. I just need advice I guess in how to approach her when he’s gone and I come home again?

I don’t bring people over that she doesn’t like or anyone at all cause I don’t like to..

The site started running a mentorship programme for people to learn how to give critique and help the writing along, and I signed up.

--
A little bit about him, he has always been sort of a ""one upper"" but this has gotten worse in the last 6 months. To the point where if you say something you're excited about he will very quickly say something bad that could come of it. It's depressing to be around, and feels like he is just trying to crap on you. 

No matter how you try to help him with anything, it's wrong or not the right way because it's not what he thought of. We have had a few very deep discussions on our lives in the past and one thing I have noticed is that he does not agree with anything about himself unless he says it. I have even tested this as I will exclaim something about him I observed, he denies it with the opposite, then a few weeks later I will exclaim the same thing he said and he will deny it. It's very frustrating for me as I want to help my friends whenever I can but he will consistently counter everything I say, even on non serious topics. 

-

I have never been extra pushy on him as he is a private person, and have taken a step back from trying to help him get out of his bad mood for months now. But he is only getting worse. All he does is mumble now, say negative things about everything, complain and even make snarky remarks about our other friends about the smallest things. I've gone through a friendship similar to this and I am not going to be dragged along again by someone who is being negative and pulling me down every time I am around them and refusing to accept any ideas that come from outside of his mind.

I am very reserved even though people usually think that I have slept with a lot of people). \*\*\* I am not saying this to toot my own horn.

Those are the reasons why I believe I would be good at bottle service. BUT.. I am very scared of working at the club. I get really anxious about doing new things before I start, especially applying (I think when clubs do re open I will definitely struggle to get myself to actually apply), and being so shy and anxious definitely affects my ability to do things. I am also really scared the girls there will be rude, catty, and not accepting .. It's like I have so much confidence talking to guys, but I think if I was working I would get really nervous in a way.

So I've been wanting to do bottle service for a while now, I think I would love the attention and it would be an amazing experience and good money (and just sounds like a fun job over all)...

has anyone else done bottle service (or bartending or stripping etc) and have any tips/tricks to stay calm, or any advice for how to apply etc?

How was your experience? What are the pros and cons?

And my friend is a 21 year old blonde who is  a very lively and shorter than average girl with no past relationships(as far as I know) and she loves when someone plays with her hair.

So when I first went to university I was in German Teaching but after a year of not being able to focus and struggling with my own problems I changed my thingy (profession maybe) to Tourism and Management. 

And in the first day of my second school I was sitting in class as I always did since the elementary. A hand poked me in my shoulder and asked for a lighter and I gave it so we were friends from then on. 

I can't tell everyday of my 3 years with her but our relationship was steadily getting better and healthy in that period. We have a small group of 5 friends (my and her best friend) and we go to movies, picnics, concerts etc. and we have good times overall. 

That feelings started to develop in me last summer when we did an internship together and has been increasing since. We also started to watch movies at her place (she stays with her friend) and in the last 6 months of watching movies she started asking me to play with her hair. 

She put her head on my lap and I knew that there is a bunch of nerves in the scalp and I practiced some massage things when I was bored back then. Anyway I started doing my thing and she liked it so much and I felt damn good about myself and it happened a dozen times after that we also stayed up talking until sunrise a couple times. 

So in the end I like this my best girl friend and I did that before to another girl and when I confessed she said no and I have this weird rule that I never stay friends with a girl that I liked before cause it hurts everytime I see them and if I see them with another guy things can get ugly. I like her friendship but if I don't say anything I may never will cause this is our last year in college.

He said Joe was getting in the shower, so he wouldn't hear a thing. I said I didn't want to do it, but as soon as I heard the water start to run, Jack grabbed my breasts.

Then Joe jumped on him and the two wrestled on the ground for a couple minutes while I was trapped in the corner on my bed.

I had told them that I would not bail on them partway through and that I wanted to do this (Not on a contract). Normally I would want to do the job, but I am not sure if the physical damage to me would be worth it.

 Now with Canada's student benefits, I would be able to earn $1000 a month and receive $1250 a month from the government, which would give me $9000 over the summer. I could quit my current job and find a part time job, and work only 16 hours a week to make just $3000 less, which would save me 324 hours over the summer. Although I need the money for debt, I feel that working so much longer and possibly permanently damaging my body for that amount would not be worth it.

I don't want to just quit out of the blue and leave them without a installer, especially since I said I wouldn't and they have been very nice, but I also don't want to be stuck doing this job when I could make a bit less and save tons of time. I was thinking about letting them know that I was going to work this next week to see how a full week will feel and if I could do it, but that if the labor is too intensive that I would have to quit for my own health.
Would it be appropriate to text my manager to let him know how I am feeling, or should this be done in person, if at all? How would I go about letting them know that its too demanding of my body and that I have to quit in the kindest way, since I don't want to upset them.",10May2020,1
743,"A few days ago something odd happened to me

Well, I didnt sleep the night it happened, but that is mostly because I woke up on 2pm, so it would make sense that I wasnt exhausted at the time. Well, I was a little exhausted because my mother got drunk the night before, but it wasnt that bad. She was only singing loud and that's it. No drugs, alcohol or medicine was taken the night before.

Well, it all started in the kitchen. I made myself breakfast and was about to leave the kitchen, but then I saw (not directly, but from the corner of my eye) at the door a Dog with a deformed face. When I looked over to the door, it was gone. I was scared, started trembling and shaking (it felt like I was going to die). I took my plate with my food and was ready to attack it. When I walked out and it was gone. After that I ran to my room.

The things that happened occurred in a matter of 2 hours, so I will need to list them:

* I was laying on my bed, covered in blankets, and I thought that my body morphed into the one of an insect, so I was scared to take it off (I did anyways and I wasn't).
* I googled what to do against it (I thought it was a panic attack) and it told me to hold things, but when I wanted to take something and hold it, my brain made me think that there were thousands of them under each object. No object was touched or moved in that situation.
* A bit of spit came out of my mouth (on my lips) and I slipped it back into my mouth by slurping it up, but when I did that, I got scared that the people watching me poisoned it and then I imagined people putting poison in my spit inside my mouth, so I tried not swallowing my spit.
* At some point I was curled up crying 2 teardrops, which felt really good.

Something, which I also need to mention is that my view of the world is odd. I believe that I am on some kind of show/experiment and that people are watching me, but I also believe that anytime where I dont see or hear my friends, theyre being tortured. Its not something I always think of, but when it comes up, I get worried and uncomfortable. Any time I see a new person (be it online or outside, I often think ""What if I am right and because I met them, now theyre going to be tortured when I dont see them.

This idea of the world doesnt always appear in my head, but it appears at least once per day and I think its because of the quarantine thing. I miss talking with my friends (Not that much about my problems, but just in general.

747,"so basically i (f19) have this online friend (m19) i’ve been friends w for the last 5 years and he’s nice and all. but he’s really fucking annoying sometimes and super demanding. he always demands i send him selfies and shit like that and it’s so annoying. i’m not a confrontation person but i paged him on this multiple times and what not. 
so i video call him every once and a while even tho he asks all the time because everytime i do, right after we call he becomes super demanding. he’s not bad to talk to on call but like the way he acts sometimes just pisses me off and makes me not wanna talk to him. 
the last time i called i told him we can watch a movie one day and literally the day after he started becoming annoying telling me to hurry up what i was doing that day and all. 
don’t get me wrong he’s a good friend and nice but sometimes it’s just really annoying. even tho he doesn’t mean it seriously and i can just page him about it and he’ll understand. it’s just irritating. 
these day’s i just ghost him every time he wants to call and stuff or tell him i’m busy (which he’ll ask with what and a bunch of other questions). 
i facetime my other best friends regularly  and i’m gonna face time a mutual i have with the friend in question, and i’m just worried he’s gonna be even more annoying about it after he finds out. 
i don’t really know why he didn’t get the hint since i’ve been doing it for the last 5 years and i’ve been doing it a lot lately and being kinda rude/dry. 

tldr: basically how do i tell someone i don’t wanna facetime him specifically because he’s really annoying sometimes, without being rude.

750,"Hi I am a 21 years old Asian girl, and I want to know what people like me do on Mother's day. I have an Asian mom that seems to be well probably bipolar and angry. She doesn't answer my questions at times, screams and being rude a lot including to my hardworking Asian dad, doesn't ever consider saying sorry to me for being mean to me these many years, never learns to be a better person even if there are many obvious opportunities to be, and she never seeks help for herself to get out of being negative. She barely compliments me, and moreover, just focus on what I do wrong and just merely tell me that something is wrong with me when she does never do anything to think of resolving the issue. After all these years, I feel like I wish I could get away from my mom. I never felt the emotional warmth I need, and I believe she is much responsible for slowing my progress in terms of personal development(such as self-confidence and knowing who I want to be and having positive feelings and how to be good at being social and life choices). She's just busy being quiet keeping to herself about what's wrong with her and giving off miserable vibes. Some good things I could think of are times for instance, when we saw/talk about something funny, playing with my pet dog, sometimes help me check if I dress ok, give me food, and that one time she complimented me on having a clean room, but I feel this just doesn't justify the hurt and continuing negative emotions she gave me all these years and still is. It's ironic that one time she asked me why I am giving off a negative vibe during a family trip when she just seems oblivious she always and is still giving off a negative vibe herself. Heck she even made me doubt Christianity since she just shows anger and just tell me to read the Bible and pray when I don't see her do those things. Moreover, I just don't feel like over the years she doesn't deserve the respect I would give to a mom. I am dealing with a major depression, and I dropped out of college since a semester ago to try to have more time to think of the best career choice I wish to have. Also I am seeing a therapist. 

I hope I described best of what I could about how it affected me. I hope someone here feels my pain in terms of living with a mother who makes me feel conflicted with the negativity(mostly) and positivity my mother could alternate between that I wonder if I have something like Stockholm syndrome(maybe because something inside me wants to love my mom but my mom always make it hard).

752,"First time i'm posting on here, and nobody knows i'm on reddit, since it's not popular in my country. Also, English isn't my first language or my second, so be patient.

For context, i've been living for almost 3 years with my bf in his parents place rentfree to save up to buy our dream house. We have bought it, but the firm first has to finish the interior (place the kitchen, bathroom, floors etc.). 

Today (mother's day) we were having a barbeque with the family (me, my bf, his mom and dad and his younger brother). We were talking about a lot of things, and sometimes things get a bit heated since opinions differ (this is normal in this family, they fight over the smallest of things) but things went on. Suddenly the younger brother went outside to smoke, and the mom said he'd gained a lot of weight, to which my bf responded ""haven't we all?""

The younger brother came back in right after that, and because when the mom said the comment on the weight, we looked at him, he knew what was said, since she says it practically daily. He got angry (he's sensitive about his weight, he used to be chubby, got it turned around with gyms but he let himself go with the whole COVID-19 situation). 

Anyway, things got heated, tempers flaired, and inexcusable things (from my bf, his mom and his brother) were said.

Some of the things the mother said to my boyfriend:

* You're a piece of crap
* Nobody in the family likes you
* Loser
* You ruin everything
* You're not my son anymore

My boyfriend is someone who is hardheaded, tries to show that nothing affects him (but it does, especially from his parents and brother) and will not break down in front of anyone if he can prevent it (i'm the only exception he's made on that rule, cause i can calm him down).

He's apologised to his mother, but she keeps saying he's the cause that mother's day lunch was ruined, that she hopes he's happy, and that she'll never do anything for him again.

We are going to be living here for at least another month before we can move into our home, but i don't think it's wise if this is the way we're going to be living here.

753,"I (M16) had to end my first relationship a little over 2 months ago. I loved that girl so much, I would always compliment her, see if she was ok, and make her know that she was the best girl ever. We dated for about 4 months, we went as far to second base and no further. We broke up one time in January of this year. She broke my heart, but a couple days later that Saturday she texted me saying she missed being with me. Now that I look back on it, I should not have taken her word on that and gotten back with her because that is where stuff really went downhill. We already had some problems like her not opening up to me, she would not talk about any of our problems, and she blamed everything on me. By doing that she made me very depressed and insecure about myself. 

She never really told me that I looked handsome or she loves me unless it was when I said good night or good morning to her. She would always get pissed me when I asked if she was ok. She also just would not talk to me, she was all giddy and happy for cuddles, kisses, and me holding her hand but never wanted to talk to me. She almost was like two different people, when we texted she was a whole different person, she was nicer and just overall acted better towards me, but when I saw her at school or anyother place, she was a jerk. I would ask what's wrong and then she would start a fight with me. 

The defining event that made me want to break up with her was when we where at a superbowl party. She invited me and I gladly came. I was stoked to see my cute and very much loved girlfriend but when I got there, she acted like I did not exist. She ignored me the whole time and was mean to me the whole time. I should have left early but I stayed and it made it worse for me. She would not talk to me and her friend noticed that so she basically forced us just to talk but at that point I just wanted to go home and stay in my room and blast my music in my headphones and cry. I left that party with one thing on my mind, which was breaking up with her. I didn't break up with her that monday and everything got worse. 

We had more fights that week, it was more me trying to tell her that I'm hurting and we need to fix our problems. We had a pretty big fight that friday. This is still the same week as the party that I went to the superbowl party. On that Friday we hung out. She would not talk about our fight or try to fix it because for the only reason is because we where at Wendy's. That did not help me, she played little to no attention to me and just was mean to me. I bought her all of what she wanted to get at Wendy's. Never really got a thank you. I realize now I should have stayed home and played video games or played my guitar. 

Now we are getting to the end, I'm sorry for it being so long I just want you guys to know everything. Through out our relationship I said some things because I was angry at her or did things. Like I ignored her to try get it to her that I was not okay. In that same week as what happened Friday and the same week where I went to the party. We had another fight, she decided that it was a sin ( we are both Christians) to cuddle, kiss, hold hands, and hug a certain way. I'm not kidding. Which if you read the bible well, that is not a sin. The next day after that Sunday I finally pulled the plug. I broke up with her over text and in the middle of school. Stupid, ik but I was so done. 

After that we had some more drama. My friends told me that confessing how I felt to her would help me move on. I tried to talk to her but she ignored me and starting saying she was scared to talk to me because she was afraid that I was going to physically hurt her. I did not want to do that at all. I was calm with her, I asked her to talk to me calmly but she still said that. I finally was able to tell her how she made me feel, she dodged the conversation and made it about herself. 

Im over her and just done with her. I'm trying to close that chapter on my life but it feels like the memory of her in my head wants me to remember all that pain I went through. Emotionally I'm like glass. This is my first breakup, I loved that girl so much but I got hurt so much in return. I'm sorry for such a long post and any feedback is taken and appreciated. Even if it is criticism of me I'm ok with it. What I need help with is, how do I close that chapter of my life? How do I let go?

755,"Hi everyone, I hope you’re all doing well right now. Im really hoping for some outside perspective on a couple things I’m considering

I’m a [23F] American who was just accepted into a English-language environmental masters program in Norway, which I had applied to before all this happened. I graduated from college in the US last year and have had a pretty solid engineering job for most of the time between graduation and now. I have been really lucky both in terms of getting a job so quickly after college and being able to do it from home once quarantine kicked in here. I’ve been living with my parents to build up a year’s rent in savings—since Norwegian universities are tuition-free, I just have to have a full years rent ready to go at the start of each semester to prove I won’t have to drop out halfway through due to living costs.

I’ve also been looking at apartments in my area in the US as a backup plan in case I didn’t get in and found a really nice one where I could have an art studio and home office for really cheap. Art is always something I enjoyed and was good at, but had to put aside for studying, and to work from home and have a studio would give me the chance to dedicate time to practicing a skill that really makes me happy. 

With the coronavirus situation, the university has been really unclear with the admitted international students about whether we will be able to get visas or whether classes will be online, and that’s because they themselves don’t know. Admissions results were delayed by a month so they could figure out whether certain departments would even take international students this year, and now we only have twelve days or so to make a decision. They say they’re planning to have in-person classes in the fall, but they also denied all international applications to programs that “require a great deal of physical presence and would be too difficult to find adequate digital solutions,” so they’re obviously keeping a fully-online semester on the table. Deferral is not an option, but I can apply again next year and I’m pretty confident I would get in again. 

I have a lot of worries about doing it this year. I’m worried about moving to a place that’s going to be in lockdown and not being able to make any friends when I’m away from my family and American friends. I’m worried about the travel itself (3 plane rides at least). I’m worried about never getting to meet my professors in person and paying all this money to rent a place in such an expensive country and never getting to go to a lecture. I guess if I could boil it down to one worry, it would be that I’m going to be cold and alone and have no means of meeting anyone once I’m there to make it better. 

I really like the program though, and having a masters degree at 25 would be amazing. I study climate change solutions and I feel like every year I’m not moving forward in that field is wasted time. Norway is the best country for studying sustainability and earth science, and living in a place with glaciers you can reach by public transit would be one of the greatest experiences for someone in my field. Plus, I lived in Denmark for study abroad in undergrad and visited Norway a couple times, so I already have a good idea of what to prepare myself for culturally. The climate science courses I took in Denmark were 100X better than any I ever got to take in the US, and I know they’d be even better at the university I applied to. 

All of the family members I’ve asked advice for say I should go, especially my grandmother who moved from Spain to the US in her early 20s. My dad made the point that the longer you go without being a student the harder it is to pick back up, and that delaying for a year ends up meaning delaying forever for a lot of people. Another friend told me that since Northern Europe has managed its outbreak relatively well, my life might be less impacted by COVID there than it would be here. She mentioned a friend of hers who was traveling in the Netherlands and “forgot there was a pandemic” with the way everyone was acting.

Even my boyfriend, who I really love, told me I should go, even though it would mean leaving him. We’ve been separated by quarantine since he goes to college here but comes from another state, and I might not ever see him again if I go. I didn’t know the last time I saw him that it would be the last time I saw him.

Thank you if you made it to the end here, I know this got long. I really want to hear advice from actual international students who’ve been navigating this whole situation already, but all advice is good. My grandmother told me I would regret it if I didn’t go, and I think that’s true, but I would have to trade a nice situation for a lot of uncertainty to join this masters program.",10May2020,1
756,"I posted this in another subreddit but it wasn’t gaining much traction so hopefully it does here. To clarify I’m a dude and this post is about another dude that I’ve been friends with since high school (we’re both 23 now). Anyways I hang out with this guy a couple times a week to smoke weed and drink and just talk about life since we’re both young and have similar interests. I live with my parents but we’ve been hanging out at his college apartment more because no one else is there so it’s a place where we can smoke/drink as much as we want without fear of being caught by anyone. This guy has told me that since high school it looks like I have ‘evolved from charmeleon to charizard’ noting that I have put on a sizeable amount of muscle and have been going to more expensive barbers and having good fashion sense. The thing is I have met this guys girlfriend so I thought he was just being nice and took it as a compliment. 

Fast forward to the other day we had been drinking quite a bit and I was in no position to drive back to my parents house so he suggests that I sleep over and I said thanks that’s probably a good idea. So I grab the couch in his living room and he goes off to sleep in his room. Fast forward to later that night I wake up and he’s feeling up my upper body like my biceps and chest and I tell him wtf are you doing and when I look at him I see he’s completely naked I tell him fuck no I will beat your ass to a pulp if you take one more step towards me then I’ll call the cops . He goes back into his room and under the covers and when I go into confront him about it he acts like he’s knocked out. I grab all my belongings and drive back to my parents house. He texts me the next morning asking me what happened because he sincerely doesn’t remember. I tell him and he profusely apologizes saying he doesn’t remember and was drunk and couldn’t control his actions. I tell him I don’t think we should hang out anymore cuz I’m not gay and that was completely uncalled for and had me jarred for awhile. He said it’s not fair because we all do weird stuff when we’re drunk. 

Thing is dude is actually a really nice guy and gives me a lot of weed and alcohol and food for free and rides whenever I need so I’m genuinely confused as to whether I should eventually (not for a few months) maybe smoke some weed with him again (not at anyone’s house) or if I should just steer clear.

ok so i’m gonna debrief the situation as best i can. bear with me, this may be a long(er) post. 

i’m 17 years old. my parents divorced when i was 11, and we moved to victoria, british columbia about 6 years ago (my dad is in the military so he gets posted roughly every 4 years). my mum lives about 30km away from downtown victoria, and my dad about 10km. my dad moved to victoria 9 months before the rest of the family did, because he wanted to get set up and accustomed to the city for his work. during this time, he met someone and fell in love with her. i’d say their relationship was pretty decent for the most part, they never fought or argued and shared lots of common interests and viewpoints. 

fast forward about 5 years

my dad and his girlfriend broke up (they mutually decided they needed to work on their own personal things or smthn like that, kudos to them for taking things maturely). 

fast forward again about 8 months. 

my dad starts looking into dating again, and finds a nurse who’s looking for someone on tinder. they kick things off, and everything seems to be going good for them. 

however, this is where things start getting really weird and confusing for me. 

my dad is still actively seeing his current partner, but simultaneously seeing his ex. the whole family is convinced he isn’t telling his current partner the whole story. for instance, he’s still seeing his ex about 1-2 times a week. today he’s going on a 4 hour bike ride with her. 


how do i bring this up with him without seeming rude or intrusive? ofc i want the best for him and his relationships but i don’t feel comfortable with the thought that he may be cheating on his current girlfriend. 

(side note: i got kicked out of his house almost a year ago for drug stuff (woot mental health issues), so i live full time with my mum. my brother and sister are on a weekly rotation between houses, and my parents are still in contact because they’ve put their divorce on a different plate than the rest of the family) 

anyways, TL;DR

i think my dad is cheating on his current gf and i have no clue how to talk to him about it

So to some of my friends who I never told any of this stuff to now think I’m down, because I’m not as bubbly as I used to be. I don’t want them to see know what’s been going on or see me that way, it wouldn’t be fair on them. Although I still need a way to convince my friends that I’m okay. Any advice?",10May2020,2

765,"For starters I have bipolar depression and Emotional Deprivation Disorder. I had an extremely abusive father who pretty much tormented my life for about a decade.I’ve tried to seek help, talk about it but it does only so much. 

I keep doing things to push people away; friends, family anyone that can potentially bring a slight amount of joy to my life. 

I noticed that I subconsciously make decisions that lead in people hating me and eventually distancing themselves from myself. I don’t know why but I have this mentality where I keep thinking that I don’t deserve a single speck of happiness and man’s hatred is the only thing that I should feel. 

My last mental breakdown caused me to lose any friends I had. Because of the pandemic I had to move back in with my parents. I try my best to suppress these urge but it occasionally slips out. Especially in front of my step father. He is a really great guy and I consider him to be my actual dad over my biological father. At home I have been in slightly higher spirits than when I was by myself but each moment of laughter of slight happiness I feel I sort of automatically repress it with a shitty moment from my past and try to put up face so I don’t worry others.

As of now I haven’t been in a relationship since early 2017 and I can’t form any sort of emotional connections besides the ones I currently have, there were times I was asked out by sincere people who I could possibly have a future with but I kept shutting them down in meanest ways possible. 

I’m really at a loss of what I could do change myself I don’t think I have any suicidal tendencies as of right now, I just want the world to hate me which if I look at it now is a very narcissistic desire albeit  i don’t think this feeling stems from narcissism.",10May2020,2
766,"I am a transgender male (19). I just got an apartment much closer to my college and I am living with a roommate. 

7 years ago, I came out as transgender to my doctor and therapist. I did not come out to anyone else or start living as a man in public until a little over a year ago when I became a legal adult. My friends at college and my roommate were extremely supportive of me and so was my father when I finally came out. My mother, on the other hand, was somewhat upset. She is slowly coming around (although she still does not use my preferred name or pronouns) but she thinks that I need to accept myself as a woman. I told her that this is my life and I want to do what makes me happy. I have my own health insurance, my own home, and I'm a legal adult so financially I am not hurting her. However, I do understand that this must be stressful for her. I am living full time as a man currently and my endocrinologist has cleared me to start HRT in the near future.

Now, there is a problem that has been bothering me for a while. My mother's extended family is very religious and they do not accept homosexual or transgender individuals. They believe that people such as myself are sinners and will go to hell. I have not told them yet that I am transgender and my mother has not told them yet either. I don't think she plans to until she absolutely has to.

I pass very well as a man now and since I am beginning HRT very soon, I will not be able to keep this secret from them once the holidays roll around and the family gets together. I love my family very much and would never want to hurt them, but this is who I am.  I am concerned that they may cut ties with me and potentially not allow my part of the family to attend family gatherings because I am a ""sinner"".

This may seem like an outlandish fear, but they have already done this to my family a few times before. My aunt and uncle (my mother's brother and his wife) did not invite us or my grandmother to celebrate Easter with the rest of the family one year because we do not go to church regularly (I am an atheist but my mother is catholic like them). They also excluded us from multiple other family get togethers throughout the years for the same reason.

I do not want my mother to become alienated from her family because of me, but at the same time I fear she might take their side. I don't want to lose my family and I am unsure of how to handle this situation. Any advice would be helpful but please be respectful in the comments.",10May2020,3

769,"Hi reddit, 
Basically any advice wld be taken gratefully. 

I've suffered a lot lately, theres been a lot of things going on that hv made me depressed and negative, and lose sleep. My mind is constantly racing.

All ive experienced is that the more you feel the more you will feel pain. 
I'll admit, I think in one respect with certain things I am overly emotional.

That's what I want advice on, how can I truly stop feeling emotion for others. How do I gradually shape my mind to not care for people and focus on me.

By the way when I say not care, I dont mean be a complete arsewhole, I mean hv the ability just to cut people out of my life when I need to.

To stop feeling weaknesses such as lv, hurt, pain, compassion, regret for people, and to focus on myself.

I want that feeling of having nothing to lose, not caring abt my actions. Or loss and worry. 

I really hv concluded that people are far better off having no  emotion.
I rlly dont want to keep saying why I feel this way and what caused me to but if u need to know it on my posts, I've posted a lot olkon it and just dont want to keep repeating myself.

The only time I felt slight better was when I planned on hanging myself cus ii didnt have to think of the future

And yes I hv had therapy, it doesnt help me I dont think.

I get woken up by him screaming his lungs out in the living room in front of my mom, my hands begin to sweat as adrenaline rushes through my whole body. I've been conditioned to feel fear as soon as my father raises his voice, as he becomes completely irrational and unpredictable in his drunk state. 

A few months ago he became physical for the first time. Long story short: my mother got hit, I had to defend myself and my mother by using pepperspray on him, the police got involved. 2 Weeks of relief, me and my mom split up to live somewhere else for a while. 2 Months later my dad supposedly bettered himself, we moved back in together. Naive decision.

Right now I am sleeping with pepperspray right next to my bed, fearing that he might kill me in my sleep. The fear might be irrational, but I have the feeling he wants revenge. He does stupid things when he's drunk, then apologizes when he sobers up again. He bought a big knife off of Amazon a while ago. When I asked him why he got one, he answered with: ""Just felt like it"".

I don't have enough money to move out, as I am currently unemployed. I am waiting to go to University this October. I am seeing a therapist every 3 months. I don't really have anywhere to go.

I have tried to explain to them my reason, but they get mad and my father repeatedly will tell me how bad of a mood he is in, and that he won’t talk about it. 

A little background, my parents caught me smoking weed about a year ago, and trashed my car, my room, took all my stuff and threatened to report me to the police. This was right after I told them I was considering wake tech, so they accused me of wanting to just smoke weed and be lazy, instead of go military. I would like to state now that they are GREAT parents, I love them and for the 99% majority of the time they are just awesome. 

Ill explain now why I am not for military. I haven’t felt a draw towards military since i was like 12, but I made a huge mistake saying I wanted to go military then, because my parents took it and ran with it. I want to go to college, I want to be able to have fun with my friends, and I want to study business and marketing. I want to be able to smoke up occasionally. I want to have my hair. I don’t want to do the desk job I’ll get cause my visions sucks. But I want to make my parents proud as well, and they won’t be proud unless I go military.

780,"My partner has had her dog, a ~3 yo border collie, for the past 2 years. They had gotten the dog when the original owner (OO), a close friend of my partner, couldn't care for him anymore due to their rent agreement/living situation.

Cut to now, and my partner and the dog have bonded immensely. In particular, he's been great for emotional support as both my partner and I have several mental health concerns. Two months ago, OO contacted my partner requesting that they return the dog, saying they can take care of him now. This is dubious to us, since on the past two years OO had gotten a new dog, then given that one up too as a result of their inability to care for it properly. On top of that, OO has several young children, including a newborn to take care of, and another new dog they've had for less than a year. They've also tried to guilt trip my partner by saying they ""Promised the kids the dog was coming back"".

We don't want to be jerks to OO or her kids, but it also seems unfair to demand back a dog that hasn't been theirs for two years.

786,"        I’d like to start this off by saying that my mom is by no means a disbeliever in the dangers of COVID-19, but historically she has been very receptive to what she finds on Facebook.

        My mom has began to get very involved in the Facebook groups and whatever spreading the idea that COVID-19 is less a pandemic than a plan-demic (nice pun on their part though).  I literally woke up on the morning of my birthday a few days ago and overheard a documentary she was watching about how COVID spreads so fast because it was engineered to, and how leaked “secret FDA documents” were proving it.  It also made very clear its belief that a COVID vaccine can and will be very dangerous, and I quote, “just like any other vaccine”.

        My household has almost definitely had the coronavirus, as everyone in my family (except for my sister, who moved out a while ago, and me for some reason) has shown symptoms consistent with it.  The problem here is that I’m not sure, and from what I’ve heard, nobody else is sure, that one cannot get the coronavirus more than once.  Though a coronavirus vaccine is not available at the moment, and probably won’t be for a while, I would like to be able to get it when it is available, without my mother’s interference.

Before anybody tells me: „Just call a therapist“, that‘s easier said than done.
I have problems getting on the phone with people. It takes me a good 20mins to actually get to the point of having my courage up to call a person. Before I call someone, I have to think of what I‘m going to say and then practice, before doing that I can‘t call someone because I am scared, I don‘t know of what I just am. One of the reasons why I have serious problems picking up the phone from an unknown number. 

So, I have problems with what I think might be symptoms of depression and self-harm. I know I need a therapist because I can‘t talk to my friends/family about this issue but I know I need help to get better. I want to write an email to potential therapists explaining my situation and I don‘t know how to formulate one. 

Also I live in Germany, in case that‘s an important piece of info.

she was nice, funny and really sweet.
we had a gc with other friends who are really good friends.
in july, c started dming me everyday. i was okay with it bc she was my friend and she was really
funny and stuff.
after months, we became super closer. even though she was an online friend; i considered her my sister. 
in october, she made this new friend ""d"", ngl i was a bit jealous of them, but it didn't affect my friendship with c. 
after days, c told me about d and she said d treated her bad, i told her to stop talking to her bc this girl d was manipulating her, not even exaggerating, but she didn't stop.
after months, they becane closer. i have to admit that i was really jealous, but again i didn't tell c anything. 
in april, we stopped talking every day, we just had like one convo or not even a convo, just a question. this really affected me ngl, at the point that i cried over this. 
ofc she was becoming closer to d, and tbh c changed sm, her ""jokes"" made me literally cry, they weren't even jokes, they were her thoughts about me.
i told her she changed and she made a ""joke"" about me, which made me cry, and then she was like ""oh my god, im sorry! that was mean"", ofc i told her everything was ok, i didn't want to feel bad or something.
one day, i told her i was quitting (the app), but it was bc i felt literally alone. i couldn't dm anyone else, bc tbh c was like the only friend i talked to, bc i felt my other friends ignored me. then, i thought about it, and came to the conclusion that i wanted to be on the app on her bday, and wish her happy birthday, etc. so, i told her i wasn't quitting (I didn't tell her why), i told her i was taking a break in few days.
after 2 weeks, i became closer to some friends, and i forgot about taking a break. 
one day, she dmed me saying ""hey, didn't you say you were taking a break?"" and i was like ""yeah but im reconsidering"" and she went ""ok --------"", she called me someone who used to promise things and never do it. so, i got mad and said:
""ok ill explain more since you dont understand clearly
i wanted to take a break because i thought the app was boring and i couldnt find a server
after realizing it didnt matter and i didnt have to have a break because of that, i changed my mind
im not doing a --------, im just thinking of what is good for me""
she said:
""ok well i am so sorry for not understanding clearly""
then after that i felt bad and i tried to ""fix"" it. i said:
""i just realized i sounded mean, im sorry i didnt mean to sound like that""
and she went ""wow really that is fine i don't really mind at all"".
i understand that she was upset and stuff.
next day, she took a break from the app for 1 week. tbh, that really helped me because i didn't care about d and c. but i still felt bad about what i said. so i sent c an apology letter.
when she came back from het break, she forgave me and i tried to start a convo, but ofc i couldn't.
right now, i haven't talked to c after she forgave me, and she became closer to d.
rn, im not jealous. im sad because it shows how easily replaceable i am. tbh, she replaced me. 
i feel like i wasted a whole year talking to someone.
i told her secrets, and im scared bc i dont want her to tell d about ny secrets.
i feel so bad.
and i cant dm her, because if i do, she'll have to answer, not bc she wants to talk with me.

798,"I live with my mom, grandma, and older brother. My younger brother moved out a while ago, but he visits every once in a while, usually for special occasion, such as birthdays &amp; if my mom needed something from him. Our ages are 32, 30, and 27 respectively. We're Asian &amp; we like to stick together until we actually have to move out.

Me &amp; my older brother doesn't get along at all. We're completely polar opposites. Even people thought we're not related at all. I even give him silent treatment for the whole quarantine because the things he does in the past 2 months has been nothing but annoyance, unnecessary, &amp; obnoxious.

He suddenly decides to make the living room his room &amp; work space. He slept on the sofa, brought a huge desk to set his computer &amp; printer, has been playing music unnecessarily loud during daytime, and turning on movies unnecessarily loud during night time.

This week, he yelled at me twice. Once for mistakenly deposit mortgage money (he provides no solution, just yell). Second for laughing too hard one time at midnight with discord friends (he texted me with capitals &amp; exclamation marks).

I completely ignored him. One, because the mortgage money is a very small no big deal but honest mistake &amp; I would fix it, if he provides the solution, which he doesn't. Two, I never said anything about his unnecessarily loud behavior, but me, being accidentally loud for one minute one time, and he suddenly decides that I'm rude? We butt heads a lot, but more like I'm the punching bag. He yelled, raised his voice, creating tantrums, but he never give a solution, as to rather he thinks by causing uproar will fix a past mistake. I give him silent treatment whenever I am upset at him, stopped attempting to fix his mistakes &amp; behavior.

Anyway, today is his birthday, I picked up the foods &amp; my younger brother to come home to celebrate. Mind you, I'm still upset at him, but today is his birthday. He's laying down on the sofa when I went out (1PM) and when I came home, he's still in the same position (2PM) playing his phone, blanket over his body.

When all foods are ready, my mom tried to wake him up &amp; so does my grandma. He ignored them. Instead, he pulled his blanket over his face. My mom asked if he's sick but he doesn't say anything. Not a word. Me &amp; my younger brother didn't make any attempt to wake him up, just because, but he ignored my mom &amp; my grandma completely.

I was baffled. His own birthday. This is his own family that wanted to celebrate it with him. Instead, he chose to being extremely rude &amp; ignore his own mother &amp; grandma. He even went back to sleep because I heard him snoring. I was even thinking to drive my younger brother back to his own apartment because I thought that this is a complete waste of his time, but he chose to stick around playing his Switch.

Now I'm sitting down with my laptop typing this. Sorry if it's too long. What should I do with my older brother? Mind you, I'm not the expressive type of person who goes around fixing people's problems. I don't wear my emotions on my sleeve either. It's deeply uncomfortable for me, unless the person asked me.

800,"I'm in high school rn. I was never bullied, but I've had people here and there who said and did mean shit to me.

For example, earlier this year this kid took an embarrassing pic of me looking at my crush's Instagram without my knowledge and sent it to some of his pals as a joke. Those pals sent it to others because it was apparently a really funny pic, and eventually it spread through a lot of people. The pic was badly timed, with my eyes closed and my mouth open, and frankly it looked like I masturbating. Everyone laughed at it for a week before forgetting about it.

Another time during middle school, someone told on me for playing on my phone in the bathroom during lunch, and acted as though I had committed some sort of felony or something. I got yelled at by my parents for that.

Another time in the 7th grade, a kid literally told on me for swearing. Just for swearing. Apparently its extremely heinous to use ""foul language"" in public.

Earlier this year, while school was still open, I told someone my reddit account (not this one, a different one that is now deleted). A couple of weeks ago, I asked the kid to unfollow my account, and it turns out he only followed it the day I told him before unfollowing it. However, he told 4-5 other people about it, and they stalked me and read what I was posting without my knowledge. I wanna be able to vent and talk about personal things anonymously without having to worry about anyone tracing my posts back to me. So I got pissed off, deleted that reddit account, and here I am with this one.

Also, about 2 weeks ago, a friend notified me about a group of kids who are friends with each other (these group of kids I just happened to know, as they were in some of my classes, and I occasionally talk to them here and there, but I never hung out with them or anything) secretly giving me a nickname behind my back. This was an inside joke among them. One of them had a Youtube channel and wrote some disstrack about me as a Roxanne parody, where the lyrics were basically describing me and making fun of me behind my back. I confronted the guy who posted that, and browbeated him to delete it, and he did. He told me that he thought I was his friend or something. I told another kid who was in on this that I didn't appreciate it, and he told me that he thought I was friends with them and even planned to invite me to go out to a mall or something, but never did due to lockdown. I could tell it was just a last ditch, bullshit excuse to try to avoid confrontation.

Bottom line, how do I forgive such people, not care, and resist the urge to get back at them?",10May2020,5
802,"My family treat me like trash, they don’t listen to a word I say, everything is my fault, just being shitty in general. 

During An argument where my sibling (let’s call them a) ruined my favourite pair of jeans, this had happened before and I told them the difference in our clothes multiple times, even going as far as writing my name on them. They didn’t listen to me and proceeded to stretch and tear them to the point that I can never wear them again and were completely unapologetic about it, saying that I was being overdramatic about being pissed of that they ruined yet another pair of jeans that belonged to me.

All I remember is seeing red and just wanting to wipe that cocky smirk of their face, so I snapped and slapped my sibling across the face, their fine they didn’t even have a mark. 

my other sibling (let’s call b) jumped on me and began punching and scratching me to the point I still have nail marks and bruises a week later.  My family is now calling me a monster and saying that there is something wrong with me, my grandmother (my parents died last year) is threatening to kick me out and said that she should have put me in foster care).  although I’ve apologised profusely to A (she accepted it), B refuses to apologise even though I still bruises because of them and their still calling me a c*** and a monster. 

My family is agreeing with her and say that once again I should let it slide because I’m older. While I understand I did a shitty thing, I apologised and made up for it. B has not and everyone is siding with them. B knows this and tells me that at least they have people around them who love them (unlike me) and that I’m just a “f******g monster,

804,"My younger brother is 10 years old and I'm 19, he has an old iPad that he uses for games and watching YouTube, he once broke the perfectly good charger by being careless and I scolded him about it because Apple accessories are quite expensive so we try to make them last as long as they can. 

Recently he forgot the password and in an attempt to guess it correctly he locked and disabled it. The issue is an easy fix so it's not a problem. The concern I had is that he didn't tell me for 3 days because he was scared I'd scold him. Being someone who was afraid of discussing his problems with his parents because of fear, I don't want my brother to feel the same way.

805,"I met this girl on a dating site a while back. We talked for a year online before meeting up for the first time. When we did it was just a one night stand and that was the first time she ghosted me. It wasn’t that big of a deal back at the time seeing as how she mentioned to me that she was talking to her ex and we only hung out that once. About a year after that I hit her up to ask her about it. I made it clear that it wasn’t a huge deal but I really enjoyed that night with her and would have liked to see her again. She apologized for not texting me back and explained the situation with her ex. I didn’t know about her ex when I hung out with her so it all made sense to me. 

Anyway, after all that happened she and I started meeting up and hanging out regularly. We never made it official and we made it very clear that we weren’t going to rush into anything but we really enjoyed each other’s company. We started getting really close over the past few months. It was really nice just being able to enjoy each other’s company without any drama or strings. We started acting as if we were a couple without realizing it. I connected with her on a deeper level than any girl I’ve been with before and I realized that i never actually knew what it was like to have feelings for someone rather than the idea of that someone. I didn’t realize that in all my past relationships, I just had feelings for the idea of being with somebody who met certain standards. About a month ago was the last time I saw her. Right before my birthday. I went out of town to visit my brother but when I had gotten back home she had the the nicest gifts anyone’s ever given me delivered to my door as if she got them for someone she’s been with for a long time. 

We kept talking regularly for about 2 weeks after. Then she had told me that she got back from her grandfather’s funeral. I was surprised she hadn’t told me that he passed away earlier. After that she just stopped texting back for a couple days. When I told her that I was worried about her and would like her to at least let me know she’s ok she responded and apologized. She said she’s cut herself off from contact with pretty much everyone. I told her it was ok and to let me know if I can do anything even if it means to give her space. She just stopped replying altogether after that and I haven’t heard anything from her since. It’s been 2 weeks. She still posts on her Facebook, but it shows that she hasn’t even read the couple messages I left her on fb messenger and Snapchat. Should I assume at this point that she’s moved on and try do so myself or should I try to talk to her again even if it just means to get some closure? It stings that she isn’t messaging me back and if she’s moved on that’ll likely hurt pretty bad too. However above all else I just want to know that she’s ok and happy whether I continue to be a part of her life or not. I’m just really lost as to what to do.",10May2020,2

Im the child of an immigrant. Which means we’re low income. I know my mom tries her hardest to give me and my sibling a normal life but im so far off. I always feel behind everyone else. 

I look at people i meet and they always have these grandiose adventures where they go to the lake or go out of state camping, or they have everything i wish i had. Braces, contacts or their own car and room. Parents who discipline them and have money for what ever they need.

I just feel so trapped. I’ve never been out of state and i have at most 5 years left in this shitty state because im in college atm. 

How do i see the bright side of my life? I dont have money to go out and do stuff nor have friend at all. My self esteem and social skills have been ruined thanks to my mom stuffing me in the house and never letting me hang out with people. I know she is just trying to protect me but i just feel horrible and like a worthless weirdo. 

Thinking about growing up and never experiencing what everyone else my age is experiencing makes me mad. I always feel like second class, like im not human like everyone else, i feel like im inferior to everyone who has a dad or has gone on roadtrips or people who get all their medical problems taken care on the spot.

Hi I’m writing this for advice. I’m 23 year old m who has a 28 year old best friend M we’ve known each other for 10 years now. Over the ten I have caught him looking at me ( maybe eyeballing me) any way. Im wrriting because I’m a bi guy and have never had sex with a good friend before. I’m pretty sure he is either bi or gay because he never talkes to women or about women.

So anyway I texted him from a different number saying hey this isn’t a prank or a joke I’m really into you and have been for a while I just don’t know if your like guys( he has never told me direct) but give me a smiley face or a thumbs up if you are. Of course he didn’t reply to the number but the next day I shit u not he calls me on my phone and pretty much was asking to hangout soon.

Does he know it was me? Also how do I approach him with it because I’m kinda scared to ask him what do you think I should do?",10May2020,2

810,"My family, most specifically, my mom, makes life seem unbearable sometimes. We’ve always had a rocky relationship and she’s always provided everything I need but she’s emotionally abusive. She calls me names, tells me I’m going to hell, she’s hit me and tried to fight me, always telling me to get out of her house, etc. Last summer she and my sister got in my face and were saying I was dead to them and kicked me out for a week over something they started and my mom spit in my face and told me to fight her. Now, today, she and my grandma and the same sister have been talking about me calling me names, saying I’m never going to be a good mom or wife, they don’t know how anyone will ever want to deal with me and other things. This isn’t even the half of it. But I’m so tired of being treated this way by them. I’ve had suicidal thoughts since I was 10 and it got a lot worse when I hit my teens. I’ve tried to do it twice now but obviously failed. Even though they are the sole purpose for me feeling worthless, disgusting and many other things, I love them and don’t want to hurt them by my death. I just don’t know what to do anymore. It hurts hearing all these negative things about myself and how I’ll never be this or that. I know I’m not the best daughter, granddaughter or sister but I’m not the worst. I do a lot for my family and they fail to realize it. Yesterday my mom said she wishes she had just one smart, successful kid and that hurt because out of 4 kids, I am the one that graduated high school with good grades, some recognitions and then I recently finished my first semester of college for pre-nursing, I also bought my first car and pay for everything of mine (unlike my sisters, they have 0 responsibilities) and I work just about everyday while they don’t. So for her to say that kind of kills me and makes me feel like I’m not enough. She always compares me to one sister specifically &amp; that sister has done sooo much bad stuff, even almost legally getting my mom in trouble but in my mom’s eyes she does no wrong.

813,"My roommate is 23 years old adult, I'm about the same age, but she doesn't clean the kitchen, always leaves her dishes in the sink and NEVER TAKES THE TRASH OUT. Last time about a month ago, I adressed that to her and she said that we should clean and rotate every week, and that she will come up with the schedule chart which she never did! Then I waited a few days, and then had to clean everything myself. I cleaned the gas, sink, washed the floors, fridge, kitchen counters. Then my fiance came to visit me from another state for a few weeks, but he always cleaned after himself and threw the trash out all the time. She was nice and did not say anything about my fiance spending a few weeks here. So thanks to her! But its been two weeks that he left, the gas is super DIRTY! Trash has been full for a week! I refuse to throw the trash out because I'm tired. I am not a babysitter! I just don't understand how can a person be this filthy?! She is moving out in a month, so maybe she just doesn't care???? But I live here!!!! I want to give her freedom and I want her to feel comfortable and let her clean whenever she wants, but I find it a little disturbing. I mean she is a good person I guess, but doesn't like cleaning maybe??? In that case maybe she needs to get her own appartment? I am confused, I don't know how to approach this issue, I have been waiting for her to clean for about 10 days. I even put the ""Comet"" out and put it next to our dirty gas. I mean she uses the gas and cooks just like me. But why doesnt she clean? I offered her to split the houskeepers fees, she said its such a small kitchen, that she is not interested in hiring anyone. The thing is that my fiance is coming from another state to spend a week with me. So I am not sure if it's right to address it, because technically my boyfriend uses the kitchen, but he is my guest. What should I do? I am not used to living in these conditions, but I understand we are young adults and don't want her to feel the pressure.

And she was very manipulative, she would turn my brother and me against us, I like to think that she's trying to change, but the reality is she may be manipulating again, I can't know. Because of my mom separating me and my brother like this brother hates me and I can see it in his eyes that when I win a competition or something he's hurt. Even tho whenever my parents would beat my brother up I (3 years old) would get in between for him to run away. So they would beat me instead.

I've had a really hard childhood but I've been working on myself for a while and I never get mad when they do something stupid or insult me. My brother also tells everything I tell him to his friends.

My father is a really weak man, he knows that so he tries to convince him and us that he's a ""man"" by yelling, destroying stuff and getting really mad. My mother makes him do a lot of dumb stuff because he listens to her. And my father never admits blame.

And there's me (18yo), I'm gonna leave the house as soon as I am financially stable, it's really toxic.

824,"So, to explain my situation, I ( 21F) I live with my parents, I study architecture in the morning, I do an intership in an office in the afternoon and in the evening, I study Design in another university, so my life is very busy. I always had a strong desire for freedom, since my parents are very strict and I need to follow many rules all the time.  

But since March  I am feeling more and more this feeling growing inside me, I need to do something out of the ordinary, alone, to take my own decisions and know different people with different backgrounds. The thing is that I don't have my own money , I would love to live alone but it's simply too expensive to live alone in Brazil and I don't have time to work more. So, I need my parents permition to do some things. 

I need freedom, I need to have an adventure, I need to know the world and I need to be independent, as least in some way. So I was thinking about my possibilities, I could do an exchange program in a country that speaks spanish, portuguese or english and try to have a scholarship, I could work on my vacation time  in some type of program for foreigners and I could do a trip by myself.

 Between this options the only one my parents would let me to do is an exchange program, (or I could wait to graduate and work in another country)but the process can take many months and for me the possibily of present something for a big class in another language, and learn how to live in another country, deal with all the bureaucracy is too frigtening lol  .I will end my courses in two years but I am waiting to have my freedom for too long, I don't know what to do to fulfill this desire and I don't know how I would get more money to do a trip( this would be the ideal option for now) and I don't know if I have another possibility that I am not thinking about. In your opinion, what should I do?

So I, along woth my sister and dog moved into their house. They had a dog and kids of rheir own. My dog is super friendly and theres was not so much. My dog had to stay downstairs with my and my geandma while my aunt and uncles fog roamed the house freely. Not that I have an issue with that, their dog was here first

Anyway, 3 weeks ago my aunt and uncles dog died. The first thing that was said at the dinner table by my aunt was ""please give me some time before your dog can come upstairs"" Me and my sister both agreed. Its now been 3 weeks and my dog is still not allowed upstairs bc my aunt isnt ""ready"". Never theless, I overheard my aunt teling my uncle that she called a dog shelter, but all rhe applicant spots r filled at the time, and people can only come visit when spots open up, bc there cant be crowing due to Covid-19. This has set me off till no end. My dog has been seclduded to the basement (shes allowed to use the backyard and was allowed while my aunts dog was alived as well) but isnt allowed to go upstairs, where MOST of the family is, because my aunt isnt ""ready"", yet She called a dog shelter yesterday. Today is Mother's day so Im not going to say anything, but this has set me off to no end because 
1) My dog did nothing to cause my aunts dog death
2) My aunt knows my dog... shes known my dog for 7 years, livinf with the dog for 7 years... its not like I am bringing in a stray dog

828,"So I(M) just got engaged to my girlfriend of almost 5 years. 

Bit of a backstory, I have a brother (2 years older than me) that suffers with severe cerebral palsy due to complications at birth that resulted in a hemispherectomy procedure (where half the brain is removed). He has about the mental age of a toddler, but is none the wiser and is happier than the average person. He requires 24/7 care from my parents and additional support. No fault of his own, he is very vocal and loud. My parents life revolve around him 360 degrees and I always come 2nd. Fair enough. 

My problem here started when I told my mother about wanting to ask my girlfriend to marry me and her first response was “Will the venue be disable accessible?” No congratulations, no tears, just concern about my brothers access.

After proposing, the worries started to come. If we invite my parents and brother to the wedding, is the wedding going to revolve around my brother and his comfort and are they going to completely ignore me?

The selfish part of me wants to invite them bar my brother because I don’t want to be sidelined on such an important day, if not the most important day of my life. (side note: they never attended my University graduation even though I asked months in advance and the excuse was they had to look after my brother).

I’ve came to the conclusion that I do not want my brother there anyway due to his vocal nature; he would be a very big distraction during such an intimate moment.

832,"Hi, I am a 30 year old guy who lives in India. If you are not from India I would like to tell you that it is fairly common in India for people to live with their parents or even grandparents all their lives. 

As incredulous as it might sound to westerners, that's how it usually is in India. Most of the time it's because of the lack of resources, others, out of free will.

Would I like to live on my own in a house of my own? YES. Can I? NO.
 
I am a software developer. And thankfully make enough money to feed and put a rented roof over the head of myself and my family (mom, dad and my younger sister). I am single. I have been single for 8 years now. I only ever had one GF in life, we broke up in 2012. 

I have a sister who is 17. She has autism of the degree that she doesn't speak, and has intelligence of a 2-3 year old. She is not violent in anyway at all. But she does need constant looking after. She is totally dependent on my mom for her basic needs. It is my mother who bathes her, cooks for her.  Every once in a while, say 2-3 months or so, she, my sister,  would spoil her clothes sitting in the living room and my mother would have to clean her up. 

My mother is not getting any younger. She is in her mid 50s and my dad who is retired, is in his early 60s.  

I hate to see my mother worrying about my sister. I have seen her cry so many times because she is worried about what will happen to my sister after she dies. Of course I console her by saying that should anything happen to her, I will be there to look after my sister. But truth is, I am worried too. Because I can not look after her the way my mom does. 

Do I have the means to hire a full time caretaker? No.
Do I want to stay single for the rest of my life? No. 
Do I want to abandon my family? Absolutely No. 

Who is going to accept me with my baggage? No girl would ever want to deal with this situation if given a choice. And I wouldn't blame her. 

When I was a kid, I would tell my dad about my dreams. I would tell him that one day I will become the richest man on the planet, I will be a bodybuilder, an engineer and a pilot too. And it seemed so achievable to me as a young kid.  As I grew up, my dreams became smaller and smaller and yet unachievable. 

Fast forward to today - I turned 30 last month. I feel like I am running out of time. 

Many a times I find myself day dreaming. I dream of finding a girl who loves me and I love her. I dream that I have enough money to hire a full time caretaker for my sister who I love dearly. Enough money to make my mother stop worrying about my sister. 
I dream that I have my own house. I dream that I have another house just right next to mine, where my mom and dad live. It's some dream. Probably the kind that will never come true. 

What do I do?",10May2020,4

After graduated I've been working in my hometown, a small town where  unfortunately most of the young educated generations move out to pursue better professional opportunity. There are a few of my schoolmate of the same year settled back here either for family business / started business / min wage job while most moved to cities or even moved abroad. Since the quarantine, I've been thinking about my future everyday.

 It seems like I am moving no where in life when I compare with my peers or familiar faces that I know they are from my hometown.

Could anyone of you mind chipping in your opinions or wake me up? During this quarantine, I have listed few possible pathways for myself but I don't really know if it is feasible.


1. Stay hometown

Keep the job and eventually start something myself or help my family who currently run a local business here which I think can still be improved and then see where it takes me to my next venture.


2. Move to city when pandemic is over

Or perhaps I should move to the city for a better job? A change of environment?


3. Abroad

I've actually been thinking to take a year or two off for Working Holiday and then save a sum of money in case I want to further my study abroad or a backup to start something myself.

845,"Thanks to the current shake up world wide, I've had a long time to reconsider my priorities. I've had a life goal of moving abroad and enroll in a language school to learn a brand new language and experience a new country and culture. I've contemplated this plan and always pushed it further on the hypothetical future, during some years I wanted to establish a career before I took on that plan, afterwards I wanted to pay off my student loans, and recently it's all been about having enough money to put towards retirement.


The current global situation has made me realize that the future isn't guaranteed. It's important to have contingency plans but those plans should not supercede personal fullfilment. I have a few hang ups, and while they aren't necessarily things that will stop me from committing to moving abroad I'd like to hear from the most honest opinions you can get complete strangers on the internet.

My hang ups:

1. I'm entering my 30's and while I still look like I'm in my early 20's, I'm insecure if that will keep isolated from others who might be enrolled in language schools.

2. Taking a year away from my career sounds scary and like career suicide. I wonder how much that could affect my future lively hood.

3. Moving abroad and essentially distancing myself from my social group could alienate me from family and friends.


I'd appreciate any kind of reaction or advice, I'm looking for honesty. Oftentimes friends and family will spare your feelings with compromising opinions.

850,"My mom makes me go to sleep at 10:30 on weekdays.

I am a nightowl, which means that going to sleep early isn't a nautrally good thing for me. This leads to me staring at my ceiling for 3-5 hours every night, and is driving me insane since this has been going on for 2 full years now. 

My biggest issue with such an early bedtime (for me) is that my real life friends and online friends are alwayd busy during the day and afternoon, leading me to getting about 1-2 hours of time to spend with them. This has caused many of my friendships online to fall apart, simply because we spend so little time together

I have tried arguing with my mom about how I need a later bedtime, but everytime she pulls up statistics and averages (something that doesn't prove much on an individual basis). She refuses to experiment with my bedtime, she has just chosen the latest health tips online and make my bedtimes based on those. 

I am growing very tired of my mom calling me after an hour of being with my friends, just to make my struggle to sleep for 3-5 hours, this happens almost every night.

The thing that is making me very confused is that my brothers could actually ask my mom to have a later bedtime, and they asked for absurd times like 3am, and she just said yes without no further thought. I'm starting to think that she is just sick of parenting and wants her free time at this point, considering she only gives me stuff that I can do by myself, like for example a computer. 

I am looking for advice on how to convince my mom to understand my natural sleep schedule and to understand that my friendships are falling apart because of the strict bedtime rules she enforced.

Here's some info about me if it helps.

15
Norwegian
Going to a public school

853,"Hello there, \*insert General Kenobi meme here\* 

(for this post advising me to add age and sex so I am a 21 M)

So I always have this issue, I guess all my life, and I can recognize some are my own doing. When it comes to conversations, especially those who are online and as well happen to be female, conversations die out fast and are short ended like ""oh ok"" ""cool"" ""yup"" or just answer the question but doesn't answer the other ones you asked or don't provide more detail.

This is not only in text (while it happens more through text then in person) but in interactions with a person. Typically I would be having a conversation with a person and like I said in my experience it happens with a females more. M=me P=other person

after conversations ended I would ask something like,

M=""where would you want to travel to if you had the chance?""

P=""Colorado""

M=""Oh cool I visited Colorado for a conference while I was in school, I loved the area and I went during February and it snowed a bit. I was 18-19 at the time and went with some class mates who were 21 at the time so they went and bought a lot of weed related stuff once we landed.""

P=""oh ok"" ""wyd""

something similar I always face this often when texting with other people, I understand that we don't know each other and if there nervous or something like that, or don't have a strong conversation skills but I see this way too often all around like why is this? What can I do to not face this? I realize too sometimes I can talk a lot too and ask for conversations, I might seem like I am... I don't know the word for it but ""conversation deprived"" and get amped in a form that I share a lot of detail and really into the conversation. So I guess that might seem too aggressive in conversation to some people but I am just trying to be friendly and showing interest in the conversation.

While in person things will be that awkward silence but I try to keep conversations going by talking about a subject the other person enjoyed or what we have common and try to fix on that for a bit till I can find another from of topic we both can continue.

I always had the anxiety to talk to others because of this, I often face this all the time in person ans/or through text, I am determine not to make conversation end but not force it either and let the conversation flow. I am the type of person who can be easy to talk to. Just give me anything, and I can work with it and we can talk for hours, but its hard to find those who can do that and most just end things like that. Its painful and frustrating like hell. I looked up on guilds and try to follow that advice, but all seems like a struggle. Maybe I am not seeing it and I am the issue all along and causing things to end like that, but I see myself as a good conversationalist professionally and socially because I have friends who see this and tell me its easy to talk to me about anything and when we do talk, we can go to point A then end up to Z without really knowing how we got there but enjoyed the time.

Wondering if people had issues like this and if they can offer their two cents in this matter, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",10May2020,1
854,"So last week I turned 30, and instead of being happy and celebrating, I spent it alone in my apartment ignoring the few texts/calls of happy birthday wishers. I've lived basically the loneliest life imaginable thus far. Never had a gf, still a virgin, and back in college finishing my degree. Obvs I had bad self esteem and/or confidence issues that put me in this spot. I only have a few people I would consider ""friends,"" but even they haven't wished me a happy bday so that should tell you how close I am with them.

I'm just extremely disappointed in myself to allow myself to hit rock bottom when I had so many years to change things up. Every year that goes by I tell myself its too late to change anything. When I was 25, I told myself the EXACT same things. I just feel completely hopeless and even if I thought change was possible, I keep telling myself its too late. Part of me wants to close the chapter on my non-existent twenties and start fresh now, but the other part of me thinks in order to have a good 30s you first needed a good 20s.

My biggest problem is in order for me to change my life, I have to accept that I wasted it up till now. That's an extremely tough pill to swallow. And I'm afraid of not being able to change anything bc of how deep of a hole I put myself in. My life will never be as good as it could have been, and to have a life at say 30% instead of the 100% if I made changes 5-6 years ago is not appealing.

Like I have all these things that I want, and to 99% of people it comes easy to them, but for me it seems impossible to attain. Like a gf, job I'm happy doing, social life, being close with family. And to have those things I first need to change myself - I can't be miserable and unhappy and expect a girl to fall in my lap. But bc I have NONE of those things, I can't be happy or confident. See how fucked I am? So any advice you can give will be appreciated. Thanks",10May2020,1
855,"Things changed after Covid. I've lived in a large art space / music venue for two years in Berlin. Me and a rotating gang of builders and art directors lived, worked and maintained the space. We mostly host experimental music, but we've hosted anything you could imagine weddings, even a discussion by the first women to ever run a marathon; Kathrine Switzer! It has become a home for me and I love it here.

Anyway, connected to the art space are two large airbnb lofts which paid the rent to keep our niche thing going. But since the pandemic, no gigs + no tourism = big trouble. So we have become an artist residency. Over the months, many people have come to live, people from everywhere. At the beginning of this new era, I, ignorant of all the new occupants left my denim jacket on a chair all weekend long...

Three days later when I realised my wallet was in there I hurried to it, only to find pocket dust and earphones. Hundreds of euro, cards, drivers license, gone, and at a very bad time. At the time only two new people had been here. One super chill dancer who since left, and one painter, who drinks, sleeps all day and doesn't really interact with anybody, doesn't paint so much either. Now I posted messages on our group chat and stuck up posters around the place, and who came straight up to me... bloodshot eyed, and with great interest... the painter. Empathising and asking what happened. A cover perhaps? Needless to say it never turned up and this was the last conversation we had. Now I could have dropped the wallet while cycling, but I'm super careful about where I keep it.

So over the last few weeks I've seen him very briefly, he's like a ghost. And sometimes I even have to clean up after him, as it's my job to prepare the living quarters for tourists-scant as they've been-that come. Toilets, kitchen etc. And that is an awful feeling. I think he can feel my resentment, and he is very quiet when I'm in the room and practically never interacts with anyone but one or two guys in his area of the building (there's fourteen of us now).

To add to the sting of it, I feel as if I can't do anything, I've no evidence, I called police and insurance and no-one helped. It keeps me at night, and there's such a tension that i can't let go of.

Now I like to see the best in people, so I am picturing a scenario where he didn't steal it, but either way I can't help but behave very coldly towards him and it's creating a weird atmosphere. I want to move past it somehow but I'm caught between suspicion and rudeness.

Am I the asshole for thinking this guy stole my wallet because he seems culpable? Because of his way of life, drinking all day and being antisocial, and really unclean. I dont know if I am actually pushing him away from socialising with everyone because of my suspicion.

858,"I was raised with a given that I would go to college, my dad's a teacher and my mom is Asian so it wasn't even a discussion. The culture in grade school was very focused on getting kids into four years, and I got sucked into it. I used to be fairly ambitious about what I wanted to do in life, I wanted to go into public policy or law school or politics. After building it all up in my head that I had to go to a four year straight out of high school just like all my friends, I entered college as a poli sci/gender studies double major. By the end of my freshman year I realized I didn't want to study either of those things anymore, and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. But feeling like I had no choice but to soldier on with college, I changed my major to history with the hopes that I would still want to go to law school or grad school afterwards. By sophomore year I was burning out on school HARD. I know I should have gotten an internship or something to boost my resume, but they were all unpaid and I wasn't even really sure what I wanted to do with my life so I just got regular jobs because I still had no idea what I was trying to do with my future. By junior year I was struggling with depression and just trying to get through it because the prospect of dropping out made me feel like a failure. Now, my family is by no means wealthy, but also not poor, so we didn't qualify for any financial aid. My parents assured me that they had been putting money away and had pulled enough strings and took out a loan to pay for it. It was a lot of money. Like, a lot of money.

Well, I'm expected to graduate with a degree in history in a couple months and I've never felt so fucked in my life. I resent the culture I grew up in for making me feel like I had no other choice but to go to a four year, I resent my parents for telling me it would be worth it, and above all I resent myself for spending a colossal amount of my and my parents money on a degree that isn't even an investment. Once I graduate, I'm going to take on the bulk of my student loan debt and I feel like I have no idea how to find a job in the midst of an economic collapse, much less with a history degree and no real marketable skills. My resume is so weak and I don't have any connections and I don't even know where to start now. I don't even really like history anymore.

I just feel so scammed. I wish I hadn't put so much stock into school as a kid, I wish I'd taken a gap year, or gone to a community college, or gotten a job, literally anything except the path I took. I'm in so much debt and for what?",10May2020,1
859,"Hello people of reddit,

I downloaded snapchat, because all of my friends use it and talk about their streaks all the time. Obviously, I didn't want to be left out, so I downloaded it too. My friends sent me a bunch of snaps with S - streaks on it, so I replied same with this S. However, it kind of burned out and stopped. I don't know how it could happen. They somehow stopped sending me streaks one day and it stopped.

I stopped with snapchat for a while, recently my friend sent me a snap not containing an S, I have been talking with her for a good month on Instagram. So I was like hey do you guys still do streaks in here and she was like yess, so I was like okey lets do them then and she was again like yes. We sent streaks the next day and now, day after, she hasnt sent me one. I have sent her one. Now I dont know what do to, continue sending her snaps with streaks even though she doesnt reply or just wait if she catches up any day again.

A big thing I dont get on snapchat is, am I supposed to answer? Some snaps look like mass produced, so I dont bother answering them. Although, my friend told me about how someone got mad at him for not answering. Some says snapchat is great for starting conversations. I used to start conversations by sending memes about a topic I knew the person liked.

So the point is, I dont know what to do now with my friend. I used to send her memes and sometimes we had an hour long conversations and sometimes she sent me memes. I feel like waiting for her to text me / send meme at least. Because I feel like contacting her first more than 3 times first is bad. On the other hand, I can lose that custom. I mean with that, that she is used now to talking with me. I would also like to talk more to my other friends, but I dont know any reason why to talk with them, so it wouldnt be weird.",10May2020,1

I also had a full summer of work planned, but it got canceled. Due to all this, I’m moving back home at the end of this month when my lease ends, and I’m worried sick about how I will be able to deal with the situation. I have a very bad relationship with my mother, who is extremely emotionally (and sometimes physically) abusive, and has been for years. The main issues are she is very controlling, she has very frequent mood swings and she reacts violently to very minor disagreements. On top of this, my father passed away almost two years ago and she completely ruined my last moments with him in the hospital, not to mention that she shut down so much from her grief that I had to do so many family affair things by myself (like deal with his cremation). At this point I have laid off properly grieving my dad as I had so much to do with finishing my college degree, and this is a frequent point of contention between us in addition to our normal disagreements, as she commonly mocks me for not dealing with my emotions and she is already rubbing this in my face (i.e. saying I‘ll be able to use my dad’s study for work when I’m home and making fun of me when I say I don’t want to use his room). Honestly just texting her the past month and a half has been the worst our relationship has ever been while we are apart, so I just have no clue how I will be able to get through weeks, let alone months of this situation (me alone in a house with her).

Basically, to summarize and also TL;DR I spent my entire middle school/highschool/college years ensuring that I would never have to move back to my emotionally abusive house again, but because of unprecedented situations caused by this pandemic I am going to have to move back home for at least a few months and I have no idea how I’m going to be able to cope.

SIL went and told him to stop because their daughter was trying to sleep and he exploded, started yelling so she raised her voice and then MIL and FIL got involved. For some reason. To me, it seemed like they ganged up against her and eventually, she grabbed her now crying daughter and took her to the park. Just to get away.

I can hear MIL, FIL, and BIL talking in the kitchen and jeep hearing the words ""crazy"" and ""hospitalized"". Is there anything I can do to help SIL? What should she do? Would what my in laws are doing (threatining to stop helping with the child financially, yelling, calling her crazy ect.) be considered abuse?

Not that its pertinent, but I did a tarot reading for her (ive been practicing for a while and figured this would be a good first test) and got troubling results.",10May2020,1
864,"Hi ! I'm new to reddit so bear with me here!

A friend I've had for just over a year has suddenly been acting extremely cold and distant towards me.

Some backstory for clarity :
Since the day we started talking we've never had any troubles opening up and clicked instantly. We've both told each other that we have never once told anyone else the things we share with each other, and we would every so often let each other know just how valuable we are to each other. We were like each others soulmates if that makes sense, and both pulled each other out of dark places.
She does however have a track-record of cutting friends out when she feels as though she nor said friends have any lasting benefits from remaining friends. 
We are in a shared friend group and she has told me that she is strongly concidering distancing herself from the others, while reassuring me that she is not going to do so to me since we can conversate on a deeper level and are closer.
She has been more distant here and there when she goes through depressive episodes but usually asks me to hang out just the two of us to cheer her up or at the very least gives me some sort of heads up so I'm not left clueless.
The past month or 2 we've had some slight troubles, we've both been getting on each others nerves and bicker a lot (although its never ill intentioned and no feelings are hurt). Just a week ago (last that i saw of her f2f) we hung out and had deep talks about some problems in our friendship which id say went well, and i let her know that i was planning on spending the coming week to do some self-reflection and have some alone time (which isn't out of character, although maybe uncommon) to which she replied that she should find a new friend to hang out with for the week id be gone (not out of character).
This week ive tried messaging her and she either gives me dead-pan replies (no, just, lol..etc.) or completely ignores me. 
To be frank I'm not really sure what to make of this situation, since this is EXTREMELY out of character for her (at least regarding our friendship) and it's only been a week of recieving these types of messages.

OH very relevant info : We're moving in together in 2 weeks with another friend and we share a room together. Lol.

This might be a pretty loaded post because it’s been a long time coming but- here goes nothing. Thank you if you decide to read this whole thing. An unbiased opinion is something I really need right now. 

Yesterday morning i woke up from a really shitty dream where i got literally stabbed in the back by a ‘close friend’ of mine. For the sake of privacy, we’ll call her bubbles. Bubbles and I have been friends for a long long time and everything has been great until the last year and a half/two years. Bubbles started to introduce a girl who we’ll call Blue into our friend group. Things were fine when we first got to know eachother. We werent the kind of friends who were ever really close but there wasn’t any awkwardness between us and we got along well. Our friend group also likes to party (we’re all 20 somethings) and we all got along fine and hung out quite a bit. Blue even introduced me to my now boyfriend of a year, and I was very thankful for that. Over the time we all spent together, Blue and Bubbles started to get really close. Things started to go downhill once Bubbles decided it was time for her boyfriend to move in to her place. Blue got really really jealous and told Bubbles that it would cause irreversible damage on their friendship. Eventually Bubbles convinced her to basically give a friendship with her boyfriend a shot. This was really awkward, because once they got close, Blue started to get really clingy and possessive of Bubbles. She used to do things like show up to her house uninvited a lot- even when Bubbles wasn’t home or was working. Or invite over friends of hers that only she knew. She would also dictate who could come over and hang out whenever she was at the house and it made me uncomfortable. Once Blue and Bubbles started hanging out with eachother basically every day, my friendship with Bubbles started to fade. She stopped asking me to hang out and whenever I would come over the two of them would make me feel like I wasn’t even there. 

During this time, Blue and my boyfriend (who had a long friendship before I started dating him) had a falling out because my boyfriend saw a lot of toxicity in her. At this time I wasn’t really around the two as much, because it made me sorta uncomfortable to be around Blue. Fast forward about a month. In this time, Blue had a mental breakdown (which she had a few of over the time i knew her) that was so alarming Bubbles reached out to me and asked if she should call the police to get her help. She was making serious threats to her own life and I supported Bubbles decision to get her hospitalized. After just a day or two, Blue was out of the hospital with an angry vengeance. She started texting me talking all kinds of shit about Bubbles. Which reeeaaallly didn’t sit right with me. I had to help Bubbles through the guilt she now had over doing (what was in my opinion) the right thing. While doing this, I started to express some of my concerns about Blue to her. She just seemed like she was in a really unhealthy place and it was taking a toll on Bubbles. She’s the kind of friend who is so loyal and wants to help everyone, which, ironically, is her downfall in this case. Bubbles really didn’t seem to take what I said to her for much, but her boyfriend and I saw the same things and he basically carried that conversation further with her from what I know. 

A few months pass and Bubbles and Blue are inseparable. But things just seemed to keep getting worse and worse between them. The things Bubbles used to complain to me about, like not feeling like Blue respected her space, or how Blue owed her money, or took things from her, became the norm of their friendship. At this point, I really saw Blue for who she was. She was toxic. I learned a lot about her from being in her circle and hanging out with her random friends she brought over. She cheated on her partners a lot. She did coke with random people on Bubbles dining room table. I mean, really I could go on but I won’t because this is already long enough. I just didn’t want to deal with it anymore. 

So I told Bubbles I didn’t want anything to do with Blue. I gave her my reasoning and said that I didn’t want to lose our friendship over Blue, but I wasn’t going to be hanging out when she was around. She said she understood why someone wouldn’t want to be around Blue and that she understood my decision. 

After this, my friendship with Bubbles went to absolute shit. I tried to hang out with her without Blue around but it never worked out. I’d invite her to my place after work and she always bailed on me, to the point where it became a joke between bf and I that whenever i’d ask her to hang out I should just go to sleep instead because she’d always cancel. Any time she’d try to invite me to something, a day later she’d mention that Blue was also going to be there. I’d then say I wasn’t comfortable going and ask her not to invite the two of us to something in the future because those were my boundaries. 

There was one time that bubbles, a mutual friend from highschool and I were supposed to have a girls night in at her place. Bubbles texted me as i was about to leave telling me that Blue invited herself over and wasn’t leaving. So I cancelled. I then got texts from her and our mutual friend asking why I couldn’t just put my feelings aside and come hang out. I told Bubbles that I felt like she was disregarding my feelings because I had plenty of reasons why I didn’t want to be around Blue. Especially because once word got to her that I didn’t like her anymore she started talking a lot of shit about me behind my back. The narrative was that I was brainwashed by my boyfriend and Blue never did anything to turn me sour on her and I was just crazy. After that, Bubbles and I never really hung out again or talked much until a few days ago. It was my birthday and she was gonna come over and hang out. 

The night before my birthday, our mutual friend from highschool calls me and tells me that she’s been hanging out with Blue and Bubbles a lot and that she’s been experiencing the same things I was while I was in their circle. She asked for my side of the story as to why I cut Blue off. I told her my reasons. She told me that they gave her the “brainwashed by boyfriend that bitch crazy” story and that hit me the wrong way. I kinda knew in my heart that Bubbles wasn’t defending me anymore. But this set it in stone for me and really made me feel like I wasn’t being respected. I also found out that the day the three of us were going to hang out and Blue “just showed up” that Bubbles had actually invited her over. Kinda had a feeling about that too. I decided I’d push it all aside at least until after my birthday because a lot has gone down in my personal/family life this last year besides all this and I just wanted a night to drink and forget all the bullshit. The party went well 

but then I had that dream I was talking about. 

That was two days ago and it pulled all this shit back into my head and I had a moment of clarity. I have a private account on instagram that I use as a vent with like 4 followers and i posted about the dream but I was pretty vague. I made the post, fell asleep, woke up and ended up deleting the post because I’m really not the kind of person to air my dirty laundry like that, and even though it was vague, I knew I acted in the heat of the moment. 

Later that night I get some messages from Blue. (attached) asking if I still liked her. I knew she had seen the post and deducted it was about her. I didn’t want to lie. I said I did but I don’t think we should be friends anymore. She asked at the end of the convo if she could come over to drop off a birthday present and I said yes. She came over and we had a talk. I’ve had so many with her about our friendship that I was just tired of talking. She asked why this was happening and I told her how I felt. How she prioritizes Blue over everything and I was tired of it affecting our friendship. How I had tried to keep our friendship together even though she was friends with this person and I hoped things between us wouldn’t be affected but that it wasn’t possible. 

I confronted her about how she lied to me and she denied it. She just kept saying how things could work out and how she’s realized she can’t keep me and Blue happy at the same time. I said that it’s not cool that she’s so concerned that she’ll hurt Blue’s feelings by spending time with her other friends (because she’s a jealous person) that it affects all of her other friendships and even her relationship. She got really emotional and kept saying she didn’t understand. She also said something about how she didn’t know I was upset about all of this because she never “saw me hurting” when I’d had so many conversations with her about boundaries and feelings and she always promised that things would work out but she never made an effort on her end. She got up and left after that. 

I went inside. Got a call from our mutual friend who asked “wtf just happened and why did Bubbles call me” i gave her the jist. She asked if i still followed her social media and i saw that she was posting about how she got home and was close to using unhealthy coping mechanisms as a result. That was triggering and upsetting for me. That was followed by a bunch of comments about how she’s some huge fuckup and ruins all of her close friendships. I felt really bad after reading all of that. But what else could I do at this point? we had conversation after conversation and our friendship had gone to the wayside. 

We didn’t even talk. I hadn’t seen her in so long. I mean. God. I just feel really conflicted. 
I care about her deeply, and she was a sister to me. I never wanted her to hurt like this because of me. But what else could I have done? 

Did I make the wrong choice here? 

TL;DR Long friendship between myself and my friend Bubbles turns to shit after she becomes besties with a girl everyone other than her finds toxic. I set boundaries to keep the drama from toxic girl out of my life and they weren’t respected. Had enough of it and ended the friendship.",10May2020,1
866,"Hi all, 

I (25F) have known for a few years now that my dad (75M) has a possible son who was born over 50 years ago. This happened obviously a long time ago, at the start of my father's career in another country. He was let's just say a known sports star at his time so in that country, if you were into the said sport you probably had heard of him. My mom (56F) told me he was quite the player back in the day and always had many ladies around him.

My mom had me when my dad was 50 and by that time they had moved out of that country to the US for his career along with my sister who is 5 years older than me. My parents have been divorced for over 20 years but have remained friendly for my sister and me.

A few years ago talking to my mom she opened up about how when my sister and I were younger she received letters from a woman in that country about how she gave birth to a child she is 100% sure is my fathers. She mentioned how she has tried countless times to reach out to him, not for money but so that he could meet his real father. The letter was sent well into his adult life and his mother described his rough upbringing, time spent in prison, mental health struggles..etc. A lot of this she said was due to the fact my father constantly denied he was his child (he had most likely grown up knowing who he was due to his career).

My mom said my dad was very dismissive of the conversation and laid it to rest quickly. She sent the letters and photos to his sisters who said they would look into it but that was the last she heard until yesterday.

She received a message on Facebook from his mother asking once again if she would be able to get a hold of my father. This ""child"" is now in his 50's. His mother said he was recently diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer and that all he wants it a paternity test to prove who is father is. She said they do not want anything else from my father except that knowing. She desperately wants her son to have the closure she believes he deserves.

Reading this was obviously heartbreaking. I feel very open to talking to him if he would like that but knowing my father we know he will never open up to this. He's stubborn and has quite frankly ignored this for the past 50 years so I can't see that changing anytime soon.

We are trying to decide the best route to take next. My sister and I are very open to providing our DNA to see if there's a match with him if that would help. We've also discussed having my mom reach out to my father to see if he would be open to talking to him- if anything for my sister and me to have the right to know about a half-sibling. I'm not sure this is my place to reach out to my dad who I don't have a very emotionally open relationship with.

Looking for advice on how to go about this. My mom is not sure the best way to address this to my dad or if she even should (it's not like she went snooping herself, his mother reached out to her). We also feel strongly we should help out his potential son with the DNA test (our DNA not our dads) if he would like that. Is it best to leave my dad out of the picture or try one last time even though it could cause him to close off even more?

Seeing that his illness is time sensitive we would like to get moving on this ASAP and try to give any closure we can provide.",10May2020,3
867,"Okay so we had an assignment that is due in on Tuesday, but we've had a very limited timescale due to Covid-19. 

We literally had about 2 weeks to create an app from scratch, write about it, plan it, and test it. Now trust me, that's not long enough. 

We've also had zero teaching because a) Covid-19 and b) our teachers laptop was having isses so he couldn't teach us online. 

My college stated that they want us to hand in all assignments by the 12th May and are expecting work to be done to an okay standard but nowhere near as good as they are normally (due to limited timescales and the poor learning environment.) 

They stated that if you've already done it (literally one person had) then you had to submit it in that state. And that if you haven't done it, do as much as you can and submit it by the 12th. 

So I started the assignment today (10th May.) A bit late sure, but I was doing other work for other teachers. Anyways, I tried to make this app and although it isn't terrible, it isn't as good as what is required. We were told to make a Maths game which would randomly generate two numbers and then randomly tell the user to multiply, divide, subtract or add them. It should also keep track of the score and time and if they are doing well, the difficulty should increase. 

This cannot be done in the timescale, it's simply not possible. However, when I spoke to my Dad he told me to contact my teacher and ask for help. I get what he's saying, but it's impossible. With the time I've got I highly doubt that I can drastically improve my assignment. So I said ""okay dad, but there isn't much I can do due to the limited timescale."" This kinda annoyed me as I get what my Dad is saying, but I really can't do a whole lot about it.

Also, leading back to my work, I've produced a game that can generate random numbers, but you can only multiply them together. That's it. Sure it says ""well done"" or ""wrong"" depending on your answer, but nothing more. It's probably 40% of what the requirements ask. 

Again, I can't do anymore. Ive searched high and low for YouTube and website tutorials but due to the software that we need to use being unpopular, there is literally nothing. As for using more advanced software like Unity, I can't learn it in time to even make anything as those programmes are insanely complex (as good as they are.) 

So really I'm asking if I should contact my teacher tomorrow and give him a heads up as I feel like I'm a failure and I haven't done good enough. I want to cry. I work so damn hard and it feels like I'm stuck in the mud not progressing. I want to work in Formula 1 when I'm older and I realise that I need top grades, so anything less than perfection for me isn't good enough. 

Is an email even worth sending or do you reckon that seeing as he's aware of recent events, and literally told us not to sweat it, that hell be understanding? 

I'm just super scared if my work not being good enough, but I can't really do much more.

Thanks.",10May2020,1

871,"Tl;dr I've been failing uni for three years, much to my parents' chagrin, and want to take a year off to pay off my existing student loans and apply for other programs. How do I break it to my very demanding parents?

After a breakdown I had in December, I confessed to my mum that I haven't completed a full semester at uni the whole time I've been there (three years). I asked her to keep it a secret from my dad until I was ready to tell him but she told him herself within a month. I haven't told either of them any more information since then aside from very carefully worded ""updates"" on how uni is going now.

I was a star student in highschool and graduated with honors with acceptances from a lot of good programs but now I'm nearly 21 with almost no post secondary education under my belt. Needless to say, my parents (especially my dad) went from being extremely proud of me to constantly berating me for all my shortcomings whether that be my mental health problems (the reason why I tanked after highschool), lack of education or my lack of religious conviction. It feels like after I failed in one way, my dad lost all respect for me. He often says that I only have another three years until I won't be able to study anymore and will have to take a low paying factory job. He doesn't see the trades or college as a viable option, only a proper university. 

I've been working at a greenhouse since February and after finally having medication that works for me, I found a horticulture program that I want to get into and enrolled myself in an online horticulture class through a local college. The only issue is that even if I get into the, highly competitive, program, I won't start until March 2021 so I'm going to be taking a year off regardless of what happens. This year will also give me a chance to start my education again without any debt on my back. 

The issue is, my parents are convinced that I'm still at my first uni, just with a program change, and that I'm going to be going back in the fall. I'm terrified to tell them about my real plans because they already don't respect me at all but will definitely see me as even more of a failure if I tell them I won't be studying for the next while and when I do go back, it'll be to a college instead of a university. I don't want to live with them anymore, and have tentative plans to move out with a friend in August but I know if I make the decisions I'm making (especially moving out without technically needing to) they will treat me as a third class citizen from now on.

874,"I am a 42 year old single male with no children, no pets, living in SE Virginia, USA.

I have not held a real job in over 8 years. I quit my career IT job to take care of my dying parents. My mother passed in summer 2017 and my father in summer 2018. I have been doing part time delivery work like Uber Eats and living off my savings and a modest trust fund.

I have been spinning my wheels and doing absolutely nothing since my father died.

I am currently renting a house for 1000 dollars a month (I have 1 roommate who pays 1000/month). About 1300 a month with electric and internet. I don't need this much space, but it is nice having two private rooms and a private bathroom on 8 acres of secluded property.

I have no debt at all, just monthly expenses. I have 14,000 left in my bank, and 20,000 in a trust that pays 500 per month. My credit score is only 750 because the only credit history I have was my student loans, which have been paid off. I have never had credit cards or financed a car. I drive a 1998 Subaru Forest with 105k miles on it.

I know a full time job is the answer to most of my problems. However, its been so long since I have had a good job I am apprehensive about trying to get back into the IT field and doing 40 hr work weeks. Also, I have been rather depressed now that I have no family and feel completely alone. Furthermore, I am blind in my right eye (scarred retina), and have bad floaters in my left eye which make life difficult.

I want to move into a less expensive place, but apartments require applications with proof of income. Most apartments in my area are about 850 a month anyway, so its not that much of a savings after expenses (electric, internet, etc).

I don't smoke, drink, or do drugs. I spend my days on the internet and reading novels.

875,"Hi. Because of the confinement, I came back home in order to live with my family instead of staying alone in the city where I used to study. Living with them again has made me aware of some problems in my parents relationship that I had never noticed before.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad was just elected to some new post with additionnal responsibilites, for a two years mandate. Before that, my parents used to work together and had their own business, but nowadays my mon is left alone to do all the work, and it really took a toll on her mental and physical health. Even in those trying times, my dad insists on not taking the virus seriously and keeps going out to work so he ""can show people he's not afraid"" like some sort of communication power move. We... are very critical of this stance. As a result, we don't see him much and when we do, things can easily get bad.

&amp;#x200B;

They're bickering. My mom kind of takes everything he does and says at heart, she believes it to be all out of spite towards her. My dad is a very passive individual who went through some really bad stuff when he was a kid, so he kind of jokes about everything, or lie to get out of trouble, the kind of automatic go-to reaction that can make communication really difficult sometimes. He does take a lot of friendly/unfriendly shit from us with a lot of calm and humour, I must admit, but his whole ""nothing is that serious"" is really infuriating at times. On the contrary, my mon seems to be in a really bad place. She told him that she doesn't think she can forgive how he abandonned her to work alone, it's even making her question her profession.

&amp;#x200B;

She's joking around about the fact that he could have a mistress, which my siblings and I strongly believe to be a joke (my dad is no Casanova and I believe he'd never do that, but he's my dad so obv...), but I'm very anxiety prone and this is stressing me out.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom did throw around the word ""divorce"" when he was not around, which is what's making me panic a little because that means she really thought about it, it's not a ""heat of the moment"" threat. She feels like they have drifted away as people, in their political views, in their personnal ambitions, in personnalities... I know a divorce isn't the end of the world, especially since my mon and I know they could still be friends or at least on good terms, so I'm not afraid that it could tear our family appart. But the perspective of change is still terryfing. I'm a whole ass twenty year old ""grown-up"" but here I am crying at the simple idea that my parents don't love each other anymore. I want what's best for the both of them, and if it's a divorce, then okay it's fine, but I'm really afraid I could not cope with it if it happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to burden them with my own take on the matter because this is their relationship, and they deserve to be happy, even if it's not with each other. But I'm still feeling really unwell.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you know how I could cope with all that ? Help their relationship to go better, to be at least a little more peaceful ? Like I said, maybe they won't stay together romantically, but even in that case, I just want them to get along and be happy.",10May2020,1

I told him that I wanted to stop kissing until I figured out some things and he said he understands. How do I stop feeling guilty? And why do I feel ashamed?,10May2020,1

She and my parents think im totally fine while i‘m infact not at all, i told them i would like too see someone else but they said no, cause they think im good.

And in the nights like now i cannot sleep, i cry or hurt myself too feel better (i dont do that anymore cause of my bestfriend). I have alot of friends who have problems too, and im always looking out for them and hide everything from them. I dont even have the spirit too go to school anymore, i reached that point again but i tell myself too go every fucking day of my dumb life, so that no one notices.

880,"Hello everyone! Just curious on this topic. I’ve [F,23] been casually seeing this guy [M,27], we’re not in a serious relationship nor have specified the boundaries of our relationship. I met him on Hinge. We did set up a boundary of not having sex on the first hangout. We talk almost everyday but he goes long periods of time, sometimes hours and hours without talking to me which I get were adults. I hung out with him on Wednesday and we watched a movie, I brought sushi, and I spent the night. We did not have sex. Just made out a little. 

I insinuated that I think he talks to a lot of girls over text and he jokingly said, “who hurt you?” And he said he “doesn’t feel like he gives off that vibe at all.” 

When I told him I didn’t want to have sex he didn’t push it at all. I said, “I don’t want to have sex with you on the first date/hangout.” And he in a light hearted way said, “sex? Did I say I wanted to have sex?” I responded, “no.” And he said, “we don’t have to have sex. I respect you not wanting to.” 

I brought up something along the lines of what brought him to hinge and he said he was looking to settle down and slow down in his life/relationships. He also stated that he’s usually the guy who’s friend zoned. Quote, “I have a lot of girl friends but not a lot of girlfriends.” I noticed his phone also going off a lot when we hung out. 

Big thing for me though also was that his friend randomly FaceTimed him during our hangout and his friend was like “whats going on? Who’s in the background your wife/girlfriend you showed me on Instagram?” And he put the camera on me and his friends were like “there she is” almost cheering/laughing. 

I noticed tonight on Instagram he likes a lot of girls pictures and follows a lot of women. Models and pretty women alike. This is my insecurity talking 150% but it bothers me that he likes these girls ass pictures as of 1-3 days ago when we were just hanging out. 

I know I have no room or ground to be upset but it turns me off to the thought of this guy being a horn dog. I’m also thinking in long term, if we do end up dating the liking the other girls pictures will bother me more.",10May2020,1
881,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years. The first year was really rough, and there was toxicity on both sides but mainly him. Not being there for me, being distant, being mean , constant fighting and just him taking his problems out on me. After almost a year of fighting, we sat down and decided to stop this and try to work it out because we genuinely loved each other but weren’t communicating enough and allowing each other in. 

I’m not going to act like everything wasn’t hard for me and that how he acted is okay, but I’ve forgiven him and have continued the relationship. The past few months have been great. We’ve become so close and have really grown as a couple. 

The biggest problem is how busy he is. Due to his career, he doesn’t have a lot of time for me and is highly stressed so doesn’t really talk to me all day. I normally see him once or twice a week. He makes time for me when he can and will ignore his work to spend some time with me. I just can’t demand him to ignore his work to give me more attention, just like he wouldn’t demand the same from me. 

My family thinks the relationship isn’t healthy and have called me a booty call on many occasions. I will admit it’s not a normal relationship , but I’m very happy. He challenges me, encourages me and pushes me to be better. Sure, things aren’t ideal right now but he has goals. This dynamic allows me to focus on myself more too, where as I haven’t in past relationships. I’m happy in this relationship and I love my boyfriend very much , but I’m so tired of the arguments. How do I get them to understand I’m happy and I’m okay with this dynamic? 

If anyone is willing, please DM me and we can get more into it because I really would love an unbiased opinion on things.",10May2020,1
882,"There's this streamer who I admire a lot, and I recently started asking him for permission to draw him and post my works on my Instagram account. He was okay with that and gave me the permission to do it. He said that he even liked my drawings, and actually appreciated my work.

Yesterday he streamed something on Twitch. I don't have Twitch myself, so I missed it. But my cousin created herself an account to cheer me up and try to get him notice me and say something about my drawings, so she straight up pretended to be me to catch his attention.

She kept writing things on the chat like ""hiii I'm the person who asks for your permission to draw you on Instagram! You're really special to me!"". Non-stop, almost spamming and obviously overwhelming the streamer with messages waiting for him to say something about it. Tired of getting constantly those comments, the streamer obviously ended up getting mad at her. Or, well, at me, because that was who my cousin was claiming to be.

It was today, when I was on videocall with her, that she told me about what had happened yesterday.

""I kinda wanted to get him to notice you, but I think I made him mad...""

And she began to explain. I was kinda shocked, and I tried my best to explain her that what she had done was wrong. She's only ten, so it's understandable that she did what she did, but now I'm worried that the streamer may not believe the truth if I told him. Because, well, he doesn't know what happened, and could very well think that I'm making up stories. I had been finally able to get a bit close to someone I admired for a long time, I don't want him to view me as a spammer or some sort of crazy fan :(",10May2020,1

I am not sure why I’m starting to do this. It’s honestly humiliating and makes me want to hide away from everyone for as long as I can.

I've had her and friends insinuate that I'm either gay, asexual, or a loser (maybe there's some truth in that one). But the reality is I'm okay being alone.

889,"After years of anxiety created by my step dad, today I finally decided it was enough. I was tired of waiting for the other shoe to drop. He was very manipulative to everyone in his life - to the point where many people have cut him out of their lives over the years.


I live with my dad but my mom and brother still live with my stepdad. Today he called me from my moms phone (as I have him blocked on everything) and asked for an explanation as to why I cut him out. I tried to be civil and respectful at the beginning of the call until he started cutting me off and twisting my words so then I proceeded to tell the full truth of how I have always felt. I told him about the anxiety he has caused me throughout the years and how toxic and manipulative he could be with people. I regret getting so worked up in the moment but then he started calling me evil and manipulative so I ended the conversation civilly and told him that I still don’t want a relationship with him (note; I have lived with this guy for about 15 years and he feels like he’s my dad).

I know I am doing the right thing for myself and my mom has even told me that she understands why I’m doing it but I still feel bad. I just want to know how to move past this guilt so I can start living more independently. Any advice would be great.



The issue is my mom. The only reason I have kept the peace with him over the years was for the sake of having a relationship with my mom. In every situation, she picks him over me and my brother. She’s a great person and a good mom but she tends to put herself and her own issues above her kids and it always has been that way. She knows how toxic he is (as I have brought up my concerns to her many times ever since I was a kid) and still put me and my brother at his disposal. I don’t want to cut ties with her but I finally need to make choices for myself.

895,"Ohh well I don't know where to start but I'm a 17 y/o girl and it's currently almost 3 in the night but I'm unable to sleep and the reason is my elder sister and my best friend's grandpa. So the story is that when I was like 9 or 10 years old, my best friend's grandpa used to constantly sexually harass me like squeezing my boobs (and yeah I had boobs at that age cuz I was overweight) and touch my other private parts when my friend used to not be there and the most disturbing part was that his own wife would always see him doing that to me but would never say anything to him 

.i don't know if my best friend knew what was happening to me or not but I eventually stopped talking to her and her grandpa stopped doing anything to me. But that was only one part of my nightmare. So when I was like 7 years old, my sister used to touch me inappropriately in the nights and she sometimes used to kiss me on my lips (I know it's disturbing, it's hard for me to write this sorry) but whenever I used to ask her anything the next morning regarding her behaviours she would say that I was dreaming and nothing happened. That incident is still traumatizing for me but she doesn't do that now. But recently I started talking to my old friend again and from the past 2 weeks her grandpa has again started touching me inappropriately and I can't seem to do anything to stop him and along with this my sister has started sleeping in my room instead of hers. Although she doesn't do anything to me now but it still scares me whenever she sleeps closer to me. And this is why whenever I try to sleep now my mind just starts to show pictures of my friend's grandpa harassing me and how my sister used to touch me in the past and all this is enough to keep me awake throughout the night. I don't Fucking know what to do. I just want to kick my sister out of my Fucking room and I wish that old man bloody dies .

 I know it's wrong of me to think like that but I just can't help it. Please tell me what to do. I can't live the rest of my life scared and weak . I just want to sleep but I can't. My mind keeps showing me those images",10May2020,1

Alright, so I bought a car in '07, used the dealers preferred loans cause I was a dumb 20 year old.

When I got back, they shipped the title to my home, but then I got divorced, had to move into the barracks, and PCSed really quickly. My title has been missing since then. 

I didn't think about it for several years, because I'm dumb at any age, but then I decided to work on it. Sent letters to the DMV in Alaska to get a new title processed. They said they needed something from USAA. USAA says they dont have the records for my title anymore.

I don't really want to throw a huge party because I don't enjoy being in the centre of attention. I'd rather meet with a couple of my best friends and chill at my place. That would be fine but there is 1 problem.

Classmates which I'm not really close with keep inviting me to their parties. That's cool but when you invite somebody, you expect to be invited in the future to the party by the person you invited. That's why I'll feel guilt when going to these parties because as I said before - I don't want to invite people I'm not close with.

So there are 3 scenarios:

1. I go to the party and don't invite the person to my party -&gt; result: being seen as a bad mate who goes eagerly to the parties but don't invite other people
2. I don't go to the party -&gt; result: being seen as asocial
3. I go to the party and force myself to throw something bigger -&gt; result: me not being that happy as I could be on my birthday

I had to find temporary accommodations to try and weather out Covid because I am immunocompromised. I was set to work from home and it was going well for a while until my roommate disregarded the shelter in place order to go hang out with their friends. They work with the public so their risk of exposure is quite high, and seeing people outside of work does not help with this. I tried having a discussion with them about being more sanitary in the house and not visiting people because I'm at high risk. They agreed to this and then within two days, they preceded to continue their habits.

I discussed this with my doctor and they said I should either self isolate in my room or see if I can stay with a family who is working from home, or someone who has limited exposure to the public. I chose to try and stay with my brother but they live in another state. Before I decided to travel, I was able to get a Covid test to make sure I am being safe(it was negative). I called to book a flight with United and I told them that I am immunocompromised and I needed them to go over their sanitation policies and what they're doing to make sure that I will be safe. I was reassured that they are sanitizing and social distancing so I decided to book a flight with them. Well low and behold I see an article about United with a completely packed flight and how they were not distancing people and now I'm terrified to fly.

I'm in need of some advice on what to do here. I can stay with my parents, it's a bit of a drive but it'll be a pain to try and work (They're a huge distraction which is why they weren't my first choice). I called United and asked for an explanation as to why their policy changed and they couldn't give me an answer. I continued to ask questions about this issue and the person kept saying they didn't know. Eventually they disconnected me and I am PISSED. I used to work in customer service so I was by no means an ass hole.

The more I think about what I said and my self analysis the more I am coming to the conclusion that despite being dead set against it in the past I should go and do and open uni course to better my prospects. It would have to be foundational because my educational background is far from great. I am an unspectacular person in every conceivable way. I currently have a commission based role which can be very rewarding and I think I was getting there with it before lock down. However I am very aware also that it won't make me a millionaire and that there are people my age who make more. I'm still young and I think the regret of having done a course that wasn't needed would be worse than having not done one I should have. All I have for me is a determined mindset and the willingness to put the hours in. I've always told myself that although I can do that with work I can't with education. I am starting to think that is a false limitation that I've set for myself. That really I've became more than I was at school. Focused and I have a goal in mind. Which makes sense. I should become a better man with age.

Am I right? Would I be better focusing on getting better at my job and aiming for a promotion? Should I try and further my education despite the potential failure and debt? How do I know for sure? Or more sure?

Tldr: I want to be rich and all I have going for me is determination to work hard? Would that hard work be better focused on education?

This has lead me to being depressed/suicidal since I was 15 and I knew about 4 months ago if something didn't change I would kill myself sooner rather than later. So I got up and started doing shit got my license, started working out, tried to get confidence to be more extroverted and got my resume ready for some jobs in my local mall

And since the beginning of year 12 I've regretted taking IB so I'm wondering if I should just resit Year 12 and go to another sixth form/college and just do A-levels? (I don't mind adding an extra year before uni by the way) 

btw I don't know if this is relevant since this is my first post here bu these are my subjects:

914,"Hi, I'm 16F!

Me and this boy follow each other on Instagram (we have mutual friends but never met and he is a year older than me).

He replied to two selfies (over time), now calling me cute.
And I reply with ""thank you &lt;33"" or something he says ""no problem :)"" and it's cool, nothing more nothing less..

But honestly no guy has ever complimented me like that (though it is so minor and he may compliment all his girl friends like that). I always go back to those texts and read it again, it makes me feel really good. I felt more confident in throughout the rest of the day and I don't really understand why? 

Suddenly I can't stop thinking about that text even though he probably didn't even mean it so deeply and I start to develop a little crush. 

I am such a hopeless romantic and I don't know if it is normal to feel like this after some person calls you cute like twice...
No boys have ever really wanted to talk to me, I don't think one boy has ever fancied me so this probably explains how I catch feelings so fast; I'm not used to it? I start to look at people in a different light (crushy type vibes) even if they are simply NICE. 

Then I step back from it all and think, ""okay this person calls you cute twice and now u are in love?? Breathe man!!!"" 
I always say to myself ""hahaha I'm such a virgin!!!1!1!"" To try and excuse my ""behaviour"" about it.

*I need to know how to take these compliments not so seriously (or if I don't need to??)*

Sorry if this seems like the dumbest advice question, feel free to just not reply. But I am so confused with myself (is it hormones? I don't knowww 😣)

Thank you!!! ^^",10May2020,1
915,"So, context: I’d just arrived home late at night and the sky was pretty so I tried to take a photo of it to no avail. However, as I was heading back in, my cat dashed out and I couldn’t catch him. So, I just thought, “Whatever; I’ll wait it out and he’ll eventually come meowing at the door to be let in as he always does.” The only problem.....I feel asleep. I fuckin’ fell asleep. And I woke up the next morning to my dad banging on my door and asking what’s happened to the cat. 

Long story short, we’ve searched for him everywhere but he’s nowhere to be found. My dad had heard a ruckus in the middle of that night, and, upon going downstairs to investigate, found an upturned potted plant holder-thing outside. He was too tired to really think about it, though, and went back upstairs. Now, we live in an area with coyotes; my sister said she’d heard them cackling that night. I think you can piece together what we believe had happened.





That cat was my dad’s best fuckin’ friend. 

And I fell asleep.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to think; what to feel. I‘m completely lost and terrified and angry at myself for letting it happen and just completely and utterly depressed that my dad won’t be able to come home from his deeply stressful job and just cuddle up with his little buddy anymore.

It sucks to even type that. It sucks so fucking much, I just...

My dad hasn’t been the same since and, honestly, neither have I. I haven’t seen him smile once. I haven’t found the motivation to do anything besides sleep and drink water. 

I don’t know what to do, and at this point, I’m desperate—not as much for me as I am for my dad.

920,"Hi everyone,

I just graduated from college in the Midwest (US), and my parents in NYC are pressuring me to come back and see them for 3 weeks to a month. I have a job lined up in the West Coast, where I will be working from home for a few months to a year until this pandemic settles down (couple year contract I signed). The job officially starts in early August, and I need to arrive a few weeks early to quarantine myself after I land.

I really don't want to travel from a low-risk sparsely populated area in the Midwest to the epicenter of the world for corona virus, and risk getting my parents sick. They are in their 50s and are at high risk. They don't seem to understand that if I get sick, I can spread it to them and kill them. Also, if I get sick, I may have to delay my job's start date (can't travel or program properly while hospitalized). 

The only reason why I would see them is to make them happy and so we can regroup for a bit, but it is not necessary at all and my lease in the Midwest ends in early August, so I can stay here until moving out to the west coast.

Regardless of my points, they still want me to come in 3 weeks to see them. No matter what I say they keep manipulating me to feel bad for them and to come ""home"". I try to tell them to think logically and not emotionally, and they don't fucking care. Every single day we argue about this and I can't seem to suck it up and officially tell them I am not coming. I don't know what its going to take, but I wouldn't be surprised if I don't speak to them for a month. I am pretty content where I am and I feel fine with my few friends on campus.

Does anyone know what to say to them so I can just cut this crap out? I am not legally obliged to follow their demands, I am an adult. My father is more understanding but is also very unreliable, and my mom is just a conservative workaholic who think she is immune to this virus.

921,"I want to start commuting to work by bike instead of walking. However I’m paranoid about what could happen to my $2k bike when I park it outside in front of my work where the only place I can lock it is up-to a thin metal fence/handrail structure which although is in direct view of the street, I still don’t deem safe because it’s not well lit and there’s hardly anybody around at night when I finish my shift, so someone could easily tamper with my bike without being noticed. I’m not keen on the idea of getting a cheap bike specifically just for commuting to work.


I want to park my bike securely inside the building but I’m not aware of anywhere I could do that – aside from either in front of reception in the waiting area or in the reception area itself behind the desk. I’m hoping there is an area available that I’m not aware of but would be able to utilise.


How do I bring this up with my boss that I want to bike to work, but feel uncomfortable parking outside where the security is minimal and hence I want to know if there is anywhere available where I could park it safely indoors instead, without sounding either entitled, overly paranoid/fussy or stirring the pot too much (also only been here a few months lol)?


If it makes any difference, I work in a retirement home. I don’t know how my boss will feel about me parking my bike by reception as it will be visible to everyone who walks in and also…what happens when it rains? Would it be socially acceptable for me to wheel in a dripping wet bike and park it inside? (Would probably be wheeling it 10m or so). I feel like this is just recipe for strange looks from staff, even if my boss says it’s okay but doesn’t pass the message around of my plans.


I don't want to come across paranoid because it’s like “well, lock it up and you’ll be right…no one will want your bike that much”. My boss knows I live close to work (15 min walk away) so could easily take the “why can’t you just walk instead?” stance, but as I work nights, I find it much safer to bike home than walk home. I’m also 17 so in the eyes of some it could be “can you be picked up by mum/dad instead?” 


Another place I could park my bike is at the back of the building where the big skip bins are – but that could also be argued just as unsecure – it’s not a well lit area and despite the area being out of view from the street which means a thief is unlikely to suspect anything and find my bike, one that is planning their move also has it easier as they don’t have to worry about anyone looking at them.


I don’t think anybody else bikes to work that I’m aware of, so I’m in the minority and getting together with a group to ask for secure parking is not an option.


I’ve considered sending my boss a quick email, how does this look?


Hello (name)


I am planning to commute to work by bike in the coming weeks, however am slightly concerned about the security of parking my bike outside by the front fence/handrail. Is there anywhere inside the building where I would be able to park my bike more securely?


Kind Regards

TLDR: want to bike to work but nowhere secure to park, how do I ask my boss to park inside the building?",10May2020,2
922,"A little backstory:

I currently work as a manager in the same fast food restaurant I started at immediately following high school in 2014. I'm able to pay my bills with this job, but I hate it. I'm miserable here, and if I wasn't dependent on the steady pay I would have quit long ago.
I also have an Associate's (AA) from the local community college and while the degree is just in liberal arts, I was a communications major for a lot of my time there and so a lot of my credits are from those courses.
I know an AA isn't worth much of anything in today's world, but maybe I could use it to get a job that doesn't involve flipping burgers? What types of jobs should I be looking at? 

Also, which other subreddits should I look at to answer my question? I plan on returning to school once this pandemic is over - my goal is to become a high school teacher.",10May2020,2

So I have pretty bad anxiety, I text my boyfriend and best friend a lot, mostly reassurance questions, sometimes I just want my boyfriend to come over. I try and let them know if I’m thinking of hurting myself. I’m moving to NY in about four months,  my boyfriend and I have been having issues with his depression and we have been getting into a lot of fights. He wouldn’t tell me if he wanted to go or not. Finally, he texted me this “I'm really scared to go. Our frequent fights for the past several months have made me really afraid of the idea of going. I feel my mental health just progressively getting worse, and continually having fights or having to talk you down on a regular basis is a serious contributor to that. I have been really scared to admit that. I've walked away from fights or situations with my chest really tight, and struggling to keep focus on anything.” he said he wants to work it out but wants a 3 week break to figure things out. I texted my best friend the next day and she then says to me, “well I feel the same. You clearly have problems to work out and my family and friends don’t want me being friends with you. I couldn’t find the right time to tell you, but I guess now is” she asked to be still very friends but I very much said no. Should I forgive my boyfriend? Am I a problem?

926,"So I’ve been doing a lot of thinking and decided I would post this because it’s been on my mind a ton lately and need to have someplace to just let it out, maybe it’s a dumb question or none of my business. 

So backstory to this: Growing up my family and I have hung out with the same families that my parents have been friends with since birth. Throughout my whole 16 years on Earth, our group of friends has remained the same and we know each other super well and get along amazing (our group is 4-5 families, average number of people per family is 5+). We are all Christians (pls don’t hurt me Reddit) and we all kinda monitor each other and keep each other in check. Two of these families in particular are slightly frowned upon by the others but still very much loved by our group. One of these families has a very attractive 18-19 (can’t remember the exact age) girl who has had a couple of boyfriends that she broke up with pretty fast. It isn’t really obvious but all the moms in the group kinda don’t like that she’s had a couple of boyfriends, among other, not major things. The other family has two boys, one who is super outdoorsy and hunts, fishes, etc. Sadly this boy (who’s 15) does unhealthy things such as drinking, lots of swearing, etc. but is still fun to hang out with and respectable. His parents pray for him all the time and try to steer him in the right direction but he doesn’t really care/listen and does his own thing. 

So now to the story, so recently our group of families have gotten together a couple times during this quarantine and hung out. Both of these times that we’ve been hanging out I’ve noticed the 18-19 girl (let’s call her Jane) and the boy (John) have been leaving numerous times together and go into the woods/somewhere they’re alone. They’ve never done it before and have only started doing it recently. If they aren’t alone they’re always with each other, John is super girl crazy though so it isn’t a surprise, he’s always hanging around girls. I’ve never actually seen what they do when they’re alone but it’s a pretty good guess, especially when the girl’s older brother has to go “check on them” sometimes, (there was also something that happened that I’m not going into details about). I really don’t know why, but this has been bothering me very much lately, first because I never thought Jane would be the type of person to do what she’s probably doing (as a Christian and just in general) and it’s kinda changed my view on her. Second because the parents have no idea, and I’m afraid if somehow the parents find out it could really put a dent in our big group of families relationship. My mother even asked me the other day about “why are Jane and John with each other so much and going off together.”

Don’t get me wrong, it’s really not my business, but I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s been nagging at me for the past week or so. I’ve considered asking the older brother about the situation to get a clear answer but haven’t yet. So that really brings me to my conclusion/advice question. Do I ask the older brother about the situation and see if it’s as bad as I think or just let the whole thing carry out and see what happens? Once again I know it’s not my business but it has been on my mind so much lately and I figured reddit is where I can pour out my thoughts :/",10May2020,1

We didn’t talk much after he moved out of town (high school), and I moved out too soon after. After a while words got by that his grandpa passed away. He was devastated as he doesn’t have very good relationship with his parents, and gramps was the only one who supported him. He contacted me and we started talking again. I thought it was good that he was opening up to someone, but he always said things like wanting to die, that things would be better if so and that he couldn’t take it anymore. Of course I tried to support him anyway I could, telling him that we were there for him, that we cared and he could always count on me.

939,"I live in toronto so any insight from people in toronto would be helpful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two days ago, my bestfriend tried to commit suicide by overdosing on insulin. She was in coma for four hours. She soon woke  up and stayed in the ER with security guards guarding her. in the morning, she told a lie (I'm not quite sure what it was), and she was released before seeing a psychiatrist and her parents picked her up. 

Between then and now (she won't tell me what happened but I feel a little uncomfortable asking her) But after she went home, at night the paramedics rushed into her home, and took her to the hospital again and made her sign a form.

Again, they stuck needles in her. And now they're even being harder in enforcing rules and giving her absolutely nothing, not even a pad because they're scared she can use it to do something. 

Now she's in a room in the ER, by herself, hungry as they haven't given her food and she hasn't eaten since last night at 11 pm. They made her sign a form so she can't be leaving any time soon until they think she's okay. 

One nurse, when injecting needles into her, did it so roughly that her hand hurt to a point a doctor had to do an ultrasound on her. 

They also are keeping her quarantined due to covid-19. 

Sometimes, she'll ask for water, and the nurse will forget it. 

It seems worse than being in isolation in prison. At least they get food.  

This will make her mental health worse. She is smart, really smart but broken. She's the smartest person I know. 

I'm not sure if the paramedics came and took her because she attempted suicide a second time, or because they found out she lied (one day earlier) or because she was exhibiting the symptoms of covid-19. I don't want to ask her because I don't want to put her in a painful state of mind. 

Her parents are very ignorent and I wouldn't be surprised if they said something that led to this. 

But I know from the way they are treating her, that once she does come out and she will (after social engineering the staff), I will not be surprised if she'll do this again.

940,"I'm in the UK and have been in lockdown for just about 2 months now. I got stuck at home just before lockdown was announced as I had come home from uni for a memorial service which was then cancelled due to COVID. 

Even though I am with my family, I feel incredibly lonley, I havn't been able to see my girlfriend in person for 2.5 months as we go to different universities. On top of that the university I attend has given us a large number of assignments due to not being able to complete end of year exams. I haven't had a proper break and I am trying to retain an internship for the summer. Even though I am talking to my girlfriend and close friends on a daily basis and am keeping fit. Despite this, I find myself getting incredibly lonley and upset all the time, I regurlarly just sit doing nothing because I feel to shit to do anything ( I can't even bring myself to watch Netflix). I talk to my girlfriend loads and we do movie nights and stuff like we would usually do if we were together. What I think makes it harder is seeing all my friends still at uni and enjoying themselves. When I talk to my siblings or parents about how I'm finding it, they usually just say something along the lines of ""cheer up"" or ""it's the same for everyone else"". This leads me to just not want to leave my room. 

I just don't know what to do because it seems like its going to be at least another 2 months before I get to see someone outside of my family and I'm finding harder everyday to cope.

941,"I was not on the sidewalks yet I was still in the road by the intrance. I was carrying a cup of soda and a snack from the gas station I walked to. I was tempted to chuck the soda at the dog when he got closer but it freaked me out(I did NOT want to get bit) so I ran up the closest street in my neighborhood but the dog was running behind me(and getting closer) when I yelled out ""hey! Get your dog now!"" I saw no owner but when I yelled it again (louder because he literally was 5 steps away from me) the owner she kind of smirked and said ""oh he doesn't bite"" but then why would he come lunging at me?

Almost every day, for 8 hours a day, she sits near my office and screams the n-word nonstop at the top of her lungs.  


We (workers in the office) have called the non-emergency police line soooooo many times.  They never show up to move her.  We are afraid if we confront her she could become violent.


I have tried to be sympathetic since she isn't all there but I can't take it anymore.  I just can't take it.  8 hours of constant screaming and racial slurs is driving me up the wall.  She screams so loud we hear her over music and traffic, through locked doors, everything.  She isn't even that close to us.  She's over 75 feet from our office door and we hear her clear as day.

944,She is in an abusive relationship with a piece of garbage egomaniac for ten years. Has three kids with him. He cheats on her constantly with other women. Some of whom are escorts. He verbally abuses her. And has physically assaulted me. He’s 6’4 250. I am 5’8 170. He has now ruined Mother’s Day for her. And by extensions us as well.

I live in London, where you're looking at at least £600 a month before bills for rent/travel etc. My family home is closer to my office than anywhere I can afford, and therefore it's cheaper to get to work, and i've been putting aside £700 a month (almost like a rent to myself) in the hopes of affording a place. 

Aside a couple of things (like my laptop breaking one month etc) I've stuck to it. And now I've discovered that getting a deposit for a house means next to nothing.

953,I’m 14 years old I made a big mistake way in the past and I feel like crap right now. When It was the beginning of 7th grade a guys best friend asked me out for his friend. I said yes and met the guy the next day. I’ve known the guy since we always rode the bus together. In the beginning of our relationship he got a random 8th grade to try and flirt with me to see if I was “loyal”. The 8th grader kept asking me for a pencil and kept trying to talk to me. I kinda was trying to learn and so I kinda ignored him. My boyfriend was taking to a guy and that guy pointed it out and that’s how I found out my boyfriend was trying to test me.ilI’ve known the guy since elementary and he was my first boyfriend(we’ve also been best friends).So I was kinda mad but I didn’t say anything because I didn’t know what to say. Always on the bus Me and him we’re always teased for dating and he always walked me home. It felt kinda weird cause ever since then we were VERY shy towards each other. And all of a sudden all of his friends were trying to be my friends(they never talked to me once or even noticed me). I kinda missed when everything was normal and no one was teasing us and we would laugh and talk again like normal. I wanted to break up with him but I didn’t want to hurt him. So I came up with the idea that my dad found out and that we couldn’t date anymore because my dad wouldn’t let me date until 10th grade. I told him and we immediately never spoke to each other again. I felt so bad and I want to tell the truth because I was bad for lying and I hate lying. I lost my friend and all of his friends were being rude to me. Eventually his friends stopped but I still feel bad I want to be his friend because he was such a great friend. I’m scared if I tell him the truth he’ll hate me even more. I just want things to go back to how they were when we were just best friends. But I think I am too late and I’m scared of everybody else too! I wanna make thing right but idk.

954,"I have to admit, this post it really long and kind of a roller coaster but I really want help improving or learning. I can’t express enough how much it means to me if you read till the end.

I’m starting to think I’m just stupid and inferior.

I’m in college right now and my semester ended recently. I really need some help and advice basically on how to learn in a general sense. No matter how much effort or time I put into things, after a certain limit I no longer improve or get better. Whether it be school, video games, anything my potential just plateaus at a very low point.

If you looked at my grades in school, you would think I put minimal effort into the things I do just to get by. But the fact of the matter is, I put a good amount of time and effort learning the material, asking questions in class and going over homework to prepare for tests.  When it comes time for the test I always get between a D+ and a C no higher than that. Then when I go over and see my friend and he shows me his test he got a B or an A when he was on the night before playing video games. I have things open on my computer and see him actively playing games.

If I am being honest with myself, in the summer I put more effort into video games than I do into school work during the school year. I play for hours, especially during quarantine and I am the type to dedicate myself to a game. Even so, after about a certain amount of hours I stop improving. My friends who have played less than me surpass me or are just as good as me after I spent the whole day practicing something or just playing nonstop through out the week.

I have tried for a long time to get a girlfriend too and have asked many many out. And one rejection doesn’t hurt, but the fact that every single one does. I’d say I’m pretty attractive and people really like me and say I’m like the nicest person and everything, but it seems like that’s all I’m good for. No girl ever agrees to do anything with me and then ghosts me or stops talking to me and trust me I’ve tried everything and I’m not shy.

My failures have caused me long term depression. I’m not going to pretend anymore. On the outside everyone sees me as a happy fun and caring person and I was a couple years ago, but I’m really hurting :(. When I do cry or express my emotions of sadness to my parents, specifically my dad, says I’m a baby and I’m being stupid until I get to the point where I tell them I want to “leave this world” until they actually start feeling concerned.

Nothing makes me more upset than my own incompetence. I’m not going to say how, but sometimes when I get frustrated with myself after a long time, I hurt myself to feel better. To put it lightly I wish I was never born.

This post is about improving and getting better at things but my mental state is really bad right now :(. Please help me.",10May2020,1

964,"Our new neighbors moved in 2 weeks ago. We didn’t see them and didn’t go up to greet them like we normally do because we’re under quarantine where we are. We bought a card to leave at their door but haven’t gotten around to it yet.

I should mention our building was built in the early 90’s and prior tenants have caused property damage so now there’s a lot squeaky floorboards everywhere. The walls and floors are very thin.

Since they moved in, both my SO and myself hear angry stomping, banging, slamming every door... ok, just noisy neighbors - annoying but manageable.

But the first weekend came and on Friday, at exactly 2pm, we start hearing screaming and yelling, roaring out from nowhere. Phrases like “don’t you fucking roll your eyes at me, bitch”; “didn’t you hear me the first time, are you stupid?”; “don’t you dare fuckin cry”; stuff like that. I can’t make out all of it but can hear enough to get the jist. It’s always accompanied by a ton of screaming/yelling that sounds like it’s coming from both sides, and I can hear things being thrown at the walls. The woman often leaves in a huff after this (I can hear her slam the front door and run down the concrete stairs) but always comes back after like 10 minutes.

Sometimes I hear bigger slamming sounds too, and I don’t want to make assumptions about what it could be but the mind wanders and based on the sound and force behind it, I worry it’s one of them getting thrown against or pushed into the walls or floors. They full speed run across the apartment, and based on weight, it honestly sounds like she’s trying to run away from him. We can hear them chatting if we’re all on our respective balconies at the same time, and he routinely tells her to shut the fuck up, even when they seem to be getting along.

I can tell it’s coming from upstairs because I’ve gone outside on the balcony and it’s silent, only to walk back inside and it’s like I’m in the room with them again from a sound perspective.

They’ve had this same routine both weekends they’ve move in. They always start fighting around 1/2 pm and it’s loud enough that it’s woken me from a deep sleep quite a few times. It’s Sunday and they’re going at it again, just like they did Friday and Saturday - same as last weekend. They’re so loud and violent up there that my cat has been hiding under the bed and whimpering every weekend because she’s so scared. She won’t even come out to eat or drink until nighttime.

I’m currently listening to them fight right now (they’ve been going at it off/on since 1, which woke me up) and they threw what sounds like a glass or vase(?) against the walls and a bunch of beads(?) fell on the floor. It sounds like they’re fighting about someone else this time, the man just keeps screaming “if you knew he was there, why the fuck you’d hang out?” I heard a big slam sound again. Now he’s scream-called her a dumbass and telling her “you should be glad I fuck with you at all.” Three more huge slams on the floors, each harder than the last, and constant yelling “shut the fuck up bitch.”

My SO just woke up from the really big slam sound. He said they began this in the early morning hours when he was still awake and were really loud even then (he said he was surprised I didn’t wake up). I asked him what they were fighting about and he said he could just hear a lot of yelling on both sides.

I’d like some advice on how to proceed from here. I’ve been a mandated reporter before when I used to work for kids and the abuse alarm bells in my head are blaring. I’ve never reported on the behalf of adults before, and am unfamiliar with the process. I feel out of my depth and really wanna help if there’s an abusive situation going on but also don’t wanna stick my nose where it doesn’t belong. We don’t know these people, we’ve never met and they’ve only been here two weeks. We’re also under quarantine, so I don’t know what their real daily schedules are like; we’ve all been ordered inside except for essentials for over a month now.

My SO and I have already discussed calling the nonemergency number to explain the situation but is there anything else we can do? We tried recording some of it to give to the cops as evidence but it wasn’t clear on the video despite being super loud irl. I’m worried that since their fighting is so off/on and inconsistent, the cops will get here during a calm patch, find nothing amiss, and it may just get worse from there for the abuse victim. I’m really worried for this woman.

Please excuse any misspelling or bad phrasing, I was attempting to write and listen out for sounds from above at the same time.",10May2020,1
965,"Ive been dating my girlfriend for about a year and a half, I feel that we love each other dearly and we both have great chemistry, but I feel that this quarantine is maybe bringing the worst out of us. We're both living with out parents, social distancing and all and I feel that we have fought more frequently. We did fight, very rarely, before the quarantine but we would get over it in a day or two, and we were perfectly fine. 

I feel that she does show signs of anxiety and self consciousness, since she wears baggy clothes and isn't the best with social interactions, usually not knowing what to say in a basic conversation, and I've tried to be very understanding of her. She overthinks a lot and I've tried to get her to talk to me about anything, trying to listen to whatever problems she has and also trying to ease her anxiety and fears. I've been very patient with her for a long time, and ive truly tried to be a good boyfriend, I say all the nice things because I mean them but I feel that she doesn't want to actually believe them. I also feel that i have to walk on eggshells because she's so sensitive to honest statements and I'm at a loss for what to do. 

We got into a fight recently because I was told something at the last second and I don't like having things thrown at me when I have other plans, I told her that she knows that I don't like having stuff thrown at me so spontaneously and that if she told me a day before I would've been fine with it. I've been more.. strong when talking with her, trying to get her to stop being so stubborn but to no effect. I feel that I may be doing the wrong thing and that I may be miscommunicating my feelings, and the fact that I feel like im walking on eggshells when honestly talking to her makes it more difficult to express myself.

969,"Hi. This is an issue I've been struggling with for a long time. I'm sorry if this is long.

I (21F) have a lot of conflicting feelings towards my mom, if you're curious for all the details you can check out my post history. The tldr of all of it is that until I moved out of her house at 19, I was constantly exposed to cigarette smoke every day because she would only smoke in the house. She smoked like 3 packs a day and our house was only 600sq ft, and I'm not even counting the times when my stepdad (also a smoker) was at home, doing the same thing.

She smoked constantly and almost never got up from her chair. She hasn't worked since I was like 7. All of this led to her having tons of strokes and almost died and now she has to live in a nursing home. She's been there since September.

I've also realized that she sort of emotionally neglected my little brother (14M) and I when we were kids. There was no lack of love from her, and even though she was always in the house and never left, she really never tried to talk or connect to us. I spent all of my days either outside or in my room playing video games, watching tv, or reading. I would walk by her and she wouldn't really acknowledge me at all.

This didn't become a real problem for me until later on when my mom realized that I hated physical touch. I didn't get many hugs or touches in general when I was a kid so I never got used to them. She got mad at me for that and tried to force me to like touch, which obviously didn't help.

I started to resent her more and more later on when her health really declined and she started to rely on me, a teenager, to take care of her. I was in high school and music programs and I wasn't sleeping because I had no time between it all. I asked her if I could get therapy or take antidepressants because I got diagnosed with depression, and even though SHE HAS DEPRESSION TOO, she didn't let me do any of it. 

I moved out when I was 19 and started living with my dad because I realized that other people could smell cigarette smoke on me. I had had no idea before because I was literally noseblind to it, and the thought that I reeked of smoke my entire life made me furious. About a year after I moved out is when she had the strokes that almost killed her.

My main issue right now is that when I see my friends with their moms, I just get really sad and upset that I'll never have that. My mom's still alive, but I've grown to almost hate her for everything she's done and how selfish she's been. My poor fucking brother who's only fourteen is messed up from this, too.

This hits most with my roommate. My roommate has a great relationship with her mom and she visits often. I just get really fucking sad when she visits because I'll never have that and it's almost led to me being upset with my roommate over it, although I obviously hide that from her because it's not her fault.

I don't know what to do, seeing all these mother's day posts that everyone's made about their moms is really fucking me up and making me really sad. I feel like I have nobody, especially right now during quarantine and I just feel like a miserable sack of depression and hatred. I guess if anyone has any advice on anything that can help I would really appreciate it.",10May2020,2
970,"My sister has high-functioning Aspergers, and while her stubbornness and other characteristics typical of autism have always been difficult to deal with, I still love her to death and I appear to be the only one in my family who genuinely believes nothing can hold her back and she can succeed in anything she wants. My family didn't think she'd even go to college and boom, she's in her last year of her major. But recently, I think in the past six months, she's gone through a change that's made it very difficult to be with her and I've been struggling how to help her out of this mental hole that I believe is limiting her potential.

It started a little before the pandemic, but she's been talking about having anxiety that sounds like it's really been doing a number than her. I'm diagnosed with OCD and GAD myself so I understanding all about anxiety, but I must admit it's been very difficult to emphasize with how she presents hers. She talks about it non-stop, and she even has a shirt she always wears that says ""ANXIETY"" on it like it's some banner of pride or uniqueness. Anxiety is a struggle with me every day, and it almost feels like she's minimizing that, but I digress.

Perhaps to cope with the pandemic like most people are, my sister has taken to talking to people online. This shouldn't be an issue, except she's practically obsessed with her online friends (I think she talks to them for like 6-8 hours and may be procrastinating schoolwork to talk to them) and they really just seem like they don't have a good influence on her. I think she's talking to those alt-lite dorks you see scattered everywhere on discord and have made her think being mean to her family makes you seem more adult or something because she's really hostile with me. Any time I came into her room, it's like I'm a burden, and talking with her is like walking on eggshells. It's even worse with my parents, who she constantly snaps at and refuses to take any advice from. Just last night, before mother's day, she told my mom how much she fucked her up. I know we're all hurting, but she doesn't have any right to put the pain on others. She even has an online boyfriend who honestly seems pretty nice, but I am worried he's projecting a lot of his anxiety and worried unto my sister because her anxiety has gotten worse since they started ""dating"". She's even said how he's ""the most important person in my life right now"" and I'm honestly really worried she's gonna get led on for a ride.

In summary, I feel like I'm worried she just not setting her self-up for success. She doesn't get out unless I force her for a walk. She's treating her online friends like her family instead of the people who actually care about her. She's obviously struggling with anxiety. She has so much incredible potential and I just don't want that to go to waste. I will do anything to keep her safe and happy but she's causing a lot of fights in my family and I can only listen to her problems for so long before my patience dries up.

Any advice is welcomed. Thank you.",10May2020,1

973,"Hi. I am living in Maryland with two loving parents and my sister. My family seems like the dream family but it isn’t, we all suffer from our own issues, yet we try to stick together as much as possible. There is one thing holding us back though, I hate my dad. 

My dad is strong minded, hardworking, and expects so much from me and my sister. But his behavior has has an extreme role throughout my childhood. His anger, neglect, stubbornness, and fear, has made me develop social anxiety when I was 7. Yet while I had social anxiety my dad never took action to help me. Instead he ridicule me, make me feel guilty, and yell a lot. If I cried he threatened he would “give me away,” “let me run away,” “put me up for adoption,” or “send me to a hospital.” If I got below an A he would become upset, and watch me do my homework, not letting me leave until I finished. He forced me into sports I didn’t like. He forced me into programs I didn’t want to attend. If I spoke up, he would shame me, and sometimes threaten to lock me in my room for the night. He would call me sensitive, yet I couldn’t control my emotions because of the condition I had. 

My worst year ever was the year when he realized he needed to change. I got into an emotionally abusive relationship with a girl, yet he didn’t believe me. In fact he urged me to make up with her, threatened to take me out of my school if I didn’t talk to her, and forced me into social situations with her. At the same time both him and my ex made comments about my body and personality. She would say I’m fat and ugly. He would say I’m sensitive, stubborn, emotional, and too skinny. My dad continued to put me up to impossible expectations and cruel punishments. I developed bulimia, anorexia, and depression. Near the same time I realized I was gay, yet my dad outed me (when he realized I looked up “how to come out”) when I was not ready, and it ruined me even more, even if he accepted me.

When he found that I had been abusing laxatives he brought me to my therapist (good move) yet later made comments like “Wow your grades are so good with you having these EDs, I’m excited to see what they would look like after you are treated.” My dad is never really there for me or proud of me, so throughout my treatment my mom brought me places, while my dad didn’t even signal he was happy, felt loved, or was proud of me. Yet I battled it by myself, and I won the battle.

My dad has changed and hasn’t changed. He still loves money and his job more then my family, yet when he does have time he spends most of it with me. It makes me feel bad though because now he is neglecting my mother and I feel guilty. The second reason why I feel guilty is if I bring up something he says that is wrong he will say, “Wow you must really hate me if you could think I would ever be that bad of a person.” He comments about how gapped my teeth are and how long my toes are. He would yell at me if I felt he was doing something wrong. He forced me on challenging schedules. He has mocked my singing, shamed my passions, and now comments about my sisters weight and schedule. It it triggering for me and I’m worried my sister will get an ED because he says things like “You ate that much Jello? That much Jello could feed a whole family.” Still he is better then he used to be, he is trying to be a good dad. 

He is trying to change, yet I still have really bad anxiety from him. I can’t get over my low 
self-confidence and he won’t be happy for me. I feel guilty though because I know I’m not in the worst household ever. For example he accepted that I was gay, not many fathers do that. He also doesn’t hurt me physically. I know he is trying to change and I want him to, put he can’t change me. He can’t change what he has done to me.  I feel guilty that I hate him so much, and I can’t tell if it’s natural or if he is making me feel guilty. I’m scared. Can I please have some advice.",10May2020,2
974,"This started about two years ago when my brother started smoking weed. I never had money to smoke but I wanted to, so I resorted to taking my brothers weed. Just a little at first, but I started getting bolder and taking larger amounts until he started noticing. Two years later, this is still going on, except he's gotten smart and gotten a safe to keep me out of his things. Still, I continue to go into his room every chance I get and scrape the leftovers out of his grinder or the dab resin out of his rig. I don't want to do this and I know it makes my family upset when they tell me time and time again to stop, but I can't stop. Even when I have my own weed, I'm still tempted to make from my brother.

975,"My husband and I have been married for about 7 years. I don’t get me wrong I love him a lot. But there has always been a constant issue with him and My mother-in-law always acting like his 27 year old son is a baby.

My MIL and I usually get along very well, but we do butt heads with the constant need she has to control my husband. Somehow she manages to switch the narrative and make herself the victim and me the bad guy. 

A few things they have done are bought a motorcycle for him without consulting with me, using my husbands credit to get a brand new truck while I was at work, and almost buying him a plane ticket for vacation without even considering my daughter and I.

I don’t know if it’s the fact that she pretty much left him with his grandma for the first 5 years of his life that she feels the need to continuously baby him or what it is, but  lately I have been very fed up and boy has she noticed. I talked to her calmly about getting my husband and motorcycle was not right because that decision should have included me as well, doesn’t mean I would disagree, but that we are married. She got very angry and acted like a victim to my husband and told him a bunch of lies I didn’t say like for example I wanted her to take his motorcycle away from him but she would never do that, of course I never said this.

Like I said we have butted heads but this time she is acting plain out hostile and childish. I don’t know what to do, I guess my question is how to Deal with such a controlling MIL without breaking my relationship with her or affecting my husband?",10May2020,1
976,"For background: I (19 F) am home from college. I have two younger siblings, one a sophomore in high school and the other in elementary. My mom has a pretty bad autoimmune disorder that she refuses to acknowledge past taking her necessary medications, which has led to some pretty scary medical situations in the past. 
Now, her disorder, combined with a crazy family history, had lead to severe anxiety and depression. I’ve tried in the past to urge her to go to therapy, I was in therapy for a number of years and it was immensely impactful. She refused and continues to do so whenever I bring it up.
This wouldn’t be such an issue if her mental health didn’t implode every few weeks, leaving me and my siblings completely unsure of what to do and left pretty helpless. I’m the oldest and I’ve dealt with her breakdowns for most of my life but I’ve kind of reached the end of my rope. It’s likely my own inexperience in helping others, I’m not the most emotionally intelligent individual, but during her episodes I can’t say anything to her that I meant to be comforting, it’s only met with a rebuke.
It’s selfish of me, I know, but I genuinely am completely at a loss of how to deal with it. Every time I try to help, I’m only pushed away but when I don’t help, I get guilt tripped because I don’t care and I stay in my room to avoid it (I’m a relative loner, it’s not out of character for me to hole up in my room). It severely impacts my own mental health that I’ve been working on improving for years but I can’t step away and force my siblings to deal with it, they’re way too young to have those kinds of concerns. 
Her breakdowns are really taking a toll on me and I’m just tired, I think. I don’t know what to do at all anymore.

984,"To preface, please understand that I don’t believe in anything he taught. I love all people and carry no hate towards anyone for any reason. Also, I’d like to keep the channel unmentioned to maintain my anonymity. If you find it, please don’t say anything.

My dad was a religious extremist who was obsessed with converting the world to his religion. He isolated himself from everyone in the world who didn’t want to join his religion. His only “followers” were his children. He constantly used brainwashing techniques to try to make us believe in what he taught. He was also really scary and I was too scared to resist. I was 14 when he made us join his cult. This went on until right before I turned 18 a few months ago when he died.

After brainwashing my siblings and I, he would record weekly meetings (that he made me host) that he would post to YouTube where he ranted about his and God’s hatred of the world, America, gays, white people, and how black people will one day rule the world. The whole of his channel is extremely racist, sexist, and homophobic. He literally (like, actually literally) has videos titled things like “All \*\*\*\*\* people should be destroyed by god”, “\*\*\*\*\*\*\* will be destroyed”, “Don’t support \*\*\*\*\*\* marriage”, “don't date \*\*\*\*\* devil women”, “\*\*\* people are mentally ill”, and that’s just getting started. The contents of the videos are even worse than the titles. It’s all really sick.

I am in hundreds these horrible videos and I don’t want anyone to see them, especially with me in them. I’ve tried reporting the videos individually, reporting the channel as a whole, and sending YouTube screenshots of the hate-speech titles.  I’ve also tried explaining the contents of the videos through my reports. It’s been about a month since my last report. Not one video was removed. Not one response from YouTube.

The worst part is that my other 3 siblings still believe in what he taught and still rewatch his videos all the time. The brainwashing was very effective. I want this channel taken down asap so that no one sees my siblings and I taking part in this cult and so that my siblings have no more access to the videos. Thus my brothers and sisters and I won’t be labeled as racist, sexist, or homophobes and they can let go of what my dad taught.

What do I do? I don’t understand why YouTube hasn’t deleted this channel already. Are there any other effective methods to contact YouTube to tell them this channel is evil and needs to be removed immediately? Should I give up and just hope no one ever finds the channel? I’m ashamed to have been a part of that cult and I don’t want anyone to ever find out about it. It might ruin my life. And I want to save my siblings. It’s really stressing me out.

985,"Hi reddit.

I am a 20M who is forced by the quarantine to live with my 38M father in the same room. Living with him has it's positives. We sometimes have nice conversations and watch movies together etc. However all of these positives come with him being in a sober state of mind.

Every few days he would start making homemade cider and I get so much anxiety once the brew has finished because he gets extremely drunk off it. When he is in his drunk state of mind, his mind wanders of to very negative spaces. He talks about death and childhood trauma and other negative things. He also says he would like to live a life being drunk all the time.

When he is drunk, I can't talk to him. It sparks so much anxiety in me to the point where I can't look him in the eye and I just plan the quickest way out of the room. I can't stand the negative talking and topics that make me feel uncomfortable. He also does a thing where he repeats a certain point he made the previous few days. Sometimes he repeats a point (or story) up to 4 times. Is that concerning? 

I am grateful he doesn't abuse me in any way, but I'm really worried about his mental health and how alcohol is affecting it. I also want to protect my own mental health because I've worked so hard to control my anxiety until now.

I've spoken to him about going to a therapist or AA. he has the mindset that therapy hasn't helped him before and he doesn't see it helping him now. He is not open to the things which helped me with mental health either (meditation and self help). I'm concerned but I also don't know if I have the ability to help him get out of a toxic place he has to get himself out of anyway. What do i do? This is overwhelming for me at the moment.

My entire family has been right politically for as long as I can remember. My parents continuously complain about immigrants, say that the born British deserve jobs first and foremost no matter how qualified the person is, deny that Britain has a bad history (I tried to talk to them about the famine in Ireland because I was curious if they had been educated on it and they called it all utter rubbish.) 

Whenever they get drunk alone with the family, they mock Asians. They also excuse the racist actions of politicians, don't think that blackface is terrible, and when my Grandad was EXTREMELY racist they agreed with his offensive words (but later denied that they did so, excusing his behaviour because he's old.) They also don't think ANYONE should be allowed in the UK, which I find quite funny and hypocritical because my Dad said that he wanted to move to Canada. 

Well, my parents and I had an extremely heated argument a couple of days ago where I called them racists. They accused me of being delusional because the internet has apparently 'warped my perception of the world', and the words were blurted out of my mouth before I could stop myself.

We were very close friends in college(about 4 years ago), but we have both moved to different parts of the country since graduation. I’ve only seen her once since graduation. We talk on the phone from time to time, but most of the time she is so busy she doesn’t even reply to my text messages. 
I will be getting married a few months before her wedding. We are having a small ceremony with only immediate family. With that being said, I’m not expecting my friend to spend any money on my wedding day or pre wedding events. Her wedding will be a destination wedding for me, so I know it will cost at least $1,000 for my FH and I to attend the wedding, not to mention pre wedding events that she will want me to come to. I don’t make a lot of money, so $1,000 is a lot to me and would probably take away money from our honeymoon budget since her wedding is so close to ours. I want to celebrate her, but I also want to make sure FH and I have money to buy a house and pay for our own wedding events. I just hate that all of this falls at the same time.

I am 22 (f) and I’m currently on academic suspension. 

I’m the youngest of 10, so everybody is putting all of their hope in me. So I started off school with really hard majors and decided those weren’t the majors for me. Within my first couple of years at school, my sister had passed away abruptly and my family and I aren’t good with handling our feelings so everything went spiraling down from there. 

I’m in my 5th year of college, but I’m still not graduating.. which I have accepted that already and have already told my parents (My parents are 72 (f), 76 (m)). At first they were disappointed, but accepted it too. However after a couple of weeks, my mom decides to drop a bomb on me to quit school. Is it wrong of me to feel selfish and still want to go back? 

I guess my train of thought is, “I just got back on my feet” —&gt; “this means school will be better” —&gt; “this means happy middle class future (hopefully)” idk there’s a lot more to my college experience. But in short, a lot of pressure was on me starting school, with my parents being in such a big generational gap AND with only an elementary school education they don’t understand the concept of school? They do, but they don’t.

For context he was an only child and his father/her husband died quite tragically 6 month prior to my John’s diagnosis.

Once every number of months John’s mom text John’s close friends, checking in on us, or vice verca. I’ve asked her how she’s been when it quarantine first began. She says “she’s been okay, getting through the days.” I nor anyone in our friend circle has seen her since the funeral, she said it would be too painful, but eventually she will have us for lunch.

1003,"I’ve dated my ex when I was 13 and he was 16. He was my first boyfriend. We were together on and off for about 9 years.The relationship was toxic from the beginning. He cheated on me almost a week in to the relationship and instead of leaving, I stooped to his level and did the same. As the relationship progressed, he became an alcoholic. It made us drift apart even more because he chose to party and do drugs as well. He dropped out of high school almost after we dated. We saw each other on his days off or when I would ditch school. We only slept and ate when we saw each other because he was always tired from work. 

As the years went by I became very unhappy. I’ve always struggled with depression, body image issues, low self-esteem...the works. Having this relationship just made it worse. I had my own problems to deal with and I had to deal with his alcoholism and addictions on top. But we were used to each other and it was hard to leave.

I broke it off after 9 years, moved out without telling him and didn’t see him for a year. I was working out somethings and needed to find myself. My mother never really intervened because she didn’t know how bad it was. She was going through her new relationship at the same time as well. I acknowledge how this was wrong but I digress. 

I had to move back because problems I had with roommates and I wanted to go back and finish school. I don’t remember exactly how but my ex came back. My mother would tell me he would come by and cone drunk crying for me. He bonded with my stepdad when I was gone. He is an alcoholic as well. We tried to work it out once more. This time we decided to get engaged. I felt like he was serious and we were fine for a couple months. He moved in. 

We were having a conversation one day and I see someone called him by the pet name he gave me. I was livid. He didn’t want to talk about it. He said I was making a big deal. Mind you, I already have serious trust issues. I didn’t want to be made a fool again so I kicked him out. I live with my mom and stepdad so I have no say in my house. My parents let him stay and he’s been staying in the living room for almost 4 years.

I am a full-time student about to finish my bachelors by next year. I feel my mental health declining. We don’t talk to each other because I don’t want him to think that I want any relationship of some kind. He is dating and still talking to the same person who he called by the same pet name. I haven’t dated since we broke up. I hate being home because him and my stepdad drink constantly and are being loud while I’m sleeping or studying. Like I said, I have no say in this house because I don’t pay rent. My family likes him because he is hard-working, so they always include him in events. I don’t attend or come out if my room whenever he’s around, which is almost always.

I feel trapped. He helps out with rent so my family is ok with him staying. I’ve had a conversation with mother but she dismisses my feelings and says that I’m dramatic. We had the same relationship dynamic. She decided to settle for my stepdad. I decided I didn’t want to have that same future. It’s sad and lonely because my stepdad isn’t getting help and my mother is always angry that he choses his addiction over her at times. When he does the least to show he loves her, she dismisses his behavior and the cycle continues. I can’t afford to move out and she gets hurt when I tell her I want to leave. I hate putting her down because she always relies on me even though I have other siblings. 

TL;DR - toxic ex of almost 4 years won’t move out because he pays rent; I’m a broke full-time student and can’t move out.
