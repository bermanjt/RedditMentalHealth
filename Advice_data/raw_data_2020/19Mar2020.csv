0,"So I’m really unsure as to whether or not these occurrences constitute as anything, but I had a friend suggest that it was sexual harassment and it’s been bothering me ever since. All three incidents were when I was 15.

Incident 1: My school was having building work. Three builders walked past me and started whistling and howling like wolves, then they stamped their feet and ran off. It kinda scared me because I had no idea why they did that but I felt uncomfortable walking in that corridor for a few weeks.

Incident 2: I was standing in another corridor talking to my friend when one of the school caretakers came right up to me, rolled his eyes and told me to smile, then laughed and walked off. He just genuinely isn’t a nice guy and I don’t know if he was being sarcastic or what.

Incident 3: A boy in my PE class who bullied me a few years before started staring at me in PE class. It seemed to me like he was staring at my boobs but I can’t be sure on that one, maybe my brain was just seeing things.

If anyone can shed any light it would be much appreciated. I feel like I’m overreacting but my friend seems to think this was sexual harassment because it made me very uncomfortable.",19Mar2020,2
1,"There’s this kinda thick Indian girl who wants to hu with me. I guess she’s not super attractive but I can tell she’s cute. I’m a virgin so everyone’s telling me to get experience but idk. Does it matter? Do I want to fuck someone I barely know (while sober) and then realize how gross it is afterwards? I’m torn but leaning towards no. Is sex good enough to do it with someone that’s only sort of attractive that I’ve had like one solid conversation with.

3,"my ex was my best friend before we dated, so obviously life has been different since we broke up. although we haven’t spoken in two months, i would see him at school sometimes because we have a class together. it’s kind of painful to see him, but he seems happy and i’m glad he’s ok. since corona sent everyone home, i haven’t seen him for a week and i keep worrying that he’s going to die. one minute i’ll be calm and the next i’m so stressed because i’m afraid he’s going to die without us becoming friends again. this is obviously very irrational since he’s in perfect health, but it is becoming debilitating to me. what do i need to do? is this a sign i should reach out? i know i need to get over him and i’m working on that, but i can’t do that when these thoughts keep popping up. what would be a healthy way to dismiss them?",19Mar2020,1

This friend willingly offered us their room for the time that we’ll be there, so far it’s been almost two months. Today I found out that while we were gone, they snuck into “our” room and went through one of our bags to get something they let us borrow. Given this specific friends track record, I wouldn’t be surprised if they’ve done this before but it wouldn’t surprise me. My issue with this situation is that I’m not really sure if I should say something about it or not because technically it is their room.

10,"I'm in the UK.

I'm 17M, I work every other weekend in a kitchen, mainly washing dishes. I'm scheduled in this weekend to work both days and as it's Mother's Day we apparently have an unprecedented amount of bookings, so the restaurant is potentially going to be full all weekend.

I haven't heard anything about the restaurant closing and I think it's very unlikely that they will. The owners are pretty stubborn and definitely wouldn't want to miss out on the extra income. They've literally called in everybody to help out this weekend because of how busy it's going to be.

I only recently got the job and my friend stuck his neck out on the line to get me it, and part of the criteria for me starting is for me to be willing to work and to come in for overtime when needed. However, my college has literally been shut down and exams have been cancelled over here in the UK. Things are looking very confusing and uncertain.

I also have immunocompromised parents. If my mum catches this, she will get extremely sick and potentially could die from it. I don't wanna risk her health over this stupid job, because although I need the money for gas and for savings, it's not super urgent.

I don't want to mess about my employers or fellow workers but at the same time I don't think it's a good idea to go to work this weekend given how busy it will be and the fact our government are literally urging us not to go to crowded places. At the same time tho I seem to be the only one concerned and I don't want to be ""that guy"".

I'd appreciate some honest opinions on what I should do. I was thinking about telling them I can't risk my mum's health and I will not be coming into work or college until we're given the all clear. Does this sound reasonable or nah?",19Mar2020,0
11,"I’ll post a tl;dr at the bottom. 

I am the day to day manager of a local, single owner video game store. It is located in a mall that we pay rent to. The mall is currently open at reduced hours 12-7pm due to COVID-19. 

The governor of my state has strongly advised the closure of all non-essential stores. Obviously a video game store would fall into this category. On top of that, the only other Mall in the state (and one that is far larger than the one I work in) has closed its doors for two weeks. 

The only person above me, my boss, is the store owner. He does not understand the severity of what is happening with Coronavirus at all. He is acting like everything is totally normal. 

Making the issue even more complicated are these two details: Sales are up and have been the last two weeks, closing our doors would seem foolish from a monetary standpoint. Also, *FOUR employees* at another business located inside our mall are currently being tested for COVID-19. 

I will admit that until recently I had been acting like things were normal too, but now I realize that it is up to everyone to pitch in and protect those around them. I plan on talking to my boss tomorrow about closing the store of his own volition this coming weekend. What should I say to him to at least convince him that this is a real situation that should be taken seriously?

Tl;dr: my state is asking all non-essential businesses to close, I work at a non essential business. my boss doesn’t think coronavirus is serious at all and basically is pretending it isn’t happening. How do I convince him to close his store so we can contribute to everyone’s protection from this outbreak?",19Mar2020,1

First of all, thank you for your time if you take the time to read this. I'm 19M, and throughout my life I've had a few crushes just like anybody else. However, I am too anxious and nervous about approaching to someone I don't know, specially if they are from the opposite gender. The last time I tried talking to a girl I had a crush on was in middle school. I walked up to her and asked her if we could be friends and that I wanted to get to know her and she just said no and left. Ever since then I've decided not to talk to any other girls out of fear of rejection and because of how nervous I get.

Fast forward to the present, I am currently in college and there's a cute girl in my class room that doesn't talk to anyone in the class. She's alone and quiet all the time and I honestly want to talk to her very badly but definitely not in class in front of people in case anything embarrassing happens. I have no idea of how to approach her or what to say, and I'm afraid of what could happen.

Daniel is in an LDR and his girlfriend Beth is moving in for at least three months. Daniel didn’t ask / tell us about this, I found out through Anna.

I appreciate we need to talk to Daniel, but I don’t know what to ask.

i started growing an interest in her and really wanna be with her but i think she might be depressed, she doesn't answer the majority of things i write and at first i took it personally so i decided to talk to her about that. when i asked her she told me she is like this to everyone even her close friends, again i thought it was a lie and she just didn't want to talk to me so i stopped reaching out to her, 2-3 months later i decided to try and light things up between us. I figured maybe now it's worth a shot. So i wrote to her casually and things were fine until the next day she ignored me again, keep in mind it is in the middle of a conversation she can just stop texting back. So i decided to ask her what's up how she feels and why she is acting like that with me. 

She responded with an apology saying not to take it personally, and that her freezing me out and ignoring me isn't intentional. She mentioned that she does this with everyone now and that she doesn't feel ok, other things she mentioned are signs of depression. I don't wanna self diagnose her with depression that was just an assumption. 

i am really interested in her and i am not trying to force her to anything i've tried getting her to talk to me but she said she much rather wants to talk about other things so i've just talked about other things to get her mind of w/e is bothering her, but sometimes she just stops answering again and i don't wanna keep trying to talk when she doesn't answer.

36,"So I have ptsd, I've had it for close to ten years. I see a therapist and a person who monitors my medication, they are both at the same practice. The expectation is I need to be in therapy in order to see the med management.

I had a therapy appt today but remembered at 11 this morning that I haven't seen the management in awhile. I looked at the card they sent me and my appt was for last Tuesday. I checked my phone and I never got a reminder call or text that I've got for all my appointments the last 4.5 years I've been with this practice.

I freaked out because a no call no show is grounds for removal from the program. I'm on a med that is very bad to withdraw from. I missed one dose before and had the worst migraine of my life and couldn't function. And that was only one dose!

I called them at 1122 and left a message asking if the appt was canceled as I never got a call. Please call me back as soon as possible. I spent the rest of the day with panic attacks and a migraine that I had to leave work from due to the stress.

I had a call from the therapist scheduled at 330. She asked how I was and I said I was handling everything fine until I realized I forgot an appt and never got a call. She reassured me I've never missed any appts I'll be fine, she went to email med person and said hey ______ missed their appt called four hours ago never got a call back.... Appt was at....... Then she stopped she's like you're not on the schedule.

Guys the receptionist was new and never put me down. She wrote out my card and never actually booked my appt.

I'm pissed. They never return calls, I've had horrendous billing issues with them that I've never gotten called back about and had to go into the office to deal with. Therapist is great about callbacks but med is like 50/50 chance you're gonna get a call. They can't keep receptionists so I'm pretty sure I've seen two dozen in the times I've been there.... I go once a month for one and once every other month for the other so it's not like I am there a lot.

43,"I've been using discord for years and I've met my fair share of people. I've had people hurt me, I've had people I would even call my best friends and I was fine with it all but as of half a year ago, I ended up dating someone on discord. A pretty stupid decision I know but honestly the entire situation was pretty insane but at that time, I didn't regret my decision of accepting their proposal to date. Honestly, I was rather fond of them at the time. So we dated or if we can even call it dating, I don't really know, it was my first relationship after all. 

But before we get into what happened, I think it's good for you to know that I'm a rather reserved person, I don't let people in all that easily, even the people I would call my best friends, I would never confide in them because my problems were my own, I never even let them hear my voice, I put a distance between myself and everyone I met. But with my significant other at that time, I thought why don't I let them in, why don't I let them hear my voice, lemme confide in them for some of my problems. And so I did, I let them in, I got attached to them and at that time, I was so elated to have someone I was close to. 

But then a month passed, and they dumped me in a call. I was kind of expecting it since once they came back from their trip had been acting a bit distant. And the day before, they dmed me saying that we had to talk. Which is basically the harbinger of bad news. We kind of did a back and forth though, they said that they didn't want to dump me but wanted to at the same time. Pretty dumb, I know but I saved them the trouble and broke up for them but technically, they dumped me so yea. After that, I was kind of in a bit of a state of shock. I had lost the closest person that I had at that time and yes we did agree to be friends but it just felt wrong to continue on with what we were doing. It felt wrong for us to do calls, dm each other and just talk. It was a few days later when we were talking to each other in dms that they let out that the biggest reason why they got together with me was that at that time, no worries I'm ok now, I was in a bad place. They were grasping at anything to keep my tethered to where I was and in that panic, I guess they thought of asking me to be their SO. 

After finding that out, I kind of felt really hurt or I still am hurt I guess. It felt like I was a burden and like they didn't want to be with me for me and after having them as my outlet for a month, I felt a strong need for another outlet, someone else to confide in. I had finally gotten the taste of having someone to confide in that I guess I just couldn't handle everything on my own anymore. Bad mistake on my part, I should've handled everything on my own but I didn't. I confided in a group of people, a group of 4. They knew of my relationship with my ex and I was already friends with them and so I confided in them. I let these four in(lets call them A, B, C and D) and I've just been confiding in them for the past 6 months, ever since I broke up with my ex. 

But over these 6 months, I won't deny I've had fun and I've felt so reassured to have them as my support system but they have hurt me in ways that wouldn't hurt me if I had kept a distance. While I was venting, A told me to shut up. I became despondent for a week after that but when they found out that hurt me, they apologized and explained that they were pissed cuz of something else. A simple miscommunication, ok then. A different incident, I wanted to talk to B about something I wanted advice on but they ignored me. That sucked. A few days passed by until I dmed them and asked them hey what's up and they said they thought I was ignoring them. I honestly don't know where they got that from but a miscommunication, ok that's fine I guess. But then recently, a bunch of issues really piled on me and I went on discord and D asked if I wanted to vent. I took their offer and only two sentences in, C started to like criticize me on what I was saying. How me saying that midterms suck is kind of weak of me, and I should stop complaining. That's just how life is. And then they went into bringing up the incident with my ex and how I was in a dark place and said like you just need to toughen up and your dead grandfather wouldn't want to see you like this. I immediately closed discord and I haven't really been talking on it much unless someone directly dmed me but C came on a few hours later and apologized, I didn't talk to them. I would love to shove in more little situations but this post is already long. 

Anyways, even now when they've done these things to me which seem little but they hurt a lot, I want to run back to them. I want to run back to my ex and talk to them. I constantly look at the member's list to see them online and watch the chat to see if they talk. I want to continue to joke with A, I want to draw with B, I want to play games with D and I want to tell stories with C, but I'm scared. I'm scared that they're going to hurt me again, I'm scared of continuing to let them in and I'm scared of my growing attachment to them. I have never let anyone in like this and its painful yet so much fun at the same time and I don't know what to do. Right now, I'm just keeping my distance from discord but I really want to talk to them. Thank you so much for your time in reading this, I know this is long and I'm sorry about that. Honestly, ever since 6 months ago, I feel as if I've become even more pathetic, I don't handle things on my own anymore, even to the extent of asking help on Reddit.

49,"So I went to college for the last 4.5 years, and am graduating at the end of this summer. My major was Journalism because I always liked to write, and I found it an interesting way to develop my writing skills. I enjoyed my major for most of college, but the past year I've really been going back and forth on it and if it's really what I want to do with my life. But I didn't want to change my major my senior year of college and have 3 or 4 more years of classes, plus that much more in student loans. So I've stuck with it, but I really don't know what I want to do after college (which is a problem pretty much everyone has, I know). I've always been interested in film and the entertainment industry, but my school didn't really have a good film program so I never considered that.

I guess what I'm asking is to those who have graduated college and moved on, is it really that hard to get a job in a different industry than what you got your degree in? I know a lot of the skills and practices of my major can be applicable to the film industry (writing, camera work, video editing, photography, etc.), but I'm just really unsure what to do with my degree now that I'm close to having it. I've thought about documentary filmmaking, which journalism has a lot of ties to, but I really don't want to work for a magazine or be a reporter or anything. Which is something I thought I wanted to do 2 years ago, but now that I'm actually being faced with these decisions I realize it might not be what I want to do for the rest of my life.

52,"( i apologize in advance for possible typos, am a bit tipsy at the moment) 
So the title says it all. I have been through some difficult times in the past months, relatively speaking given age and life experience, but everywhere i’ve been looking for support and advices, this has come up everywhere every single time : “respect yourself” . And right now I have just finished a call with my father who I haven’t seen in 17 years but have been through digital contact since he left, and since all of my childhood he wasn’t there, now i’m in my 20s and feel his missing from my life, I feel i am a bit too drawn into having a father / father figure that teaches me life advices and so on. Anyway, my point being he talked to me about respecting myself. And all the points and examples he gave, they all made sense, and I understood them and understood from his life why he would teach me/ advice me this.
But the one thing I don’t get is : how do I start respecting myself? 
For example, I bought myself a pull up bar a while back. I’m not fat or something, but I could definetly be alot fitter, thus me buying the pull up bar. But me having absolutely no knowledge in gym stuff and how to actually do pull-ups, everytime I was trying to do some, anyway i knew / could, i was laughing at myself, as in “yeah sure, like this will work you’ll definetly be a Schwarzenegger in 2 weeks”. But after awhile i thought if i would watch some youtube tutorials on how to do proper pull-ups, i’ll feel better about myself and my effort, but when trying to do the proper pull-up, i can barely do two proper ones, and that makes me feel even more of a joke about myself and feel like my effort is ridiculous. 
So it all comes down to: how can i respect myself?How can i respect the effort i’m trying to do? How can i stop ridiculing myself? I realize that to get fit takes time and effort, but everything j do, trying to learn guitar, work out, go out running, i end up ridiculing myself. 
How can i stop this and just value the effort i’m trying to put into it?",19Mar2020,2
53,"Hey Reddit.

My county today issued a “Shelter in Place” order effective tonight 12AM for 2 weeks. I work for a discount clothes retailer. I also have hypersensitive asthma and take medication that lowers my immunity to catching things and infections, so I have kept myself in lockdown at home because I already suffer from respiratory problems as it is.

I went to urgent care last week and was excused from work this past weekend. I asked my boss what action should I take because I am at high risk and it’s not safe for me to go out. He emailed me back saying I have to apply for Medical leave of absensence in order to keep my job.

The thing is, with this shelter in place, they are closing all un essential retail places, ans mine definitely falls into that as all we sell is discounted clothes  (its like ross). So technically, they’re supposed to close too. Can they let me go over this? Im in California. Thank you for any help!",19Mar2020,2

If yes, could it also charge a deep cycle battery at the same time (even partially)?

I had an idea of a long range (albeit slow) vehicle based from bike parts (for the reasons of I have a 12v 200w motor on my bike and bike parts are lightweight).

I have seen the science project long range cars before and that's what I'm drawing inspiration from.

56,"Hi! I'm hoping to get some advice or insight.

I drive a 2012 Chevy Cruze. I drove my car 4 hours from Georgia to Orlando the other day, and the following day was driving a short distance (20 mins) when my cars head gasket blew. I had it towed to a near by Mechanic that my insurance company recommended (although I think that was simply because it was the closest) . Anyways, they originally quoted me $1000 to replace the head gasket and had my car for over a week and ended up replacing the head gasket, thermostat, oil cooler, &amp; 2 camshaft sensors. He kept calling me to tell me additional things which is understandable as they found things wrong. I agreed to everything even though I was stressed about the money, understandably so. it ended up being close to $2000. He gave me my car back on Wednesday and said that there was a sensor malfunctioning but that I could drive it and be okay so I said okay. Well my car kept stopping IN TRAFFIC. 

so i had it towed back to him and they cleaned up the 2 camshaft sensors and he gave me back my car again and it was better, but I'M the one who said lets replace them because I didn't want to die on the highway driving back to Georgia if my car shut off. So anyways, I pick up my car again and begin my drive home. I stopped for gas about an hour in and once I turned my car back on, the check engine light was on again. I immediately called the shop and he told me it was okay and to keep driving, so I made it home. 

The next day, I was driving for about 15 mins when my car overheated again. I had it towed to another shop in Ga and they're saying the motor is blown(based on a noise the car is making). There was no oil on the dipstick &amp; the coolant was empty. They say they can't really prove the guy in Florida did anything wrong, but that he should have replaced my radiator too. The guy in Florida wants me to bring my car back to him, because he swears it just needs a radiator replacement and a coolant flush. He told me in a text that ""The best thing would have been to replace the radiator but we didnt think you could afford it"" BUT NEVER ASKED ME. I was willing to have ANYTHING fixed.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess I'm just wondering... what would you do? Should I demand my money back from the FL shop? Should I make them pay for it to be towed back down? Report to the BBB? Get a third opinion?

&amp;#x200B;

The car is not paid off, and now I'm definitely upside down on the loan. So I'm just at a loss. The FL guy was very nice to me the whole time, didn't charge me for labor for the camshaft sensors and even wanted me to text him when I was home but I just feel manipulated because I'm a girl and I dunno what I can/should do.",19Mar2020,1

Hi everyone! I have a question. I like this one girl in my 4th period class, I started talking to her and I even got to the point of walking her to class. When we are walking majority of the time she’s first to make conversation asking personal questions like where I would love to live ect kinda had a thought that she liked me. 

Because of the Corona Virus we won’t be in school till most likely next month if everything goes as planed. I got her added on Snapchat for a while now I added her before we were really having conversations like that and not to long ago I put her in my private snap story, I was going to put someone else in the story and as I was looking I saw she wasn’t there but she has her snapchat settings to where you’re not added by her but you can still text her. And early yesterday I asked her about a homework assignment and only got a 2 word reply it was my first time texting her. I just told her ok and she opened it pretty fast. While I took like 3 hours to open hers.(not on purpose I had to go do laundry with my parent) 

Anyways I just want to know how does she feel about me and how would I go about talking to her because we’re out of school for a while and spring break is coming up.

60,"My stepdad has Atrial fibrillation and has undergone two ablation surgeries--one as of recent. He's also had a cough for the past year and it's gotten worse over the past two months. My mom is highly stressed and feels the need to take care of her father because he can't see his wife, who has been inside of a locked down memory unit care facility. My mom is in her late 50's and stepdad in his early 60's. They both work full-time and have the opportunity to work remotely while our state transitions into lock-down. I just got off the phone with my mom who was talking about going to see her dad, and I was trying to tell her that there is a possibility she can either contract it or kill him. She somewhat listened. She also talked about going back to work the following week, even though she can continue working from home.   


What's even more frustrating is that I have two other siblings that have great influence over their thoughts. One of them thinks this entire pandemic is a hoax. Their thought process even goes to the extent of believing reptilian satanist rule the world. My other sibling (whom has more influence) is an antivaxxer who thinks this is setting the stage for an economic collapse with the intent of giving everyone the mark of the beast via vaccination. I had a 2-hour conversation with them the other day to try and get to the core of what they believe and why they believe it. It came down to a complete denial of science and a literal interpretation of the Bible. I tried to reason with them, even explaining that since it's a literary text, one would have to stand outside of it and state ""that's how it's to be interpreted."" I tried to explain that a key element of language is ambiguity. I even pointed towards books in the Bible that are poetic, so there's no sense in claiming one is literal and not figurative. This then led to them claiming they were in direct communication with Jesus who guided their interpretation. Just think about the level of arrogance here. None of this matters. Trying to reason with a web of conspiracy theories (that end up being a recourse to the Bible) is a fool's errand.   


I'm worried about my siblings having influence on how my parents treat this; more specifically, with what they view as preventive measures. The reason I say this is because my sibling stated that if the state goes into full lock-down I need to drive to their house so they can ""treat"" me. Of course I would never do this. But this means they are influencing the decisions my parents are making. I'm worried about losing my parents. I tried to call the suicide hotline to sort this out with someone on the phone, but it was so backed up that I started writing this. I'm sorry for venting here. I hope everyone stays safe.

61,"My father often says things like “You’re terrible at being a human being” or “You’re worthless” He says things like that to me A LOT. He also emotionally abuses my mother? He just thinks he’s playing with her, but it’s actually extremely hurting her. She can’t see past it because she’s so in love with him though. There’s a line of divorce in my family, my mother’s parents’ divorced, and my father’s parents’ divorced, but I truly don’t want my parents to have the same fate. It’s just so hard due to my father’s attitude all the time. 

My family is religious, we’re actually christians, but my dad basically dropped out of christianity, I suppose he just doesn’t feel it anymore. This is really effecting us due to my mom, sister, and I are still christians. Although, my sister and i are more the role models for christianity in the house now. 

It’s all just been really tough on me though, I’m the youngest, and they just never really taught me anything. No cooking skills, no laundry skills, basically no cleaning or basic human function skills. Even though I know how to do the laundry and do the dishes now (mostly small things like that, I promise I don’t live in complete filth), they still never taught me how to cook, and my dad blames it on me. He constantly tells me how I’m “Never going to make it in this world” but I truthfully blame that on him. Am I wrong for that? They never ever taught me things unless I asked for them to do so. I asked my dad to teach me how to cook noodles, (I know kind of stupid because they’re so easy) but because they never taught me stuff like that, I was scared to use the oven and the stovetop. He basically went off on a small rant and yelled at me a little for it, but still ended up teaching me. 

Aside from all that, sister is leaving for college this year, she’s moving to a different state. We’ve always been close, she’s always stuck up for me, but now that she’s leaving, it’ll only be my mom and I in the house alone with my dad. I’m honestly a little scared about that. 

I know I’m definitely not the favorite child. My mom begs to differ because she loves my sister and I the same, but I’ve always had the title of “The bad child” I would even get told out loud that i was. But I know why this is, I’m also definitely not perfect. I’ll disobey direct orders because of pride, or I’ll just procrastinate. I’m guessing that’s why my dad tells me things like “You’re never going to make it in the world” but I think he could find a better way to consult me. 

I’m sorry, I know this whole rant was probably all over the place, but I think I need advice. Maybe someone who went through something similar? I’m not sure if I should talk to my mom and dad about these feelings, or if I should just hold out and claim the title of “Good child” by acting better. Any body got advice good advice?",19Mar2020,2
63,"Helloooooooo

.... So, um, I made this reddit acc for the sole purpose of finding a detailed answer to my problem.

I've made a YouTube account a while ago. One day, I was looking for free episodes of a new anime exclusive to Netflix on youtube, hoping that I would find the full episode with a good quality and English subtitles. I did find the episodes. So I thought to myself that maybe I can repost these episodes too since everyone is doing so.... And next thing I know, I downloaded the best quality episodes that I could find, edited them in a way to go undetected by YouTube , and posted them. Let's me just say, I got sh*t ton of views, likes, comments, and a steady rate of followers.

I woke up a few days after that with 2 copyright strikes on my channel by Netflix, and the episodes were automatically deleted. I thought to myself that it's my fault and I'll just wait until the copyright strikes are gone and try to be careful.
A few hours ago though, I was listening to music on youtube music and it suddenly stopped.... Come to find out, my YouTube, YouTube music, and YouTube studio were terminated with my whole account.

I know I did a mistake by posting Netflix new and upcoming anime of the year, but the 3rd strike came out of nowhere, and in the email it said that it's for these videos that were already deleted a week ago already....

I need help! Do I send youtube a message like the other you tubers to get my channel back or to just forget abt it!??",19Mar2020,1

All the federal holidays plus a few scattered throughout the year and 2 weeks off over the winter holiday, usually from about Dec 21st to Jan 2nd. It's a pretty good job, but they don't pay for the amount of work they give to their staff. They have also been having financial problems since before I started which was about 3.5 years ago. Because of these financial issues they have been cutting back on benefits and perks.

69,"The only time I hear from people anymore is when they need something. My “friend” S is a perfect example of this. Myself and S have been friends since the end of high school (5-6 years ago) and in the beginning were relatively close. We would FaceTime everyday, we would text consistently. We had a really good friendship for that first year and a half. 3-4 years ago, we started talking less but would still check in with each other. She never needed anything, I never needed anything. Standard platonic relationship. I may have loaned her around 20-40 during this entire span. Around 2 years ago, she had a kid. Shes alway been bouncing around as far as living conditions go, from her dad to her mom to her boyfriends to her friends back to her mom then to her grandmothers, and would shuffle between them.  She doesn’t keep consistent work. Basically, her life is sustainable but not really stable. Around a year ago, she began asking me for money routinely. We stopped having regular normal communication about a year ago. 
She began asking for small amount loans, which she would pay back ($20). Then she began asking for money basically as a gift. Something she didn’t have to pay back but that I would be willing to give her just to help. She then tried to turn donations into a business transaction to make herself feel better. Wherein, she would ask me for money and then would send me provocative photos in return. I don’t want to see her fail or struggle so I gave. I’ve heard her mention to one of her female friends around this time that I have money. I didn’t care. Then after a while she began to gain an entitlement to my money. Getting mad when I would tell her no, trying to swindle me into buying her a car and just would only call when she needed something. I went off on her about it and she calmed down a bit realizing what she was doing was disrespectful. However, at this point when she calls, I know she wants something. I dont hear from her otherwise.

For the last two to three weeks, she’s been texting me asking for money. I’ve just said no. She’s responded with, “ok, I just thought I’d ask.” I’ve noticed she tends to ask when she notices I’ve spent or am planning on spending a good amount of money on something else. Like posting a Rick Owens hoodie I’m buying or im taking a random vacation. A few days ago, she asked me for 150 dollars for her insurance, I gave it to her. Figured that would be a nice thing to do. But the next few days following she kept asking for more money. Which I refused. Reminded me of the story, “If you give a mouse a cookie.” 

Today, she calls me and I ignore the first two calls. I send her a message a few hours later and she calls me again. I answer and she begins to small talk me, which is weird. She doesn’t typically ask me about my life anymore and so it feels fake. I know she wants something but I play along. She asks me about my job, asks how the super bowl was and a few other random things relating to me that she would have seen on Facebook. I answer them, she cuts me off at the end and states, “I know you probably figured out I want something,” and then proceeds to ask me for money. According to her, her job (I don’t know anything about it) is holding her check due to the coronavirus. Which is weird to me because I’m like, “why would your job be holding your check?” She says they sent her an email saying thats what they’re doing. She tells me she’s staying at a hotel with her kid and will be unable to pay for it. She wants me to send her some money to pay for it. Says she might be able to pay it back later once this thing is over (I don’t believe it). So, I’m stuck. I know for some people this corona thing is bad and I don’t want to see anybody ass out because of it. I don’t like being contacted by people only for money though. She claims that she’s asked a few other friends and they aren’t able to help her. And she just assumes that I’m the one who would be able to help her. So while she “knows that I don’t want to be asked,” she supposedly needs help. I 100%  believe that she is probably broke. Should I help or further encourage her to find another solution to this problem? I feel like if I give her this, she’s just going to continue to ask for more. She hasn’t even given me a numerical amount but I have this feeling that it’s just going open up the doors again for her to ask me for more and more money. I never hear from her unless she wants something. I’m stuck. Help?



TLDR: Only hear from my “friends” when they need some money. My friend S doesn’t call me to check on me, to hang out or anything; just to ask for money. I refuse most times but sometimes am willing to give. Today she claims her job is holding her paycheck amid the coronavirus. She’s living in a hotel with her kid and needed that money to pay for her room. I don’t want to see her end up messed up behind this whole thing but I’m tired of being used because I’m in a decent financial situation.

I live in Sweden, and our government has been very nonchalant about the corona virus (didn't close schools or borders, refuse testing to anyone who isn't hospitalized and don't encourage self quarantine unless you are sick)   
Basically, I have a feeling we will be Italy number 2 in a few weeks. Everyones attitude seems to be that its fine if you don't feel symtoms (our government encourages this attitude). I follow news internationally pretty closely and I know how untrue this is. You can transmit the virus with no symtoms whatsoever.  
So, the boy I work with has a family outside of caretakers who can take care of him. Basically he isn't left without any help if I cancel work and no one can replace me.   
His mother keeps saying IF I feel sick I should stay home but otherwise its fine. What should I do? I feel awful canceling work without feeling sick but I also am terrified of spreading the virus to the boy and his family.   
We have no idea how many people are actually carrying the virus here since they stopped testing people, what if I have it? :( I hate this.   
Me and my partner have been self quarantining this whole week, he works from home pretending his sick because his workplace refuses to close down. I can't work from home.

The past 3 weeks I've been super depressed because I feel as though I'll never be with anyone and I'll always be comparing myself to other more attractive peers of mine, the outcome always crushing my soul because I know I dont look as good as them.

I got in contact with her son and let him know the situation and he apologized and said that she is in a nursing home.

87,"i’m a beauty student (UK), I have completed my first year of studies and last year was in my second year. I was hospitalised for my mental health in November as I lost a third family member in a year and found it all to be a bit much as I was 18 at this point. I was called into a meeting in college and advised I would have to leave the course due to low attendance. (note: I was up to date with course work &amp; assessments still) Their reasoning for me having to leave was that it’s unfair on other students who have been in full time that I would receive the same qualification when I hadn’t been in class as often. During the meeting, the head of the beauty department had said she thought it would be best for me to leave even though I told her the course was helping me with a routine and gave me something to focus on. Anyway, they came to the conclusion that I should withdraw myself from the course on medical grounds even though I was unhappy with doing so, I did. They told me there would be a place for my next year (2020) and I wouldn’t have to worry about picking up where I left off. 

So, I applied, had my interview last week. My interview was with a woman who I hadn’t met before. She was kind of patronising in my opinion. When she asked about my absence I told her I lost my mum to suicide in 2018 (I was 16) and was left homeless due to this &amp; I suffer with PTSD as a result and have suffered a lot as I don’t have any family here to support me as my mums sister lives abroad &amp; I grew up with only my mum. The interviewer asked why I was off in 2019 if my mum passed in 2018 for a start which I thought was odd as it’s not like you heal from something like that so quickly. She then told me I “couldn’t have any hospital stays or trips to the doctors” and would have to maintain 100% attendance. Fine, I agreed of course but acting like being in hospital was a choice didn’t really sit well with me. She also told me to spend some time with my family to ‘help myself’. As I said, I don’t have any family in this country!! Then she told me I could be lying about my qualifications. I remained 100% polite and smiling throughout my interview as I didn’t want her to think I wasn’t happy to be there for some reason. 

I received an email today saying I have been unsuccessful in my application with no reason as to why they haven’t accepted me. My question is, can I query this? I can’t help but feel this is discrimination as I was told to leave on medical grounds. It’s upset me quite a bit to be honest &amp; I don’t know what I should do if I can’t further my studies.

I was waiting for an hour and a half while he played his video game. I soon went up stairs and told him AGAIN he needed to get off (I was getting sooo mad.) I set the baby on the floor, he played with some toys, and I sat on the bed. About 10 minutes later, he shut the game off, put the stuff away and punched the TV twice causing it to smash. The baby cried so so hard, he was terrified. I quickly ran over picked up the baby and said “why would you do that infront of him??” (I kept my cool). He then said “get the F*** over there” and pointed to the other side of the room. I walked over holding the baby and he took his gym bag off the floor and threw it at the dresser.

104,"Hi guys so let me explain this first of all. I have never done overnight shifts. I work at an animal hospital in a boarding facility area of the hospital. It is a 24/7 emergency hospital. Due to this virus everyone is cancelling their dogs reservations. This has now led to the boarding facility being shut down for a while I guess. (We just got this news today me and my coworkers). The office manager had a talk with us today (Only 5 employees in the boarding facility). At the boarding facility us who work in that department don't do overnights. So basically the office manager told us that she needs receptionist and all of us from the boarding facility will now be receptionist. The turnover is so high for receptionist because you are dealing with emergency and angry or upset clients. So this sucks. But even better now they decide I will be doing overnights 12am until the morning. Its annoying because we weren't hired for this. It's going to be so different. I did reception a year ago at a private clinic which is probably much different from 24/7 emergency.  This has all been thrown on us today and I'm trying to process it. Now here is one of my problems. I will only have the next 3 nights of training and then I will be alone overnights doing reception... MY coworkers are a little luckier because they will be working during daytime with other people. Basically I am freaking out :) My coworkers honestly are too. I don't know how long it is going to be like this I guess depending on this virus... Hopefully boarding will reopen.. I actually left my last hospital because I hated doing reception.. plus I went to school and have a assisting certificate because I wanted to work with the animals.

106,"Hello! I'm a Resident Advisor at a large public university and I hate it. I work in 2 labs and an office as well (while being a full time student) and I love those jobs. I've been working since I was 15 and I have always been very good at my jobs, I've been promoted in 3 positions and have great references for all of them. Work had always been something I pride myself in. 

But I applied to be an RA halfway through freshman year. I liked it for the first year but then I started to resent it. I'm not an extrovert, I hate living in the dorms, and honestly I don't give a shit if residents smoke weed or drink as long as they are safe. I wanted to help people and build community but it feels like the university really just cares about rule enforcement. I'm not a huge fan of the people that work in the department and tbh we are underpaid, as the university won't pay for our housing. Living on campus is 3x more expensive for me than the house I have next year, and the pay does not make up for that loss. They also prevent me from getting paid for more than 8 hours in my other positions so I volunteer because the other 3 jobs I have are great for my resume. I seriously regret saying I would come back this year and I will not be returning. It's definitely starting to effect my performance, as I've stopped caring about administrative duties like filling out reports on time. My boss texted me today about administrative duties and I feel bad that she is inconvenienced. 

I've set an alarm now to start doing things on time every day so I hope it will get better, but I'm not sure how long I will continue to work here because of corona. Most other universities have kicked students out of the dorms and we already have confirmed cases near campus. I feel bad that my resentment has effected my performance and at this point I don't know what I can do. Right now, I don't even put this on my resume because I hate it so much and I have much more relevant work experience. I feel like if I did put it on there my boss would just shit talk me (probably rightfully so) as a reference, which would really stand out as a dark spot on my otherwise really good resume. This semester has sucked for me on so many levels and I hate that out of my year and a half as an RA this semester is the one my boss will remember me as. 

This is not like me. I've always been a hard worker and I am in all other aspects of my life. In all of my other positions I do very well and my coworkers/bosses like me a lot. I think letting my work ethic slip has also made me resent my RA position more. I just don't know what to do. I'm gonna try harder to do better and I know this is my fault, but what would you do if you were me? Put it on the resume? What even are my options? I have a VERY good resume other than this, will it ruin my chances of grad school? Can I just pretend I never worked here? Can I say I worked here but not list a reference? I have 5+ professional supervisor references that will vouch highly for me, can I just ignore this one? Do you think quitting during this virus outbreak (many other RA's have) would do more harm than good? I know it's my fault, I'm just trying to cut my losses going forward. 

TLDR: I suck at my job because I strongly resent it. I'm quitting at the end of the semester, and I want to know how I should deal with it going forward.",19Mar2020,1

110,"So I (23F) finally moved out of my parents' house to move into an apartment in the city with my cousin, her boyfriend and her dog. I immediately get a job at her workplace and everything is starting to settle into place. This is in November.

There were a few things about the arrangement that bugged me from the get-go, but I pretty much brushed them off. First was that we never actually set up a chore schedule, despite meaning to. (I should state that my cousin is basically ""in charge"" of the household.) Also, the dog is a medium/big one, about the size of a lab. We live in an apartment with no yard. I asked her why she got him, and she said she was looking for a cat, but fell in love with him. :/ I won't really get into it, but the apartment is often messy and I feel like I'm the only one doing a chore consistently (dishes) and I think my standard for cleanliness is somewhat higher than theirs.

With Corona, I'm planning to go back to my parents' to weather this out in a small town. What I'm wondering is if I should be planning to move back full-time since it's both cheaper and I'm more comfortable there. While this seems like the more sound decision, part of my issue is that I'm already feeling like going back is failing to launch or something. (And I just got my room pretty, but that's negligible.)

Any tips, advice, or stories are well appreciated!",19Mar2020,1
115,"Will try and condense this as much as possible. Long story short, was with a guy for about a year and we broke up in September of 2019. We work together, but didn't talk or really interact for about two months. I reached out after about one, hoping to dissipate some of the awkward energy. He didn't respond and I was ok with that. He then reached out about a month later responding to my previously unanswered text. After that point, he began texting daily. 



Our conversations remained friendly and we talked for about a month before agreeing to go to dinner together. Conversation was easy and it was a good time, and we proceeded to go out about once a week from then on. Eventually, we started going back to his place after dinner or making dinner at his place. Not much happened, we would hug goodbye, and occasionally cuddle a bit, but nothing big. There were some more suggestive brief touches on his part too, but only every once in awhile. 



In January, he started texting a bit less frequently, which I guess threw me off a bit. I decided to talk to him about it and how when I had to start conversations all the time it felt like I might be bothering him and like he doesn't want to talk/doesn't value me. He said he understood, and said he's just not always full of conversations, but that I was welcome to start the conversation any time. I then proceeded to talk to him about, if we were to progress more, it would be more of a friends with benefits type thing, as I'm moving away in July and not really in the relationship mindset. He expressed that he was worried that if we became physical again, it might make our relationship too intense. I expressed how that wouldn't be the case for me, but understood his point. We dropped it, and after our conversation, he began texting daily again and making an effort, which I appreciated. 



February, conversations began being a bit spotty again, but still frequent so all was good. I went for a few job interviews at the end of February/early March and we spent time together before I left. He brought a blanket to cuddle on the couch with and positioned himself so he could run his fingers along the back of my legs/butt while we watched TV. When I was gone, he texted me daily the week I was away. However, when I returned, things died down. 



He has called me once since I've been back to invite me to dinner, which I couldn't make since he called to invite me about 20 minutes before he wanted to go, but otherwise, it has been me initiating conversations straight for a couple weeks now. We have gone up to 4 days without speaking before I gave in, since he hasn't initiated. I don't want to push it. However, whenever I do text, he responds almost immediately, and will often initiate phone calls after I've initiated texting.



 We did spend time together this past weekend and had dinner and then went back to his place to watch a show we are watching together. Once again, we were sitting under a blanket, and he began running his fingers along my leg so this time I reciprocated. I got up to use the restroom and when I got back he pulled me to cuddle and lay my head on his chest. He put his arm around me and down the top of the back my pants on my butt, and had his other hand caressing my chest. I initially had my hand resting on his stomach, but he moved it down a bit, where I could then feel that he was hard. He moved my hand onto it, and I just stroked it a bit on top of his pants and eventually moved to under pants/on top of boxers. Sorry if TMI.



I didn't want to take anything too far too fast, so when the show was over, I got up to leave. There was some hesitation, as I wasn't sure exactly what he wanted to do, but I didn't want to be too reckless. So at the end we just hugged, and he rested his head on top of mine. We pulled away as if we were going to kiss but didn't. Obviously, this has escalated, but the contact situation remains the same. I texted him first and had subsequent conversations with him on Sunday and Monday, but haven't texted and so haven't heard from him since. 



I'm fine with the FWB thing like I said, but I don't want our communications to solely be one-sided or to not talk at all until we see each other again. I guess I'm just a bit confused as to what is going on and how to proceed. I'd usually be fine calling it out, but I already did and really don't want to nag. I also don't want to be annoying or pushy. So, I guess I'm asking for others' thoughts and opinions on what I should do?


TL;DR: been spending time with a guy, lately have had to initiate all our communication even though he responds well when I do. Despite less communication, physicality has been ramping up and I’m not sure what to do.",19Mar2020,1
116,"So I’m 16 years old and recently got a job at a small business in town. (It’s a bakery and I’ve only worked there 2 times so far and haven’t finished “training”). Because of the Coronavirus, it’s been closed down and will not reopen for a few weeks. I live in Massachusetts and there are new rules about food service places because the virus is bad here. 

Anyway, the bakery is new and opened up last fall and since it’s closed down, I’m worried about the future of the business. I don’t think it’ll get shut down for good, but there will definitely be an impact on it financially for a while. Should I be worried about my position there? I’m new, young, and nonessential to the business. What would you do if you were in my situation? I can’t think of anything that could help my chances of working there when it reopens.

Which brings me to my problem, because of coronavirus, my uni has closed its doors and I only work once a week so even though I'm still working its only one day. I can't really invite people out anywhere because nobody will want to go considering the virus...and I'm starting to feel the loneliness creeping in a bit.

123,"(Just made this account so my main account wouldn't be linked to this post)

My depression started about three years ago, so towards the end of my eight grade. It was mild at first, I would tell my friends I'm busy when they asked me to hangout or I would skip some practices because I wasn't feeling it, and as time went on, the mild depression snowballed into me not being able to even get out of my bed sometimes. My relationship with my parents is pretty awful, I lost all my credits for my freshmen year due to having about 50 absences, and unintentionally ghosted all my friends. 

One of the things that I have been struggling with the past couple years is trying to get my dad to understand that haven't been trying to intentionally ruin my life. He thinks me being depressed is my fault, that I'm in this shitty state because I chose to be. I hate it when he asks,""Why don't you go to school?"" or,""How have you changed so much?"" or ""Why are you like this?"". I always reply with,""I don't know"", you know why? Because I actually **DON'T** fucking know. He always freaks out and we get into these long arguments, sometimes lasting over an hour, about how shitty of a son I am. I wouldn't even call it an argument. It's just me trying to explain to him I just need some help/time and him repeatedly telling me how worthless I am and how good of a father he is. I don't know how many times he's said,""I don't know why I deserve this"", or ,""I never wanted a child like you"". I'm not going to lie, whenever he bring me to the verge of either swinging or breaking down in tears, I have said some nasty things but only once I've been pushed to my limits. And I know, I know it IS my fault for not being able to get up in the morning and drag my ass to school or be jolly every fucking second of my life but its hard when your own mind is telling you to kill yourself.

I moved a town over this year and its been far from perfect but I was passing with a 2.9gpa and 9 absences by winter break. Unfortunately however, putting a kid with mild depression in a new school does not cure that depression but turns that mild depression into suicidal thoughts. Its been hard for me to make new friends in my new school and I guess over countless hours of me laying in bed and thinking and crying and wanting to die during winter break, my depression became worse than ever. I haven't gone to school since winter break and my relationship with not only my dad but my friends just melted away.

I have been seeing a therapist and have been prescribed some antidepressants and the depressants are supposed to start working in about one more week but these past weeks have been some of the toughest weeks of my life. Two weeks ago, when I got my antidepressants my dad came into my room, picked up my case of pills and said,""See, you're the one with the problems, the doctors even gave you medication"", I socked him and we wrestled for a couple minutes until he pushed me off of him. We haven't talked since and I don't know what to do.",19Mar2020,1

127,"I’m bisexual and ever since I told my mum I was bi when I was 13 I’ve never said the words out loud again. I mean even if I tried to I couldn’t so I just choose not to in fear of something idk what. But I also never talk about who I find attractive. 

The only reason I’m asking if it’s normal is because my best friend has given me shit for it. She hasn’t been rude she’s just been frustrated I guess? A lot of people know I’m bi, but I’ve never told them. The only people I’ve told is my mum and my best friend figured it out because I did mention a guy being good looking once a few years back. Everyone else found out through another friend of mine who told them. (Bit annoying but no big deal for me since no one really cares). 

A newer friend of mine asked me if I could go to our prom with her since neither of us are in a relationship (only 2 in our group who aren’t) and we could just go as friends. I was about to reply when my other friend (sorry for any confusion) said “he might get a girlfriend before you, or a boyfriend since he’s bi.” The friend who asked me (let’s call her Ashley) was shocked. Ended up getting annoyed at me for never telling her and I just said the truth, that I never feel the need to talk about who I find attractive. 

The day went on and my friends started talking about people they’ve fancied in our year. They turn to me and since I’m bi ask me which guys I’ve fancied, I’ve fancied a few but I never told them who because idk it’s just weird for me to talk about who I like. I told them there was no one and I probably wouldn’t say if there was anyways. They then asked me about every male friend I’ve had and if I’ve ever wanted to be with them, I told them no they accepted that. 

It was only later in the day when my best friend said quite loudly in our class (which was uncomfortable as fuck to me because it wasn’t just our friends there) that I need to start telling people who I like if I ever want to get a relationship otherwise I’ll end up alone through school. I just laughed it off and didn’t reply hoping she’d stop by she kept going on before I looked to and mouthed to shut up because the class was dead silent. 

Anyways, I went off on a rant there but back to the point, is it weird I don’t talk about who I’m attracted to? That I don’t tell people about my sexuality? That I find it so hard to even speak about out loud and that even if I tried to the words would just not come out? Idk why I’m like it I just don’t see the point I guess?

135,"Sorry, this may be a long post. A few weeks ago, a girl messaged me on a dating app. I was skeptical at first thinking it was a bot, because she was from a different state, and usually I don't get messaged first. From there we started chatting, I tired to make sure it wasn't a catfish or anything, and everything seemed okay.

We eventually moved to snapchat, had good conversations and sent some snaps back and forth. This eventually lead to flirting, and nudes were exchanged. Now we set rules before hand, obviously no screenshots and explaining that this is just fun for us. I don't usually do this, but she stated that she had done it before.

Now she doesn't work, and I am very busy atm work (especially with Coronavirus around). She would send messages during the day which I struggled to respond to. This is where things began to change. She would send strange messages from out of nowhere. ""I had a dark dream last night"", ""i just got into a fight with someone and they called me a slut"". I would view these hours later and struggled to respond.

As we chatted late a night, she started to share more personal details about herself. About her upbringing, school, and how she enjoys watching ""dark videos"" or similar stuff. I could begin to see that she's clearly been through a lot mentally and emotionally. Now I've got friends who battle with depression, and have been there for them and tried to help as best I could. Although not knowing this person that well, I tried to be as helpful as I could.

Eventually, it gets to the point where when I would say goodnight, she would follow up with a message 5 minutes later saying stuff like ""I'll never be loved"", ""I just saw a dark video"". I believed it to be stuff to bait me to stay awake, but I couldn't not check the messages to make sure.

As this escalated, to stuff like self harm, former partners, family issues, I made it clear that I wasn't comfortable talking about this stuff. She would come back and guilt me about the flirting, sexting, etc. I was trying to be as delicate as I could at this point, and tried to say that this should stop, and started trying to steer the conversations towards more positive discussions. She then leant hard into trying to flirt and send nudes, especially when I was at work.

As we had agreed this was just fun, and she had bragged about how she's sent nudes to multiple guys, and ""do I really think I'd hurt her feelings if we stopped"", I began to really try to step back. Although she claimed she doesn't have feelings, I thought otherwise. But I've told her numerous times that I'm not looking for anything, especially a long distance relationship. Anytime she would bring up the extremely personal stuff, I would try to point her towards professional help and her family. Only to be shut down. 

This all eventually lead to me going on a date with someone and not speaking to her for some hours. The next day, she questioned me on it, I told her the truth, which she went off at, claiming I'm like everyone else. This lead to her claiming she would self harm, and how she doesn't feel, which I once again suggested professional help.

Now I don't know what to do. I've tried to steer her to professional help and be a positive person. I don't like the idea of just blocking her and never talking, but I can't handle talking to her about it and wondering what she may do. Any suggestions?",19Mar2020,2
136,"Some backstory: I (19M) hit a low spot and needed a place to crash. Ended up moving in with a friend of a friend (20’sM) who owned a 1 year old French Bulldog in a two bed two bath apartment. 

Since then roommate has gotten a girlfriend who has moved in with us.

Shortly after her move in, they got a puppy. A boxer puppy. I’m fairly knowledgeable about dog habits, breeds and the like, and already dreaded what would come of this.

Both of them work full time jobs every weekday. Up around 7:30, gone by 9. Neither back until around 4 USUALLY. They often go out sporadically to party/who knows what on the weekends, and sometimes even go places weekdays like today in particular.

This puppy is almost a year old to my knowledge. She’s grown to be around 70 pounds if I were guessing. She’s very high energy, as most puppies are, even more so as a boxer puppy. 

SHE IS INSIDE OF A CAGE MADE FOR A FRENCH BULLDOG FOR ANYWHERE FROM 18-20 HOURS IN A 24 HOUR PERIOD, DEPENDING ON THE DAY.

What makes it worse is that she’s recently become destructive out of boredom. She tore apart the only thing she could get at in the cage, which was her bed, and they have yet to replace it. This is the third one after she SOILED THE PREVIOUS TWO.

Today is especially convincing. I awake and leave at 6 AM, return at 4, nobody is home. They both went to work at ~8-9 AM, and neither were there when I returned. Neither of them returned until now at 10 PM. I can only assume/hope one of them returned to the apartment to let her out, then promptly locked her back up and left again.

This means around 22 hours today that she spent inside of a crate that is too small for her, attempting to sleep on the bars of a crate because she didn’t have a bed. At least for 6 hours to my knowledge, maybe more that I don’t know about.

The French bulldog doesn’t get crated. He is allowed to roam the living room and kitchen of the apartment as he wishes, and often DOES HIS BUSINESS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAMN FLOOR. That’s an entirely different issue, but I don’t feel BAD for him because he’s not forced to either hold it or WALLOW IN IT LIKE THE PUPPY.

I’m a very anxious and non confrontational person, especially since I’m not super close with the roommates. I really need advice as to whether or not this is animal abuse (I definitely believe it is, I could really just use some references, official guidelines, laws, etc.) and what the best course of action would be to address this.

I’m actively trying to move out because putting the potential animal abuse aside, they’re loud and keep me awake at night, and if I step in the bulldog’s piss or shit one more goddamn time I’m going to pop a fuse.",19Mar2020,1
137,"My aunt has had a very very successful life.  I don't want to get into details about her, but long story short she's worth about 30 million. Yes, I just said 30 million. I was that kid who grew up taking vacations at my extremely wealthy aunt and uncles beach house.

Anyway, my aunt is my dad's sister. And right now during this coronavirus epidemic my Grandfather (my dad/aunts father) is 80 years old and still working. He never quite saved up a retirement fund and has been working to support his wife and keep food on the table.  My grampa is still going out every single day to work while this whole coronavirus thing is going on. He SHOULD NOT BE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE. But he has to in order to keep the money coming in. My mother and father struggle hard with money themselves so they cannot help my grandfather out.

This is where my aunt comes in.  She could easily give my grandpa a couple thousand dollars so he can stay indoors and wait out this virus epidemic. He is putting himself AT RISK every single day he continues to work. And my aunt is just chilling at her beach house with my uncle as if nothing is happening. That is so sad in my opinion. She could easily give her OWN father 10,000 dollars and it wouldn't even leave a dent in her bank account. Matter of fact 10 thousand dollars is so minimal to her net worth of 30 million, that would be the equivalent to giving somebody $5 bucks. That's how much money she has.

 I've absolutely lost all respect for my arm for not reaching out to my grandpa and helping him out in these times of need. Nobody else in my family has the means to support my gramma and grampa besides my aunt. Matter of fact, she's never even gave them a dime. Looks like people's true colors are showing during these times. What a shame. Imagine being a multimillionaire and not even giving your own father money so he can stay home and stay safe.

It was three people, two girls and a guy, and one of the girls was singing at the top of her lungs. She was quite drunk. But I thought ""Ok! Caronavirus season I have nothing better to do let's hang out!"" Well she first was very flirtatious with me then dropped ""you look like my cousins"" as she leaned in close to me (Okay Alabama, cool your jets) and then she gave me a playful punch but the kind that hurt. Then we are talking and the two of us end up on our own. She facetimes her sister who she proceeds to yell at saying she will disown her if she doesn't show up within the hour. At this point I noticed the stick and poke tatoos on her hand. She then proceeds to share that she has seizures and that she beats people to a pulp sometimes when they try to restrain her. At one point I nudged her because she was leaning hard on me and she straight up slapped me across the face and told me not to touch her again (she was LEANING on me).

He has a female friend who he met through the same dating app as me and he told me they went out a few times and decided to be just friends. They've been ""best buds"" ever since and hang out often, sometimes alone, sometimes with others. I met this friend and while she seemed nice and I like her, there was one moment that felt weird to me. She was talking about his hair and reached out and touched it and said something about ""my Bob""'s hair. We only hung out for about an hour that night and I haven't had any encounters with her since. It made me kind of uncomfortable because, if she's willing to do something like that while I'm sitting there watching...what is her behavior like when it's just the two of them?

I also should add that I recently got out of a long relationship where I was cheated on many many times throughout. I'm sure that's where 90% of my insecurity is coming from and I know I need to deal with that and I can't let my ex's behavior impact this new relationship...but it isn't easy, especially when I know he is hanging out with this female friend alone sometimes. We just started dating and I don't want to ruin things by pointing out that his hanging out with her alone bothers me (i.e. I don't want to give the impression that I'm trying to control him, because I'm not). I honestly don't mind if they stay friends and hang out in group situations, but the one on one time does bother me a bit. So far he has been great and hasn't given me any reason to feel I can't trust him. His female friend on the other hand...I don't know. And again, I don't know if that's me being irrational or if it's a legitimate thing to not want your boyfriend to hang out one on one with a female friend.

Am I being completely irrational?

Would I be in the wrong to ask him how far things went physically with her when they were dating?

Tell me how to handle this situation....I really care about him and I don't want to be stupid or let my past make me see things that just aren't there.",19Mar2020,1

156,"So, as a male, having a diagnosis of anxiety is not something I want to admit to, but I feel as though my constant paranoia and anxiety is taking a toll on my SO and I don’t want that. Over the past few months, it’s gotten so bad that I’m having panic attacks at least once a week and at most four a week. 

I don’t know how to deal with it. Any ideas, considering the whole isolation thing? 

Some important info: I’m still in high school but I don’t go back for three weeks, I live with my doomsday prepper parents who aren’t allowing me to even leave the yard, and I have mild depression

My mom doesn’t believe in modern medicine so both mild depression and severe anxiety have been diagnosed but left untreated and pretty much brushed under the rug. I get out of here in a year though, so meh

158,"Hey guys. So, as you know, this pandemic has people locked up in their houses. I'm in an area where everything except essential businesses are closed down. I'm young (22) and I live with roommates, both of whom are off work and at home as well. My roommate who's room is right next to mine is dating a man in his 40s and every time they have sex the entire house and everything in my room shakes. They're not very loud and are mostly respectful, but in all honesty, I find it reallllllly disgusting. Like truly stomach turning that I can FEEL them having sex. I can't imagine feeling that way at least once a day for the foreseeable future. What should I do about this? is it appropriate to talk to my roommate about it or enquire about how long he'll be here? How can I assuage myself if I shouldn't talk to her? I know that we're all kind of stuck in this together and people need to have sex but good lord. My boyfriend and I would never have sex here when people are home because the walls are so thin, I know that she knows I can FEEL her having sex because she agreed to not do it late at night or early in the morning as to not disrupt my sleep (it LITERALLY wakes me up). This is honestly the bane of my existence right now. Please help.",19Mar2020,1
159,"I got laid off from my serving job a couple days ago. I live with my parents rn, and I normally pay them $500 / month for rent but it looks like they'd understand for my situation. But I need a job to pay for student loans, food, my car payment, and phone bills.

My boss said that she has a job for me at an affilliated grocery store ready to go. The problem is that my grandmother lives at home with us. And I really don't want to get her sick. I don't think I could live with myself if that happened. Grandma and my ma tell me I should just wash my hands and I'll be fine. But everything I've read says that's not how primary transmission is done, it's done through droplets, and I'll be in close contact with people no matter what I do. So I'd likely catch COVID-19 while I'm there. And honestly, I personally don't care. I'm 155 lbs, 24, and haven't had any illnesses in my life. I'll do fine, but I couldn't live with myself if I got my grandma sick.

The options are basically to move in with my little brother who has an apartment in the city, or for my grandma to move back home a state over which is an hour 30 away. She normally lives there by herself in the summer, so I suggested to my mom that she move back there early since this pandemic is going on. But my mom just flipped out at me, said I'm an opportunist, that I don't care about Grandma, that she doesn't have any friends down back home this time of year, etc. I'd get it if she doesn't have friends down there, I don't want her to be all alone, or not have anyone to help her down there who live close by. If that was the case I wouldn't have said anything at all, probably just move in with my brother, or just turn down this job, collect unemployment, and look for another job with less contact. Idk if it's actually true that no one is down there right now though.

Anyway, it's now just a lot of family drama. My mom mom is upset and doesn't think she's wanted, and I feel terrible. I want to tell her that I love her and that I want her to stay. But she seems so hurt she might move anyway. I don't know what to say.

161,"So in respect of the rules I will use a fake name for the person who I’ll introduced to this story. His name is gonna be gen. So basically me and gen used to date only for a couple of days and I only knew him for about 3 days before we started dating. Before I asked him out I asked if he wanted to continue talking or if he wanted a relationship and he said that he wanted a relationship. So after we got together things between me and him were almost perfect. The only problem is that he’s trans (switching from girl to guy) and before we started dating I stated that I was attracted to his feminine features- this will make sense in a sec. On top of that I’m a senior who’s about to graduate and he’s two grades below me. Also, my parents would fucking hate me if they found out I was dating him because he’s white and trans. I state this because dating him gave me a lot of anxiety. When I tried to talk it out with him he just broke up with me saying that he couldn’t be in a relationship and the fact that I was attracted to his feminine features hurt him. Now he’s currently going through some things but he doesn’t wanna talk about what he’s going through because that was how he was raised. I even tried to get him to be more open to me but he snapped. I want to get closer to him cause I really like him but idk how. He said that he’s gonna be more distant due to his issues and he’s even left me on read. I basically wanna know how I can get closer to him without being a nuisance.",19Mar2020,1

163,"20M here and there are alot of things that aren't working out in my life, to keep this really short and simple; I have anger issues, like real bad one where I blackout and break things. This has being going on for a long time, since childhood I was a destructive kid with a bad temper.

I had a really nice and loving childhood but when I get upset or mad, I just loose it, I yell, I break stuff, punch the walls till my knuckles bleed etc.
When I get mad, I want to break something or someone, I don't get the satisfaction by meditation at all but instead it fuels me up even more.

Since I started dating this girl things have been going downhill, I've been someone I never thought I would become, I am ashamed of myself to say this but this is the only place where people would understand.
So the relationship was bad from the start,I loved her dearly but she cheated (long story) I forgave her but I was still pretty mad about it.

So I had her Instagram account without her knowing and saw that she was lying to me again, in a fit of rage I hit her twice but I regret that. I never wanted to hit a women but now I've crossed that line, I even threatened and blackmail her that I'll leak her nudes etc. 
  
(Ik this sounds really really bad but this is not me, I'm not in control when I'm mad, I blackout)

Today I was in an argument with her, I snapped and I broke my 10k piano and broke the baseball bat itself, my face was red like blood from the anger and to scare my girlfriend, I grabbed my dog and put a knife on it's throat and told my girlfriend to apologize otherwise I'll slit my dogs throat.

Then it suddenly hit me with what the fuck I am doing? What have I become in past few months, I threw the knife away and sat down and reflected about the things  I could've done. I love my dog to death but at that moment, it wasn't me. 

Idk what treatment I should get, it feels like a curse and I bet one day I'll end up killing somebody.

Ik I am a piece of shit and deserve to be behind bars and I'll readily do my time if I feel I've started to become dangerous. I wanna know the root cause of this? Why am I defective? Why cant I live a normal life? Why do I get this murderous rage?

Please I don't want torments from people saying mean things, I just want help. I don't wanna hurt anyone at all. I feel my personality changing too these days as I've become more short tempered ,irrational and aggressive.",19Mar2020,1

165,"My girlfriend (18F) and I (19M) broke up on Sunday at 9 months. It was on good terms and the feeling was mutual. As you would expect after a breakup I’ve been upset but it’s a bit more complicated. 
We ended up calling it off because it wasn’t working anymore, her effort in the relationship just completely stopped one day and with her parents being unaccepting due to me not being religious and her mental illnesses it became too hard to stay happy with her as I was no longer feeling like a bf at all at this point and after some talking about our issues she decided too that it’s for the best we end it. 

But the thing I need help with is this...

We ended it on good terms and we may be friends after a few months as we are in a lot of mutual friend groups and activities but my emotions are getting to me. She’s a good person and she never truly hurt me all that bad in the relationship other than not treating me well. But I had really good memories with her and we ended it on good terms there wasn’t any anger or anything but now, a few days later I’m feeling hatred for her... it happens to me all the time and I hate it. It’s like I still get teary during the day at times when I remember what we had but it’s like my coping mechanism is to convince myself that I hate her and she was the worst and all that so I don’t feel so hurt that she just let me go for my sake. I should be upset yes but grateful for the times we shared but I’m beginning to fill up with anger to the point I don’t wanna look at her anymore and I feel so guilty for it because she’s a good person and we were happy but being such an emotional person naturally thinking of the negatives and bad thoughts is how I make it easier to cope with the loss, I don’t mean to but I do.

171,"Hi! Before I start, I would like to say I'm aware that none of us know what this guy's true intentions were unless I ask. I'm just wondering what other people think.

Long story short, I \[21F\] met him \[21M\] my freshman year college and it was obvious that he wanted to get to know me from the very beginning. He eventually became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he showed up with hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what he wanted and he said he didn't want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year, nothing really happened. He made the effort to hang out with me here and there, but we never actually hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to talk a lot through Snap and he tagged me on stuff on Facebook. When classes began, he immediately asked me to chill the very first week. This became a consistent thing throughout the school year. Every time we hung out, he tried to hold my hand. Some things he did that made me think he wanted a relationship was: he would always pay for my coffee, bought wine a couple of times so we could drink it together in our dorms, bought and cooked me food (dude specifically bought me steak too cause i asked for it), bought me a bottle for my birthday after I jokingly asked for one, asked to chill in the city and Facetime over winter break. First semester, we were both at two parties together and usually he hooks up with other girls but both times he just stayed with me throughout the party. One party, I was dancing with another guy and it was obvious that he was mad but didn't say anything. Not only that, second semester, I had a birthday party and he bought me a bottle. I got drunk and was apparently touchy with his friends. The next day, his friend told me that I was touchy with them and that he looked mad stressed when I did that. Anyways, last week was basically our last week of college because of everything being moved online do to the coronavirus. He asked to hangout because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, once again he pays and tries to hold my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. He then asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no and he asks why. I know I should've asked what his intentions were then but I just couldn't so I said that I wasn't good at this physical stuff and he kept saying that it was fine and he didn't care. I said I'm only comfortable with being kissed on the cheek so he kisses me on the cheek and neck for a little bit and then we cuddle for 2 hours (this is the most physical we got all year). Later that night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he'll be coming too. He comes, we're both on the dancefloor, I dance with my guy friends, and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

So did he want to just hook up with me or did he want an actual relationship? I'm confused because he spent so much time and effort throughout the year to hangout with me -- but just for a hookup? Anyways, I feel like if he really wanted a relationship with me he would make the effort to make his intentions more clear and would reach out first. What do you think?

TL;DR: Guy did nice things for me throughout the year then hooks up with another girl on our last night of college. Did he want a hookup or relationship? Do I reach out or see if he does first?",19Mar2020,2

173,"**Questions**: Is it possible to pursue a completely different college degree program (ie. an associate's degree or bachelor's) in a different field of study while I put my current bachelor's on hard pause? Am I limited to certification programs? Is there an organization where I can receive more information on what my options are? Are there opportunities I'm not considering?   


**Background**: I'm currently on a break from obtaining my bachelor's degree in a specialized field in an out of state college (I'm located in the US). I am less than 12 credits away from getting my degree and have the option to complete my program through transfer credits at my home state. However, since my degree field is so specialized, it is difficult to find classes, plus I have lost all motivation in holding a career in that particular field.   


I was considering whether I should pursue a different degree but I am not sure what my options are. My adviser has told me that I can return to school whenever I feel ready to, even if it takes additional years. My first plan was to just complete my courses at a community college in my state but I realized quickly that I still had zero motivation in the field and had to drop the courses.   


I am hesitant to stop my degree program completely because my college is well known and highly regarded with an extremely low acceptance rate. Plus I am so damn close to finishing. The college only offers degree programs in one particular field of study, so switching majors will do little as it was the field I had issues with and not my particular major. I have considered transferring, but because my program is so specific, barely any of my credits will be relevant enough to transfer. This will leave many of my credits useless towards a degree. I don't want to make the amount of tuition I paid useless unless its my very last option. I did not have a holistic liberal arts college background so I would be missing many basic freshman level courses.   


My end goal would be to receive schooling so I can start a career. I just don't want a career in the field I was currently studying in. I have been in contact with my college adviser but they were only able to provide information on how to complete my current degree and not if it was possible to explore different options in the meantime. I haven't been successful in landing a job that wasn't minimum wage. Plus my options are so limited since most openings required a degree. I can't lift heavy materials or do physically demanding work so I haven't been considering trades although I am open to the idea.

175,"My partner’s dad died recently and he was a hoarder- had months to years worth of supplies of TP, cleaning supplies, canned food, etc.  He has always been a hoarder, according to my partner, but he was also elderly and homebound and was not doing as well mentally near the end.  So all of these supplies were things that he had well before the current situation and he died before ever being aware of this new virus. 

We had a “virtual” estate sale last weekend- people got a time slot, could purchase items they had placed a hold on, come pick them up without others there, and everything was first come first served, based on the waitlist system.  We did not include toiletries, cleaning items or food items simply because we were more concerned about getting rid of the big items like furniture, appliances and other household items, and we didn’t want our ad to include consumable items because we didn’t want the ad to get flagged and removed.

You can probably see where this is going.  We should have removed the items from the house, that we know, but since people were only going to have access to the garage, it seemed safe enough. But someone looked through the windows and saw some of the supplies and called the cops. I explained to the concerned citizen that we had inherited the supplies, we hadn't purchased them and asked them why they felt it was unreasonable for us to just keep them since we had inherited them, and would use them eventually. They screamed at us that because of what is currently happening with the quarantine, that blood was on our hands for every person who died, and the fact that we hadn’t purchased them ourselves was further argument that we should be donating them.  

The police arrived and basically told us that we should expect that the house is not safe if the supplies remain there and that our safest option was to donate them.  I’m not sure they believe us, that we inherited them,  or that we would keep them for private use, and they implied on multiple occasions that they believed we would be trying to sell them and price gouge. My belief is that a family would be able to use all the supplies within a 2 year period, so it’s not as though the stockpile is so large that it would fit in a storage unit, or have to be stored off site- everything fits in our current space.

Am I really off base here and is my only option to donate it at this point?  I have run this by a few people and they have all given me feedback that keeping it is an asshole move. My partner is ambivalent but would like to keep it simply because people are telling her she can’t when it’s stuff that belonged to her dad, and she’s still working through a lot of things with his death. She has donated many other things of his, including unopened latex and non latex gloves, face masks, Mobility devices, motorized scooters, thermometers, etc., to vulnerable populations, just not items we would actually use ourselves. Not sure what to do, but certainly am feeling the heat, and yet I don’t feel like I am doing anything actively wrong by keeping it.  Would love some advice and perspective.

My landlady is a single mother of 2, she has an 18 year old daughter who is very quiet and almost never around, and a 10 year old son who is severely autistic and always with her. 

I am a very quiet tenant. I always pay on time, I never cause problems, I'm very respectful of her space and try to be quick and quiet when I walk in to go down to the basement. I don't drink or do drugs and I rarely have guests over. I follow all of the strict rules she has to keep her autistic son safe. I have not caused any issues so far. 

She is very kind, but very controlling. She told me I am required to keep all of the lights off when I leave the apartment to keep the electric bill down, but I pay utilities with my rent so this is a bit confusing to me. I have been very diligent at turning the lights off, and one morning while running late for work I forgot to turn the bathroom light off and she text me a couple hours later saying her son shoved something under the door and she went downstairs to get it and was upset that I left a light on. She then left several sticky notes in my apartment reminding me to turn the lights off. 

I am suspicious that she checks often after I leave because that was the first and only time I accidentally left a light on. 

She texts me frequently to help her with various things that are hard for her to do with her son, and I don't mind assisting her, but she asks me almost daily for help. 

She regularly schedules appointments for contractors that need to get into a supply closet in the basement, or exterminators that need to go look at the basement (even though there are no issues with bugs/mice in the basement. Only in her kitchen) and will text me daily for a week leading up to it that I need to make sure it's clean down there (I pretty much always keep it clean, so this gets annoying.) 

Her son, who I have no issues with at all, can be a little aggressive and has hurt me on a couple of occasions. He once ran up to me while I was unlocking the door to the basement and pulled my hair so hard he almost knocked me over and my head was sore for the rest of the day, and once threw his mom's phone at me and hit my hand quite hard. I understand he does not know what he's doing, but at the same time I am always afraid to bring guests over because I don't want him to accidentally hurt them. 

I often stay up late and I will be quietly doing the dishes at 1:00am and she will text me and ask me why I'm up so late (she also stays up late.) I even barely coughed while in the basement the other night at midnight and she text me and told me to be careful not to get them sick. Her son screams throughout most of the day, pushes garbage under the door that I have to clean up, and she will vacuum right above my bedroom until 2:00am sometimes. If I'm not home by 10:00pm she wants to know what time I'll be home. 

I am a very patient person, but I'm becoming quite irritated with the lack of boundaries. I pay way to much for this apartment considering the circumstances, and I wish I had my freedom and flexibility to live there in peace. I am the first person she has rented it to. 

I do not think she has malicious intent, she is a very kind person, but I do think she has issues with control. How do I handle this situation going forward? Would it be appropriate to talk to her about it? If so, how?",19Mar2020,1
190,"I always feel like I'm just going through the motions. I usually feel numb or just unreasonably angry. I had a great childhood but my family life went severely downhill at 18 and I feel like I haven't bounced back. I look at the person I've become as opposed to who I feel like I used to be and the difference is unrecognizable. I don't feel like myself anymore. I've been through multiple suicide attempts and self harm and I feel like I'm past that stage if you want to label it.

But how 5 years later from when my life was turned upside down I'm not sure how to get better from here. I know it's silly to look to reddit for help but I'm hoping someone can share something they did/are to doing to help them feel better than the way I have been or if someone could share their experience. It's always nice to hear you're not alone.

191,"Backstory:

To be honest, I don’t remembered when I identified as bisexual. It was occurred to me gradually in my life. I just don’t care who I ended up with. Also, I’m in the closet because my family doesn’t agree with LGBTQ.

—

The reason I’m writing this right because a friend of mine (who’s queer and been in a few of relationships before) asked: “How you have if you’re bisexual, if you never dated before?”

I don’t know exactly why I’ve felt uncomfortable, but it did. In response to that question, I told them that it was complicated and quickly moved on. (Which it was a complicated situation.) They have tried to pushing the question further, but I explained that I don’t want to talk about it right now.

Now, I’m middle school—had some small crushes a couple of people here and there. There’s a lot of times where I think a person is attractive. However, I don’t want to be in a committed relationship right now. So, I never had the “huge and emotional to my heart” crush before. I’m genuinely not interested in a romantic relationship and just want to focus on myself. It’s too much of a struggle to be in relationship in the situation I’m in. Also, I couldn’t want to be selfish and make my partner to be unloved due to my circumstances with my family.

The reason I need help on this—is because I’m wondering if people in relationships understand their sexuality more than people without one.

I would like everyone’s opinions and advice on this please! :)",19Mar2020,1
192,"As you probably can tell, we are in the middle of a pandemic right now. My friend and I are not at risk because we are young and not immunocompromised. I, however, have decided to #staythefuckinside because my parents and other people are older and have underlying conditions. I’m not leaving the house at all for the next month or longer, only to exercise outside and get food.

My friend, her parents, and her siblings will all be making a long drive down to Florida and stay in a condo with a private beach for about a week.

I think that this trip is a terrible idea because, even though they’re driving, they still have to stop at rest stops and restaurants, all places with people and possibly disease. They also can’t really do anything in Florida cause everything is closed, so what even is the point? They have a private beach (even that might be closed), but beyond that I don’t know what they’d do. The only thing they would be doing is giving the disease more chances to spread, and getting some extra vitamin D.

So long story short, I want to convince her that this trip is a bad idea. I will probably also have to convince her parents the same, since they are the ones driving, paying, etc. I have about a week to do this. I would like some advice on how to convince her how staying put is so important right now. If anybody has had to convince someone to stay home during this, those words would be greatly appreciated.

Alternatively, I could be overreacting about this whole thing and I’m the one that needs convincing that it’s okay for her to travel. If you think that’s the case, please tell me.",19Mar2020,2
193,"I've been working at my first ""real"" job. It's full-time, with benefits, and is catered to my skillset. I also get paid way more than I should. It's an old company with old values, and I think that's part of the problem. 

My job entails me doing data entry and creating fairly basic excel reports for effectively one person across the aisle from me: my boss. My desk is among the sales team, and it makes it hard to focus.

The HR department is nonexistent. It's one very shy older lady who has a reputation for not following up on complaints about behavior.

The main offender is a middle-aged guy who belittles every sales team member (not including me since I don't report to him) in a very demeaning and non-private way. What's worse is that he is their supervisor, and has created an environment where people are afraid to ask him questions. Hearing him loudly call his subordinates names, verbally threatening to hit them, and loudly telling them ""you've fucked up, now get your shit together"". These things happen every day, multiple times a day.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was called a nerd by a sales team guy that I've only ever been nice to and people around him laughed.

My boss denies that anything is wrong with the state of workplace behavior, and even joins in at times (but only when provoked).

Why haven't I left? One main reason.

I don't feel like I have enough experience to be competitive with other 22-year-old liberal arts degree majors.

194,"This is a really tough subject for us to talk about, for me to even think about. But I need to be honest. 

I don’t want to convert. I’ve lived my life religion free and I’m happy, but he’s lived the exact opposite life style with all his focus on “being better with himself and becoming one with Christ.” 

That doesn’t bother me, at all. I don’t care what religion you practice as long as you do it willingly and aren’t hurting someone else’s life style. But for him it’s different. 

He says that for his marriage him and his spouse need to both be one with Christ, constantly studying the Bible together and learning to live with this faith. He’s said (as we’ve lightly touched this topic before) that he would only want me to go through with it if I wanted it for myself, not for him. And I’m glad he thinks that! 

But when I tell him I don’t think I want to or I’m pretty sure I won’t, he keeps saying to “give it more time.” The reasoning behind that is that I have been going to a few sermons with him the past couple weeks just to see what it’s like. It’s alright, not terrible but not something I think I could do for the rest of my life, especially if we had kids. 

He’s also headstrong about this because is such a big part of his life and he wants me to be part of that, which I admit touches my heart. I just wish it wasn’t over something as crucial as this. I know at the end of the day I would be fine with having different views, because I still love him with all my heart. It hurts to think he wouldn’t want the same. 

I’ve been having this dilemma the past couple months and it’s been rough. I need to get rid of this anxiety and the fear of being ripped from my own personality. Please help.",19Mar2020,3

I contacted my work and told them what the hospital told me and they insisted that I need to be tested and they need results so they can ""figure out if they need to close or not"".

200,"I’m 16m and my dad abuses me. Not physically. I don’t think he’s ever hit me, but it’s all mental. He yells at me more than he talks to me, usually how i’m doing something wrong or how i’m not good enough at something. Just the smallest shit too, like earlier today he was screaming in my face about how i cleaned the bathroom with a disinfectant instead of bleach, and he also yelled at me because i ate too much chinese food, but i was on my first helping as the rest of my family was on their second to third. Every day it’s just something new and so outrageously unfair and he finds so many things to yell at me and ground me for. I understand to some people that might just be “tough love” or maybe he’s just a hard father, but you need to understand that this has been going on for years and i can’t take it anymore. It’s gotten worse recently. He’s been calling me some pretty bad shit, such as “a piece of shit” or how i’m retarded”. I hear him rant to my mom behind closed doors about how i’m a failure and i do nothing right and how i’m not the son he wanted. Now, i’m a suicide survivor and i have depression but it got better for me, but it’s all coming back because of him. I told him he’s making me slip back into an really depressed state and he walked away and said “i don’t care”. I always ask him to please whatever he does stop yelling at me and he knows it’s my main anxiety trigger, but he doesn’t stop.

201,"I really am at a turning point. Sitting here quarantined for days on end already still filled with worry checking my temperature, I think about why I left my husband (42M) who drinks constantly. Together we own a local plumbing company. Though, daily we would end up at the bar with the good old guys, after many drinks he begins to belittles me and sometimes it got physical. Me ending with stitches in my lip, lying to my parents and missing thanksgiving last year. This time last year I was having a miscarriage. I don’t even think he really wanted it. After he found out he asked me why I wasn’t on birth control. We are married and we had already had that talk.

Fast forward months and I’m taking swab test at plan parenthood to prove I didn’t cheat with stitches in my face. I think I started to wake up. I don’t know. For over a month I hid it from everyone I know (while I was healing) and he still went to the bar. Dec 31st my birthday my life long friend made me leave after seeing the pictures of my stitches. To be honest, I never wanted to admit I was in another abusive relationship because this wasn’t my first but it was my first marriage. I have been a fool. 

I left on my birthday which only enraged him more; his slimy drinking buddies right at his side. For first month I was getting my life together and used what money I did have to buy my parents 5th wheel trailer. I moved it out of town about 45 minutes near my best friends house. I have now quit cigarettes and drinking (well I drank one beer after helping shovel sand for six hours on a project with this old man; whom, I wasn’t going to tell him no.) I’m proud I quit cigarettes but quitting drinking made that insanely easier. Overall being away from him made it easy too. I sleep better and I don’t stress as much. Until the virus that is, he wouldn’t listen to me, my parts won’t listen to me. 

I’m quarantined in my house and things have changed after days of thinking. 

Over the weekend I had a huge opportunity to teach at a Parks and Wildlife event for ladies who want to learn more about the outdoors. I teach the solar cooking class and my mom teaches the gun classes. My parents wouldn’t listen to me and went anyway; the day before when I realized I shouldn’t go so I could help “beat the curve”. I called and pretended to be sick, I felt horrible but they were completely understand and my mom went anyway. She is now coughing; my dad keeps saying it’s her sinuses and I convinced my sister to take her to the doctor. They gave her one of the five coronavirus year they have. My mom has water around her heart, diabetes and had heart surgery. We wait 3-5 days time to find out the results. 

My estrange husband and I have been working on things. Though, before the virus I was the only one going to therapy (a couples therapy he chose). That’s right I went alone. My normal therapist had already told me he was gaslighting me. The new therapist he chose was like “if he won’t come with you and he won’t change then it comes down to how much are you willing to take. Everyday since I have been thinking why wouldn’t he be trying to get me back? Everyday he still went to the bar all the way up until our mayor closed them down. Me leaving didn’t mean anything. We are at three months and he is losing me. I don’t know when you know is enough and could I even possibly feel right leaving him while I’m in isolation? Everyday he still goes to do plumbing and I’m worried about him (though I shouldn’t) and my mom. If they don’t listen to my pleas, do I just realize they have to save themselves? What if it was the last time I saw my mom? I just wish I could move on or find some peace. I know my problems are minor. I don’t feel like I can turn to anyone I know for good advice. I’m usually the person there to make people laugh when their sad. Maybe I should focus on that.",19Mar2020,1
202,"I did not have a job last Summer - didn't need one, had a car, a favorable schedule, enough money to last me through the school year, plus I wanted to focus on my schoolwork and do some independent learning. 

This Summer, I had planned to get a job to pay for a new car(as well as my other necessities) to reliably get myself to college next semester, since my mechanic brother told me he doesn't think my car will last much longer now. I live in a tourist town. Our population goes up by over 1000% in the Summer. With the coronavirus, there will be no tourists nor will there be any jobs available(no tourists + businesses closed). 

So, a job seems off the table at this point. I could take out more loans, but that would not be enough cash for the entire semester and it's more money in loans than i'd be comfortable with. 

I could probably get a job at a grocery store if I wanted to. However, I would then be risking bringing the virus home to my older parents(the virus has been confirmed in my county). Therefore, grocery store is also probably off the table.

Well I come across my cousins boyfriend. [27]  They’ve been together for almost 2 years or so. My cousin and I are somewhat close as most cousins go, we grew up together close. She [21] is 9 years younger than me. [30] 

Well, I swipe right because maybe it’s an old account. But it’s not. It’s actually a match. He messaged me and I messaged back hello and asked what his plans were tonight. And then invited me to his place this weekend so I’m assuming he physically cheats as well. At this point I’m stuck on what to do. 

Because he also has an Instagram that my cousin doesn’t follow despite posting pics of them to hers, and she wasn’t on his. Is this a hidden account he has her blocked on? 

Do I tell her? I feel like I should because they’re about to move in together. Now here’s my plan to do it because I will not be the messenger.

I've been working at my current job for about 7 or 8 months now. I take the bus to and from work every day. 

I recently found out that I'd have to quit my job in the next month or two because of my school schedule. My plan was to give a two weeks notice (although when I talked to my supervisor about leaving, they said it was not necessary) and then leave after a shift. It just seems like the respectful thing to do. 

The Coronavirus has me on edge. I can't afford to get it. My family that I live with is older and has medical issues, so if they get it they could die. I take the bus, and I work in a room with around 15 other people. I'm super nervous about catching the virus.

I've called out of work the past few days sick because of a cough I've had. No fever, but I'm trying to play it safe (and as for my family, I'm trying to stay away from them for now while checking on my symptoms. So far so good!)

210,"So with that, I wanted to clarify, no I am not schizophrenic. Let me explain. 

I have dreams of real life events happening. Things that could very much realistically happen. Normal every day things. For example. Certain interactions with people, texting people is a pretty common one, school events, etc. 

I wake up in the morning and my mind is hazy. As I start to wake myself up I start getting confused on what happened and what didn't. I'll assume something that happened my dream happened and when I go to continue it /like look at a text message or continue a conversation/, I realize it never happened. Or I assume things that did actually happen didn't thinking it was a dream. 

I never like saying the full story of things because memories are in the same category as dreams. When I was younger, I had someone who liked to grab me and throw me in the air. /I was 5 and he was like. 30?/ and I would be screaming in fear and crying and trying to avoid him

Whenever I tell the story I kinda tell minimum detail and sound very confused because I'm not sure if it actually happened or if I somehow dreamed it. 
I'm just so confused on why this is happening, it's been horrible lately. It feels like 17 different dreams which are small realistic or unrealistic things happening at once and I just don't know what is going on and what isn't. 

This has also caused me to gaslight myself. If someone does something to me I think I'm overthinking, being dramatic. Not all of it happened the way I think. And I continue to let the cycle repeat. 

If it's helps I'm 14F. I just really don't understand what's going on or if this is normal. Whenever I tell people anything about me I just get that 'mood' text back which I hate.

Cash flow freeze...

Maybe this is a bad idea but say we tried to freeze the cash flows in the economy where they are. No one pays any expenses for the duration of the lockdown unless your entire supply chain hasnt been disrupted by the virus. 

No mortgage payments, no rent. Depreciation and maintenance cost paid by government. This includes rent for small businesses. Inventory losses can be recouped through loans or in turn for equity in firms from govt

Essential work is subsidized by the govt for the duration of the lockdown. 

The national gaurd supplies food to those with inadequate savings. All they should need is food and possibly  childcare equipment because they should have no expenses. 

After quarantine is lifted, everything resumes. 

Is this rediculous? I don't really see how else we'd get through this without massive layoffs. I know it would be absurdly expensive,  but now theyre talking about a one trillion dollar stimulus that baisically seems to cut taxes and just throw money at people. That's great and all, but what if this lasts longer than a month or two?

220,"Hi,

First time ever posting and pretty hard for me to articulate this. I'm finding it hard to come to terms with what I want to do with my life ever since I actually started to eliminate distractions, focus within and really question myself (not sure if just overthinking). The cusp of my crisis stems from never really trying throughout school/high school; study for the stake of studying whilst distracting myself with video games all throughout my schooling life. Due to playing video games and always being on the computer, I've become quite knowledgeable with how computers worked. Not necessarily because I loved it, just because it came to be, from the amount of time I spent on the computer. Therefore, I half-wittedly decided to do Information Systems/Business(Economics) at University simply because I've just always done it; however, recently my interests have taken a 180 degree flip to Philosophy, Psychology, Economics and Sociology. I have always subconsciously questioned why people do the things they do, questioning the processes of everything I see and having deep and meaningful conversations with anyone I come into contact with, about issues internally or within the world. I work at a Loss Adjuster company and have been exposed to the corporate world and the thought of working a role-filling, meaningless job ceases to excite me. I do not care about money, nor wealth, rather fundamental success, stemming from loving what I do. I find the hardest part is dropping 3 years of University work I have completed with IT and pursuing something I am passionate about.

I suppose the question I'm really asking is if pursuing an IT-oriented field is worth it, or taking a 180 degree career change into Psychology with a minor in Sociology/Philosophy, given the employability of this field.. Has anyone done something similar? If so, how did it go in relation to finding a new job when comparing yourself to others whom have miles more experience ahead of you due to always following it.

226,"
I’m writing this out before I go to bed to get it off my mind and wake up with a clearer head. Any sincere advice is appreciated, I’m in a situation and I want to do the right thing. I live with my parents at the moment. My mom is in her 50’s and my dad is upper 50’s. This month without foresight I decided to quit my job for a job that is greatly affect by the virus. Needless to say it fell through. I deferred a  loan and plan on doing it with my others. So for 2-4 months I should personally be alright with money. But I will be needing money at some point. My parents generally aren’t great with finances and such although they work. 

I had a panic attack the other day when I thought about my parents catching the virus and dying. I also have a very heavy moral conscious and I want to do the right thing for the world around me. 

So right now I am unemployed. My previous employer called me today and offered for me to work for him again. Under the pressure I said yes, but I’m having second thoughts. Although he thought we didn’t have the best relationship and it was hard to talk to him about things. The guy who employed me scared me in general and he doesn’t sound concerned about the virus. Says it’s like chicken pox. I know many people want a job right now so I know it’s a good opportunity. Broadly speaking it’s a labor job and I would be a lot of times going to between 1 and 4 houses and doing work either inside their home or outside. I believe that it would mostly be just me and my boss working. I live in a fairly big city with confined cases in America.

I am beyond scared of catching the virus and giving it to my parents or others around me. I accepted the job, but I’m so scared. I could back out if need be, but I also don’t know if other jobs would be much better. I don’t want to be a burden on them financially either. I feel I’ll need to work eventually. I wish that I didn’t live at home. Honestly I’ve thought crazy thoughts like sleeping outside to avoid giving it to them. Idk. Even in general. I know staying inside is the best option to save as many lives as possible, I just don’t know what to do. 

Please pass on some advice. I’m anxious and scared. I want to do the right thing. A friend told me he’d take the job in my situation. Idk.

230,"BACKGROUND: I have spent my whole life working towards a job in Aviation. More specifically a helicopter pilot. I did not decide to get into Aviation because of the looming pilot shortage, or the cool factor. It has just always been something that I have loved since childhood. 

I had my glider license at 16, fixed-wing at 18, and commercial heli at 19. I have taught multiple students how to fly and have fortunately been in the position to acquire my own aircraft (which at this moment is my mid-life crisis).

I have invested EVERYTHING I have and then some into this. 

BUT

I have never known job security. 

CONUNDRUM: 

The last 3 years I have spent working contracts in the industry, and have not managed to obtain one longer than a year. I constantly find myself without work for 3-4 months at a time in between jobs. This has created a huge financial burden for me as I have enormous flight training loans to pay off.

Recently I landed my first ever permanent position at a  factory working a good shift. I enjoy being busy and working with my hands all day in the friendly atmosphere. Nowhere is this close to what I thought I would be doing but hey, life happens.

I love not having to work with the constant worry of how many days I have left, and what is the plan if my contract isnt renewed / things go sideways.

On the flip side this is not what I went to school for. My old boss recently sent me information on a place to apply to, with a high likely hood of me getting a job offer out of it. Considering it's the prime time to get new contracts for the spring season this is my only opportunity until next year to give Aviation another shot.

The thing is, I dont want to be left high and dry in a couple months if I dont get extended / permanently put on slate. My last serious heli job laid me off without cause suddenly at the worst time of year for new work prospects. It blindsided me completely, and I have struggled to recover from it. Since then I have worked 4 horrible contracts until now.

I dont want to leave my new secure job to be burned again, by companies that could care less about me. At the same I dont want to seriously regret this tiny possible opportunity to get back into what I used to love. Even though at one point I had started to hate it due to circumstances.

How should I move forward? 

Sidenote: I hate wasting people's time and money training me on a job that I dont plan on staying at, and would feel INCREDIBLY guilty if I were to leave my brand new job after a couple months.",19Mar2020,1
231,"I have a friend, lets call him Marvin. He was always such a sweet and chill dude. Donated money to people just to see them smile. Had little live streamed parties to just chill and give advice. Would literally give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. At least thats what I knew of him before now. Now my friend is also noticeably middle eastern and lives in the states. Not saying that that has a bearing on anything per say, just that I have to admit that middle easterners are NOT treated well and a lot of people in the states are unbelievably racist. 

Here is where my stressor comes in. I've known this guy online for a long time. Not really in person in which is why im torn. He is the subject of a court case right now. The court case is that he was accused of trying to r*pe a girl. It shocked me that anything like that could even be connected to him like that but I certainly know that blaming the victim is a bad Idea and these things do happen. But ever since the Johnny Depp/Amber heard thing came out I'm afraid to unconditionally believe anyone without evidence. Especially since the states are really bad about racism. But I'm also not gonna believe him without evidence either since well...r*pe accusations should always be taken seriously. What the heck should I do? I want to stick by him until something is definitely decided in court but people these days hate neutrality. Should I take a side and ruin a relationship with a potentially innocent man or drop him immediately even if he might not have done anything?

But here’s my position: We live in a state with just a couple dozen cases thus far. None in our city. The procedure is being done at a dedicated eye surgery facility, not a hospital. There will be less than 10 people in the room with me, which is under the CDC guidelines. Plus, it’s a medical procedure, so I’m assuming everything is sterilized and disinfected.

I just think a couple hours outside the house (which we have to do anyway to buy food) for a procedure I’ve been dreaming about getting for 20 years is worth the small amount of risk involved.

237,"     Alright, so this is going to be a long one. I will try to shorten it as best as I can but if you take the time to even read this it will be greatly appreciated. 
     Basically, when I was kid up until I was 12 I didn’t know the LGBTQIA+ was a thing. I figured that I would grow up to like men and everybody knew that as well. So, when my family would try to set me up with other boys I always said I wasn’t interested and never understood why mom would yell at me. She would always yell about how people would think I was weird. 
     Fast forward to age 12, I learned being gay was a thing and not too long after I started to put together the pieces that I’m not straight. Before I even got to come out and accept myself, I was outed to my mother. At the time I used the labels asexual and lesbian to describe myself and still feel that way although I just prefer to use queer when I came out to friends. 
      When my mother came to me, she initially was very loving and caring and since I had never heard her say anything about LGBTQIA+ stuff I took it as her being supportive. I admitted it to her and it became evident that she was the opposite of supportive. She threatened to take to a doctor to be ‘fixed’ among other things. In the spur of the moment, I did the only thing my 12 year old brain could think of. Which was to avoid going down a path of conversion therapy and telling her that I was still figuring it out. 
      Even now, years later I use the same excuse because when she asks me about I never know how to respond. What can you really say in this situation? If I explicitly say that I’m not straight and explain my feelings like I did, I’m running the risk of going down that path again. I also have no way of knowing whether she would actually do those things.On the other hand, if I tell her I’m straight she is never going to believe me. 
     Since then, her view of the LGBTQIA+ community has changed quite a bit and has come to me with questions to try understand some things(specifically with being transgender, which I am not) and seems to be more understanding now. However, I don’t know if that’s her trying to manipulate me to come out of the closet or if it’s genuine and I’m just freaking out over nothing. She says the thing that would hurt her the most is me not telling her and I don’t want to hurt her. 
      Part of me wants to come out to her but I’m unsure of what to do, hence me coming here. I know rationally I should stay in the closet for pure safety. Helppppp.",19Mar2020,1

She won’t let my me move in with her to take care of her if my GF would have to move in too.

245,"TLDR: BF of 5 years has been a constant lying asshole who has cheated and just caught him lying to me about drugs again for the millionth and idk if I should leave him or not because that means splitting apart our 2 dogs that are brothers and I’ll never see one of the dogs ever again. 

I’ve been in a relationship with this 22M for 5 years. He lies about everything. He’s consistently lied to me  and stolen from me over the past 5 years about drugs ranging from weed to meth, also signed up for a dating site 2 years into the relationship. I kept forgiving him over and over again. Well we moved out of state, it didn’t work out due to the heavy drinking and we ended up getting physically violent and I started using to escape. At that point we moved back. End of year 3, After we came back I busted my ass working 60 hours a week to make ends meet only to find out he was cheating on me because I didn’t spend enough time with him. Again I crawled back to him.  A lot of family shit happen and he didn’t have a job for a year, so year 4 he finally got a job got his GED and wanted to go to college. I thought he was getting it together and that it was finally good. I could hang out with friends without getting screamed at or accused for things I wasn’t doing I felt like I could sorta be my own person. but he still didn’t have a job. fast forward it’s almost year 5 I had a gut feeling like I did when he cheated that I was being lied to about job hunting and about his family. Idc about what he does with them their his family but don’t lie to me about them when I know they don’t like me. That itch wouldn’t go away so I peaked and turns out he was lying to me about finding a job, drugs, and asking if his bud had any single girls he could talk to. It was the last straw after being lied to constantly for 5 years but animals are involved. I work full time as well as go to college. We have 2 dogs, 1 is mine 1 is his, I feel guilty splitting the 2 dogs up and am extremely upset that I won’t see the other one ever again by leaving. I don’t know what to do and a part of me doesn’t want to leave but when can I say enough is enough? Whenever I then try to tell him how lying really hurts me he either starts to yell at me or turns it around on me or tries to gaslight me. 5 years and he can’t seem to get that lying is what causes these issues but he makes it seem to everyone that I’m crazy and making things up and I’m just a bitch. I don’t know what to do anymore. I know I’m not the best person ever but certain behaviors I ended up mimicking to him so he could see how fucking shitty it feels to be treated the way he treat me and he doesn’t care.

246,"I know this is a common theme here on Reddit but I snooped through my sister’s phone with a purpose and found that she and a family friend are making fun of me and saying hurtful things. I see my sister almost daily.

My sister 27F and I 32F had some differences almost 10 years ago while we were both coming into adulthood. We both said some awful things to each other throughout these times. Now as very grown adults we have a close relationship and enjoy spending time together. She is best friends with a very judgmental 27M who is friends of the family. They bond by judging others and making fun of people so I know from past experience I am sometimes a topic of conversation. It’s unavoidable and inevitable. I thought by now that may have died down considering all the time that has passed and the fact that we have all grown to be more mature. I rarely fight with my sister anymore and when we do it’s a passing disagreement.

She left her phone open while she was over tonight to a text between them and I saw “she she she she”. Curiosity got the best of me and I looked. They started talking about me because I told my sister last night I thought it was absurd to spend $2000 getting her graduation party catered by a local food truck. I am more financially independent than her so my only thought in expressing my opinion was that we could throw a catered party for cheaper. They were calling me broke. Making fun of my car which is not as new as theirs. Saying they can’t wait until my sister buys new houses and new cars after she graduates because I will be so jealous. That I’m a loser. How dare I say something like that. Just going on and on because of my comment that was just an opinion.

My sister and my nephew still live with my dad. I am 100% independent but I’ve been nothing but supportive of her since the birth of my nephew. I don’t know what I’ve done to make her believe I am jealous or broke when I have built a great life for myself without the help of my father. I am smart and have since found a great career for myself and I love my own life. I help her out with my nephew all the time and I’m always at her beck and call. I really go out of my way for her. Part of my overcompensation with her comes because I know after all these years she forgets our two sided past arguments and holds a grudge with me for things I have said so long ago. She called me a statistic because I was a college drop out and in response I called her a statistic for being a teen mom. She only remembers one side of that conversation. I have apologized profusely over the years every time she has brought this up and about a year ago (last time she brought it up) I told her to stop because it’s been so many years and I have proven my love and loyalty to her over and over. That the grudge was getting really old and she sounds ridiculous even bringing it up because we have both said mean things to each other in the PAST. Regardless of all this I thought we just genuinely have a great relationship now and that we are past all of that. I see that is not the case and she still thinks awful things of me. I genuinely don’t think of her in any negative light but want to be accepted by her.

I tried to make this as cohesive as possible and I hope my point has gotten across. I’m looking for any advice on how to move forward or confront her and have her accept me. I am so sad I have to go to bed and hope to find some answers in the morning. I will respond then. Thanks everyone.",19Mar2020,1

To give you some context I am currently 18. Over the years I feel I have gone into a shell. I'm not super bad just a bit less sociable than the average person. Back when I was younger, probably up till like grade 8/9 - I did not give a fuck. I was seriously the funniest cunt and I would just do wild shit. I didn't actively pursue girls (usually), but I had probably like 10 girls who wanted to go out with me up till that time.

Then about that time I started becoming involved in drugs. I did not use too heavily but they did become centre of my life. I stopped talking to any girls pretty much, I lost a lot of my funniness and I just kind of became a bit of bitch (I don't think this is all the fault of drugs and they may too have been a side affect). Now apart from my ""nerd"" friends and some of my druggie friends - I'm the only virgin. I'm not horrible with girls but I'm far from good.

What can I do to get back like how I used to be? - Funnier, wilder, more sociable (not giving as much of a fuck)",19Mar2020,1

249,Hello reddit! I’ve been talking to this girl for a while now. We have mini conversations from time to time and snap each other everyday. I really like this girl and I think she is super nice and pretty. I’ve been wanting to tell her that she means a lot to me for a while now but I can’t bring myself to do it. Sometimes she leaves me on open and I am the one that usually has to keep the conversation going. I play Xbox sometimes with her younger brother and I thought it would be a good idea to tell him that I like his sister. He promised me that he wouldn’t tell. A day after he asked her if she liked me and she said no. I was thinking that maybe she said that because I was on a call with him and she was too embarrassed to admit the truth. I am really torn about what to do. Most of my friends and a few female friends have told me to just go for it and tell her how I feel. I don’t know how to tell her how I feel without sounding like a creep. I am 16M by the way. Thanks for the help.,19Mar2020,1
250,"So I met this girl on tinder (we are both 19) and we immediately clicked. And we have been talking/video chatting for a few days. We finally met today, and things were a tad awkward at first, but we really started talking. She kept sending me signals that she wanted to get more intimate. I don't know why but I just didn't go for it, I mean she is hella fine and yeah I really do want to smash and that is why I got tinder in the first place. I don't know why I didn't go through with it, all I had to do was to make the first move. And later after she left we were joking around and I joked about how I could tell she wanted to fuck,  and she said back yeah I was waiting for you to make the first move jokingly. I guess why didn't I go for it, I don't know what stopped me.",19Mar2020,1
251,"This is really stupid but here goes. I am 23M and things got a little dirty with a friend 24F a week ago. 3 days ago she texted me saying her period was 2 weeks late. I told her to get checked and see a doctor + take pregnancy tests immediately. The next day, I asked for updates since she said she would get it done the same day, but she did not reply. She has been actively avoiding my calls and texts.

The thing is, we didnt even have sex, not even close. Just heavy petting and a lot of fingering. I didnt even come. I did do some research and if i had gotten some preejaculate on my hands and fingered her, that could have a small chance of pregnancy.  

But the thing is, she is clinically depressed and anorexic and has been known to be very attention seeking so its possible shes just scaring me for attention or that her period is late for other reasons.   

I know the odds are that there is no cause for alarm, and that its just my anxiety kicking in. But between my depression and a couple of other stressors in my life right now i really cant relax. Could really use some advice or reaasurance. Thanks.",19Mar2020,1
252,"i (F17, if thats relevant ig), am flying halfway across the country on friday to escape my dad for a few weeks (he and his girlfriend are abusive, violent asshats) as my school has kicked us out of our dorms for Coronacation™️, so I made plans to escape with one of my friends to their dads property and live there for two weeks. I booked the flights, have cash and everything all planned out, I’m making a last run to the store tomorrow after work and packing everything up. The only thing is, I’m not entirely sure if my father knows I’m going or is okay with it. I asked if i could go last week and he said yes, but changed his mind as the coronavirus situation got more serious, which then triggered a huge argument that ended in him having a melt down and basically telling me to do whatever the fuck i want “since thats all you ever do anyways” so i took that as an invitation to book the flights, but we havent talked about it since. Now im debating if I should leave a note or just wait and see how long it takes for him to notice im gone. I feel comfortable banking on it being AT LEAST a day or two, and if im lucky i could make the whole trip without him noticing im gone or, even if he does notice, caring where im at. the other day I asked him to go meet a school friend and he said no bc of the virus, and then I just ended up leaving through the kitchen as he was sitting there, (he WATCHED me leave and didnt say or ask me anything about where i was going or what i was doing) and i continually checked my phone leading up to and after my “curfew” of 11pm and no word from him. I ended up coming home at two jn the morning that time and he didnt say a word to me about it or anything else for that matter. The only thing hes said since is asking me what i got my brother and i for dinner. So im not sure which is better because knowing my dad I might be able make this whole trip without saying a word, but hes extremely volatile and unpredictable so. also does my dad even deserve a note? the fact of my feeling unsafe in the home and him and his gf being absolute pieces of shit (normally phrased in a kinder manner) is a huge source of conflict for us and puts all sorts of strain on our already shitty relationship, so im worried if i leave a slightly dramatic “heres where ive gone and why, with all my love, joyousmushroom” im worried itll make it worse.

254,"hi. this is embarrassing. looking through all these comments, it seems like my issue is quite minor and doesn’t really deserve attention, but I’m desperate and I need guidance 

All my life I have been a simple person. I’m very outgoing, but satisfied with the few friends I had. I never needed much, because in my eyes, I had a lot. I didn’t really dress to impress, never really brushed my hair, wore the same worn Nike shirt. Like I said, simple. Over the years, friends have come and gone, but mostly the favorites have stuck with me. This year though, a lot of that changed. 

During the summer of 2019 I had a sudden decision to change my style of clothing, grow my hair out, and try and have a “glow up”. Not to sound cocky, but in my eyes, I definitely had a glow up. My hair is more tame, my clothes less worn. Blah blah blah, etc. I was quite happy with myself. First day of school a few of my classmates complimented me, it felt nice. Surprisingly though, my friends didn’t like it too much. 

Like me, my friends were simple people...and still are. At first, I don’t think they really noticed that I was was dressing differently, nor cared. But after a week of putting efforts into my outfits, they confronted me and said things like “are you really doing this?” and “I thought you were joking” 
I didn’t really notice it at first, after all, I was also questioning myself. But after a few more weeks of dressing differently I decided that I was going to keep it up. Because for once in my life, I actually felt pretty. 

So for the next few months, I experimented. And my friends didn’t like that either. They would start to insult my outfits, going as far as to publicly announce my outfit to our whole lunch table. Sucks that my boyfriend at the time also joined in on the fun. At sports practices, I found my best friend giggling it up with some of my other friends. When I asked what was so funny, my friend told me that she had told the whole group about my new “style”. It hurt. That night I went home and cried. Because the moment I started feeling good about myself, the people I trusted most turned on me. 

I mean you probably are thinking “why not just confront them about it” 
Back before all this crap happened, my friend group had certain “jobs” that you had to live up to. My one friend was the smart one, my other friend the “stupid one”. And I was the “comedian  or the wildcard” 
I guess part of my job was not to care what other people thought and to brush it off. And before all this, I would’ve. But I felt insulted by my friends, and hurt. 

Over the next few weeks it just got worse and worse. I started to admire one of the friend groups at my school, because they’re everything I want to be. Well dressed, confident, kind. So I’ve made and effort to talk to them. The other day I was talking to one of the girls in the group, and then walked back to my friend group. The first thing my best friend said to me was “do you seriously think your friends with them?” 
THAT hurt. 
Next day I came in to school with a nice looking outfit, my friend burst out laughing and continued to mock me for it the whole day. 

Reddit. My friends have never acted like this. We’ve always been a laid-back, drama free group full of laughter and support. But I don’t know what to do at this point. Suddenly my closest friends are relentlessly bullying me for something I deeply care about and everytime I try and stand up for myself, I am ridiculed for being uptight. I don’t want to come off as dramatic, so please give input on what it looks like from and outsiders view. 


Thank you for your time :)",19Mar2020,1
255,"AITA for yelling at my mom for guilt tripping me &amp; not respecting my decisions?

I (25F) live in a major city... and clearly things are not going well in the world right now. So long story short, my mom is afraid of what people will start doing when they’re backed into a corner because they’re scared of the virus, places closing &amp; being isolated in their homes. People can do some crazy stuff so I understand her concerns... but I work in the news &amp; that is considered essential during times of crisis. 
(In the 2 short years I’ve been in broadcast news I was in the middle of hurricane Florence working weather coverage when my station got evacuated &amp;amp; I lost a vehicle after my engine flooded out, yes I know turn around don’t drown, and had to spent 3 days with a very kind family of strangers after &amp; I also did coverage for Dorian.) 
Her concerns for my health &amp; safety are valid but she has not respected my decision to work until we can’t. (I am taking all the precautions set by the CDC besides working from home because we can’t.) Tonight I yelled at her for guilt tripping me into coming home. AITA? I sure feel like one. And now I’m questioning my decision to isolate away from my family &amp; continue to go to work... should I assume mom knows best or trust I can make decisions as a 25 year old?",19Mar2020,1

I guess it would be different if it was just one or two guys, but it seems like a lot of people. I don’t know where they’ve been y’know? I’m not really concerned about US getting the virus, it’s more about becoming a carrier and spreading it even more, potentially infecting people who are most at risk. It’s also the fact that I think it’s a little selfish; everyone has been told to try and keep social gatherings to a minimum so what makes you all special? Another thing, the kid who invited him had a fever not too long ago, so that’s great. I really don’t know what to think anymore.

262,"The stupid virus ruined everything good about my school year.Im on break indefinitely and I just feel super sad unless I can find something to distract me. Do you have anything to help? Here’s a list of everything the virus ruined.

1. The gym. I just started going to the gym as I am a bit overweight. Now I can’t go there anymore. I had fun there, too.

2. My friend. I cant talk to one of my closest friends. She’s a great person, and I wad just about to ask for her number. Now I cant see her for the foreseeable future.

3. My crush. I was just starting to talk to her more, but now I cant see her. I constantly get reminded of her from random things (seeing her name in words I read, having dreams about her, seeing things that remind me of her, etc.) and it really sucks.

4. The musical. We had a musical scheduled for May that we’ve been working on since like November. It was the highlight of my day. I had many friends in there, along with my crush. I hate not having that anymore.

5. My plan. I was going to confess my feelings to my crush. There are many details that make this plan impossible to do as it was intended. 

6. Hanging out with friends. I cant really go do anything fun because it’s all closed. Everything we would do besides hang out at one of their houses is closed. 

7. My favorite class. My musical theatre class has about 14 kids. It is the most supportive group of people I’ve ever known. They made me feel like I could do or say anything in there without getting judged. Now, that’s all over. Plus, the plan was gonna take place in that class in front of those people.

8. My birthday. I wanted to go camping with some of my friends (and my crush) for my birthday, but we will likely be on quarantine over my birthday. I’ve heard rumors that school will close for the rest of the year, and if that happens, I cant invite anyone I don’t have the phone number of, which is almost all the people I wanted to invite.

263,"pedophile: F

pedophiles friend: T

my friend: S

earlier today, i exposed a pedophile on reddit. somehow, someone found it and sent it to F and she went ballistic. her friend, T, dmed S saying whoever posted it needed to delete it. apparently F was having a mental breakdown over it and T was telling S there’s two sides to a story and all she had are accusations...

a month ago, S texts me saying F said she had feelings for her and T. F said she tried to forget about S but soon didn’t want to anymore, hence why she’s a pedophile. any time S would tell F to go away and stop texting her, F wouldn’t listen and text S anyway. F was clearly obsessed with S and it disgusted me and i had enough so i exposed her on reddit. 

also F’s youngest “friend” is 12 and is mainly friends with teenagers. F “doesn’t see age” and only sees the souls of the people she’s talking to (literally every pedophiles excuse). i’m so tired of this and i don’t want anyone to become victims like me and S were. i don’t want any more KIDS to feel obligated to be friends with her, especially the 12 year old. i’m so disgusted with F’s behavior, but like i said, F is suicidal. i don’t want to be the reason why F kills herself because she has a ton of friends that she’s basically brainwashed.",19Mar2020,1
264,"About 5 years ago, I had met this guy at school, I’ll call him TF (toxic friend). We really hit it off and considered each other best friends, and our friend groups being similar assisted in that. However, a few years later, when interacting one of our mutual friends who we both rode the bus to school with, he was always extremely hostile towards her. 
The reason for this was that once when we were all joking around, she let something slip about watching porn. We’re teenagers so it’s not like it was very shocking, but he and his family are very against that. That itself I don’t think is bad, beliefs are beliefs, but despite her apologizing (which I don’t think she should’ve had to) he seemed to make it his mission to bully her as much as possible. At the time I was a Christian and also was worried about popularity and such, so I didn’t step in and just tried to maintain friendships with both of them without disagreeing with either party. I was always uncomfortable when I was with both of them, and eventually even when I was just with him because of how much he complained about her, who he knew was my friend. He would ask questions like, “she’s such a *insult pretty much any insult here,* right?” 
About a month after this started, his mom pulled him out of school for online classes. I don’t know her reasons (but his mom is a very nice person so they were probably reasonable, please don’t blame her).
This made it a lot easier to stop talking to him, so when he started calling her derogatory names like whore and slut I cut it off completely and talked to my other friend about how she should stop talking to him too, as he had obviously started to take a bit of a toll on her mental state.
Among other things, this was the main reason I stopped talking to him. Recently though, about a year later, my friend posted on her Instagram story tagging a profile which I didn’t recognize. The username seemed like something TF would use, but I didn’t think my other friend would still be in contact with him, and a bunch of my friends were following the profile so I requested to follow it. Almost immediately, it was accepted and i got a dm asking how I’d been. I saw the pictures the profile posted and it was TF. I didn’t want to make it seem like I was purposely following him with the intent to unfollow once he realized, so I just went along with it. “I’m good man, how about you?” 
He said he was good. Then he said he missed me. Because I was close with a lot of friends/ex-friends of his, I know he’s still up to his usual antics. Up to this message I haven’t responded. I don’t want to make him feel like I want to be friends with him again, but I still think it would be harsh to unfollow now, even if he wasn’t a good person to my other friend. It’s likely that he’ll be back in school next year, so I don’t want to keep relations hostile as we still have a lot of friends in common and we would likely be together a lot, but I don’t want him to think I like him. What should I say/do?",19Mar2020,1
265,"I'm a US citizen and I've been traveling since around the time COVID-19 started to spread. I have quite a bit of travel experience but I've never met a challenge I couldn't overcome while traveling but I think I meet my match. So many flights are getting cancelled left and right. I keep having to rebook and my refunds won't process for two weeks+. I never worried about money while traveling but I'm getting really low on funds.

Do I beg a friend at home for money? Do I book a flight a few days out and stay longer? I do want to live in Thailand but in the next few years but if I could get a reasonable job and visa like right now, I wouldn't be against staying here.

 There are flights available but so many are getting cancelled that I don't think I can afford to waste more money. I do have friends that live here but I don't think I can stay with them.

266," 

i'm gonna try to keep this organized cos i know those big paragraphs are hard to read

some unnecessary drama caused by my best friend is what caused all this

we'll call him 500

i've been best friends with 500 for 6 years now, and this was the year we became freshmen in high school

it started out fine, and wasn't a very big adjustment for us

he got with one of the girls he became close with, but wasn't able to maintain the relationship, and she ended it

she talked to me way more than she did with him even during their relationship, and i ended up getting together with her

(i'm very happy with her and we've been going for 3 months but that's not the point here)

after they broke up, he developed a deep hate for her for no reason, and constantly insults her

he told me he would stop insulting her, because he knows it made me mad, but he only made it 2 weeks until he snapped and started doing it again

he's never said it to her face because he's actually a coward, and she knows about it but doesn't care very much

through her, i established a small friend circle with 4 other people, and they're great

but the problem is, 500 has targets on all of them for no reason

to give a little background, he's terribly insecure and was really offended when he found out that we had a group chat without him

they let him join, but all he did was spread toxicity in response to their nice gestures, and it resulted in him being kicked out

at the beginning of march, he told me he was ""tired of the disrespect, and has decided to be deliberately toxic to anyone who slightly offends him""

i think i should mention that he *is* bipolar, but he's purposefully rude to my friends regardless of if he's on a high or a low

what really set him off is that one of my friends has started dating 500's crush, and 500 doesn't understand that my friend wasn't trying to purposefully steal her from him

i have another smaller friend group, which is my partner and 2 other boys, and we were planning on watching a movie at one of the boy's house this saturday night

none of us want to be enemies with 500, especially me, so we decided to invite him

in response, he aggressively threatens my three friends and calls it a ""pity invite""

he then tells me, and only me, that if he does decide to go, he wants to just make it awkward for everyone and be toxic to us

i told my three friends all this and we told the boy's parents to not allow him to come

he says that he has a plan to get revenge on everyone who has wronged him, even though all of his ""targets'', a.k.a my close friends, have tried to make peace with him

this has all sprouted from him overreacting to small mistakes that he takes as great offences

he also refuses to admit that he is insecure, and the problem is that if he did, it would solve all of this

he thinks it's all okay between me and him because he's not targeting *me,* and doesn't understand that this is all greatly affecting me even though i've voiced my opinions to him several times

hence the title, i have no idea what he's planning to do to my friends, and i'm feeling constantly anxious every time i think about

i'd hate to have to cut him off for all this, but i see no end to it and if he keeps taking it further i'll have no choice

he's also been thinking about leaving our current high school next year, and while that would solve all of these problems, i'd like to keep him as my best friend

this has all become too much for me, and makes my generalized anxiety even worse

any and all advice will be considered and appreciated, and thank you very much you for your precious time.",19Mar2020,1

My friend texts me knowing that I have workout equipment asking to come over because his gym closed. I let him know that my mom said that I can’t have anyone over and that I could ask but the answer will probably be no. I call her and ask if he can come over and to my surprise she says yes. She said you two can also go in the backyard. Just don’t go in the house. I said okay cool. It was really nice because we’ve been in quarantine for the past 4 days and it would be good to see a friend. We talk and workout together. He asks if he can go in the house and fill up his water bottle and I said no, that I’d have to do it for you. He says okay, and I do it for him. He then asks to use the bathroom and I said no, sorry. He goes around to the side yard to do his business and gets his hand sanitizer from his bag. He then suggests that we get burritos. So we go out to the one place still open, get burritos for takeout (because dining is banned) and we come back to my house. My mom had said earlier that we can go to the backyard so I thought we could just take the 7 steps from the garage door to the backyard through the house. I told my friend not to touch anything. That only I can open the doors. He said okay and we walked through the house just to get to the backyard. We eat our burritos and walk back through. I made sure he didn’t touch anything. He leaves and I go on with being bored again. My mom gets back and said asked if I followed the rules. I said yes except we just walked through the house to eat our burritos in the backyard. I made sure he didn’t touch anything though! And that I was very careful about it. She was fine with it, at first. She decided to change her mind about it and that I let “my dirty friend trample through the house”. She said that I didn’t “have the balls” to stand up to my friend and say no to him. Even though that’s what I did earlier and it was MY IDEA to just walk through the house. (She was under the impression that it was his idea.) We get into a massive argument and she said that I can’t sleep in my room tonight, she’s talking away my computer (that I bought), my phone (that I bought), and the car. She also said “If there wasn’t a pandemic I’d kick you out on the street.” She said I don’t understand what I did wrong, but I said I clearly do. I understand that I disrespected her rules about letting him in the house, but my point is that she’s overreacting and grounding me on unfair premises. She is claiming that I couldn’t say no to my friends request (it was my idea) that I don’t understand why what I did was wrong. I do, 100%. We just had a screaming argument and I can’t change her mind about anything tonight. I don’t know what to hope for.

278,"Ever since I can remember I have always been too scared to speak up and talk to people. I have enough friends, but eventually run out of things to say, so I feel like I make the friendship boring after a while. I want to make new friends but I feel like I have nothing to say to people and bring nothing to the table. I can't talk in classes, idk why. It's not the fear of rejection (at least I think). I just have nothing to say. I'm an incredibly boring person. I don't have any real interests so I don't know what clubs to join to meet people. Not to mention I really just cannot make myself appealing to girls. I assume most girls want someone who can hold a half decent conversation.

280,"We run 2 before and after childcare centers and have had to shutdown as of Monday. Best case it’s looking like we can reopen the beginning of May. Worst case is if we are closed last June. At that point we will be forced to shut down as we are completely parent supported and will be depleted of funds as we have to pay rent, current payroll and then payout sick pay to our staff. 

Bottom line if this happens and when the workforce is returning to normal:
We won’t have jobs (36 staff)
150+ working families will lose their childcare 

I understand we are merely one of countless companies facing a highly uncertain future but to be able to inform staff and parents that no layoffs off of staff would be occurring (this is important as hiring new staff takes a lot of time due to background clearances) and that we would be fully and immediately operational once we are given the all clear would have such a huge positive trickle effect throughout the community.

291,"Honestly, I’ve never had to deal with a HUGE decision being set before me that determines the rest of my life. But here I am now, stuck between two college options. 

An important thing to keep in mind which makes my decision even more difficult: 

These two colleges would cost almost the exact same amount and they both offer the major in which I am interested. 

I would love advice from people who have been through college or also faced a tough decision regarding college choices. 

Background: I come from an extremely small private, classical, Christian school. I have been there from kindergarten through 12th grade. My graduating class has 10 people. I’ve only ever known life in a tiny Christian school. My family is full of devout Christians. They are not by any means requiring me to go to a Christian college, but they encourage it because it will be easier to find a good group of solid Christian friends. 

The first college is a small (~15,000) private, Christian college. 

My great aunt, my grandfather, my grandmother, my mother, and my brother have all attended this college. The love of this college runs DEEP within my mom’s side of the family. 

Pros: 

• I would have a class size closer to what I consider normal and am used to from my primary education
• I would continue to receive a solid private education (likely a slightly better education than my other option)
• I would make a lot of my family happy 
• I would be near my brother in case of emergencies 
• The school is about an hour and a half away from home
• I would be surrounded by good Christian influences, which would benefit me personally as well as give my parents more of a peace of mind

Cons:

• The dorms are small, dirty, and ugly
• I don’t have as much of a desire to be there as I do regarding the other school
• As a private school, there is much more of a “snooty”/“daddy’s money” atmosphere 
• I don’t necessarily want to be at the same university as my brother 
• After visiting on three separate occasions, it really did not feel like an atmosphere in which I would thrive (However, this might be due to the fact that I was always around my brother and his friends. He is extremely extroverted, as are all of his friends, while I am not.)

The second college is a huge (68,000) public college. However, don’t think of a normal public college. This school is more competitive than a lot of private schools and is viewed in a higher category than typical public colleges because of its academics and quality of campus life. 

Pros:

• I have only heard good things about it from friends and other people I happen to meet
• My dad loves the school and almost ended up there himself. He always wanted his kids to be there and made us love the school from a very young age
• The dorms are much cleaner, nicer, larger, etc (which is important for a more introverted person like myself who is likely to spend a greater amount of time there than the normal student)
• The average person here is what many would call a “good ole country boy”. They’re hard workers, loyal, raised right. I value having these kinds of friends
• I have a greater desire to be here
• Social networking as a graduate of this university is extremely easy. Just flash the school’s ring and you get the job if your interviewer happened to graduate from the same school. 

Cons:

• I would be receiving a public education in large, less intimate classes when I could be receiving a private education for the same price
• The campus is huge and the classes are much bigger, which I am not used to at all
• I would break the legacy of family members who have attended the other college and I would let down everyone else who wants me to be at the other college
• The school is about three and a half hours away from home
• Not everyone around me is Christian (However, I don’t think it would be too hard to find a group of Christians at a school of 68,000)

I have so many different people telling me to do so many different things. Part of me feels like it’s extremely unwise to go to a public school when I have the option to go to a private school for the same price. Another part of me thinks I want a change from what I’ve known for the past thirteen years. There are so many variables, and I know I’m letting someone down no matter what I choose. My parents have been great to remind me that they’ll support me no matter what, but I still know what they each want for me. 

What would you all do?",19Mar2020,1

297,"Hi! Before I start, I would like to say I'm aware that none of us know what this guy's true intentions were unless I ask. I'm just wondering what other people think.

Long story short, I \[21F\] met him \[21M\] my freshman year college and it was obvious that he wanted to get to know me from the very beginning. He eventually became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he showed up with hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what he wanted and he said he didn't want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year, nothing really happened. He made the effort to hang out with me here and there, but we never actually hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to talk a lot through Snap and he tagged me on stuff on Facebook. When classes began, he immediately asked me to chill the very first week. This became a consistent thing throughout the school year. Every time we hung out, he tried to hold my hand. Some things he did that made me think he wanted a relationship was: he would always pay for my coffee, bought wine a couple of times so we could drink it together in our dorms, bought and cooked me food (dude specifically bought me steak too cause i asked for it), bought me a bottle for my birthday after I jokingly asked for one, asked to chill in the city and Facetime over winter break. First semester, we were both at two parties together and usually he hooks up with other girls but both times he just stayed with me throughout the party. One party, I was dancing with another guy and it was obvious that he was mad but didn't say anything. Not only that, second semester, I had a birthday party and he bought me a bottle. I got drunk and was apparently touchy with his friends. The next day, his friend told me that I was touchy with them and that he looked mad stressed when I did that. Anyways, last week was basically our last week of college because of everything being moved online do to the coronavirus. He asked to hangout because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, once again he pays and tries to hold my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. He then asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no and he asks why. I know I should've asked what his intentions were then but I just couldn't so I said that I wasn't good at this physical stuff and he kept saying that it was fine and he didn't care. I said I'm only comfortable with being kissed on the cheek so he kisses me on the cheek and neck for a little bit and then we cuddle for 2 hours (this is the most physical we got all year). Later that night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he'll be coming too. He comes, we're both on the dancefloor, I dance with my guy friends, and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

So did he want to just hook up with me or did he want an actual relationship? I'm confused because he spent so much time and effort throughout the year to hangout with me -- but just for a hookup? Anyways, I feel like if he really wanted a relationship with me he would make the effort to make his intentions more clear and would reach out first. What do you think?",19Mar2020,1
298,"My boyfriend told me he’s going camping with some friends this weekend which I don’t really think is a good idea. I guess it would be different if it was just one or two guys, but it seems like a lot of people. I don’t know where they’ve been y’know? I’m not really concerned about US getting the virus, it’s more about becoming a carrier and spreading it even more, potentially infecting people who are most at risk. It’s also the fact that I think it’s a little selfish; everyone has been told to try and keep social gatherings to a minimum so what makes you all special? Another thing, the kid who invited him had a fever not too long ago, so that’s also cool. Things would be different if it was with people he knew really well contained if someones house, but going out into a public area with a bunch of people he hasn’t talked to in a REALLY long time? I really don’t know what to think anymore. Is the media blowing this out of proportion or should everyone really be doing some social distancing? Am I over reacting and should I just let it go?

299,"So I (22M)had this friend (also 22M, we'll call him D)who I have been knowing since I was in the 4th grade but last year I decided to cut him off for constantly making moves on my now current fiance. I did not talk to D for the entire time but after a year we decided to talk things out and I made the mistake of completely forgiving him without creating any boundaries. 

It has not even been a year and he went back to his old ways. This guy tried talking my fiance into going into the bathroom while he was in the shower multiple times. He also decided to describe a dream he had of both of them to having sex. D currently had girlfriend throughout all of this. When my fiance told me this I was both livid and hurt to know that he did this again.

He is still cut off but the problem is that my other friends keep defending him and saying that he isn't that type of person. My friends also keep talking among eachother and bring up the subject of cutting me off. I'll admit I'm not the most amazing friend, I do have my flaws, but I definitely am not hitting or trying to do stuff with my other friends S/O. 

My friend who keeps defending him (we'll call him bill) has the mindset that he can do no wrong despite literally seen it unfold. To add another point, awhile back me and my fiance had a big problem that led to a temporary break up and I confided in Bill for support and some guidance. I told him that I didn't want him to tell anyone and that it was just between me and him. Not a day later the asshole lets one of our other friends know. At first it bothered me but I just saw it as another person that could help.


Now yesterday my fiance decided to tell my D's girlfriend all the creepy shit he had done to her only for D's girlfriend to throw back at her telling her things like ""why did you hang out withhim in the first place?!?"" and ""Why the hell didn't you ever tell me this?"". Now my fiance has reasons why she did not tell her immediatly that are personal, D however never said anything because he knew he would be in some deep shit. I also found out from that conversation that Bill had also told D and his girlfriend about my relationship problems and I felt extremely stupid to think I could trust him. 

Now I feel terrible right now, I feel like I have no friends and these were people I have been knowing since I was 10. Currently I do nothing but work, stay home, go to school and hang out with my fiance, but this situation just makes me feel like maybe I was never really a good friend. I'm scared to make new friends because I simply don't know how and scared to think this could happen again.

TL;DR My friend was putting the moves on my fiance and my other friends are defending him.",19Mar2020,1

My boyfriend of nearly 2 years and I are both transferring to the same college for the upcoming semester and are looking to room in the same place. However, the people he was staying with (close friend of the family) are selling the house and he is basically homeless. He can’t afford an apartment on his own with his current job and the hours he works due to being a student. If he can’t find a friend to rent an apartment with soon then he will be homeless for the last few months that remain in the semester as well as during the summer. I tried asking my parents if they would let him stay at our house, but ultimately the answer was no. I love him very much and the last thing I want to see is him leaving to the army due to not being able to find a place to stay or a place he can afford. He currently goes to UHD, so an apartment near that area would be ideal. If anyone has any information on cheap apartments that are still somewhat decent or any websites that I can use to try and find him a house/apartment to rent for a reasonable price it would be incredibly appreciated.

I was sitting on the floor by the dining table, with my head in my hands. And my mother lost her temper and hit me repeatedly while asking me to die, and then she dragged me across the floor and threw me into my room. And at this point, I was crying really really loud because of the physical and emotional pain. To shut me up, she slapped her hand over my mouth and I couldn't breathe for a moment.

I also honestly slacked off in the beginning of the Fall when I had settled on a topic. I don’t know why I wasn’t pushing myself earlier.

To make things worse I’ve told my advisor that things have been going okay and that I’m near done with data collection. And now my campus and lab is closed because of Covid-19, and I only have about half of what I need. 

To make things even worse, I broke the machine that I was using for my experiments. I was working late and in a rush and made a careless mistake and now I feel like a complete failure. I know all of this could be avoided and I shouldn’t have lied to my advisor. 

The machine can be fixed but it will take some time and we have to call in a technician. But other people use this machine to and I feel awful for wasting our grant money.

He’s going to lose all respect/trust but i have to talk to him I just don’t know how.

Thank you for listening to my late night rant. 

TL;DR, liked to my advisor about my progress and now i have to come clean.",19Mar2020,1
305,"I have recently come to the realization that I tend to go crazy and fixate on little (or big) thinks that inconvenience my life. I can’t let annoyances go and tend to overthink A LOT. 

Little things like not getting replied back. Not knowing how to word texts is also frustrating. I just get really anxious and frustrated. 

My partner pointed this out to me when one day I was overthinking a text I had sent to my boss about calling off (because I have a viral infection). It was so hectic. I didn’t even realize that I’ve been doing this all my life. Like when I can’t find something in my room or something dumb like that. 

I also get so infuriated easily. I dislike things quickly (because I fixate on it so much that I just keep having an emotional response to it, where eventually, I will just resent whatever is causing it). It’s making me feel like everything in my life is out of control. I also don’t do anything to help myself be better, but I honestly don’t know how. 

If anyone can offer some advice I’d really appreciate it!",19Mar2020,1

311," 

32, male, relatively healthy (recreational bodybuilder so I exercise often and eat healthy), recently came down with a respiratory sickness just before all this coronavirus craze causing hospitals to get swamped.

Basically a couple weeks ago my son fell sick so we took him to the doctor. He tested positive for mycoplasma and so they gave him an antibiotic to treat him in case he'd develop walking pnumonia. Then, my other son catches it as well and is treated for it.

Fast forward to a week ago and now I've come down with a sickness, which I'm assuming is what they had. It started with a low grade fever (99.5), severe body aches and a hacking cough that could be relentless at times. I haven't been to an actual doctor in a very long time, so I don't have a GP and I also don't have any health insurance, so I wasn't sure what to do, so I decided ""fuck it, I'll ride it out and try to recover on my own"".

Over the last few days I've gotten SLIGHTLY better. I don't always run fever anymore and I don't have body aches at all, which is a huge plus. I still have overall fatigue but the cough is still here, if not worse. My chest is starting to feel tight (could be from all the coughing I've been doing) and the base of my throat always feels ""full"" and ""wet"", like mucus is sitting there. When I cough it moves around but rarely comes all the way up. I don't have any shortness of breath, no difficulty breathing what so ever and no chest pain other than general stiffness that I think is just from coughing so much.

Now enter all this coronavirus craze and hospitals being swamped, I'm not sure what I should do. I'm 99% sure (I'm not doctor ;)) I don't have the coronavirus and I have improved SOMEWHAT, but this is day 7 of being sick and I'm a bit afraid of pneumonia. Should I just go to an ER deal with the bill I get sent later (aka ignore it, sadly)?

I'm not sure if this fear is rational, but I'm afraid to go out and catch coronavirus on top of what I already have.",19Mar2020,1
312,"Almost a year ago I dropped someone because they wouldn't let me talk to, or have fun with friends they introduced me to and they'd always keep me, and isolate me from the rest. With the courage and help of the friends my toxic ex friend introduced me to (let's call them A) they helped me get rid of A and in turn it helped with me making my own decisions and ruling how I wanted my life to go. A, however keeps trying. Every month or so they come back into my instagram dm's in NEW accounts trying to talk to me, and when I politely reject them they always turn on me suddenly and talk crap about me to random people online. A even gets their friends to harrass me and it's honestly such a burden. A has approached me at school multiple times and has made multiple threats in the past to hurt me when I didn't comply when it came to being their friend again. I don't wanna be their friend because when we were friends they dictated everything I did and I couldn't make my own decisions. And if i even try to talk it out with A, they're gonna make me feel bad, harass me and make new accounts in hopes of me trying to talk to them. It's such a burden because whenever A comes around in my dms, they make me feel bad about myself, spread lies about me around at school AND online, and gets their friends to harass me. I know it may not seem that important but how do I get this over with already? What do I do and say? It's weighing on me and some of the stuff these people say really hurts me.",19Mar2020,1
313,"TLDR: My Dad is supposedly a changed man from when he abused me 6 years ago and I’m torn between seeing him again for the first time in 6 years to see if a new relationship is possible, at risk of it backfiring horribly, or just move on and hope that my siblings and I never have to be around him again.

I need some advice from an outside party, as everyone I know is too close to the situation to give me a clear response. I myself am very torn about the whole situation and am often left in tears, so I just don’t think about it. Even if no one sees this or it gets taken down, that’s okay, because maybe at least I can feel a little better for now.
For a little background information I’m 19F. My Dad abused me between the ages of 12 and 14 years old, so a little over two years on and off. At the time I didn’t realize this was wrong, I was still super innocent and I just didn’t want to hurt my dad’s feelings, as we were really close otherwise and I told him everything. I finally realized that something was wrong when I let slip to one of my youth pastors that my dad had been touching me. The next time I went to youth group I saw the police through the glass doors and immediately thought, “They’re here for me.”
I talked to three different police officers that night in the prayer room, by myself, even getting on my hand and knees to demonstrate a question they had asked at one point... yeah... They arrested my dad when he came to pick me up at the end of the night. That’s the last time I saw him.
He spent a couple days in jail until my mom paid bail. Basically after some court stuff, he had to start probation that usually takes 8-10 years to complete, but could be quicker or longer depending on how well he rehabilitates. 
Since then we had to sell over 2/3s of everything we owned, my dad lost his job and my mom was a stay at home mom. We had no money to stay so my mom, three siblings (who were never abused) and I all moved states to live with family until my mom could get a job. My Dad could not leave the state the abuse occurred in.
For 4 years, I had severe depression and PTSD, but worked to get better along with the idea to eventually reunify the family. My mom had no idea this had happened and has supported us kids as much as she possibly could by herself. However, she also is still married and has only entertained the idea of divorce once when he lied to her for months about breaking his parole (looking at porn and somehow cheating the lie detector tests?), which caused him to nearly go to prison and he had to restart 5+ years of probation. My mom has been very faithful to him and for a long time, it hurt me, but I thought it was the right thing to do. I thought that we were supposed be a family again some day. 
A couple months after I turned 18 I moved out with my boyfriend (now fiancé) and his small family. I started to question more and more things like, how my counselors helped me, even when looking back I could see they didn’t want him back in my life. I can see now that just because my mom wants him back doesn’t mean that it is safe for my siblings or that he is what’s best for her. I started to get more points of view than just her’s and now I hate my dad with a passion and am even more protective of my siblings, especially if somehow he completes his probation and can live with my family again. 
Still, I miss my dad so much. I’ve been told by many people that he found God and is better, but is almost the same man that he was 6 years ago. That both makes me happy and terrifies me. Besides the abuse he was one of the best dad’s you could ask for and the person I trusted and related to the most. I feel like he missed out on so much of our lives, and I’m a different person now. I cry that he is missing everything and I avoid anything to do with father’s because it just makes me sad or angry that I can’t do anything about this. This was his choice...

I guess my question is, now that I’m over 18 and I’m legally allowed to attempt contact with him, should I risk it? I cry myself to sleep sometimes thinking that he has missed over half of my sister’s life, can never be there for my brothers or Mom, and will never walk me down the aisle. I miss him so much, but sometimes I wonder if it would be better to pretend the father I had is dead? I’m torn between moving on and possibly never getting the closure I feel like I need versus letting him back into my life in which case he could have changed for the better or it could ruin me again... Thank you so much for your time and for any advice you have!",19Mar2020,1
314,"We were friends at first for a few months but somehow we started getting really close probably because our friends started teasing the two of us together as a joke. Anyway I ended up falling in love with her. Every moment with her is just amazing and I can't get enough. But it seems I'm stuck. By now I know her so well that I know she doesn't want a bf. She wants to date only for marriage and she doesn't like touchy touchy stuff until then. 
She says that when she is older and thinks it's time for marriage she'll hope whoever she is thinking of ,is also thinking about her and maybe she'll start dating then. 
Although when she's with me she actually is quite touchy touchy. We play around so much with each other(non sexually but touchy touchy). She steals my phone and then turns the other side so that I hug her while trying to get my phone back and she always acts cute with me acc to our friends. We can make each other laugh till our stomachs hurt every single day. We can call and talk for hours. Sometimes we stay out all night and just sit and talk to each other in the park. And all our mutual friends want us to be together because we're just so compatible. Moreover. We're both in a Medical College (we're both 19 because in my country that's when you enter the medical field ) and we like studying together which is such a huge plus point. Although sometimes she studies with this other guy that she claims to not like in a romantic way at all. 

The thing is. Her friend,who has been very close to her for a very very long time told me that she has been doing this for a while now to a number of guys. She gets extremely close to a guy and the guy ends up falling for her. But she will never so much as even like him back in a romantic way. She's never had a boyfriend no matter how many guys she's been close to. She's had crushes but her crushes disappeared when they started liking her back. 
I've concluded that she's either asexual or she's just a serial bestfriend-zoner 
I'm kinda frustrated now. She's just so perfect and exactly my dream girl. But I am unable to advance beyond where I am. 
I have 2 choices. Either I stick to this and maybe eventually she'll realise she likes me back. Or I should try and move on and start dating other people. 
The thing is. I'm worried if I start dating other people I may lose my chances with this one forever. Shes the kind of girl I'd want to get married to.

323,"There’s been conflict between me and my mother going on for years. I know I have been lied to and manipulated and have caught her in many lies. However always come back to having good intentions or that they were a necessary evil. That’s the part that I really need confirmation of because only recently have I began to doubt her intentions because It’s gotten to the point that I really am having severe anxiety and paranoia and I suspect that she researched how to brainwash me through gas lighting and creating cognitive dissonance in me, my relationships with others, and many other aspects of my life. I really hate to cut off all contact with her both because of what that would do to me and I know it would hurt her as well but it’s getting to the point that I really doubt myself, my future, and my health both physically and psychologically deteriorating to a point of no return. The polygraph services I have looked at in my city require either law enforcement or a psychiatrist ordering them and while we have discussed mediation, she will not go to one that she has not chosen herself. There were other mediators we tried although they weren’t professionals, and because some were biased and others were disregarded when they did not agree with her, leaves me unable to continue going to another of her choosing without at least having results of a polygraph before hand available to me because I know she has lied and would have no problem doing it again so that she can win in this war. I realize that in itself should be enough to tell me what I suspect however the question I want answered honestly is if she is fully aware of what harm she’s causing me, and if she truly thinks it’s worth the cost that the lies have made me endure. I know this is complex and may not be exactly clear as well as it probably sounds like I’m in denial myself of what should be clearly evident but if still like to know that I tried every option before having to resort to cutting a toxic family member out of my life in self preservation.",19Mar2020,1
324,"My (23f) boyfriend(21m) has been open with me about things that have been happening. These past 2 nights two of his exes had contacted him. One of these was from a relationship that was ended after she was unfaithful, let's call her L for clarification. The other one who contacted him is actually the ex from the relationship before mine, which was mutually ended and they were capable of being friends although they had drifted apart by the time we started dating. We will call her A. I'll get to the third girl in a moment as she's a bigger issue.

L was very straightforward when she contacted my bf and immediately asked him if he was seeing anyone. Upon confirmation that he was she got mopey saying things like ""OF COURSE you'd be seeing someone as soon as I'm single."" And ""Would you give her up for me?"". She git shut down really quickly and promptly blocked. So I doubt L will be a future problem.

A I worry a bit more about considering the fact that they were friends. She wasnt as open about what was going on as L but there were hints and her saying she hope they could get close again.

As for the third girl, we will call her K. K is 16 years old and is the little sister of a friend of my bf. She has a massive crush on my bf to the point of stalking him. She has popped up at his university for no reason, constantly texts my bf and gets upset with him if he doesnt reply fast enough. She will call him pet names, talk about things as if they are dating. My bf has nicely told her he's not interested as well as being more aggressive (read as literally telling her ""f*** off"" to which she responded as if it was some joke). He has made it clear that he isn't interested in her and that he has a girlfriend, but since she's still in highschool with the mentality of a common hs girl, she believes this is just a lie and a way of trying to avoid her. Despite that there are photos and such of us together. She believes I'm just a female friend who is helping him out by pulling off this ruse for the ""lie"" he is telling. He has blocked her number and she just keeps getting a new sim with a new number each time to keep messaging him. We've even gotten K's brother involved in trying to stop her bs but this girl is persistent and it's starting to take a toll on me.

I trust my bf a lot. Our relationship is transparent and we have no issue showing the other one things like above to keep things levelled. But with all of this happening at once it's making me question whether I am good enough or not. I was stuck in an abusive relationship for two years- this was with an ex- and while it wasn't a physically abusive relationship, it consisted of a lot of mental and emotional manipulation and abuse. I was constantly reminded how little I meant and how he didn't really care much for what I was or what I had to say. I'm starting to feel scared that my ex was correct and that my current bf will come to think the same or have feelings for one of these other girls.

I'm not sure on how to control this fear anymore. I have voiced it to my bf and he is supportive af and tries to reassure me. He knows it's getting me down and it makes him feel guilty since hd believes it's his fault. I don't want to be constantly worried and down about this because it's affecting him too.

326,"Alright, i'm just gonna cut straight to the chase here. About half an hour ago (around 1:30 AM), I noticed a car parked on the street next to the path leading to my driveway. My bedroom is in the attic, and I am unable to put up curtains, so it's extremely easy to see into my room at night if I have the lights on. Anyway, I notice this car sitting in the street, so I turn off all my lights and watch it for a while. It sits there for about another ten minutes before turning around and driving off. Afterwards, I call up my mom and tell her about the car. Apparently she had seen something similar a few days ago, only it was in the middle of the day. A car parked in the same spot, which then drove off after she closed all the curtains. I unfortunately don't know if the car I just saw was the same one, since it was too dark for me to make out what kind of car it was. The only thing I could see was the headlights.

But wait, there's more! Every so often (for like, maybe the past two or three months?), I see the light of someone using a flashlight in that exact same spot. Usually aimed at the ground or the woods next to my house, but occasionally pointing towards the house and even in my window. It's not bright enough to actually light up my room at all, just reflects off the glass, so it never spooked me that much. I live in a small but relatively safe tourist town, so I'm not the most hypervigilant person in the world. Guess that's why it took me this long to realize that the whole flashlight thing was fishy. So, I have three theories as to what could be going on.

1. I'm just being paranoid and it's dumb tourists stopping to look up directions, or teenagers looking for somewhere to stop and smoke weed.
2. There is in fact someone scoping out my house to try to potentially rob it. 
3. This one is a long shot, but it's potentially my father. Without getting into too much detail, him and my mom divorced, and he was abusive towards me for basically my whole childhood. Since the divorce, my mom and I have been fighting him in court to keep him away from my siblings. But until that's over and done with, he's allowed to see my siblings weekly. He's also a sociopath (literally), and he definitely has a few screws loose, which is why i'm adding him to my suspicions. Again, I don't think this is the case, but better safe than sorry.",19Mar2020,1

329,"Hello, 

I am a 22 year guy from the Midwest finishing up my senior year at university, or what is left of it anyways.

I am currently finding myself in tough situation and have consulted my parents and friends on this situation but still cannot decide for myself what the hell i should do.

My girl friend and I have been together for about 7 years now. We have been doing long distance for all of college and are wrapping up our senior years. 

The situation is that while on my gf’s spring break she was hanging out with her friends at her friends school and found out last Friday that a guy had tested positive for covid19. They were not hanging out with the guy nor knew who he was until my gf’s friend got an email from her school explaining where he had been the last couple of days. 

She then in the next couple of days found her way back to the state where she currently goes to school and lives. 

the university I go to is not on spring break until this up coming weekend so during this time I was still doing school stuff, still am, and figuring out what I’m going to do. 

She is currently in self isolation because she has been exposed in her apartment at school. However, one of the friends she was with while on spring break got tested for corona virus and it came back negative. But she is still self isolating to be safe.

So currently, my gf is wanting me to get a flight before they shut down domestic air travel and wait out the inevitable lock down in the US for this pandemic going on. But I am quite hesitant. And I feel really terrible about it. But I don’t really want to go while all this stuff with virus is going on and being crazy. 

But on the other hand I want to see my girl friend, and be with her during this madness. 

Another thing worth noting is that even if she isn’t infected, or showing symptoms she can pass it along to me, which means I’ll have to isolate myself for two weeks once I get back home, before I see my parents, grandparents, and my soon to be born infant nephew. 

This is all really stressful stuff, and I’m loosing a lot of sleep over it. I would really appreciate any sort of help, or input I can get.

Sorry for making this so long. But thank you so much for taking the time to the read this, and giving me your input.

331,"Hey, hoping someone can offer me some advice as I am currently pretty sure I am going to go ahead and exercise this right but just want to make sure I am not making a mistake.

So, I work in a medical manufacturing facility, we make all kinds of products that are used in hospitals around the world such as oxygen masks etc. As such we have been deemed as ""Essential Services"", cool. I totally get that. However, here is the part that I am having trouble with, currently the product that I work on almost exclusively is absolutely not an essential service, it is a luxury item that you would buy on Amazon etc. Not medical. This is not an essential service by any means. 

The problem is, my workplace has around 300+ staff members and we are all being stuck together for certain periods of time. They are trying to enforce the social distancing advice but obviously it is pretty impossible and we are in close quarters for a lot of the shift. Management is also not enforcing the PPE that has been provided leaving me to be one of about five people in the whole plant actually using it (and getting made fun of for it).

Honestly, I really want to just say fuck this, it is a regular factory wage job and there is absoloutley no necessity for the product I am working on.

333,"I screwed up today and lost my job(I'm living with my parents do I don't have to worry too much about rent and stuff thankfully). Once I got over the shock and calmed down I was able to negotiate to be able to call back in 2 weeks to maybe get it back. But that's just it a maybe.

I know I should have hope since that's more than most people get and if they didn't want me back they would have straight up kicked me out.

But....I can't let myself hope. If I hope it's gonna sting more if I don't get my job back. Some of my friends disagree but I'd rather get my expectations low and feel better if I do get my job back than feel assured I'm getting it back and be crushed utterly.

I can't stop thinking about what happened today though. All the ways It could have been prevented, what I could have said, have done. The day's events repeat themselves in my mind taunting me mocking me over the fact I can't go back and change it even though I want to.

Nothing feels right...food has no taste, I can't find joy in the things I used to love, all my plans are gone not just because of this virus but because of the fact all the plans revolved around my paychecks, my mom tells me the best thing I can do is distract myself but like I said I can't find joy in anything. Most of my friends aren't night owls like me so they're asleep when I need company the most, I feel alone. I'm a failure...a screw-up.

The same thoughts keep repeating in my head...over and over and over again. I can't stop worrying about the future. In a time when I need to be positive...

When I confronted them about it, they were mad at me for finding out about it. They thought that because they discussed it all last week it shouldnt be argued about again. Its one thing to have complaints about my boyfriend, but its a whole other thing if my friends were sharing these complaints with other friends who have never met my boyfriend, in a gc I was not in. Im still upset by the fact I only learned about it from someone's ex. It could have been more accepting if one of my friend confessed to the chat but they planned on never telling me. I have sinced stop talking to all of them, and have blocked them on all social media. The only thing that won't let them go is my heart.

As of monday they have been frustratingly vague about their quarantine procedure. Found out today that they are moving everything online. That means online written work out routines, with the possibility of never returning to the studio. Maybe some random small group work outs here and there (nothing properly scheduled). The gym is run by 2 personal trainers whom I've been very happy with. Is it wrong that I asked to be refunded? I paid for the trainers time, the studio space and use of thier equipment not written online work outs... they told me the money has gone to rent and is non refundable. I'm tempted to dispute it with my credit card company.
They said that they will think about offering one on one sessions after 2 weeks.... I feel really shitty, I built a relationship with them over the year but I didnt pay for online classes. Am I in the wrong for wanting my money back?

He thinks the idea of foreplay to get me really is so much work. He will have sex eventually but it takes so much convincing and even then its all about his pleasure and the aim is it finish as soon as possible. I know he enjoys sex you can see it in his face.

344,"TL;DR at bottom

With the coronavirus now a global outbreak that has devastated many by taking us out of school, as well as taking our jobs, paychecks and even some lives, many are bashing the year, 2020, saying this isn’t the year they wanted. But it doesn’t have to be that way. There hasn’t been a year, in history, where nothing went wrong as there is always a problem somewhere. 

We’re only in the third month of the entire year, so there is plenty of time for us to have a great year, even now. Yes, it sucks having to deal with many businesses being closed, and a lot of last minute cancellations of annual events and vacations, but on the bright side we have the most precious thing we can possess, our lives, and now have ample time to essentially do anything. While we are caught up in our lives, many would always say, “If the day had X more hours, I could get [insert tasks/responsibilities] done”. Well now we have that chance.

Whatever it is you’ve been putting off because you haven’t had time, you probably have time to do now. If you’ve been meaning it reorganize your closet, but never got to it, take the time to do that. With spring right around the corner, take this time to spring clean your home. Or if you’re someone who follows the *new year, new me* philosophy, take this time learning to cook new and healthy recipes and perfect it to your liking. The world is your gym, you don’t need to go to an actual gym to get/stay in shape. For example, do wall sits while you’re browsing Netflix, or some push-ups every time an episode ends. The possibilities are endless. Social distancing doesn’t have to be boring, you can be just as productive as you were before the pandemic. 

Remaining productive, while practicing social distancing during these trying times will not only benefit us individually, but also put others less at risk. 

TL;DR- 2020 does not have to be a bad year with the coronavirus outbreak sweeping many nations. With social distancing as a temporary norm due to the cancellation and closures of many events and businesses, we should use this ample time to work on ourselves and engage in the activities we’ve never had time for or that interests us.",19Mar2020,1
345,"A couple weeks ago my girl friend (let’s call her Jane) became very good friends with another girl (let’s call her Molly). My girlfriend has a really hard time making friends and doesn’t interact with many a lot of people as she is super shy. My girlfriend was super excited that she finally gotten a friend that she can be good friends with (as she has a rough past with relationships and people she used to call friends) so Jane spent time talking and hanging out with Molly. Jane was talking to me and telling me how she feels like she is able to get out of her shell again and become more trusting with her new found friends and Molly. But then this is where the problem starts, Jane invites Molly for a sleepover since they don’t live that far apart and invites another friend as well (that person doesn’t matter as they didn’t show up for the sleepover). Either way, the weekend goes by and I ask her how the sleepover was and Jane just says that she just felt like it went by in a blur. The next day Jane and Molly get into a fight and a few days later Jane comes crying to tell me to not listen to what Molly has to say about the sleepover as Jane claims Molly is blackmailing her about something that happened during the sleepover. I am taken back a bit but I try to keep calm. Basically this is the story both Jane and Molly told me (put together) that happened during the sleepover Molly tried to sleep in Jane’s bed with her and because Jane was super tired, Molly decided to make a move and put her arm under Jane’s shirt and touch her. Jane was shaken but told off Molly to go to the other side of the bedroom to which Molly agreed. Jane wanted a answer out of Molly of what her motive was and decided to talk to Molly. This caused Jane to say this “only OP has these certain privileges and is just seems so wrong why are you doing this, now you have my head in the gutter and I just can’t think”. Molly realized that Jane told her that her head was in the gutter and Molly pushed saying “why is your head in the gutter did I do something to excite you”. Jane was still the thinking of a lot of things and blanked out but there were two things on her mind: Molly’s true intentions of being ‘friends’ with her and our “session” that me and Jane had the night before where she told me to kiss her and more private matters. Not realizing that she has said it out loud, Molly leans in to what seems is a hug but starts to kiss her in the neck. (Btw Jane is small and Molly is more taller than her) Molly kinda of pushes Jane down and Jane reacts after the third kiss pushing her off and calls off the rest of the sleepover and doesn’t seem to know what to think of the situation. Fast forward to two days ago Molly was trying to blackmail Jane telling me that she did encourage it by saying “kiss me” and therefore cheated but Jane swears she didn’t want to make Molly make a move on her and wasn’t in the right head space.

Here’s where I need the advice: Does this count as cheating if she tried really hard not to tell me the first time I asked her about the sleepover and she only told me when she felt like she was force to (because of the blackmail) and not out of her own free will? What should I do or how should I respond? I known Jane for 2 years and I feel confused and don’t know what to trust so yeah I came to the only place I guess I can let this be and I hope I can get some help on this matter.
Thanks for reading and sorry for spelling and grammar, I will try responding to anyone who writes.",19Mar2020,1

350,"Hello, so I'm not exactly sure if this is the right sub but it seemed fitting. It started at the beginning of the semester. My boyfriend and I were a couple hours away and could only see each other on weekends after we'd previously been living together. 

We decided that an open relationship during our distance would be beneficial. 

I met this guy let's call him Melvin. We hung out fooled around and then he became more of a friend and we moved on. Towards the end of our fwb arrangement he starts calling me mommy and that disgusts me and makes me not want to have sex anymore. I also accidentally touched this piece of hair that was caked with poop, which was disgusting as all hell and I had to hold back a gag. He also wanted to cuddle frequently despite me not wanting sex anymore. He complained about not having a girlfriend, the  said he'd rather not date me because of my race, not that I wanted to date him anyway.

This is where things get weird. He began dating this girl, let's call her Samantha. I was throwing a party at my apartment and he invited her. He told me that I shouldn't mention anything to do with his feelings, which I thought was kind of strange if they were already dating but went along with it. 

Samantha and I hit it off and we talked to each other pretty much all night. She doesn't seem to be romantic towards him at all. Later he tells me that he hasn't told her of his feelings which confuses me greatly since he told me that they were dating. 

I encourage him to tell her how he feels, he does one day and she reveals that she's a lesbian. So he made  up a relationship in his mind when she gave no indication of her being interested. This is when the icky feeling began to creep into my chest. 

Later I would find him looking through my things. Smelling random things like bags and clothing. He'd start inviting himself over. He would chew weirdly and stick his tongue out the side of his mouth often like a frog. I felt super bad for him, he told me his friends never texted him back. I didn't understand that it was his personality.

I tried so hard to keep the friendship going but each time I hung out with him I would get this ever increasingly icky feeling. Like the hairs standing up on the back of my neck. 

The last straw is when I asked him to pick up this package I sent to my old apartment that was near his. In exchange I'd give him some snacks and rum. He brings the package and I'm thankful but see that he's looking through my things again. When we're walking I mention that people looking through my stuff makes me uncomfortable he says that he was just trying to help clean and that he was about to ask about it but the moment passed. 

I left it at that and subtly asked him to leave. He's been sending unfunny memes and not getting the hint and I don't know if I should ghost him or bring it up. 

Tldr: Former FWB makes up relationship in his head, and has been looking through my things makes me want to distance myself from him. Should I ghost or bring up what's wrong?",19Mar2020,1
351,"Now I know we have all been freaking out over the virus non-stop. A lot of people have put life on hold and for me, it has stopped me from seeing my girlfriend for the time-being. Here are our situations:

Me, I live with my mom and family. My brothers girlfriend currently works in healthcare, as a respiratory therapist. She just had her first case of Coronavirus at the hospital. Now, she has not come in face to face contact with this person in the hospital, but she works there. My brother is now at home, along with his children and myself who have been stuck here. My mother has also been here.

We have only left for groceries, and have been practicing good hand-washing. There are no symptoms at the household of Corona, but we have left in the past 3 days to get groceries/my brother bought a ps4 from GameStop. 

Here’s the catch: my mother has had pneumonia 3 or so times, and at the age of 50-55. So she has been ballistic about the situation. I am not allowed out of the house unless it’s to the store with them so far. I feel like she is slightly high risk because of the effects corona can have.


Now for my SO: she lives with her father and little brother. she also casually goes to her grandparents house and her little brother also sees her mom. Now, no one also is showing symptoms of their family. They have been practicing good handwashing etc. Her dad has gone to work but works on a construction site away from people. Her mom is stay at home. 

Here’s the catch: Her dad is takes medicine that weakens his immune system, and could have a harsh time with Corona, IF he catches it.


So my question is: should I go see my SO? My mother negligently tells me no, because I or her could have the virus with no symptoms and I could spread it her dad or she could spread it to us. I really just want to see her for a day or something and it’s frustrating as hell.

I miss her very much and I cannot stop thinking about her. We broke up on Christmas 2019, three months ago. There isn't an hour I don't think about her. I still love her and I feel empty, depressed and extremely suicidal because I can't even see her. 

Today I had dreams (I NEVER dream) about her wanting to be back together with me, but in real life I know that will never happen. It hurts too much and I can't handle the pain even though I've gone through walking 12km down a mountain with a broken collarbone, ribs and a dislocated shoulder and many other pains like that. I've just tied the noose and prepared everything for ending it all for good, but then I stopped because I heard a song on my playlist which we went to listen to live (Swallow the Sun - When a shadow is forced into the light) and I collapsed crying.

I'm now sitting on the chair I was supposed to be standing on and kicking it. I feel no hope for this getting better, it hurts just as much as the moment she said that she can't do the relationship anymore.

How can I not think about her anymore? I'm taking some pretty heavy antipsychotics, but all they do is make me sleepy, just like the other 40-50 antipsythotics/antidepressants I've tried so far, but I still take them daily.",19Mar2020,1
358,"Help me, Reddit!

I am a late 30s single mom with a mountain of divorce-related credit card debt currently making $30k/yr and struggling to survive. I have 84/120 credits towards a BA in English Completed, but it's been nearly a decade since I dropped out.

An absolute golden once-in-a-lifetime opportunity has now presented itself that would allow me to go back to college, so I'm looking to take my credits (if applicable) and transfer to a more affordable online option. The only problem is - I don't know what I want to study?!

The MOST important thing to know about me is, I've been working for about 25 years, across a lot of different industries (line cook, court clerk, unemployment intake interviewer, warehouse loader, transcriptionist, teacher's aide, daycare worker, night guard, cab driver, Lyft driver, bartender) and I've genuinely not minded ANY of them - while I was doing them. I'm pretty capable of finding mental zen in any workplace. Every job I've ever left has been for wage related reasons (is, capping out on hourly, with little/no room for growth) or because of my divorce (long story and this post is already reading like a fuckin' George RR Martin), I'm very confident if I find something that will lead to a CAREER for me, I'll happily stay in that profession forever.

Some other facts: I'm a great worker bee. I'm excellent at taking directions and following instructions, but I don't have any aspirations of any high managerial positions. My body is not happy with physical work anymore, and my mental health isn't happy with law enforcement/health care/overnights no more, either, but I will if I must to provide for my kid.

Here's what I'm considering:

1) Web development. I wanted to be a web designer when I was a teenager, I still know html and some basic CSS, but I have no idea if that's worth a damn or if web de devs are reading this right now going, ""naww das cute, she thinks those things matters lulz."" Also no idea of income potential.

2) Coding. I know nothing, though. And I don't know if I'm smart enough, honestly.

3) Court stenography. I could do this with an Associates, but I don't think it has much (if any) income potential beyond what I'm currently making.

4) Finishing my English degree. I don't know why or what for, or what I'd do with it after, but it'd be a BA at least. The Uni I dropped out of was pretty expensive, though.

5) HR. It just seems interesting. But doubtful there's much work from home potential in that future.

6) Computer science. Again, I know nothing. No idea if I'm smart enough.

7)???

Most of what I'd like to do and see income potential in is in the IT sector, but frankly the main thing that holds me back is, I don't know what I'm capable of, when I have no experience or jumping off points. I've always been computer literate, but my confidence isn't where it used to be. So if what I'm dreaming of sounds ridiculous, I'm certainly open to any other suggestions.

363,"So, I’ve been out of the dating game for a while, as the title would suggest, and I have had several small crushes on girls and never really went through with pursuing them. Anyways, I’m in college, and I have a year left after this semester, but due to the coronavirus outbreak my in-person classes have all been cancelled for the remainder of the semester. Usually, as a person who’s not very social and loves to stay in bed, I’d be more happy about that, but I’ve been struggling to cope with the fact that I’ve had a crush on this girl in one of my classes and now it’ll only be by chance and pure luck if I ever really get to see her in one of my classes again.

Let me be clear about this crush before I ask my question, though. I know virtually nothing about her, but she’s very sweet, pretty, and out of the very few times I’ve really ever even had contact with her, I’ve cracked small jokes that made her laugh. The reason I didn’t try to seek out talking to her more in class was that it would have been mightily awkward trying to, especially in the middle of like 20 other students. 

So yeah, this is a small crush, for sure, considering it’s based on nothing but physical attraction and a couple small interactions. My question is: should I attempt to contact her and try to start something up, or let it go, wait for next semester and see if she’s in a class of mine again? Or maybe I just move on and just wait for the right person and moment to come along? If it makes a difference, the only means I would have of contacting her would be by searching for her through my school’s email network.

P.S. I know this post might come across as a bit petty, and very possibly extraordinarily basic and I might get an overwhelming number of people to just say “go for it”, but I lack a ton of confidence so I felt like I needed to post this in order to feel confident in whatever decision I make.

I have experience in the field I currently work in but my advancement has been put on hold indefinitely. I would like to look into a change of careers but I'm not sure what my options are now that I no longer live in the same part of the country.

I have an associate's degree in Science and about 8 years of work experience in customer service/hospitality. I may have the opportunity to go to school or learn a trade in the near future. I've been looking into going back to school for IT as that's what I feel would suit me best but the trades -specifically electrician-  are also pretty enticing.

What should I do here? Stay the course at my current job and wait for a promotion to pop up, go back to school, or look into an apprenticeship/trade school?",19Mar2020,1
366,"Right so l am new and need some advice about friends. So l am the only male in my inner circle of friends so l get left out like 90% of the time which makes me feel really left out a lot. As well as that they have their own chat on WhatsApp without me and when it was my birthday l have everything ready and only a few days before it was my birthday they made plans for someone else’s birthday for the whole weekend. I told one of them about it and she said
“Well oh you’re feeling left out go make new friends” and if someone is slightly left out we have to fully rearrange our plans but if l cannot come they don’t really care. So Reddit what is your advice?",19Mar2020,1
367,"Hey guys. I would like to hear some of your opinions as I am not sure whether I am being paranoid or not. My crush asked me to go to his place (which has happened the past few days as well), but I am getting more and more concerned about the part where I maybe should self isolate? He doesn't go outside other than the supermarket, same goes for me. Would it be morally incorrect and iresponsible to keep visiting him?",19Mar2020,1
368,"I lost most of my friends last year because I was going through stuff. Now I have two friends left. One friend I‘ve known for a few years and the other one I met at work a year ago. Everything was fine at first and I really enjoyed spending time with them and I still do but now every time I meet the guy I‘ve known for a while he makes me feel bad.

A few examples: when I first joined the gym we decided to work out together and he’d show me stuff but he ended up making comments about how much I suck. I felt uncomfortable every time we worked out together so I go to the gym alone now.

I had a job interview and decided to hang out with him before and he promised he‘d drive me but the moment we got out of the car he asked if I wanted to put on some makeup and that he had some at home. I was wearing makeup at that time. I don‘t wear mascara or anything but I do use liquid make up and powder so I didn‘t look bad or anything. He made me feel really ugly by making comments about how I should use make up and wear tighter clothes. We decided to take some pictures and he kept saying that my eyes look weird? Lol He then turned on the tv and decided I should watch makeup tutorials. I didn‘t watch ofc bc I was pissed. He watched for about 10 minutes and said something about how he would make my lips bigger. I told him that I couldnt believe he‘d say all that to me and he was like „what? Im just trying to help“. He used to be fat and has his own body issues so I have no idea why he‘d say all that stuff to me.

I told him about the stuff my other friend does and he hates her even tho they never met and gets really annoyed whenever I mention her and tells me to stop seeing her etc.

Now to my other friend: I have paid for her food so many times, brought her her favorite candy or favorite drink to work and she never does the same.

She makes me feel bad about my makeup and my clothes too but not as much as my other friend. She always says she cant wait to do a makeover on me which hurts my feelings because I like the way I look and I guess I didn‘t realize I was that ugly lol.

Sometimes she‘d text me all day every day about something I dont really care about but I‘d still try to talk to her about it because she‘s interested in it and then the next day I tell her about something that happened to me and she either says something rude, very short, she doesnt reply at all or she ignores it and changes the topic to herself.

Thats just a few examples. Maybe I‘m overreacting idk. Yeah the easy option would be to just stop being friends with them but then I wouldnt have any left and its not that easy to make new good friends",19Mar2020,1

**I posted a month ago asking for advice but it was kinda early so posting again.**

As the title reads, this guy [M23] dm'd me [F20] a month ago and ever since then we've pretty much talked every day. He has a full time job and I'm in school so we don't message as much throughout the day which I have no problem with. We mostly message at night and honestly I love talking to him. We are basically the same person and like the same things which allows us to have a good convo every time. There was one day when we didn't message at all and honestly I didn't care as much because I get it, people can be busy and I know I was and needed time for myself. 

Now what's bothering me is that some days he doesn't make an effort to talk at all. I get people can get busy but it's not that hard to say at least one thing thought the day. A couple nights ago we talked till 4 and then next day he didn't message at all which was kinda weird in my opinion.

All I know is that I'm getting attached but problem is he lives in the States and I live in Canada so meeting up soon face to face isn't an option right now. 

I don't know if he actually wants a relationship or what? I've never been in a relationship before so I don't really know what to expect? Should I straight up just ask him? We've talked for a month now so I feel like it's about time I ask.


**to add; I normally don't answer dm's but I just had a good feeling about this one.**",19Mar2020,1

372," I really dislike my brother, and he is ashamed to get advice from me. He really has this pride stopping him from hearing anyone that's younger than him, and that's a problem. Basically, this guy had become as abrasive and obnoxious as any person could ever encounter. He loves talking about what he thinks about religion and politics, and that would've been okay if he was open to conversation. This man is a huge hypocrite, that literally says ""Be open to ideas"" when he shuts me up from rebutting his view. He would fluctuate from being a Christian and being an Atheist, and every time it happens, he'd become annoying about it. However, this guy really can't take any responsibility, and is so prideful that he can't appropriately apologize for anything he'd done. This is the type of person who says ""I'm sorry"" but it sounds so constipated and insincere, as if demanding that he needs to be forgiven. He gets so angry when people are angry at him, even if he's the one in the wrong. What's more awful is that he thinks women are beneath him, and he is frustrated that no woman would want to ride his dick. He's objectively creepy with his advancements, and every time I tell him that something he is doing is creepy, he doesn't believe me. Here is the list of creepy and horrifying things, just so we could all be clear:

* He would be all nice at the start, and all angry if he gets rejected by women. He then belittles the woman afterwards, as if to soothe his own ego.
* He had been very rude and entitled towards my mother, that she stresses out almost every week because of him. (She's paranoid, though, and for a good reason, too)
* This entitled brat literally told me that my grandmother, an abuse victim, could have left the community and lived on her own. A woman who lived through WWII with the Japs invading people's houses, looking for some comfort women! During the decline of my country's economy!
* He always shut women's opinions off because ""they're too sensitive, and that emotions override their logic"" when this bastard had literally been self-destructive his entire life through two modes: **horny** and/or **angry**.
* Oh, and he is not afraid to use *physical force* and thinks that *mass genocide of the poor* is an okay way to absolve problems on drugs. This is the guy who thinks hitting children is a form of discipline, when he complained about getting hit as a child (and no, not by my parents because they don't do that, but my great grandmother in the span of a few months).
* He demands explanation for everything, thinking he's entitled to have it. ""Why can't you talk to me right now?"", ""Why can't I enter your room?"", ""Why don't you want to go outside?"". And maybe it's alright from time to time, but holy shit, what about every time I do anything?
* He thinks he is entitled for a car and a college tuition fee from my parents, when this guy had been wrecking my father's car, and had been repeating years in college!

But I'm not here to rant, I'm here to ask for advice so I could stop this entire abomination of a personality. I should note that my brother has a mental illness and has suicide thoughts that deterred anyone from speaking up. Shit, I've met a shit ton of mentally ill people, myself included, but nobody should have a Huge Asshole pass card because of it. Also, he didn't continue the psychiatric treatment, but the doctor was very helpful (I should know, I have the same doctor), and refused to take meds.

**TL;DR**: My brother is a sexist creep who wants a relationship with women. He has a personality that is very similar to the awful part of the Incel community, and is as abrasive and obnoxious as a feedback loop noise. I don't know if I should let it be, or if I could do anything at all. I don't want any woman or anyone, really, to suffer from him.",19Mar2020,1
373,"This year, not very long ago, I was sexually assaulted.. raped and manipulated. My body very vividly remembers how it felt as if they happened just yesterday. Whenever I have any sort of sexual desire I can’t help but start to remember how everything felt. I get an intense feeling of anger towards myself and shame for even having these desires. I feel like I shouldn’t have sexual desires because of what I’ve just recently been through. Whenever I feel like I want to have sex or to be intimate I’m just immediately turned off because I always think of what happened to me and I’m scared I’ll feel the same sensations. I feel like throwing up and I just get filled with such an intense rage. I just have no motivation to be sexually active- I can’t even touch myself without remembering certain sensations without cringing and curling up. I even have the same reaction to if my shirt brushes against my nipples. Disgusting. Even typing this and thinking about this now makes me feel like I’m going to throw up.",19Mar2020,1
374,"I’ve (19M) only known her (18F) for just over a week, we met at a college social event and hit it off quite well. She complimented me a few times and I caught her looking at me a couple of times too (we both gave each other little smiles) and she actually asked for my insta before leaving.

Fast forward to a couple of days ago, saw her again at another event for the same social group, she greeted me by name and brought a chair over so she could sit next to me. We talked again, nothing too deep, but still seemed to hit it off once again. As we were leaving she joked about going out for a drink but we decided to head our separate ways for the night.

As it turns out later that night my friends dragged me out for drinks so I texted her asking if she wanted to come, she said yes and we met up at the bar. She actually came alone without bringing any of her friends if that’s relevant... anyway the night goes really well, we both get relatively drunk but not over the top and end up losing all of my friends and dancing together all night, making out all night, and she was grabbing me all over too. At the end of the night she wants to go home so I walk her home, we hold hands and she holds onto my arm, we kiss a few more times on the way and I leave her at her door after she invites me to go out with her friends tomorrow night and gives me a goodnight kiss. In conclusion she’s been all over me all night lol

Now this is where I’m starting to doubt things as everything before now has made me think she’s into me... but maybe I’m just overthinking. The next day comes around and I text her asking if she still wants to go out, she says yes. But later on texts me saying she’s too tired, which is understandable. The other thing is that we really haven’t texted much at all apart from what I’ve mentioned above, and whenever we have I’ve initiated and she’s given relatively dry responses. Could it be she’s just not a big texter? Because in person she’s much more engaged and flirty.

Anyway our next social event thing isn’t for another week and I feel like I’m beginning to catch feelings so should I ask her out? Is it too early? Is she going to get spooked? I just don’t want to leave it too late and either have her lose interest or have someone else make a move. I need some advice!!

TL;DR: 19M met 18F just over a week ago, flirting and conversation. Saw her again recently and ended up going drinking, danced together all night and made out a lot, held hands and kissed more when i walked her home. But have hardly texted and she’s never initiated. Is it too early to ask her out?",19Mar2020,1
376,"I have random tidbits of evidence to suspect that my mom could be cheating on my dad. Now the only way to see if this is true would be to confront my dad in a very uncomfortable way that will either lead to me being correct, causing my family to split up in a divorce most likely, or me being wrong, in which case my mom would probably hate me and my dad be disappointed in me believing such a thing. Is this the type of thing that is even worth getting to the truth of? Or should i just bear the mental load and move on from the situation?",19Mar2020,1
377,"We met over on Instagram and for the first 2 months or so (until the middle of January) everything was pretty much okay.
Until she first lashed out at me. I was confused as to why but she said I was ""ignoring her"" and not involving her in the conversation. The most I did was not reply when I was busy and not talk to her for a while because.. I have other friends.
I always let her talk but always got the same, bland replies that left me feeling like she didn't even want to talk.
She also would randomly guilt trip me and force me to change how I acted around her etc.
She lashed out at me 2x in february, both caused severe panic attacks for me and I let her KNOW that she triggered my abandonment issues. She never apologized, but as soon as I triggered any of her shit, I was a horrible person and literally FORCED to apologize or she wouldn't talk to me.
She even told me about her anger issues, but she'd never talk to me about her problems because she ""didn't want to"". So she constantly, when she lashed out, would always say she'd been building it up and was sorry and blah blah blah. That was a fucking lie because she never gave me A CHANCE to reply to her rants.
I always vented about my problems because I trusted her, but apparently that makes me a narcissist now?? I told her she could always talk to me but she just wouldn't, so I respected her wishes and didn't bring anything up.
She lashed out one last time on the 12th of March. 2 days after my fucking birthday. All I got was a half assed ""I don't mean to curse you out two days after your birthday, but.."" and then a text that could compare to the tallest building in the world.
I was so fucking done at this point because my mental health was RUINED by this girl. RUINED I say.
I had another meltdown that day and called her out on all the bs she'd done in the past 2 months, how she triggered me I TOLD HER SHE TRIGGERED ME and she still didn't apologize and more personal stuff.
(Keep in mind, I never said the word toxic for the next part.)
And she said (Quote): ""I just feel more bad because I've been called more toxic than I thought"" 
She guilt trips me again after I send her a long text letting out all my feelings that I had built up. And says about the trigger ""Yeah I probably forgot because I have stuff going on too""
I HAVE STUFF GOING ON EVERY DAY AND STILL GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS. SHUT. THE. FUCK. UP.

TL;DR: She emotionally blackmailed and psychologically ruined me in just two months, along with guilt tripping me when hanging out with other friends but when she did it was perfectly okay. She caused 2 severe panic attacks and one meltdown for me and then complained when I told her about my feelings.
And to top it off she said today that she was actually happier for the 6 days we didn't talk. I was, too, and I told her that.
Finally, the question.
This girl acts like a narcissist, or someone with narcissistic tendencies to me. Does anyone else think the same?
I hate assuming, so.",19Mar2020,1

Not to mention that each pallet you load with up to 130 boxes is timed. It was literally like doing intense cardio the entire shift.

381,"Hi. I’m 14 and my parents are panicking concerning the COVID-19 outbreak and its stressing me out. They’ve done everything a normal person SHOULDN’T do such as panic buying, looking at statistics everyday (and forcing me to search it up for them), etc.

Recently, my parents just went on another panic spree. Its really stressing me out. There was a recent influx of people infected in my country and its really freaking them out. I always give them statistics, give them tips from trusted sources such as government notices etc. 

It usually never helps. 

Recently, my school is close to a town centre and someone has been rumoured to have been infected and went to our town centre. My parents obviously panicked and bought even more medical supplies. They’re now forcing drastic measures onto me like drinking hot water, wearing a mask, etc. 

The rumours have not been confirmed and was heard by family friends and they eat untrusted news outlets as if it can cure everyone in a week if you drink hot water. It really stresses me out because all of my opinions aren’t even accounted for and all the tips and constant precaution to NOT overspend and panic buy.

383,"
I live in an apartment with 2 other women in Y county. All of our boyfriends live at least an hour away. As of today, we’ve been instructed to self quarantine and shelter in place. One of my roommates brought up her boyfriend coming to visit soon, even though he lives about an hour away in X county in the sf Bay Area, which also has a shelter in place order. 

I basically told her I wouldn’t be comfortable with him coming over, since we don’t know if he’s been in contact with anything in that area and possibly wouldn’t show symptoms for two weeks. And whenever someone gets sick in the apartment I always get it ten times worse because of underlying health issues. 

The third roommate was pretty much in agreement, and even asked if she should quit going to the barn to take care of her horse but I told her that wasn’t the problem and seemed unnecessary even. And she said she wouldn’t have her boyfriend visit either. I also told my boyfriend not to visit of course, but that’s not even the point. 

So I think the roommate is being stubborn and I don’t think it’s that ridiculous to ask her to postpone seeing her boyfriend considering the state of the world right now. 

Am I overreacting? Should I tell my roommate she can’t have her boyfriend visit our apartment? How do I explain this to her?",19Mar2020,1

387,"Hello, I’m a woman turning 26 this year, residing in the Philippines. My friends all have long term partners and some are married already. I don’t really plan to marry this early (in my opinion) but I broke up with my boyfriend last year so now I’m single and it makes me worry. I’m worried I might not be able to meet and date someone long term by the time I turn 28-30 (ideal age for me to marry). I want to have kids so that’s the latest age range I want to marry.

At first I didn’t let this get to me, but since the culture here is different than let’s say America (they expect you to marry early here because it would be difficult to have kids later on), so I feel so pressured. Even my cousin told me I have no chance to have children and would probably be an old maid, that comment really hurt me although I just laughed it off. 

I will be taking up a second college course (which would take up to 3 years) this year so the majority of my classmates would be about 5-6 years younger than me so it would be hard to meet someone who’s in the marrying age in school. Also, by the time I graduate I’d be 28 turning 29 already.

I’m also an introvert and since our town here is pretty small, almost all the decent guys I know here are all either in a relationship, married or they moved abroad. The rest that I know, I either don’t like them romantically or they are don’t have a good personality (fckboys, etc.)

I do party every now and then but most of the people in the bars here are pretty young. (There aren’t many bars here because it’s a small town) Also, I tried dating apps but I just didn’t feel they worked for me in this small town. I lived in Japan before for about a year and I did meet my ex via dating app but here in my town, I feel like it has a stigma (people make fun of the people they know that they see on dating apps) especially for women and also, I already tried so many and I knew almost everyone on the app! (The rest weren’t my type)

I feel like the people I meet in our small town is so limited and I don’t have any exposure or chance to meet other people since I don’t really travel that much, except with family and I have to go to school by July. Also, in the Philippines it’s still normal to live with parents if you are unwed, so I still live with mine.

Since I made the first move, I'm frankly responsible for setting up what we do on our first date. What I had in mind was to fill the back of my truck with pillows and blankets and drive out to a semi-secluded area by the beach where we could hear the waves of the ocean crashing and just stargaze. I was also planning on bringing a box of pizza and some drinks too and just have a laid back time and talk with each other. My question is, if a girl did this on a first date would you freak out? Is it too much? Not enough? We only talked once at the restaurant and the rest of the times were through Snapchat but I really want him to have a good time.

389,"My life, I've struggled with suicidal, anxiety, depression, all those dumb things I hope I overcome someday. I had a friend for 5 years straight, but one and a half years ago, he changed. 

We were the best of friends, really. We called everyday, and hung out everyday. They did care for me, and always talked to me. I was in a horrible spot back then. Nothing mattered to me, other than that daily hang out. There wasn't a lot for me going on. They'd buy me food, gifts, anything they wanted to do for me. I never wanted these gifts, or money. I always denied getting it, because I know I can never pay it back in time. It's a debt thing, I guess.

We'd be the best of friends. We played games, did everything together. I was the shy, timid one. He tried to show me to his other friends, yet, I was just shy and never talked. It was a weird opportunity. But it was good for me. In those past 5 years, I've been in and out from suicide attempts. 

Those are good, right?

He was a drug dealer, to say the least. And hate to admit it, bought me weed as it did help with my anxiety. I never wanted gifts, but. This was a serious help to me. To say the least, I do regret it.

He is overly sexual, and this comes up later. He met two under aged girls. They only wanted him for drugs. He bought drugs for her, and threw a party for these girls. Expecting sex. They were 15-16. 

They never did do anything with him. And I'm happy that's the case. I always thought this was bad, but never said anything because it'd hurt. 

One day, those friends I met. They had a girl in there that had feelings for him. That was a good thing for him, he was always overly sexual, and lonely. But, it wasn't good though after I thought about it. They did talk more, and more. Turns out, that overly sexual would've bit him. She didn't enjoy that about him, and slowly drifted apart from her feelings. Which happens! Instead, he took this the wrong way. 

This girl was his best friend. I'm glad too it was, even if I was lonely daily. I'm glad he was happy. But, the thing that hurt me the most. He was making plans with me, and her at the same time. Ditching me and ignoring anything from me. It was alright the first few times. But, later on it started to hurt. 

I never did mention this to him, but my feelings were obvious to him, so he knew about it. Even mentioned it to me. This still was constant. And it was horrid. It bothered me at that. Too much to say the least. 

He started to lash out on others, and even me. 

Even started calling me names, and said all the horrible shit I do. He blamed me for stealing his money, those gifts I never wanted, but still got them anyways. Blamed me for ruining the friendship for being depressed, and hurt all the time, how I was always shitty to him. Which was never true. 

Eventually, I dealt with him lashing out on me for 6-8 months. I was seriously hurt at the time. To the point, where I started harming myself over it. And it kept hurting, I had nobody there, and when he came along, he just started harming me, more than anything. I kept up with it daily. 

I stayed because I cared, but eventually it became too much. I had to leave, and eventually. I blocked him, and never wanted whatever. The next day, I woke up to the cops. He called them on me, and said I was going to harm my family, and then myself. I mentioned everything to the cops, and nothing happened ever since. 

Ever since, I've been alone. Still am. 

Recently, I got a message. From Instagram. It was him, and we slowly started talking. He's been apologizing up the ass to me. But it gives me panic still.

I'm scared, but. I have nobody in my life, everyday is me being alone, and no friends. It's daily sitting in a room, but. I figured the best of it. I want to talk, since I'm alone. But, would it be better if I was alone? I'm not sure. Advice would be greatly appreciated!",19Mar2020,1

392,"We live in Australia: there are absolutely cases of COVID-19. They are low, but it is a real thing. We work for a small family business. My colleague is the most junior paid staff member in her area. 

She is being extremely passionate in saying what a lot of us are feeling: that sure, the office might be cleaned every few hours, but what about the journey into the city, the huge numbers of people in the city, the risk of contamination on public transport? What about if we are carriers, and the people we may be unknowingly infecting, what about flattening the curve? Why can’t they let people work from home, people do it all the time in other businesses in our industry, etc.? 

The plan was released today that explicitly states that the owners’ first step will be made only if an employee or their household member is diagnosed, or if its a government enforced lock down, and that step will be to shut down the office send everyone home on annual leave (if they have it) or otherwise on unpaid leave. 

She was loud in the open office stating that was rubbish, that people need to pay bills, that she will be up shit creek. I totally agreed with her and noted that our employer is happy to support if anyone is put in a position of financial hardship, as they said in their email. She said, really loudly outside the managing director’s office, ‘they only care about their bottom line’. She has raised the topic at least 3 times over the past day, really explicitly, really loudly, really passionately. 

I want to repeat I totally agree with her philosophically that more should be done well before a diagnosis in the office. Flattening the curve would be my top priority if I wasn’t economically dependent on my job, and if it was higher than 120 cases in my state. 

But the reality is small businesses right now even absent orders to do so are probably simply going to shut their doors, if not totally go under, whether or not a diagnosis hits. The market is horrific right now. The logical next step is that they’d need to find people to lay-off. And I’m worried she’s making herself a target. 

My question for reddit is, well, should I say anything to her? I’m not trying to sound like a counterrevolutionary, like a narc or something, and I do truly believe she’s not wrong. But if she’d be unable to pay bills by being put on unpaid leave for a few weeks then maybe she’s not realising how loud she is being and the potential to lose her job outright (she is, after all, the least qualified, and most junior role). She would really struggle with an unfair dismissal claim given the current market circumstances, and she’d struggle even more to find a new role in this environment.",19Mar2020,1

# Context: College Student that likes to game uses pc for both college &amp; hobbies

Am a young adult college student, in a repeat year, with a privileged tough home situation and a love of games and people.
Tough situation is a combination of a young child living at home, some antagonistic family members and being the only techy interested in a household rather against any interests requiring move than tv or a book.
Country is on light lockdown due to everything so accessing everything to do with college from my gaming pc I bought and built myself.
I have been a responsible student maintaining my college work from home and devoting majority of the day to study, then game in the evening.
My two main interests have always been socialising with people (which one can't really do with quarantine) and gaming which I do in all forms but mainly pc.

# The Issue: They want to scrap the pc

Parents want to take away the gaming pc and have me study from books they are under the impression I should have as physical copies.
I do not have the physical copies as my college has 2-3 copies of each book with a weekly return policy and the cheapest second hand starts at 300 euro and are 500+ euro new, so I have alternatively been using the free to access digital library which just requires an internet connection.

Since while I have been stuck at home I have only come down for meals and refreshments they are under the impression that I have only been gaming all day, rather than anything else and even when they knock in my screen is not trusted since I am more aware of tech than they are.
I work as both a salesperson and repair technician for technology so I have long understood that family probably won't share or care for my interest in technology and I am okay with that, I also am more than aware that our understandings of technology is vastly different due to this.

Now I do game, in the evening, after a day of working on college work.
But the issue is I get berated and hounded at for even doing that, which I can normally brush off by going out, but now with this lock down it has peaked.
Family then ""put down the law"" with myself not being allowed game, just me, the only person affected by that.
So naturally I rebel since I am a young adult, being responsible about my hobbies and work so I continue with that and just move my gaming to the night when everyone else sleeps since I'm a night owl in comparison to my family.
Naturally I am caught, so supposedly they plan to scrap my pc I invested my own earnings in which will not only cripple my hobbies during a quarantine but also remove me from accessing college work and studying.
We have had discussions over my hobbies as a whole, my own responsibilities, my commitment to college, my commitment to my work life and so on but they don't understand it as a hobby and don't want to.
I am the poster child in the household who is shown off as an example, told they should go out more then get chided for not going out enough, told to do more work than ranted at for not coming out of their room enough and you get the jist, so the fact that I am repeating a year has always been a sour point for them and that was due a particularly challenging year with the home situation where the whole family needed councilling.

# So how can I fix this mess? Would be appreciated, thanks internet

Basically, am I wasting some 2-3 hrs of my days gaming when I should be more worried about college and work life and whether I am or not how can I help this come to a resolution, preferably without having my pc scrapped.
For anyone who comes out with the recommendation of moving out, that is in the works and I am saving for it but unless I drop out and work full time it won't be happening until after I have finished college.",19Mar2020,1

396,"Hey,
I'm turing 23 soon, and I started to work at 15 with an apprenticeship as electritian. Three years ago I changed into a new job and right now I'm a servicetech for heatings (oil/gas/solar/..)

A year ago I started thinking about to go back to school again, to make my abitur (I think its similar to the SAT) and go study after.  I was a average student during my first 9 years at school(kinda lazy) , but at vocational school it really changed. I got straight A's in 3/4 of my school reports and learning got quite easy for me. 

So the big problem for me, may sound stupid to you, is that I like my team at work so much. I feel kinda guilty, thinking about to leave them. They teached me so many things, came to help me with a problem at 11p.m. and so do I now for the newbies. The sallary is ok and the teamleaders do really care about what we need. One problem is, that some experienced technicians left some years ago and so it comes, that we're not enough techs during high season. Many days up to 13h or no time for lunchbreak, etc. Not that its not allowed, we just dont do it then, to be on time for the customers (stupid ik). Around once a month, one of us has to be on call for 24/7, if theres's a disorder (backery, production,..). So yeah its stressful, and a lot of pressure but I guess every job has ups and downs. 
And now I think or I know, its getting even more stressful for my coworkers, if I leave and its driving me crazy. 

I used to like my job very, and I'm actually pretty good at it, what makes it even more difficult for me. But I just don't think, that's the right thing for me for the next 40 years. Or let's say it that way, I'm kinda scared that that's it. Working my ass off, going home sleep, repeat aaand zap I'm old. My parents did it that way and I can see, that theire not happy with it. 
I think some of you can relate to the last part...


Long story short: Can't decide if I should quit my job for education, because I feel bad that my coworkers (i rly like) would have way more stress.

397,"My best friend of two years (26F) and I (25F) are having issues. She has always been a chatty cathy and it never got on my nerves much until recently. I started noticing she would over explain everything to me as if I was stupid and everytime I did not share the same opinion as her she would always explain how hers was right. I respect her difference of opinions and I'm not always up for a debate and I'm tired of warping my opinions to avoid a lecture.

We have been spending a lot of time together and constantly talking so I think that is what has caused most of the tension, but yesterday she crossed the line. I ran over to her place to pick up something, but before leaving she asked if my husband and I was down to hang for a bit. I declined as my husband was about to go to bed and it was late. I told her I would be quick. She was having a bad day, and while I was there she kept the convo going. She was talking about her antidepressants and how they work on the mind. I tried to give her some advice to cheer her up the best way I could. Finally, I was standing at her door about to leave when I told her to try to be positive and she told me to ""GET OUT."" and it literally came out of no where. I was shocked as she never spoke to me like that and I was trying my best to cheer her up. I opened her door and walked out. She texted me later and told me sorry, that she was having a bad day and should have told me she needed alone time and then proceeded to send me a long ass paragraph about why she believes in science. Like wtf, you kicked me out of your place when I was trying my best to be supportive and you asked me to hang out. I told her it was harsh l and that I was sorry if I wasn't understanding enough and that I'd give her some space. Then the next day she texts me shit about her and what she had planned. I responded with short answers and she took the hint that I was upset and apologized again. I told her that I was hurt and needed space. Then it all hit me, 75 -80% of our conversations are about her and her problems. When I talk sometimes, she tells me to ""hold on"" so she can cut me off and keep talking. I love her like a sister, but this has woken me up to many things that she does and idk what to do. I hate to be one of those friends that throw up every nice thing I have done, but I have been a great friend to her yet she treated me like shit and proceeded to dump her shit on me again the next day. If it were me, I would have felt awful and at least called to apologize. Not send a long as text as to why I believe in my opinions and a half ass sorry. Like girl, you were a bitch to me and this is really the apology that you are giving? I get we all have bad days, but even on my worst I wouldn't have kicked her out of my house for trying to be positive. Am I overreacting?",19Mar2020,1
398,"I asked my coworker to cover my shift on Saturday which is her off and she agreed. We arranged that she will work on Saturday and I will work on Thursday (supposedly my off) so she can get the day off. She agreed and our boss also approved.

Otherwise it will be fine for me if she doesn’t want to change the schedule. 

Should I continue as if I didn’t hear her complain about it? Or should I just tell her that I changed my mind and we’ll continue with the original work schedule? I feel an awkward silence at the office and maybe this is the reason. I didn’t think it would be a big deal. Idk if I’m just being sensitive?",19Mar2020,1

Tonight, my college apartments told us we have to tell them by Friday at 5:00 pm if we would like to terminate our leases. We will have to move out by March 29th. My lease was going to last until September. I was probably going to take out a student loan to pay for the summer because financial aid doesn't cover the summer. 

At the same time, our college released info that our financial aid packages will not change if we chose to leave the campus. (This is all in light of COVID, by the by) This means that the aid I am getting to pay for rent will effectivly be a big fat check in my pocket (it's around $3500).



I absolutely love it here. I love the area, and I have my own room and bathroom and a nice roommate. This has been the happiest I have ever been. I came from an extremely toxic home environment. Having my own space and being Independent has been freaking amazing. Furthermore, I am a massive homebody/hermit and I spend lots of time at my computer. I just love my privacy and I was looking forward to the online classes in my cozy apartment.

This offer, however, is WAY too good to pass up. I am basically being paid to leave my apartment. 
My boyfriend is offering his room for me to stay in for the next six months. I would be saving big time, and he is making enough money to very comfortably support
 us. But I would have to share a room and bathroom with him for six entire Months. He also has a roommate who had his own room/bathroom. We have been together for a year and some months. He will be working from home for the foreseeable future while I take online courses. 

I love him but I am so sad about the loss of my privacy. I recognize I'm probably acting like a spoiled brat, but I can't help it. My aid package covers almost the entirety of my housing, so i don't nessasarily lose money. But I gain a lot from leaving. My parents don't provide financial help and I honestly really need it. 

I am trying to convince myself that I should just move out, but this apartment became so special to me. I was hoping to see if any strangers could provide some input.",19Mar2020,1

Usually it's connected to forgetfulness. I honestly want the best for everyone but I end up causing so much trouble because I forget stuff. I've solved most of my forgetfulness problems with calendar and memos but I can't seem to prevent every slip-up. It's usually the kinda stuff you don't write up, but later it turns out you should have, or you forget to check the notes, etc. 



Sometimes, I fuck up because I don't know certain things or don't consider some things. I'm constantly trying to learn new things but I always end up feeling like a kid because people tell me ""you should have known this already!"". 



I just feel so shit whenever I just make others' lives harder because of my own shortcomings. I'm often told, ""if you wouldn't be angry at someone for something like this, why would they be angry at you?"", but I guess I'm more used to how much of a hindrance I am, and I can be more empathetic towards myself because, well, because I'm me.

407,"Afraid to get help from the law

Hello, thank you so much for your help. Let me get started with some background.

I am located in California for starters. So basically, a few months back, my friend let me drive his car. We were both 16 at that time, and I did not have my license. However, having been offered the chance of a lifetime, I decided to take the wheel foolishly. After some driving, I started to doze off and I ended up hitting a parked car, and skipping over all the panic and terror rushing through me and my friend's veins, my friend (one who owned the car) decided to tell the police that he had been driving and that I had simply been a passenger. It was a minor crash, but it was still terrifying. Being completely uneducated in law, I am unsure of how to proceed. Anyways, things went on and it seemed to be forgotten, with my friend getting a 1 month suspension on his license. However, since then, I have received threats from people saying that they would ""jump me"" (beat me up) and sabotage my college admissions. I also get bullied on the daily. However, I feel helpless because if I tell somebody about what is happening to me, how people are spreading my address and possibly ready to actually beat me up, there is the possibility that my car crash gets exposed and I go to prison or some other punishment is inflicted. What can I do? I am scared for my life literally, and I need advice desparately. This has been making me panic for the past few months, but the hate from the people around me has never been this bad. I fear that someone may actually beat me up within the next few days, as my address has been shared and I have gotten threats of it from people who are ""higher up"" on the highschool echelon. I received a message just a few minutes ago saying ""I will send my boys after you that's on my momma"" and ""I know where you live I had the highschool directory"" and ""You the ugliest n\*\*\*\* I've ever seen"" and ""what's in store is unavoidable.""

I've known them for 6+ years, they're great. 
Problem is, since we started dating, I've noticed more that they don't have the hygiene standards I expect from an adult partner. 
I encourage them to bathe and brush their teeth with me, hoping my subtle push will help change their habits, no luck.
I've outright told them their breath stinks and to go brush their teeth before, they groan but do it, but no actual change.
I don't think they actually brush their teeth properly, as last night I asked them to go brush their teeth before bed as I already had and I wanted to go to sleep, and they claimed they had, but their breath was still terrible. 
They also have some pretty intense plaque build up.
I want to offer to take them to a dentist and get a good clean done, and possibly help them find resources to learn good oral hygiene practices, but I don't know how to approach the subject without embarrassing them or hurting their feelings. At this point though, the smell is too off-putting and I don't enjoy talking in bed or cuddling due to it.

So I currently work full time with lots of overtime available to me. My boyfriend works only when he wants. He does Uber for the time being. Right now because of the recent pandemic he hasn't been getting much work. He also has an advertisement TV on top of his car which pays $300 a month. On average I probably gross about 2500 a month. Even then it still feels like I am living from pay check to pay check with barely enough money to pay certain bills. I will admit that I have a spending problem which I am trying to change. And because of this in the past my boyfriend had controlled his money and had not given it to me like before. On top of this he has his youngest son living with us. Currently his son works at a temp agency and has been out of work for about 3 weeks. But then again he doesn't believe that his children should help out with any bills although his son has helped us out since hes been with us but my boyfriend has to pay him back what he borrowed from his son. And now because of the coronavirus pandemic his other son is coming back home and staying with us for a while; he also is vegetarian so I will probably have to cook different and buy certain things for him.

I feel that this is not fair because my boyfriend from his perspective says that he should stay-at-home long enough to make sure his son is ok and doesn't do anything stupid. He says that once I have kids I'll understand. Maybe I might be a little bit upset that he gets to choose his own hours and I have to be forced to work an actual job with long hours. I know that some of our problems is because of my spending habits which like I mentioned before I'm trying to change but at the same time I feel that he also should man up and get an actual job. My job has been working me 60 hours a week almost every week and I am starting to get burned out from it. On top of that it's a lot of standing and walking around and I have foot problems which my feet are starting to hurt. Last year for about 9 months I did Lyft and uber which I fared pretty well and was able to pay our bills but it wasn't enough so I decided to take upon a job again in security the only job that I qualify for; most security companies don't pay much.

1. Report it to the campus authority

I'm not one to get embarrassed easily at all but my dad's strictness, especially around my sleeping schedule, is really embarrassing when my friends find out. And that's absolutely not the only reason I want to be able to be awake later than 9:30 but it certainly doesn't help.

He also doesn't let me go literally anywhere except the closest mall to us. Literally no where else but that's another story lol...",19Mar2020,1
422,"I live with my boyfriend. He has respiratory problems.  He works construction. Right now in a place with no running water. With several other men. I work in the homes of the elderly, half with preexisting, and multiple health conditions. We recently lost multiple workers, none due to what is going on in the world. This means I see more people and work more hours, meaning I no longer have time to sanitize my home as well. My biggest problem is that my boyfriends boss has appeared sick lately. Left work early, my boyfriend suspects, to get tested for this new health crisis. He didn't ask, so he isn't sure. I told hi. That for the safety of all those I work with he needs to. I could not emotionally handle being responsible for the deaths of several clients. If I call out without reason, there will be repercussions. I feel like I'm losing my mind- I could have already made people sick or I could be a ticking time bomb. Any tips on dealing with this kind of stress? I can't change the situation (I have expressed to my boyfriend that communication with him and me and him and his boss regarding health is a big deal) not now at least, and I am at a loss.",19Mar2020,1

426,"TL;DR: I was a camp counselor last summer and I’m not going back this summer, which makes me sad for multiple reasons. I’m just looking for advice on how to move on really. 

Last summer, the summer of 2019, I worked for the first time as a counselor at a kids (boys and girls ages ranging from 9-15) sleepaway camp in the woods pretty much  in the middle of nowhere for about ten weeks. There was a strict no technology policy - the kids had no devices and the counselors were only allowed to use our phones in the “staff lounge” where the kids couldn’t see, and we were only allowed in that room on our “off period” which typically lasted about an hour, maybe a little more if you were lucky. (That policy really helped me step back from my phone in general, I’ve been much less addicted to it since returning home). The campground itself was absolutely beautiful. There was a huge lake at one end, I would wake up early sometimes (I’m talking like 5am, sometimes even earlier) so I could watch the sunrise over the lake. It was truly breathtaking. 

Anyway, I was a lifeguard/swim instructor and bunk counselor. The lifeguard part was pretty basic, during the main activity part of the day (~6 hours every day) I taught 9-10 year olds swim lessons and kept watch of all the kids when they would play during free swim, usually on the giant inflatable in the middle of the lake. That whole part of the job put me in the best physical shape I’d been in since a very long time ago. 

The bunk counselor part though, that was the highlight of the job for sure. As a bunk counselor, I, along with 1-3 co-counselors, was put in charge of a group of girls, a “bunk”. The bunks ranged in size from about 7-12 kids, all the same age and gender. As a bunk counselor, I took care of these girls (girls for me because I am a girl). Now, “took care of” encompassed a lot of things: I slept in the same cabin as them, I attended all meals with them and we all would sit together at a big table in the dining hall, I would help them kill any bugs in the cabin (and I am terrified of most bugs), I would make sure they showered daily and brushed their teeth every morning and night, I would help them all get ready in the morning by making sure they were dressed right and their bags were packed with everything they needed for the day from swimsuits to sunscreen to sneakers to their tennis racket if they played tennis that day, I would mediate fights between them, I would comfort them if they were homesick, I would play games like cards and such with them when they were bored, I would help them all get ready for bed and make sure they went to sleep when the lights were turned off for the night. I essentially had to function simultaneously as an older sister and a mother. I got to be their friend, but I had to remain a figure of authority. 

The summer was split into three parts: staff training for two weeks, and sessions one and two, four weeks each. The kids were each at camp for one session, 4 weeks, so there were two entirely different sets of kids during the summer. Session one I was in a bunk with nine 13-year-old girls and three other co-counselors, and session two I was in a bunk with seven 12-year-old girls with one other co-counselor. I loved all of my girls deeply by the end of each session. Session one’s girls were amazing, I was scared to death that session two’s would be much more difficult to deal with. Session two’s girls however truly became my family by the end of the summer. I’m an only child but they really all felt like my little sisters, all seven of them. All of the girls from both sessions really seemed to look up to me, it was amazing to feel successful as a mentor to them all. 

There were two campers in particular, one from each session, that really reminded me of my 12-13 year old self. They both told me in the few days before they went home that I was their favorite counselor ever, and they’d both been going to this camp since they were 9 years old (meaning they had each met a ton of different counselors over the years). 

So you may be wondering, with all of this stuff being so wonderful, why am I upset? What’s the big deal? Well the thing is, to come back to camp for another summer you must be officially invited back. And I wasn’t. I reached out to the head of camp, and he confirmed that I was not allowed to come back. He didn’t give me any explanation, just told me that I was not going to be receiving an invitation. And I am just utterly stumped as to why this would happen. All of my supervisors seemed to like me - at the individual staff reviews every single one of them told me what a great job I was doing, they never had anything bad to say. Like at the first review a few of them told me to be more confident but like, by the end of the summer they all pointed out how much they’d seen me grow, and how my confidence levels had become more than adequate. And not to toot my own horn but seriously, all of my girls really seemed to love me. I felt like they were all my little sisters and I think they all felt similarly about me, for the most part at least. 

They only reason that I can think of that makes the least bit of sense is the boyfriend I had the whole summer. He was another lifeguard, a couple of years older than me. He wasn’t particularly popular with the other staff, or a lot of the kids really. While I always did my best to stay out of conflict and to dispel any conflict I saw between other people, he was quite the opposite. Very argumentative and easy to set off. We were good for each other that summer though, we really balanced each other out. I was able to cool him off when he got worked up and he helped me be more assertive at the important times. (I’ve never been very good at standing up for myself). We really did seem to love each other, and we were very clearly the happiest couple among all of the counselors. He had to go home at the end of the summer though, home being in Europe. He was only in America to work at camp. I lost feelings for him pretty quick, we were on and off for a few months but now we haven’t really spoken since December. Additionally, I no longer have any intention or interest to speak to him again. I’ve grown to resent him honestly, more and more since I found out I wasn’t going to receive an invitation back. (He didn’t either obviously). 

Now, you may be wondering why I told you all of this in such detail. It’s because I want you to understand what this experience was like for me - how it truly changed my life and how I feel like I’m a better person because of it, in lots of ways. And I want you to understand why I feel so utterly devastated that I can’t return this summer. This wasn’t just a job to me, this was the beginning of my entrance to a new family, and now I’ll never see any of them again. I want you all to consider that when I ask you for this advice: how do I move on from this? It simply isn’t healthy for me to dwell on it, but I can’t help it. 

But yes, if you made it this far I thank you greatly, and I look forward to any and all advice or input you are willing to offer. Thanks in advance 😌",19Mar2020,1

430,"Im a university student in Germany. I've wasted ~3 years studying to get my bachelor's degree. I failed my first major and tried to save it by going into a similar one where I could take some of my grades so I wouldn't start from zero. I feel this obligation to finish it because I've already invested so much time and my parents invested money but I keep getting bad grades and I can't bring myself to be interested in it. I don't even want to work in that field but I'd have to. 

Today my parents talked to me about my recently not so great grade I got and said if I'm just not interested in this and I'm not giving 100% I should look into doing sth else. I want to do something else. I've been feeling so stuck here. But at the same time I feel a massive guilt for wasting all those years and money for something that might never benefit me in any way. 

And I also feel sad in a way because I worked hard to be able to get into university. I really wanted to be a uni student. I just   hated the major I ended up getting myself into. I went to school for 3 more years so i could study at a university. I couldve gone into job training 6 years ago. But I didn't. 

I feel like such a failure but at the same time I feel like I've kinda hit a dead end trying to pursue this major/career. Should I just cut my losses and move on?

434,"Throwaway account. Might crosspost in r/relationship_advice. 

Basically, everything I've seen about how to take care of yourself when social distancing/self-isolating generally avoiding people to avoid contagion/spreading anything seems to be about taking care of children or how not to drive your partner up the wall. I live alone, and the prospect of not seeing another human being for an unknown amount of time just feels really fucking bleak. I've tried staying with my parents, but there are reasons I haven't lived with them since I was 18 (now 24) and it's not really working out and I feel incredibly isolated. Also, I can't really work remotely very well in their house because of poor internet etc. (Unless the trains get cancelled, I'm going back to my own flat on the other side of the country next week, but will be more or less self-isolating when I get there - I can't drive, which definitely doesn't help in this situation). 

Most of my friends live \~4 hours away, and travel is a big no-no in the current situation. I can work from home, and my entire company is being forced to do so, but work is normally the main place I see people or have any face-to-face conversations. Not knowing when this is going to end and I'm going to be able to travel to see my friends just feels very desperate.

446,"Hi, I’m a moron.

I am a female, and even though I talk myself up to be some hardass, I am a pretty squishy gal when it comes to emotions. I get attached and over invested in most people, which has not once worked out well for me.

I will blame this aspect of myself for my current situation, which is the socialistic, magic-believing, racist, prejudiced, ultra simp.

It was a bet, I was going to get a neo-nazi (henceforth known as Nemo) two of my friends knew to simp for me and after a day or two be like “ha, you’re a lunatic! stop hating gay people and the jewish!” but instead, it’s been about a week and I suddenly care.

Nemo is not a good person, he has openly boasted about beating trans/gay/jewish people for fun, robbing people, stealing things, vandalizing and trespassing on private property, and expected praise for blatant sexual harassment. I know this, but I dance around these topics to avoid sharing my feelings on them.

Since talking to Nemo, I have learned that he is abused at home, has moved twice in the past year, and lost most of his friends. He gets jumped frequently from mouthing off about his racist space colonization ideals or otherwise attacking people, and is frequently in deep shit with his school and the law.

And despite all this, I have also learned that he is a very caring person. He pays attention to detail, is caring when he wants to be, fiercely loyal and protective, and genuinely believes what he is doing is right. 

So with all that in mind, he is officially beginning to simp and flirt heavily with me. My special talent is toeing the line of flirt and not, which i try not to use often because I hate leading people on, but it’s getting worse. I will have to take a stance soon, and I do NOT want it to be a romantic one.

I think he’s just misguided, feels unloved and lost, needs somebody because he has nobody. 

But what if I’m wrong? What if he is just a really good simp, and I am just an idiot? I’m nervous and out of my depth. If I’m going to remove myself I don’t know how to go about it without making him an incel, but I don’t know how to maneuver myself into a position that’s not either supporting his dumping or supporting his cracked beliefs. I want to be there for him, because I think he needs it, but I don’t know how to handle the situation.

I know I am an awful person and that this is all my fault, but now I don’t know what to do.

448,"So...I have this friend who acts like a bitch a little now and then. And when I say bitch, I mean the type of person who would kiss your (now obviously ex-) boyfriend (yup, it happened). I've let a lot of stuff slide because we've been friends since we were kids and we've always been very close. She is also basically the only friend I have at the moment. 

  
The problem is, she's getting worse. And I'm finally gaining some self-respect and am starting to feel like I've had enough. I almost can't believe the stuff I've put up with during the years... 

  
Recently I got a job in the same village she has been living in for the last couple of months. I applied there because she was asking me to and I thought it would be fun to live and work close to each other since we haven't been hanging out much lately. Well, I also really like the place, but she did have an influence on me applying there. I'm moving to my new apartment in a few weeks. 

  
Today she told me she had been saying a lot of private and shitty stuff about me to all of her friends when they were out drinking ( she was not drunk though). She blames it on her being very self-conscious at the moment etc. The village I'm moving to is very small, and her friends are basically the only people my age living there, meaning those are the only people I can befriend. But apparently now they already know every embarrassing and bad trait (including my long past of anxiety issues and all of their consequences) I have, so that's just great.  She has literally told people I have lied about being sexually assaulted (it happened recently and I'm still very much struggling with memories from the incident). I'll be fleeing from my judgmental birth town to an even worse place...

  
I don't know how to face this. I didn't expect to feel this way about her, like I can't stand her anymore, but suddenly I just can't handle being her lap dog anymore. But I'm so scared of confrontations and I always let her win if there is ever a fight between us. She always makes me feel as if I've done more wrong then her, even if I literally haven't done shit to hurt her.

[some back story if you care to read]

Okay, I met this girl playing a game and we started 
talking through discord every day for a year. We talked about almost everything like how our day was, what’s been happening, our problems and played games with each other etc. I grew feeling for her and I was scared to say something about it or touch on the subject about that stuff. I don’t know where I can fit this but I was depressed at this time, at lease I think because I was scared to talk about it to anyone or seeking help. But I talked to her about being sad and how I was feeling, I’m not proud of this but I was talking about killing my self and held a knife to my stomach, to this day I don’t know why I did this.  But she talked to me about it and this helped me so much and I was so appreciative because that’s the first I ever vented. So I trusted her with everything, I’ve never felt that way with anyone, it was so new to me and I loved it.
So one day, I decided to tell her how I felt about her. I don’t remember how it went but it didn’t go the way I wished and she didn’t feel the same way, this was about 3 am.
But for the rest of the day I was locked in my room crying and sleeping, I didn’t talk to her that day.
Next day rolls around and I log on around 12 am I think, she tried to get me back on to talk by trying to cheer me up and tried talking to me on Instagram too. I don’t know why I felt happy about this for some reason, guessing because she actually cared for me or something. But I was still in a bad state of mind so I messaged back saying I was okay, but I was still sad about it and regretting everything I said and did. Don’t remember much after that, I just remember we got on the subject talking about how we felt for each other. I said the same thing but she said she did have feelings for me but didn’t want out friendship to change so she just wanted to be friends, not sure if this was true though. A few months go by with nothing really happening but still being very close and talking to each other everyday, a few problems came along during these times but we managed barely. Still don’t remember what happened but I just knew she didn’t really feel the same anymore, or if ever,  and I felt horrible for not seeing this. Like she never wanted to talk about or become something, maybe it was just fear that it was going to go wrong or she just didn’t have feelings. I’m over looking this now sorry. But I just know I was sad and not know how to feel or get over it. So We argued for a while but we made up pretty good. 
Another few moths go by, don’t remember what happened in those months. So I don’t remember when this was but I decided to tell her that I still had feelings for her but she didn’t respond for a whole day I think, but when I was trying to fall asleep I got a notification on my phone from her with a long message just saying that she might feel the same way. Oh boy I was a proud dude, I felt so happy for a few weeks. This was the first time I ever felt loved by someone else in a romantic way and I loved it. Like 2 weeks go by and I started saying “ily” and stuff like that, but she said it back. So one day I’m saying good nights and stuff, and when I’m going to sleep, I got a notification saying “I love you so much”, this made me feel like my heart dissolved to a puddle of rose peddles. I was the one saying it first and she never said it first which made me happy and a feeling I can’t describe, but relief too. I was starting to doubt that she really didn’t feel the same way. Oh my, I forgot to say that we weren’t a thing. 
Sorry again but I don’t remember if this was the day after or the day after that one.
But that day she was acting weird like she didn’t want to talk, so I asked what’s up and of course she said nothing and not to worry about it. This went back and forth for about 10 minutes, Then she said she’ll tell me which took about 20 minutes of writing  but I was not ready to hear this. She wrote that she didn’t want to be in a relationship with me because she didn’t know if she’ll love me, or anyone like me, she was thinking for months about this but came out and told me that she was lesbian. I tried acting like everything was cool and I was glad she came out to me, but I wasn’t. I didn’t know how to feel, I felt like everything I was happy about was destroyed, I felt empty but quite glad she told. Like if we kept it going just to get my hopes up just for all of it to be let down. So not knowing what to do I just left to my room, cried and fell asleep. I don’t remember much about the day after all that I was devastated (I think this is the right word). So a few weeks go by, we’re still talking but not the same, don’t know how to describe; But we start talking less and less. I didn’t like this so I start trying to make conversation and trying to fix everything, nothing was working and I felt like she stopped caring about me. I later found out that she had a girlfriend, this made me sad,mad but mostly jealous. I started being more needy but didn’t even know it, I wanted everything to be the same I didn’t want change so I put my problems on her to keep her with me. I will forever hate my self for doing this, it hurt her, it out her through so much stress and I tried doing what I was scared of, dragging her away from people just to be with one person. When I realized this it was to late, everything was toxic. The main thing we ever did was just argue. Until one day I hoped to change all this, I planned to play the game we first met on a start things fresh. I was hoping that we can do this on the same day we met. The day came by I had everything set, just waited for her to join the call. She didn’t join, she went to go play with her other friends. I just like to say my goal was to repair our friendship and that’s it. Back on topic, when she didn’t join I felt defeated. This is where it got toxic again, I was mad that she just threw away our plans and the special day we’ve been looking forward too for like weeks. But it was the same thing every time for like 2 months, it was pretty good, we argued more and more every time. But the day we had a bad argument for what ever reason I don’t remember. But I started insulting her because I was so mad, I’m not proud about this, I regret everything I said and hope I can truly apologize to her. But she had enough blocked me on discord. 3 days go by and I’m so confused what’s happening. I messaged her on Instagram and asked what’s happened between us. She said that it got really toxic and she doesn’t want to be my friend or talk to me anymore because I hurt her a lot when I insulted her. I agree to leave her alone and kinda apologize for what I said, but I’ll admit, that apology was just an attempt to save my friendship. Didn’t work obviously, but we haven’t talked sense. Which leads me to now.

TLDR: i met a girl online, talked everyday and grew feeling. She was a lesbian, we argued a lot and we don’t talk anymore. 

Ever since we stopped talking, I can’t stop thinking about her. It’s been an entire year and every day I always think about her and I want to stop. But she always pops up in my head and it makes me really down because I miss her a lot. I haven’t talked to anyone about my problems because they barley ever care, I miss the feeling I had when I talked to her everyday.  But I want to move on and stop thinking about her everyday, I just don’t know how too. Please give me advice.

Sorry again for the writing and the punctuation.
I’m also on mobile. 
Spent 2 hours writing this and it’s now 6 am, I’m tired so I’m going to sleep.

Also sorry for all the ‘ands’ and ‘buts’.

462,"Hey all. I am a 26 year old female. I've been doing a bit of cam girling on a site for a while now (please don't judge me for this- not what this is about!)  


So I have this regular guy who pays for a private show like twice a week for about a year now. He's always really nice and kind to me, but yeah he pays to see me get totally naked for him a LOT. He has a really specific username that I always remember and say hi to him whenever he's in my chat room.

&amp;#x200B;

Fastforward to last night and I'm at my best friend's house and her boyfriend is also over. They have been dating for about 5 years. I told my best friend I use cam sites, but swore her to secrecy. I don't think she would have told her boyfriend this?   


Anyway he goes out for a while and me and my friend get bored and go on his Xbox that he has taken over to my friends house. We turn it on and his gamertag is... the exact same name as this guy that watches me on my cam all the time. I immediately run to the toilet and feel awful. It's such a specific name that it HAS to be him.

Should I tell my friend this? Should I ask him about it? I feel awful but have no idea what to do? Does this mean my friend betrayed my trust and told her boyfriend that I cam?",19Mar2020,1
463,"For almost the entire four years we've been together, her routine after work has been to shower, eat dinner with me, maybe start watching a movie, or tv show.... and then she'll just pass on my shoulder. The exception being if we go out to do something, of course. This also happens even if friends come over to hang. Bam, asleep. 



Now, the other factors here is that almost without fail, she'll wake up before the alarm goes off the next day and just lay in bed next to me, scrolling through her phone anywhere from one to four hours. 



We've tried multiple things, including just letting her take a nap when she gets home, but she always wakes up angry for whatever reason, which kind of kills the initial desire to hang out in the first place. Ideally, it'd be pretty neat if she could just go to sleep later, and skip the part where she wakes up at 3:00am, but I'll take any and all advice.

School said they will refund us, and financial aid will be disbursed. Meaning, if I choose to go home, I would potentially get $5,000 financial aid. Coming from a low income family, this money is a lot. 
So now I don’t know what to do. 

Should I live in my dorm? if I choose to, I will be lonely, as all my friends will go home. I will eat limited dining hall food. And I will basically live by myself as my roommate is leaving. Everything is paid by scholarships so no money issues. I can get a job to pass time. also my boyfriend lives here. 

If I choose to live with my parents, i get that disbursement, I know my mental health isn’t going do that great. My mom and I fight a lot, and I’m going be at home for almost 7 months doing nothing. Where I live everything is pretty far. (30min - 40min commute)

468,"Hi Reddit, first time making a post.

I want to know if I would be the asshole for complaining about this.

I've recently moved into my first apartment, and I've met a few of my neighbors. Now before I moved in, the people managing the complex gave me a warning that there is a man who lives below me, who has mental health issues and occasionally causes a lot of noise. I figured that's part of the deal (I live in social housing) and I didn't think it'd be that bad.

I have no idea what amount of noise I can expect as a new apartment renter, so I'll describe my situation. The man living in the apartment below me is an older man, who seems to not be completely alright. He talks very weirdly and I can't understand him very well most of the time.

He seems like a nice enough person, he gave me some of his food when I just moved in, and in general always tries to make conversation.

The problems are:

\- He plays very loud music probably once or twice every day for half an hour to an hour and a half? So loud that I have to turn up my TV and can still hear it, or that I have to blast my music from my phone at full volume not to be bothered by his music if I want to take a shower.

\- He has fits I think where he just yells very loudly and angrily and in those he often goes out of his apartment into the hallway and he hits the railings of the stairs so it makes a lot of noise.  This is usually at night, around 11 pm and later. I've never dared to confront him during one of these times, because I'm a young woman living by myself, and he can be quite intimidating.

\- He smokes weed constantly, sometimes in and out of his apartment, so often the entire hallway and stairs will smell strongly of weed.

\- He assumes I have unlimited time to talk to him at any time, even when I'm clearly busy, leaving, or I want to go home. For example when Corona hadn't canceled all my lectures yet, I would be leaving to catch my bus to go to university, and he would start a chat with me, I'd reply quickly and tell him I needed to go. He'd say: yeah just this, and then keep talking. Repeat this several times, to the point where I told him: I really have to go now so I will. And he kept talking to me/yelling after me when I walked away. When I tell him I have to leave he gets annoyed and he hasn't said anything to indicate he might get angry/violent, but I am intimidated by him. (Especially because of his angry fits at night and because the apartment managers told me he had anger management issues.) This makes me very anxious coming home and leaving my place, especially at night.

This is why I usuallly try to avoid him when I'm leaving the apartment/coming back, but he often hears me on the stairs and will then immediately go to his door to talk to me.

The managers from the apartment called me a while ago, and they told me they'd received complaints from other neighbors, and they wanted to know if I have the same issues. I told them that I have had incidents, and that I'd keep a log of what happens, but I don't know if that's an okay thing to do because:

\- I've never actually told him that his music and his yelling bothers me, or that I'd prefer not to talk as often/prefer that he doesn't go out to talk to me everytime he hears me on the stairs. (This once again because I'm intimidated and I don't know how he'd react if I did). 

\- Like I said, we're in social housing, this man has mental health issues and he clearly needs help, I'd feel terrible if I got him kicked out of his apartment. The manager of the apartment said that this had been a long time coming because he'd had many complaints before, and that he's contacting his lawyer to get this man kicked out either way. He's said he's gonna try to get this man someplace where he'll get help, but he didn't say he could guarantee that, so I don't know if this man might be kicked out onto the streets, which I obviously want to avoid.

On the one hand I think that I should feel safe and comfortable in my own apartment, and be able to leave on time, and that the noise and smell isn't okay, but on the other hand I don't know what amount of noise/smell coming from your neighbors is normal in an apartment, and I feel bad about complaining about this man who is obviously mentally unstable and needs help, and has usually only been nice to me.

So I'd love to know your take reddit. Let me know what you think.",19Mar2020,1
469,"Sorry for the vague title, I'm not really sure how to begin. I (21f) and my husband (25m) got a credit card to help with bills. Obviously we accumulated a bit of a balance, though that's irrelevant. My friend (25f) and I started shopping together, I being more frugal and only purchasing items that I would need or use at a reasonable cost meanwhile my friend purchasing whatever her heart desires. Over the past few months (since like October) (well since the beginning of our friendship she's asked to borrow to help with bills and has always paid back within a month or so) she a been asking if I could just, swipe my card and create a tab, promising to pay back whenever she can. She's even wrote up a payment schedule. Though for about 2 months, I havent seen a payment, shes had car issues so I wholeheartedly understand. But now her engagement has been terminated, and I'm somehow caught in the middle without wanting to be anywhere near this mess, nothing has been said yet, I've been ignored by both parties for about 2 days and have only seen her when she needed something. (Maybe 2 hours for 2 days and that's it, I'm ditched) but now she's trying to buy a car and amidst this disaster, and I'm left wondering (since I'm quite sure we're no longer friends, sure as hell doesn't seem like it) if she'll actually pay me back, especially since i told her my credit card has interest and that I wont be paying her share of it (because it adds up quite a bit). 
I'm curious as to if theres anything legal I could do in case this goes south. 
I've been warned against lending money. I know, I'm an idiot, but I loved her, she needed help, I was there. 
Now I'm just afraid of getting screwed again. 
Any actual advice would be immensely appreciated.

471,"i’m going to explain my story here i guess. i don’t know why i’m writing it here, i guess i just need to tell someone yknow. 
I have a lot to be happy for. An awful lot. I have a loving family, Girlfriend. yet i’m destroyed. I’m 19 and in my first year at university. whatever you americans call it idk i’m from the UK. 
Anyway my background. During primary and high school i always had friends. i wasn’t necessarily the most confident person out there, things did make me anxious, but in my last year of high school / sixth form something happened with my ‘friends.’ i say friends because they’re not anymore. that was 2/3 years ago now i don’t know. i was failing my first year of sixth form, so i dropped out and went to college. it was hard for me as someone who didn’t know anyone, had little confidence, and thus no friends i’d consider close. I did this because my mental health was struggling in high school. 
College went by and it was great, for two years i reached my grades and made friends again. not the closest but friends at least. I’ve always isolated myself, suffered from forms of social anxiety and depression. 
Now i’m in university. my first year. i’d been with my girlfriend for about 6 months now. it’s extremely difficult as she lives 200 miles away so i don’t see her often. the distance doesn’t affect us though. my first semester wasn’t hard work wise. i had nice flat mates and course mates. yet my anxiety was hard. i couldn’t go out at night with my flat mates as i’d struggle with panic attacks. 
Eventually i told my girlfriend and parents on Jan 30th. I went home. notified my course and stayed home for a month till i felt better. came back Feb 28th. 
I had missed a lot of work, lectures etc and it’s hard to catch up on as i have adhd, i’m in anxiety medication now. i have a piece of work due tomorrow. 
Last night me and my girlfriend had an arguement. I love her. but she told me that if i don’t fix up in terms of thinking about her, which is true. i can be selfish in things due to my anxiety, she’ll leave. that destroyed me. i’ve been depressed for years. I’ve always thought about harming myself but haven’t ever acted upon it. Until last night. I wanted to take my own life. I guess that’s the honest truth. I guess i did try. i took a razor and began trying to cut my wrist down. It didn’t work. i tried many times and ended with many cuts on my arm which i now have to cover up. 
I’m ashamed of what i’ve done. i feel weak as fuck. I don’t want to tell my parents. it would destroy them. Worry them sick. i’ve only been back two weeks so i really don’t want to tell them. i don’t want to tell my girlfriend. it would hurt her too. i don’t know what to do",19Mar2020,1
472,"My girlfriend and I are both 18 and have been together for 2 years; her parents both quite liked me, too.

I had a free house yesterday, so she came over for a couple of hours. We've been trying out rougher sex recently since both of us seem to enjoy it. At the moment, this includes things like face slapping, hair pulling, gentle biting, light choking, etc.

An hour or so after my girlfriend left, I got a call from her father -- who was livid. Because of some red marks on her face where I slapped her during sex and bruises over her legs, he's convinced I was being physically abusive. It was pretty awkward, but I tried explaining that they were actually just marks from some crazy sex and could hear my girlfriend in the background insisting that I wasn't abusing her.

Stop by a few days later, the owner of the house texts me and jusr says ""you're being reported to the police"" or something like that. 

So what happened is, that someone had stolen a bunch of stuff from her friend at the party, and I alledgedly called them up and admitted that I did it, and that I'd pay them. (They change the story later on which I hve no way of proving)
The ""witnesses"" all put me in a time stamp in which I was alone, and that I had a backpack with me, though It was filled up with stuff like beers and bottles.

I really just don't want to go to court for this, as I have no physical evidence other than that they csn check my phone record. (Assuming I won't be found guilty before then, since I technically could've used another phone. - Is it possible to track an unknown number from the owner's phone? Would make it much easier)

488,"Hi. I’m 18F and I’m relatively new to reddit but I’ve seen a lot of posts on other social media so I thought I’d check it out. Anyway. 

I’m having some trouble dealing with my personal life. I found out around 6 months ago that my dad was cheating on my mom and then it was like something clicked and I was able to connect somethings that happened in the past to this as well. It shocked me and I did not know what to do because my family is pretty conservative and Idk how to deal with it. You look to your parents for comfort but mine never were the ones to offer it. I distinctly remember my dad telling me to cry in the bathroom if I ever needed to cry. And that’s what I’ve been doing so far. It’s really unhealthy and I honestly can’t imagine telling a child to do that. 

I can’t really tell my mom because she’s the type of person who wouldn’t still somehow support her husband no matter how shitty of a person he is. She’s naive. But I’ve learnt over time that she doesn’t really care for me in a way that a mother does for her child. That hurts me because I wish I was loved by my family but I’ve slowly accepted that it isn’t the case. 

My dad is emotionally abusive. He constantly berates my mom and me. I never used to notice this because I thought it was normal. Then I would hear all my friends talk about their parents and I noticed the difference quite quickly and I would tell them some of the good things that have happened in my life concerning them, building a lie. I can’t really afford to go to therapy as of now because of the Corona virus outbreak( the government has taken strict actions) and my parents are very controlling. And I have anxiety and this have affected my mental health far too much and I have hated living.

But I have managed to confide in two friends of mine but I can’t always rely on them because I don’t want to burden them. I can’t stand to be around my dad anymore and I can’t look my mom in the eye. I haven’t told anyone else from my extended family(paternal) because I don’t trust them. They used to berate me and my cousins constantly including my parents. (They were nice otherwise) I think it was some sorta joke to them but it really caused my insecurities to grow and I’ve become emotionally unstable lately because of exam pressure and just being in this headspace.  Another reason I couldn’t afford to tell anyone immediately is because I had to consider what would happen to my sister. She’s only 11 and I don’t know how she would be affected by a possible divorce. I know my mom deserves to know the truth but I can’t really risk anything because my dad has the financial power and I plan to use it to my advantage because it has come to this.

My maternal side of the family are way better. I plan to tell my uncle (mom’s brother) but he is also obligated to my dad so I’m not sure how much that would help(my dad paid for his higher studies abroad). And now that I’ve decided this is about self preservation I wanted to hold back until Ik I’m financially secure because my dad has the money to provide me with the education I want and if I’m going dragging him down I plan to do it all the way through. He plays the victim when it suits him and he’s nice when he has to be to get on out good side. I’m tired of this toxic cycle which has heightened my self destructive habits. I just want to be okay if not happy.

I want to get away as soon as I can. I would be able to if I get into this good college (out of state)I want to but it’s super hard and because I’m in the mental state studying has become impossible. But even if I don’t get in, I can only manage to get some sort of escape after a few months once all the entrance exams end. 

So I wanted to advice on how to handle myself when I’m literally surrounded by people I can’t bring myself to love anymore, even hate. And I’m not able to love myself as much which I want to. I can’t bring myself to study or stay motivated over a long period of time. Is there a way I can seek out online help or anyway I can help myself break out of this without direct confrontation with my parents since they’re the worst with confrontation and my life could really be in jeopardy in that case.

489,"I’ve (F24) been with jake (M24) (fake name) for about 3 years. We rent a house together and there’s still nearly 11 months before our lease runs out.

Never had any kind of serious problems in our whole relationship. I mean we do argue occasionally but he’s never tried to physically hurt me before or anything

This is what happened ..

I was in the bedroom just on my phone and he was out in the living room. I think he may have been on the game idk but I could hear him getting frustrated at the tv for not working properly or something and then I hear him start walking to our bedroom. No big deal he wasebt yelling or anything. But when he came in the room, out of nowhere he just slammed our door shut behind him. It made the whole wall shake and it made me jump a bit because I dident think he was that angry about the tv. I said “don’t slam the door” because I don’t want to get a noise complaint or anything or have him break the door as we are only renters. I was not trying to be rude or anything like I was just saying.

He got so angry that I said this. He started yelling that he never tells me what to do so I shouldn’t try to tell him what to do. I tried to explain that I wasn’t telling him what to do and while I was trying to explain it to him he managed to grab me off the bed and kind of shoved me into the door corner. I put my arms infront of me to stop him from getting close to me and idk if you’d call it a hit or a slap but he hit me on the cheek with like his fist ... it wasent a punch but it was with his fist but it dident really hurt that much but it did freak me out cause it made me start tearing up. Not because I was in pain or anything but just idk I was just freaking out and started crying.?

He dident do anything else. He did swear but I think he was swearing at himself. (He doesn’t usually swear) and he held my face and hugged me after for a pretty long time. He apologised to me a little while afterward and I said it was ok. He said it wasent ok and that he wouldn’t ever do anything like it again.

I do believe him I think I’m just a bit spooked so I’m having a hard time relaxing around him.

It all happened within like 30 seconds I’m not sure how it escalated so quickly. Think I might be slightly overreacting by even posting this here. I’m not injured it barely even hurt even though I did start crying. He’s promised not to do it again and I have no reason to not believe him as he has been very nice to me since it happened.

Is it ok if I forgive him ? I know the saying like if he hits you once he’ll do it again. But I feel my situation might be different. I’m sure I’d leave if he ever did it again. But I don’t think he’s gonna do it again


Tl;dr my boyfriend lightly hit me in the face in a moment of anger because he thought I was trying to tell him what to do.. he seems very apologetic and promised not to do such a thing again.. I want to forgive him. Should I ?

490,"My husband and I are struggling with this because we must move in June. The most convenient option seems like it would be a highrise apartment. We've both only ever lived in single-family homes with front and back yards, and our kids played with the kids around the block, and suburban living - even down to things like having smoking outside the only policy.  

I'd love to hear what it's like to live in a high rise, alone, as a family, or as empty-nesters (as we will be in 2 years, so that's an impactful part of the decision-making process, as well; we only have an HS junior living at home at this point after raising three kids.)  

We're used to owning a car and a truck and renting a 2400 square foot house for the past twenty years.  We have always felt like it's been way too much space, even with three kids, so downsizing is the only welcoming thing I can think of for living in a highrise, which again, would be a really convenient option for us with a new move coming up.  Also, we both work from home.  

It's hard to see living in a highrise as anything other than being quite stifling, though. 

I'm curious about every aspect of highrise living. Do kids run around from floor to floor to play? Do you ever know your neighbors? Where do you smoke a joint if you don't approve of smoking in the house? Do you even need a car anymore? How do you get your things up 20 stories without pissing someone off?  What about my dog, who is more important to us than our kids sometimes (j/k).

Thanks for any input as I truly think this type of advice will help us make the best decision.  Going straight to you guys I think we'll get the truth about it, rather than what we've been told by agents. 

Thanks very much...we both appreciate your advice.",19Mar2020,1

492,"I've been in a sexless relationship for the past five years. We are married now. I never thought we would make it this far, but we have. I am happy for the most part... I do fear in the future that I will regret never having sex again. It's her choice btw to not have sex anymore, at first I was upset--more than upset but with time... I don't know? I guess I got used to the no sex. The only thing that I miss about sex is the act... well before the act. 

I miss walking out of the bathroom, and a dude looking at me with such **lust.** I never made love before, nor can I say I had mind blowing sex.  I have reversed uterus, and pcos.  To sum it up sex is pretty much painful. **However the** ***intimacy*** **oh how I miss that soooooooo much.**  I watch a ton of porn... it satisfy most of my needs.... Maybe if i buy a sex toy I will feel better! &lt;3 I don't know how to really feel about the no sex policy. I don't think I feel much about it since its been so long now. 

We have talk about in the past, and only to lead to bad arguments. At the end she told me I was being selfish for wanting sex, when there are other ways to obtain intimacy... And she's not wrong since we been together now for five years... plus marriage.  We really haven't talk about sex since. I did thought maybe on our honeymoon I would get some pity sex... HAHAHAHAH! I did not try to get some because I don't want to reopen this issue ***again.***  She never wavier how she feels about certain subject.

495,"Before I lay down the details of the situation, I would like to lay down some context.

* I lost my dad at the age of 8, and then my mother at 13
* I had existential crisis as a child with growing mild depression that worsened over the years
* My parents both were good and bad to me, they did their all to raise me but the circumstances were always against them, resulting in childhood abuse and domestic violence involving me to vent their frustrations

It's been 11 years since I lost 'everything' and became adopted by a relative of my parents. In these 11 years of adoption were chaos, my guardian found many faults in who I was and in what I like to do, things she deemed a girl of young age should not do. We got into a lot of situations where she'd be scolding me, and these situations would resemble the times my parents hit me. The way they shout, the way they looked at me, the way they hit me without a moment's thought. Eventually, I grew bitter at my guardian, I build walls, pretend to be someone I'm not infront of them, keep many things and my depression away from them.

One day, my guardian came up to me and said;

&gt;""Y'know, one day you should come with me to the orphanage to look after some kids, take them out to a theme park. Then you'll know how privileged and how much I love you.""

The very last part of what they said, stung.

Many, many years ago, my guardian and her friends used to take part in a charity event. Where applicants are able to take care of one or more orphans and take them out to the neighborhood theme park. However, there were harsh restrictions on what they can do, applicants are not to buy any unnecessary things for the orphan. And so, at the end of the day, the kids cried at my guardian's leg, wanting to get that one toy. My guardian felt terrible, but they had to abide the rules.

Since then, my guardian kept telling me this story over and over, about how bad they felt about not granting the kids wishes for getting that toy, then, turning back to me to tell me to go do that charity event. To see how 'lucky' I am, to see how much they love me, was what they wanted me to realize by doing that event.

I'm angry, I'm sad.

I'm angry because they don't realize what sort of a roller coaster of a life I was put through. Nobody in the family knew what happened to me, no one knows I was slapped for not knowing the right answer in my homework, no one knows I was left alone in a place miles away from home for making a small mistake, no one knows that my mother nearly tried to commit suicide because I made one small mistake. 

I'm sad because I don't want to be reminded of what I clawed myself out of. For these 11 years, the lack of both parents haunts me, I wanted to know what it was like to have your parents see you off to mid school, high school and now to university. I wanted to tell them so many things, of all the people I met, of all experiences I've made. I don't want to look at a reflection of myself in those kids.

Perhaps I'm over-reacting.

I would like to hear your thoughts, am I reacting normally?

Sure, I am privileged for having someone to adopt me, for putting a roof over my head, for putting me through mid and high school and to university. But must they put it in such a way as if I spat on their face saying 'I never wanted it'? Everyone's pain is subjective, don't treat people as if they have not gone through shit.",19Mar2020,1
496,"Not sure if this is the right community but here goes. I have a best friend who is like a sister to me but unfortunately she has this other best friend who is not like a sister to me, the opposite actually. We all used to get along in undergrad - her and I weren’t really friends but we got along okay. Lately however, she’s had the tendency to always make negative remarks towards what I do or say. She compliments everyone in our undergraduate group of friends- aside from me. She tries to present herself as this really “woke” and inclusive individual but her behavior towards me is not exactly a representative of that. 
I am getting really tired of her negativity and criticism, the worst thing is that I can’t really escape her. My best friend always includes her in everything from group texts to vacations. The rest of the group seems to have no problem with her- she has been a member of our undergrad group for a while now and never really directs her negatively towards them. I don’t know what to do.

When this is over will people come out of their houses and embrace the ability to see each other after we have taken simple things like shaking hands and hugs for granted for so long. Will the economy recover in any reasonable time? Will fear still take hold of parents who will continue to keep their children at a distance from others? Or will we come out a bit more thankful, forgiving and changed for the better? Will climate change be taken seriously once we see the results from what an entire country in isolation can do? 

I feel fortunate that I am able to spend this time with my immediate family and we are taking the self isolation seriously (even though we have not travelled) for the sake of our community.

502,"Bit of background. I moved cross country without a job lined up after college. Barely scraped by for nine months on freelance work and eventually took the first job I was offered, an entry level full time freelance position that aligned with my experience. I knew right away that this place wasn’t going to be the most trustworthy or ideal, but I was absolutely in no place to be picky at the time. 
Fast forward to three months later. I’m realizing not only does the job have little chance of stability or success (think similar to a failing startup) but I have to do a lot of things that aren’t ethically “best practice” and deal with some uncouth commentary (I’m the only woman here) and office drama. I’m definitely qualified for better pay and want to work somewhere actually in my industry/something that isn’t soul-sucking. My dad said when I was job hunting that getting your foot in the door was the hardest part, and now I’m past that, I have new stuff in my portfolio, etc. But between the state of the world/economy and the state of my life (desperately scrambling to save money to move out of my partner and I’s current place by early summer) the prospect of losing income is really fucking with me.
So i guess here’s what I need help with:
- do I tough it out a few more months while I’m saving money to move, and then apply for places once that’s done? (Part of me wonders if this job will even last that long) or do I start looking now, pray I get a position, and then tell employer adieu? Note that I won’t go back to the freelancing I did before since I couldn’t even make bills with that money half the time.  Note that I don’t want to leave employer on bad terms either since they have lots of connections that could help me down the line.
- since I’m technically a freelance employee, does it look less bad on my resume if I leave the job in under 6 months? Does it even matter really in terms of “loyalty” since I get no benefits? Am I just being super naive since this is my first serious job in awhile?
- am I dumb to even be considering a jump this big when I already struggled so long to get a job, and other people are much worse off than me rn? 

I can’t talk to my parents about this bc they’re financially in ruins due to this pandemic and my dad would berate me for even considering something like this when I only now just got settled, plus I don’t want them thinking they will have to help me financially between jobs and that I’m trying to mooch from them.",19Mar2020,1

For the past month though, every time he has come over on a Wednesday he just starts immediately moaning about his day to me. I wrote it off the first couple of times as I thought he was just having a bad week or two, but now its every time. When I've been waiting all day to see him and have his dinner ready it feels like a slap in the face. Last night we started arguing as I got upset about it. He came in and sat down and immediately closed his eyes saying 'if I was in my own house I'd be in bed right now' - I then suggested if he feels that way he should just go home. Its irritating because I'd prepared a really nice dinner for both of us and was excited to see him.

508,"\*Long post ahead I'm sorry\* 

I'm 22 (F) this year, my brother is 16.  We haven't had the best brother-sister relationship growing up but we used to get along up till the day my dad decided to file for separation. Since then I cannot stand to be around him for more than 5 minutes before I lose my temper. 

To keep the story short, I had a pretty easy time accepting that he wouldn't be part of my life because I always knew deep down that he liked another woman more than my mum. My brother had no clue and so he still tries to hang out with my dad every other week. Honestly, I don't fault him for wanting to hang out with another guy. Neither do I hold it against him that he wants his dad to still be a part of his life. 

Here comes the problem: Ever since the separation evolved into a divorce, my dad and his side of the family have been indulging my brother in things that we don't allow him to do. They don't tell him off for doing the wrong things. There's just a few eg. I can say off the top of my head. 

Eg #1 - My brother is addicted to the computer so my mum and I try to limit his usage of electronics at home. Be it the Switch, PS3, laptop or handphone. My mum even resorted to smashing our iPad once a few years back. He has free reign of his electronics usage whenever he goes to my grandma's place. So he grew up with the notion that we tend to limit his 'freedom'.

Eg #2 - He doesn't do well at school. We're Asian and that's a pretty big problem obviously. He has tutors for 3 subjects who are really really patient as far as I can tell. We also give him plenty of encouragement like buying him what he wants as rewards for doing well. But my mum still gets calls from his teachers saying that he keeps sleeping in classes. My dad and his family think that there is nothing wrong and say that we shouldn't keep pushing him too much. 

For the past 1-2 years, I find myself losing temper at him more and more often. I do try to be nicer to him but all he does is talk back or take my 'niceness' for granted. And then I get angry again because I think ""Why the hell am I being nice to him when he doesn't even appreciate what we have done for him?"".  He didn't see those times my mum and I ate lesser when we weren't doing so well so that he could have more to eat. He also didn't see those times where I took out my own earnings to buy food for him. All he knows is that we are the bad guys who restrict him. 

I have considered seeking a therapist to solve these issues because I don't want this to drag out into the future where it might affect how I interact with my kids. Like what if I also keep losing temper and lash out at my kids? But I'm also afraid that the things I say might result in my brother feeling depressed or feeling worthless. 

I'm sitting here writing this in a pretty desperate attempt to turn things around in my family. I do know that my family isn't the best but it will be the only family there for me when things aren't great.

My parents do not think the coronavirus is a problem at all and that everyone is just overreacting. (They're doing social distancing but that more cuz they already work from home). They even told me to stop wearing my face mask because I was ""making life hard for myself"".

I have a med check tommarrow at the SAME hospital with the SAME doctor! If she asks me if I have been exposed to someone who has been traveling and I tell her 'yes' she will realize my dad lied and he will get in trouble.

Two days ago we were talking normally like always, saying jokes and having fun, and the conversation hits a simple word she doesn’t like, and she says that if I dare to say it again she will vanish from my life. I say something like “bullshit, words emptier then my nutella jars”. I was clearly joking but, guess what? She blocked me and she started avoiding my Instagram messages and my messages on our group of friends, and it’s been two days. I tried to clear the situation on instagram but she refuses to answer, or even to read the messages. I asked one friend in common to try and ask her to be mature but she doesn’t even answer, or at the question “Do you think to avoid him till the end of the quarantine?” she answered “No, I was thinking more.” All just because I doubted her words, and now she has to prove that when she says something she means it. Fucking pride. I mean to close things with this person, but this is unbelievable, this is unacceptable. We are teenagers, alright, but I’ve never seen or heard something more immature. I don’t really know what to do, if talking with our friends in common about this, either in private or on our group, so that she’ll see what I type, or just leave her out of my life, for good. I don’t know, we have (maybe had) a strong friendship, but her fucking pride is destroying it.

I've always been good friends with my first major crush. We've never actually been a item. But I know she's been in love with me. And I've been in love with her.
Lately I've gotten the feeling she might be upset that it never happened. And I fear our friendship is actually hurting her. I'm afraid to ask her. As she is a good friend that I don't want to loose her. But I don't want her to be hurting if she's still has feelings.

I'm a 20-year-old man whose trying to improve my art skills, if I were to give my current skill a rank it'd be somewhere between a Newbie and an amateur. I've been drawing for some time off and on but I truly want to be able to feel confident in my art style and develop one that I'm proud of. I want to know anyway that I can learn the fundamentals of art, and in the long run become an animator. My dream is to someday create a 2d animated show that people will never forget and be remembered for many times to come. I don't scale my success by that standard but it is still a goal of mine. I'll consider my self a success once I've learned what's needed to succeed in the profession I want. I honestly don't know much about animating either but I'm willing to learn. Please in anyway that you can, bless me with your knowledge and experiences from your personal art journey. I don't have many artist friends so I'm asking you from the bottom of my heart.

I just wanted to know, my roommate works at Walmart and heard about this policy change for the whole coronavirus. 

He has diabetes, and he's a smoker (in the process of quitting). So he's genuinely scared cause his mom has bronchitis and a URTI and went to get checked in a county with a confirmed case of the coronavirus. So he's scared of the virus despite being in his early 20s. He has no insurance to cover him for anything so he's just getting insulin from Walmart. 

He had called out twice this week with 4 occurrences prior to the coronavirus situation and thought he was fine. He got a call from his manager telling him that he had to call sedgewick and file a claim saying that he was going to have to be out of work for 2 weeks so that the two days he called out would not count against him and put him over 4. 

That's not what the policy says right?! My understanding is that they can just call out if scared until they feel mentally prepared to go in again or something.

I would greatly appreciate more info and advice about what to do or a hidden catch someone finds to the policy.

So, I’m F18, and work a part time job at a non-essential store in the UK. I’m contracted 4 hours.
Today I’ve told them I won’t be coming in until they are forced to close (which is likely to be next week some time), due to the COVID-19 outbreak. I would only be missing two shifts. I’ve made this decision as I’m genuinely petrified of catching it and passing it onto my mum, who has asthma and my grandma who is old and has lots of health issues. 
Lots of non-essential retail stores have closed their doors In the uk in the interest of customers and staff safety, but ours haven’t and have just told us “to wash our hands more”, which I think is absolutely appalling. As a shop assistant I would be coming into close contact with 100s of people who refuse to stay at home, handling money and using public transport to get there. 
Staffing wouldn’t be an issue as we have more than enough people working on the shifts I’ve dropped out of.

All week my manager, who is also my cousin, has been saying that she thinks this outbreak is ‘ridiculous’ and that ‘it’s just a cold’, and isn’t a very understanding person so has taken my decision very badly.

So i’m trans FTM, born/assigned female but I identify as male. Been showing signs of gender dysphoria ever since i was very young. I have been out for over a year now and my parents still believe it is a phase. I know it is not a phase, I’m mature and I know what’s going on in my brain. I’ve been keeping this from my family for a while now and my mental health is decreasing.
Back in October of 2018, I had to switch schools because I was heavily suicidal. It was shortly before I realised I was trans. I was denying everything I felt and I was completely empty.
Instead of helping me, my parents took away my social media and electronics, thinking it would help.
It didn’t.
I still go to bed every night either feeling nothing/empty or wanting to kill myself.
I know they probably won’t help me, and I don’t know what to do. I can’t get a therapist, I have no money.
I’ve come out to some of the staff at my school, however the guidance counsellor told me the only way she could get me help (a therapist), she’d have to tell my parents.
I’m now stuck in between continuing like this, keeping my secrets to myself and dissociating from my surroundings and body every single day, or telling my parents and getting my only venting outlet taken away and probably sent to a military camp.

541,"hi I am a refugee, and now I am in a refugee camp. (I want to warn that I do not speak English very well) I understand that no one likes to listen to other people's problems. All people have enough of their worries. I think that we are born and die alone. This is normal, but, nevertheless, I will now try to describe my feelings. I'm not mature yet. (I don’t know if this is important.) I had to leave Ukraine (Crimea) with my parents because of political problems. Together with my family, I felt a danger to our lives because of our political views, so we decided to leave. Well, now, when I write this, we have already received several answers (refusals) from an organization that deals with refugee problems in the country in which I am now. Since, in their opinion, Ukraine is recognized as a safe country. And everyone around us says that for us it is impossible (or very difficult) or there is practically no chance to stay. But I understand that if we return, then at best, my father will be imprisoned. And it’s not clear what will happen to my mom. You see, parents are the most important thing for me in this world. I am ready to give my life for them. My mother always taught me that I should be strong, and always supported me. There are billions of people on the planet, but only two people in this world love me, my mom and dad, and now I understand that I can lose them, and this is an unbearable feeling. And it really scares me, I don’t know what will happen to us tomorrow, I don’t know what to do, all the time I have terrible thoughts in my head, I dream of suicide every night.

For example, many teens of my age now have problems (how to get tested at school next week or how to invite Jessica on a date). And I just want my parents to have a quiet life.

So thanks to COVID 19 my college shutdown for 2 weeks and I'm spending my time at home. Although it's a shutdown, we still have exams coming up once it reopens and live classes everyday.

The problem is, my younger sister thinks even i am completely free and should play with her. Even after explaining it to her she always tries to hang out with me. Now to clarify, as much as she is annoying me right now, i know it's just how kids her age are and she can't change it easily. What i need advice on is how i handle it when it gets too annoying.

The thing is, whenever im stressed i tend to push people away and tell them to leave me alone as i get my work done. If they won't, i unfortunately snap. And this sucks because I'm acting exactly like how my mum does, which was something i hated as a child. Things got especially bad when i completely screamed at her for loitering in my room asking me for stuff while my classes were going on. With this shutdown that'll last for one more week, i need to find ways in which i control my temper towards my sister if she's not listening, any ideas on how i can convince her i need a little alone time and any suggestions to me ensuring that i never snap on her again.

Their articles are so poorly made. Laced with typos, grammar errors, and a barfy style, it really concerns me that they are writing to inform an entire city and studentry.

I don't know if it's their new paper adviser, their faulty education, or their wacky new recruits who are to blame; nevertheless, their disappointing. What I really feel bad about is that the colleagues that I once worked with are too blind for the matter.

558,"Hi, I got a situation on my hands that I’m not able to resolve on my own due to being new to this roommate thing. I just moved out of my dads house about a year ago to start my adult life. My roommate is one of my best friends from high school and we get along great. It’s been nothing smooth sailing for the past 8 months, he’s pretty much the best roommate one could ask for. Pays bills, does dishes, easy to live with, the whole 9 yards, but up until here recently it hasn’t been very smooth sailing. 

He’s been in a long distance relationship with this girl since about January. She lives about 3 hours away from us. She’s a college student and to put it bluntly, I really don’t like her. Not wanting to get into too much detail but some of her offenses include: Calling my girlfriend fat, Body shaming my friend (He’s always been a pretty skinny guy), calling construction workers evil (she’s a bit of a tree hugger), Acts like me and my friend are stupid for not going to college like her (she doesn’t understand that not everyone has a grandma to pay their bills for them to attend college full time), and petty arguments she’s tried to start with me here and there. My friend is absolutely in love with this girl and to be honest, she was actually cool to be around for a little while there before she started showing her true colors so I can see why he fell in love with her. Anyways, this is a roommate subreddit not a relationship advice subreddit so let me get on with my problem. 

As everyone knows, colleges all around America have been shutting down for the semester and have switched to online classes. Last Friday night around 10pm she calls to let us know that she’s coming to live with us until May. No, she didn’t ask, she TOLD us she was. Even my friend was a little confused. I just rolled with it because I knew my friend would be happy but we’re not even a full seven days into her stay and I’m already ready to pack up and break my lease. I guess when she said “live with us” she really meant it. Whatever she could fit in her 2009 Camry she brought to our house. I woke up on Saturday morning to her decorations and shit everywhere in the living room and the room I call the nerd hut (that’s where all of our dark souls playing takes place). Plants and small bushes were literally just sitting EVERYWHERE in our house. Also, since she’s “moved in”, me and my buddy haven’t been able to hang out. Which, I understand. They’re long distance and long distance sucks so I COMPLETELY understand but, a few times when we’ve tried to hangout she’s thrown a fit and starts an argument with him and he has to leave to tend to her.

Ignoring my petty gripes, how would you deal with this situation? Because I’m at a lost. I can’t deal with this until May.",19Mar2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

Booked a trip to Mexico 3/21-3/3 from California to Mexico City. Was planning on staying in Mexico City hostel then hopping over to Puerto Escondido for the last few days. This was a reward for all my hard work in school and on my business as of late. It is not essential travel but I'd really like to go. My airline is offering that I can change the date to a later date at maximum of November 30th, but who knows how bad virus will be by then..?

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

\-Awesome Trip

\-Much needed relaxation

\-First time going abroad in awhile

\-I speak fluent Spanish

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\-Returning to the country might be a bitch with coronavirus being day to day

\-I may inadvertently by third degree infect someone's grandmother

\-tourist attractions and bars etc. are probably closing

\-Solo travel in Mexico, you know

I just listened tom him yelling at me telling me that I’m basically a bad friend and I’m annoying and making betty feel bad about herself and in turn bothering him.

I have trouble with social cues and have a lot of fear of double-talk and subversive meanings people try to tell me. I feel threatened and will believe bad things a girl hints at to see what you will believe about her.


Anyway, I basically just had this ordeal at work where multiple girls tried it on with me. There was one I wanted, and trying to get with that one started all this. It seems I'm a project and trying to ""fix"" me is the name of the game. Some of them alluded to this, including the last one who was saying things like ""I'm the last one fighting for the cause"" and ""I still believe in humanity."" This whole thing has made me feel like an ""other.""


Anyway, I failed with all of them and I failed to let them down the right way when it wasn't mutual. These girls likely now think I'm just broken. Is there any way to change a girl's mind who tried and tried to get you to listen but only got good results some of the time?",19Mar2020,1

\- He grew up in the times of the Great Depression and it has shaped his outlook on life

\- Also he had a rather historic time in WWII, he was in the Army 96th Infantry Division, involved in:

Bronze Star Medal- 

""PFC Henning (my grandpa) for heroic service in connection to military operations against the enemy on Okinawa Island on 20 April, 1945 when their battalion was making a frontal assualt on Nishibaru Ridge and was pinned down by heavy machine gun fire originating from the many enemy pillboxes...one anti-tank squad, of which PFC Henning was a member, volunteered to fire on the enemy strongholds, fully realizing that they would have to expose themselves to the fiercest of enemy artillery, mortar, and small arms fire... and then by bringing the gun to a relatively secure spot where minor repairs were made, with a resupply of ammunition they once again put the gun into action and commenced firing. It was through the valor and persistence displayed by PFC Henning and his squad in the face of intense enemy fire, that key enemy strongpoints were eliminated, thus paving the way for a successful attack.""

Some background... I’ve worked two jobs, my first job I interned there for 3 of my summers and was hired straight out of university and in my first year I was promoted (without having to ask) which pretty much doubled my income at the time. My current employer didn’t take my internship as work experience and only the 1.5 years I worked at my previous job as an employee. 

I’ve been working my current state job for two years and I’ve thought about asking my manager when we are allowed to work from the office again what are her considerations for a promotion and if she has the discretion to recommend one. 

I’m not sure how to ask this in a way that she won’t fear I would leave for a better opportunity (I don’t have any plans to leave for the foreseeable future) nor come off as unappreciative since she fought for the raises our section got last year but a promotion to the position above mine in the same section would add $5000 a year to my current pay since that is the bottom of that position’s salary scale and would add significant free cash that I would need to keep my head above water and pay off debts.

It upsets me not that he’s successful but rather I’m such an inferior person.  They’ve got talent and something they’re really good at and I do not.

582,"
So some of you may have seen my post from yesterday, I decided to redo it because I didn’t have time to tell the whole story. Last Monday, my father-in-law passed away. My fiancé’s dad. His sister’s husband, has now gone crazy. 

Here’s the backstory: 
Until literally 4 days ago, we thought my BIL, we’ll call him Justin, had a totally perfect life/childhood. We always knew he was a little weird, but weird like, tried to be a mentor to everyone and was very overbearing when it came to his opinions. It was annoying but whatever. Same with his family, they’re all super conservative, annoying people. But over all pretty normal, like big house, movie theater in the house, Justin spent half of every holiday at our house and half at their house. He bragged about them, seemed to love them, truly. There was no issues at all. Even his wife of 7 years thought Justin’s relationship with his parents was perfectly fine. 


Now:
Were all sitting outside on the back porch, because when FIL died we all moved in with mother in law. Justin and sister are moving soon, they’re having a house built. Justin starts saying he smokes weed because it helps him with things that we could never imagine, we don’t know the person he is, he’s done evil things etc. So we’re like ok Justin well we love you anyway whatever, trying to brush it off thinking he’s just high. Then he starts talking about how he had a horrible childhood, his dad was evil and his whole family hid stuff from him, he moved out when he was 15 and lived with an evil girlfriend. It all sounded shitty, but I also had a severe traumatic childhood, so I was struggling to sympathize for him at that time. THEN, he starts prying me about my childhood. I’ve never ever ever talked to anyone about my life and childhood because it’s something I healed and grew from, talking about it to me is triggering and pointless. He made a comment “I know we’ve all struggled in the past but what I’ve been through can’t even compare” like..... almost trying to say that what he’s seen and gone through is far worse than all of us. 
No big deal, didn’t care. 

The next day, Justin has a two hour long conversation with my fiancé pretty much about the same thing, saying that he beat him with a belt and embarrassed him when he was a child and that his whole family hid stuff from him, his sister was a druggy, almost died, his family kept that from him because he was young, no big deal, really. 

After this conversation with my fiancé Justin leaves and says that she needs to go have a talk with his family because he just can’t cope if he doesn’t so we’re all extremely stressed out, obviously mourning over our father passing and now wondering where Justin is. Apparently he went and told off his family and told him that they were evil and that he couldn’t live anymore if he didn’t tell them all of the stuff that he hated about them etc. 

Justin ends up in a police car they sent him to BayCare which is in institution in our area for mentally ill, He was literally about to sign the papers to go there. He ended up coming home instead but he hasn’t stopped talking about his childhood and all of these crazy things his parents are confused we are also very confused and don’t really know what to do to help him. His wife and honestly most of us seem to think it’s a cry out for attention because he hasn’t really been getting a lot of attention considering he was the least close to FIL. sorry this is long and if you made it this far thank you I just want to get this off my chest. He just brought two loaded guns into a house where my son lives, and has told me stories about him putting guns up to his mouth before. It’s in a safe but I still I worry about his well-being. What is going on. 

TL;DR: FIL died now brother in law is going crazy.

Edit: for anyone who will say take him to therapy, we have tried, he actually refuses and recommends we go, as we *clearly* need it more.",19Mar2020,1

593,"I never drank alcohol. Never really appealed to me and was always annoyed at how my peers back in high school and college ended up doing stupid things because of liquor. Worse, it was always me and another friend having to drag their asses back to their flats and getting puked on. I never gave in to peer pressure and flatly declined any drink offers during social gatherings. I'm not bound by any religious beliefs; I don't drink because I don't want to. To put it simply, I never cared about trying different types of wine/whiskey, getting hammered, or loosening up. 

No, I currently do not have any serious life problems--or any external forces--driving me to turn to alcohol. 

Why, then, am I considering it? It's because I've always been curious about what 'loosening up' or 'lowering your inhibitions' really mean when you drink a shot or two. Does it really give you a confidence 'boost' during parties and get you out of your shell? Does alcohol really make it easier to socialize and get on the dance floor? I am introverted but have no problems socializing if I'm with the right people. If I am acting like a wallflower at a party, 90% of time it's because I don't want to be there in the first place. I'm old enough to know the consequences of irresponsible drinking. I never smoked, drank alcohol, or did drugs. Out of those three vices, I only saw myself trying alcohol but never really followed it up. 

If it helps, there is another side as to why I still avoided trying alcohol up till now: I became short-tempered after college (mostly due to the stress in my line of work).",19Mar2020,1

I am a girl with delicate fingers. calluses were something that I was aware of, but I didn't think they would be THAT bad. I know this is common knowledge for some, but I had no idea that I would have to cut my nails root-short.

I've played other instruments; none of them take as long to learn a guitar. It takes an incredible amount of strength, surprisingly. The F-cord feels like hell on my forefinger and is impossible for me to do.

I know, I sound like a delicate brat. But it makes me realize that guitar is more an art than a just ""pick it up, learn a song in a few days,"" type of instrument. If any of you could offer any advice, I would really appreciate it. Whether that's with tips on how to make playing easier, or simply selling my guitar. I really, really want to learn how to play, but I'm not sure that at this moment in time that it is for me if I don't find the motivation and move my way through the frustration.

I came downstairs to find her on her phone. All my stuff was in a pile on the table. I reached for my wallet (I have a debit card in my name tied to an account with roughly $6,000 USD in it.) She was yelling about how it was all her stuff and elbowed me. I successfully grabbed the wallet; it was my first priority. She was yelling at me that it was her money, it is not. So I grabbed her computer (in desperate need of both a distraction and petty revenge) and started to run. She tried to take it back and I made a mockery of her elbowing me (softly extended it.) She began slapping me as hard as she could attempted to knee me in the crotch. I then put the computer on the table, and we both reached for my phone and we both attempted to wrestle it out of the others hands. She then did an obviously fake slip and fall and faked being in pain just to try and get emotion out of me. I began to make a mockery of her yelling at me stating that ""Oh, it's your fault you fell"", etc. I forgot to mention this earlier but before I grabbed the wallet she was yelling at me about how it was my fault that this and that happened at various times.

598,"So for background I’m a guy in my early 20s. I’ve never stolen or vandalized anything in my life. I’ve never used a drug or taken a drink of alcohol. I’ve never even got a speeding ticket or been thru a traffic stop. I’m in college and since my on campus classes were cancelled (due to the Coronavirus) I have to count my steps for my walking class.

So I was walking around my hometown down an alley when this junky flatbed truck came flying down the alley behind me. He was driving like a maniac, and I was afraid he was going to hit me. I walked quickly but didn’t run to get out of his way. He honked at me but I walked down another alley. So then he kept appearing everywhere near me for a few blocks and I was walking in various places to lose him. All the while he honked a few times. I thought he wanted to hurt me!

A few minutes later a sheriff and police pull up beside me. The sheriff jumps out of his car and hollers, “hey boss!” Then the police jumps out and yells at me to get my hands out of my pockets. They asked me what I was out doing and then told me that somebody reported I was standing in an alley and started fleeing when the person pulled down it. I calmly told them what really happened. Then the sheriff asked me if I was on probation and I said no sir. They ran my ID. Then they just looked at each other, gave my ID back and told me I could go. They didn’t arrest me, give me a ticket, or even lecture me.

The report was a lie. I was walking down the alley, not standing in it. And I was only fleeing because I thought the stupid guy wanted to run me over or something. He was driving like a maniac and then started following me around. Did he think I’d want to stop and talk to him after that? I’m just terrified to leave my house now. I’m afraid I’ll see that guy in the truck or the police will arrest me (it’s a small town - population of 5,000). I’m probably going to be terrified of police the rest of my life! And it upsets me that they thought I was a common criminal and on probation. I almost got arrested for walking down an alley, come on!

Anyway, how can I get over this and return to my normal life and be able to walk again and not live in fear?",19Mar2020,1

600,"Ever since I started college a few years ago, I have encountered so much conflicting belief systems and approaching towards living life. That said, in the context of living in a fairly left-leaning college town, I have met so many people criticizing others for ""casting judgement"" towards the personal choices of others. I will give you a few examples....

&gt; Martina is wearing a gray tank top and denim cuffed minishorts, another woman Emily sees Martina and gets offended due to her wearing attire in a manner that goes against how she was raised. Emily attempts to make a scene by saying...

&gt; ""Emily: Why is that girl dressing like she is coming from Maudi Gras?""

&gt; ""Lexi: Emily, some people would find that very rude (slut-shaming) to judge someone for how they dress. It is fine to disagree, but if you aren't a close friend, its best to keep your disagreement to yourself.

&gt; ""Emily: I am just saying that I do not approve of that based on how I was raised...""

&gt; ""Lexi: That is fine if you disagree, but if it can come across as insensitive, then its best to keep it out of the public discourse.""

It is so weird that ever since I started college, people in society have frequently said things to me along the lines of ""it's a free country dude, you do you, and I don't feel it is appropriate to cast judgement"". Regardless of the consequences of the decisions I would make or whether or not the actions align with my values.

The problem is that morality/truth does exist, but it seems that everyone is pushing this narrative of free agency and not casting judgement that is so pervasive and ubiquitous. Can someone please ELI5 what is going on, how American culture got here, and how to make sense and cope with this?",19Mar2020,1

602,"Hey guys,
I am working on a WebGL 3D graphics project and I am facing issues in figuring out the coordinate points of my model.

What I want is that a free software that will draw a line from point 1 to point 2 in x,y,z coordinate system which has to be interactive. So imagine I want to draw a cube.

A cube has 6 faces and each face has 4 vertices.
Therefore if I plot 8 vertices (8 because some vertices will share the same position) it should end up drawing lines and therefore make a 3d cube.

I need advice on which software to use.

I have googled it and could not find any. Hence why I am asking for an advice.

603,"Hey y'all,

So this is weird and will probably sound pretentious. 

For the past few years my wife has kind of.. forgot my birthday? We moved to a new state for her job two years ago and she's done really well for herself. Anyway, last year she forgot my birthday. No card, no gift, and eventually we ended up at a taco Bell drive through and saw a movie. But I got upset because I always put thought into her birthday and even though I earn considerably less than her I work my butt off to make sure she feels special.

This year my birthday rolls around. I get a sheet of stickers from eBay that cost about $2. Then something she had ordered got lost in the post (turns out it was a video game that I had never mentioned). She gave me a card that she quickly wrote in and Indian take out. Meanwhile my family back home (I moved overseas to be with my wife) bought a cake for me, even though they couldn't have it with me. 

I feel really selfish, especially when there are people out there who have no one to acknowledge their birthday. (If you're one of those people, let me know and I'll pm you on your birthday or send a card). 

But.. I just wish she would put more effort you know? Last year I got her flowers, a nice dinner, a Nintendo switch, a video game, a t-shirt a membership to a theme park and some trading cards she had mentioned. All things that she loves and all things that mean something to her. 

Would it be weird if I just do my birthday myself? Like I've been broke as a joke since we moved, and I'm trying so hard to get back on my feet financially (long story). I spent $10 on flashcards recently and that felt like a huge pjrchase. But I'm thinking I'll just buy myself a gift that I want, get myself some flowers, and treat myself for just that one day.",19Mar2020,1

608,"Not sure if in the right place. Please redirect if not.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for a few months and she wears skirts/dresses a lot. Recently I’ve noticed that she has a habit of unintentionally flashing her underwear a lot. Whether it’s bending over from the waist rather than the knees, sitting with her legs apart, or not knowing that her skirt has ridden up when sitting around, she’s often showing a lot.  She never sits with her skirt completely up and her underwear “out”, but it’s not far off it sometimes.

If it was something she consciously did when it’s just the two of us around the house (as a kind of tease thing) that’d be one thing, but we don’t live together, and she has other housemates, so I do  wonder if she’s flashing them all the time (without knowing). I do wonder if she has the same thing happens at work as  well.

It’s not my business at all, but I feel like she should know (I'm assuming  she doesn't). She’s been wearing skirts/dresses for years, so it’s not like she’s not used to them and is flashing because of that. I’m happy for her to dress however she wants, but I feel she should know if she’s showing her underwear a lot.

610,"I'm early thirties (f) - generally a healthy person but when I was 23 had my lungs knocked out by 40% and developed asthma due to the common flu. It went undiagnosed for a year - which resulted in severe anxiety - which led to an anti anxiety drug prescription. The drug ended up poisoning me and for 3 years I've been recovering. 

Effectively I've had to self isolate for most of the time as my nervous system was injured and being outside is too overstimulating most of the time. 8/10 times I tried to go out I'd end up tachycardic and have had 30 ambulances for fast heart rate (although thankfully I'm always fine - no damage done).

I've had an A-Z of symptoms because of this poisoning and even the common cold has left me barely able to stand at times. I sometimes feel like there's still \*something\* in my lungs from the original flu.

So, I don't want to take my chances with Coronavirus.

I'd feel a lot differently minus the  above issues. I'm following the 12 weeks isolation advice given by our government that states anyone with asthma should self isolate.

 I think because I'm 31 people perhaps think I'm overreacting but I know  how much my body has been through with the first flu, and then  withdrawal. Hard for people to get who don't know withdrawal. 

However, my housemate (my Dad - temporarily!) says he won't stop working or seeing his girlfriend. We currently live on the seafront on the edge of the  country in a remote part of our country- so I feel relatively safe. However this person's work and girlfriend live on the outskirts of the capital - a hotspot.

Realistically I'd say him coming home every week  from there is a risk. He's said he's taking every precaution but I  still think it's a risk as it can survive in the air (and it's not like  it's a 3 storey house). 

The plus side of him being here might be if I do get it there's someone else here, with a car. The plus side of staying here too is I can take some walks to the beach.

614,"So, this is my cousin's family. Alex- my cousin (43M) and his wife Darlene (49F) have 2 girls, Hannah - 15 and Callie - 8.

About 6 years ago, my cousin's wife had a small mass in her breast that was found. Because this was the second one found in 15 years, she decided to have a full mastectomy and reconstruction. It was hard on everybody. She started to spin out. About a year later, she starts to rekindle the relationship with the guy she was going to marry before she met my cousin. She stopped the relationship when she found out he was getting married. Later, she ended up getting involved with 2 different guys. I don't know for sure how involved. On a family trip about 3 years ago, she faked an anxiety attack while driving, just so she could get on the phone and talk to one of the guys. She chose to get her daughter's (5 and 12 at the time) worked up and scared. While I'm hesitant to say that somebody faked an anxiety or panic attack, I know that in this case, it was fake. She spent the whole trip talking to one of the guys as much as she could, even stopping ditching the girls and her husband. She's stolen her husband's credit card and spent $600 at a furniture store 2-3 hours away, and the furniture never showed up at the house. They don't have $600 to waste. The conclusion her parents came to is that she bought furniture for one of the guys. When Hannah was 12, she found Darlene's phone and saw a text conversation between Darlene and a guy were saying ""I love you, but maybe we shouldn't do this because I have a wife and kids."" Well, Hannah tried to run the phone down to her grandparents' house next door, and Alex was running after her trying to take the phone because I guess if he could hide it and pretend it wasn't happening, it would somehow be better? Darlene works nights, and every night, she's gone. My cousin has no idea if she's actually at work or if she's off with another guy, and he's at the point he doesn't care.

Alex and Darlene make very similar amounts of money, once taxes and everything is taken out, yet Alex pays every single bill, almost all of groceries, with 2 exceptions. Darlene pays for her own car payment, maybe $50 max a month on groceries, and Callie's private school tuition, which is lower because Alex works for the school system. Recently, Hannah was pulled out of the private school and put back into a school where she is bullied and has very few friends, just so Darlene doesn't have to pay tuition.

Recently, Darlene has been toying emotionally with Callie. She'll get Callie all worked up showing her a house, saying ""wouldn't that be a nice house? I'm going to try to buy that house and we'll move in,"" knowing full well she can't afford it and won't move in, and at the end of the month it's time to crush Callie's hopes and tell her ""we're not moving.""

Darlene will steal money from the girls. From what Darlene's parents and the girls have said, it sounds like Darlene has stolen a minimum of $300 from the girls over the past 2 years. Since Darlene steals and refuses to buy tampons for Hannah, I got a tool box and a keyed padlock and tampons, and that's where Hannah keeps her tampons and money.

Hannah has told me recently that she's been having anxiety/panic attacks, and while it's partially due to being young and having anxiety, I know that the family situation, especially with her mother, is very detrimental. Hannah's told me that her mom has called her a demon child multiple times, has called her a bitch, and has slapped her. Hannah is a very sweet, mild mannered, gentle girl. I've known her most of her life, and I've seen her at her best and at her worst, and even at her worst, she is **not** a demon child, and does not deserve to be slapped.

I'm not on Alex's side, I'm not on Darlene's side. I'm on Hannah and Callie's side, because it's clear that neither Alex nor Darlene are on their side. Alex does not stand up for the girls, and he's told me that the only reason he's still married is because of the girls, and he didn't even want kids. He will not stand up for himself, much less his own children. Alex told me last week that Callie had to have 5 molars removed (thankfully baby teeth), and another 2 will need fillings, but Darlene is putting up a fight about fillings being put in because of mercury and heavy metal poisoning and that type of stuff. She won't get fillings as long as her mom has any say in it. Callie has dental issues because she's 8, and doesn't have a parent who will consistently help her create a healthy habit of brushing her teeth well and often. Alex said that he hopes that having teeth removed will be a lesson for Callie to brush her teeth more. It's not.

Both of the girls are suffering to some degree from the parental issues.

Two days ago, I got a friend request on Facebook from someone who was a mutual friend to a friend that I have in real life. I decided to simply ignore it, and move on.

The next day (yesterday), I decided to just accept, thinking that she would be a Facebook friend and nothing more.

She then texted me via Facebook Messenger, asking me if I wanted to be friends with her. Me, thinking that we would simply be internet friends, said yes. We then texted through Facebook Messenger, and we texted about dogs and pets. She then asked me for my number, which I then gave her (albeit reluctantly.) I did not really want to give my number to someone who I only knew through Facebook.

She then texted me again via normal message app, and she texted saying that she wanted to hang out sometime after the coronavirus quarantine ends.

Honestly, I'm a bit creeped. I'm sure she means well, and I'm sure it's not one of those profiles who is a catfisher (her profile picture doesn't look like a picture of an attractive girl taken from online and she has multiple photos of herself posted on her profile) but I haven't met her in real life before any of this happened.

And the friend that I have in real life only has her on Facebook Messenger and she does not have her phone number, meaning that they probably don't hang out together themselves, and I probably should've just said I only had Messenger.

She still text me frequently (every couple of hours or so) and I don't want to hang out with someone who I've only met via social media and haven't seen in real life.

627,"I [20M] just packed up and left college yesterday after they kicked us out and returned to my home in the Chicago area last night. Today my mom has explained that my great uncle (estranged from the family, I’d never heard of him) lived in Seattle and died unexpectedly about three days ago. He has no spouse or children, and his only real relatives are his sisters who are in their 70s and obviously cannot travel as it’s too dangerous right now. 

Because of this, my mom wants her, my dad, my younger brother [18M] and I to fly to Seattle tomorrow morning so we can “take care of things there”. Because airports could get shut down at any moment, we may end up having to drive a rental car all the way back down to Illinois after we’re done. 

My question is: does this make sense? Washington is one of the states in the US with the most cases of coronavirus, and it doesn’t exactly seem safe. At least, it doesn’t make sense to me for my parents and brother to travel to Washington all together at this time. Am I wrong for being worried that we could pick up the virus and potentially spread it to others upon our return? Is the risk lower than I think it is? Would it be better if only my parents went? I’m confused, frustrated, and a little worried. I’m open to any thoughts or opinions on this matter. Thanks. 



TLDR: My estranged great uncle died unexpectedly at his home in Seattle, and his sisters are too old to travel at this time so my mom wants herself, my dad, my brother, and me to go take care of things related to his death like clean up his house etc. This doesn’t make sense to me given the state of the world and travel right now.",19Mar2020,1
628,"Hello, so I'm not exactly sure if this is the right sub but it seemed fitting. It started at the beginning of the semester. My boyfriend and I were a couple hours away and could only see each other on weekends after we'd previously been living together. 

We decided that an open relationship during our distance would be beneficial. 

I met this guy let's call him Melvin. We hung out fooled around and then he became more of a friend and we moved on. Towards the end of our fwb arrangement he starts calling me mommy and that disgusts me and makes me not want to have sex anymore. I also accidentally touched this piece of hair that was caked with poop, which was disgusting as all hell and I had to hold back a gag. He also wanted to cuddle frequently despite me not wanting sex anymore. He complained about not having a girlfriend, the  said he'd rather not date me because of my race, not that I wanted to date him anyway.

This is where things get weird. He began dating this girl, let's call her Samantha. I was throwing a party at my apartment and he invited her. He told me that I shouldn't mention anything to do with his feelings, which I thought was kind of strange if they were already dating but went along with it. 

Samantha and I hit it off and we talked to each other pretty much all night. She doesn't seem to be romantic towards him at all. Later he tells me that he hasn't told her of his feelings which confuses me greatly since he told me that they were dating. 

I encourage him to tell her how he feels, he does one day and she reveals that she's a lesbian. So he made  up a relationship in his mind when she gave no indication of her being interested. This is when the icky feeling began to creep into my chest. 

Later I would find him looking through my things. Smelling random things like bags and clothing. He'd start inviting himself over. He would chew weirdly and stick his tongue out the side of his mouth often like a frog. I felt super bad for him, he told me his friends never texted him back. I didn't understand that it was his personality.

I tried so hard to keep the friendship going but each time I hung out with him I would get this ever increasingly icky feeling. Like the hairs standing up on the back of my neck. 

The last straw is when I asked him to pick up this package I sent to my old apartment that was near his. In exchange I'd give him some snacks and rum. He brings the package and I'm thankful but see that he's looking through my things again.

632,"Since I was small, my mom has kept telling me how bad I look and it’s really annoying. I’m a female and I’ve told her many times that I like my natural thick eyebrows and she keeps telling me that I should make them thin like she does. I did it once and I hated it but she won’t stop telling me how much she missed them. I also think she’s far more attractive than me and in middle school I ended up shaving half of my eyebrows off because I felt so bad about them. It did not go well.

I also got a haircut that’s easy for me to maintain and she tells me that she misses my old hairstyle which I hated because it was too much for me to deal with. One day my hair was a little frizzy and she told me that I look like a drug addict or a hippie. Then I moved it in front of my shoulders and she said it’s much better. MY HAIR CANT STAY IN ONE PLACE.

She constantly tells me I have too much acne and she buys me a bunch of natural remedies for it(which I don’t think are doing much.) She’s afraid of the dangerous side effects acne medications have.

This is a bit off topic but every time I want to buy something (an outfit or something for my room) she has to give me her input on it. She gives me harsh criticism when there’s really nothing wrong with it. Plus, she gets upset even if it’s my money.",19Mar2020,1
633,"Hi guys,

I understand we’re all going through the same trying and unknown times right now. My elderly mother and immune-compromised disabled sister live together about three towns over - 25 minutes away from me. I’ve been feeling ill and have been advised to quarantine especially since they’re both considered very at-risk. They don’t have transportation outside of a senior bus my mother takes once a week, which has now been cancelled. They have run out of food and supplies and I have tried EVERY app, website, and grocery store to order them food and supplies to be delivered and I’ve had no luck. There’s nothing available for at least the next week. I’m wondering if anyone knows of any service that will deliver at least food to seniors? The township stopped by her house yesterday and gave them basic necessities, good for a few days, which I’m very grateful for. After they run through that though they’re pretty much screwed. Please, if anyone knows of any service that could help it would be greatly appreciated. I’ve about $60 to spend on her for the time being. Also we’re located in the USA- New Jersey.

To sum it up me and my crush have been talking for a few days (she messaged first too!)

Schools been cancelled and we (through messaging yesterday) found out we’re both going to sixth form which is an alternative to college

On my Snapchat I sent most people a message saying thanks for the 5 years we had at school and I wish them the best of luck 

In that message it said I hope to see some in sixth form and she said ‘see you in 6 months’

We snapped each other back a few times and I told her I’ll see her in 6 months and she said “Yeah I’ll see you in sixth form or before then”

636,"I'll keep this short. Throwaway obviously. 

I've worked at a job that I've more or less hated for almost 2 years now. I've been lied to and manipulated since my very first interview day. This isn't my real job, it's just a part-time secondary source of income. I landed my real job during my time working at the job in question, and once they found out, like children, they asked what they would have to do in order to get me to quit my real job and stay with them full-time (for less pay, SIGNIFICANTLY less hours, etc etc). They ask me this just about every week.

My boss is never around in-person because he runs 3 businesses. The last time I've seen him in-person was right after Christmas. My initial thoughts were to send him an email with my resignation, and offering to meet in-person should he want to discuss things further. 

My only fear is that I really, REALLY don't want to have YET ANOTHER conversation about why they're so great and why I should work with them over my real job. Honestly, I have the animosity that they don't even deserve a face-to-face with me after everything. Never gonna use them as a reference, never gonna see any of them again, nothing. It's a bridge I would not care if I burned. I want to keep things professional, but I'm not going to sit here and argue about quitting my real job for them either.",19Mar2020,1

I consider him an acquaintance rather than a friend tbh only because we don’t talk that much. After the quarantine break, I wanna try speaking to him again.

I’ve been liking him for probably half a year now. Unlike my other crushes, I’ve never had dirty thoughts of my current one (I’ll admit, tmi). Yeah, he IS cute, but I feel like he’s different. He’s different from all my other crushes because I genuinely want to date him. His personality isn’t perfect, but I like it. My personality isn’t perfect so that’s ok.

641,"So as everyone is probably aware, the COVID-19 virus has been affecting people everywhere and causing places to shut down.

Here in Canada, our Prime Minister has publically announced that all borders are closing, and asked people to avoid all unnecessary travel, and closed all unnecessary work.

Essentially, everything but the some of the upper branches of the government are closed. 

However, Telus (an ISP/ phone services provider) refused to close services, and only allowed the upper management people and HR to work from home. Everyone else is expected to show up to work despite the obvious health risks.

We were told that many measures would be taken to make our workplace more secure, like using industry-grade disinfectant, cleaning the entire place top to bottom, employees will be placed 6 feet apart for social distancing, people won't be allowed to change places, working from home is being explored as an option...

However, it turns out that none of that is true. They didn't clean the place, just gave us a bunch of wipes and basic disinfectant for us to clean our desks ourselves, we're still sitting less than one feet apart, employees who are clearly sldisplaying symptoms or have been in contact with people with covid-19 are still urged to come to work, otherwise they're expected to burn through their sick days/vacation, and have to resign if they refuse, in which case it's been made abundantly clear they might not have a job when they come back unless they can prove they caught the virus.

////

Essentially my workplace isn't closing down despite our government declaring the situation serious enough, and they are threatening people into coming to work anyways, despite not even taking proper precautions. 

I don't personally believe the virus to be a serious situation for me, however I'm really starting to feel like I'm being put on the frontlines to risk my relatives' lives for a meager paycheck when obviously every other business refused to take that risk.

Once I finished high school my parents connected me with a company working with mentally ill and I was gaslighted into believing that I was mentally disabled and had a delusion of a neurodegenerative disease.

during one semester at college I randomly developed extremely painful symptoms and I was diagnosed with autonomic dysfunction, I could no longer run, exercise or go outdoors if the weather was above 75 degrees.

my neurologists knew it was all real and said that my autonomic nervous system was damaged, and that I have a neurological disease causing subjective memory loss and dysautonomia.

I challenged her, asked her what she was doing, she responded saying she was looking for her cat, and that the garage was half open, it wasn’t because she had to turn the handle to open it.

Sometimes I thought that she had some feelings for me too, but she was also shy,too. One day, some friends of her came to me and said that she likes me. I awkwardly said ""really?!,I love her too"". Then after about 30 mins she came to me and said ""do you really like me?"",and I said yes. We chatted a lot since then, we liked each other so much. Until summer came, I had an accident,and I didn't go to the athletics since then. We didn't see each other so frequently so we kinda started to break up little by little. Until we had some kind of fight, I do not remember that conversation very good,but it wasn't a pleasant one,either. Time has passed...until next summer.

When I did my mother broke up with her bf and he helped her move into an apartment. My mother isn’t the most sane/stable and I’ve been very worried about my sister. My mother was fired from her job and since then she hasn’t put any effort into finding a new one unless someone else does all the work for her. She tries to find guys to date so they can take care of her. Instead of paying rent my mother has been buying $2,000 puppies. She bought two and now has a total of 3 dogs; which isn’t allowed in her apartment. She recently got a check from a settlement from a car accident she was in forever ago and she thinks she can live off of the $5,000 indefinitely.

Due to the Coronavirus she won’t be evicted that soon, but when it clears up she’ll be kicked out.

And he tries to spread lies between me and the other roommate, making him impossible to trust. 

He proclaims he is in seminary school in biblical studies, but he is one of the most immature and rude people I have ever met (for being 31 years old). 

Because of the coronavirus, I have been working from home, and yesterday the internet quit working. Long story short, he left on Monday for an undetermined amount of time because of the virus, he is staying with his mom. I have the suspicion that he had the internet turned off because he is not in the apartment at the moment, which makes it very difficult for me to work from home. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this situation? I’m having to restrain myself from snapping on him and yelling at him, as I know that’s exactly what he wants. And I don’t want to play his games. I just want to be able to feel safe and comfortable in my own apartment. Any help or suggestions are welcome.",19Mar2020,1
672,"My cousin just told me yesterday that the person who I thought was my grandpa is not my biological grandpa. (Note: My cousin knew because my grandparents were divorced and the son he had with his new wife knew this secret and told my cousin.) I was in shock and I still can’t believe it. Apparently, my grandma had an affair and that’s how my Dad was conceived.

I don’t know if my dad knows or not, but I’m not sure if I should tell him. To my knowledge, he’s lived his whole life thinking that this man was his father. So, in a way, he’s been lied to his entire life and I think he deserves to know the truth.

My dad might know or have suspicions already, because the man who I thought was my grandpa was very short and my dad is very tall. But, I really don’t think my dad knows and the man who I thought was my grandpa really acted like my grandpa and treated my dad as his son. If my dad doesn’t know and I tell him, it will cause a lot of family issues. However, I feel that it is his right to now who is real father is. I’m not sure what to do. Nothing this strange has really happened to me before.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has any advice on how to go about this, please let me know what you think I should do.",19Mar2020,1
673,"So,this is a little long,do not read it if you dont want to. Everything started when I was 14, I was in the 7th grade of school and I went regularly to some athletics training. There, I saw a very pretty girl, I thought I fell in love, and so I did. I didn't even know her name,yet I loved her more than everyone. I was pretty shy so I didn't make any move. Sometimes I thought that she had some feelings for me too, but she was also shy,too. 
One day, some friends of her came to me and said that she likes me. I awkwardly said ""really?!,I love her too"". Then after about 30 mins she came to me and said ""do you really like me?"",and I said yes. We chatted a lot since then, we liked each other so much. 
Until summer came, I had an accident,and I didn't go to the athletics since then. We didn't see each other so frequently so we kinda started to break up little by little. Until we had some kind of fight, I do not remember that conversation very good,but it wasn't a pleasant one,either.
 Time has passed...until next summer. We haven't talked anymore sincer that fight,unfortunately. After some time, I heard some things that another girl started to like me. I didn't want to be rude so I accepted to be her boyfriend, I dont know why I did that,she wasn't beautiful at all. We made a group of friends and sometimes i said things about my last girlfriend. Rude things,more specifically. Like ""that idiot girl"",""that ugly girl"". I didn't know why I did that,because i still loved her a lot. I was just stupid. 
After some time I argued with my new ugly girlfriend. And then,I wanted to get back with my last beautiful girlfriend. We started chatting again, everything went well. 
But it couldn't be so great,could it? That ugly ex-girlfriend of mine showed the beautiful girl that I loved those rude texts of mine about her. She was so angry at me that she blocked me on every social media possible. But I loved her from the bottom of my heart. Right now she makes fun of me sometimes,and she practically hates me... and I really want to get back with her... please help me! (And also sorry for my bad English)",19Mar2020,1

So. I generally want men's perspective on this (I'm female)

What are the signs that he just isn't really into me? Or alternatively that he is?

686,"So about 2 years ago I had a great group of friends including 5 guys and 4 girls.  This group lasted about a year due to relationships in the group between girls and guys got sideways. Now that all doesn’t matter. In the beginning of that group existence I fell in love with a special girl, like really in love. But then she hooked up with a friend of mine and later another friend. My heart was broken ofcourse but I worked my way around it and became best friends with her for about a year. Like really good friends, we texted  each other every day all day, and now that I look back on it I was friendzoned HARD! But yeah  eventually the group split up but me and her kept contact. In the mids of our friendship I really understood that I never got over her..
And I was still very in love with her, fortunately she never found out and we kept being bestfriends. Our friendship ended when a little fight broke our friendship for good (sometimes we had fights). I thought it was just one of those arguments, where she tried to show me she cared about me or something. Sometimes she would cry etc. 
My friends always called our friendship “ a relationship without sexual activities but with love ”
After the “breakup” I kindof got myself to forget about all of the group and especially her . I saw her at school from time to time but she wouldnt even look at me. This whole breakup thing was about a year and half ago.  I didn’t really think about her at all anymore. But a few days ago I got a dream where she was in it and out of nowhere I just think about her and the group alot. With the whole quaratine going on my mind is almost always focused on her.

688,"So I need advice on what to do about my dad and his weird touching. I’m a boy by the way.

One again I’m a 12 year old boy:
        My dad has was never really around when I was super young. My parents got divorced and my mom took me and my sister from my dad and about hour from my dad. We would get to see him sometimes but it was never long usually only a weekend and it wasn’t always fun with mainly me getting yelled at or picked on by either my dad or my two sister(the second one was my from my dads first marriage). At the same time my mom had remarried with a very physically abusive man. She wouldn’t stay with him long with us moving out of there when I was around 8. 
      We moved in with my grandparents in my moms side for a bit before moving up closer to my dad. From here on I got to see him much more and a relationship that was previously awful began to get slightly better. I would try to hang out with him more and get to understand him better. 
    Now for some context my dad has a lot of medical issues the main two being diabetes and fibromyalgia. These make him really weak and hurt a lot of the time. Whenever it is raining he would hurt, whenever we lakes around to long he would hurt, every morning he would hurt. And not that knew it then but he was also an alcoholic. 
      He was at the time living in a house with his girlfriend who manipulated him a lot. Making him always agree with her and obey her almost. Around the end of this relationship my dad was going to AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) where he got clean and has stayed that way for a long time. His girlfriend had also kicked him out of her house and he moved into a new house much closer to us(they also broke up). 
       This made it so we saw him all the time and a real relationship started to form and we were getting along so much better then. But he always had a weird and dirty sense of humor always talking about sex and  other just weird things(I’m 11 at this point). He then also started touching my nipples which made me really uncomfortable and was just all around gross. 
     I ignored for a while and moved on with life. My dad then lost his job and was forced to move further from us. He also moved to a tiny house meaning I didn’t have a bedroom only my sisters did. I sleep on the couch. Now I’m fine with this and it’s kinda fun every one weekend going to sleep on the couch and hang out in a small house in the middle of now where with a lot of yard to run around in(I’m now 12 my current age as of writing this). Now everything was fine there until he started touching my nipples and butt more and making more dirty jokes and yelling more. That brings me to today where I don’t know what to do because I’m tired of it and don’t want to go their anymore for feet of getting yelled at or touched but at the same time I love my dad and don’t want any harm done to him. I just I need help.",19Mar2020,1
689,"I have been quarantined at home for a week with enough groceries to last me for now. I received a few emails about free delivery services for restaurants and groceries, and I'm not sure if it's completely wrong to use these, or if it's a way to contribute to businesses that have employees dependent on these transactions. 

The first was straight from Chipotle stating that delivery would be free for all orders. The second was Ubereats which stated they would have a $0 delivery fee for local restaurants. I've also received a credit for my first grocery delivery from Instacart. 

I  would like to be able to replenish my produce from Instacart as that's not going to last me for another week. I could go to the store, but then that puts me at risk as well as others around me. I also could afford a meal or two from Uber eats a week since I'm working from home and not spending money on what I would normally on lunches. 

I just can't decide if it's wrong to do this, however. 

On one hand, we should all just be inside and not exposing ourselves at all. 

On the other, they can drop things off at my door without me coming in contact, and it could be a way to contribute money back to the uber or Instacart drivers, as well as give some money to those local restaurants.

A few things to note before I get started on this. my brother has had some serious issues with depression and anxiety as well as some anger management issues in the past. Also I personally do not have the greatest relationship with my brother as we do not agree politically or on many other things for that matter. This has caused many big fights between us in the past few years.

A few weeks ago my family decided to upgrade our WiFi and since this upgrade it feels like my connection has gotten worse. My brother is constantly downloading games. He has nearly 2000 games in his steam library and I've seen him play maybe 20. It has gotten to the point where he is bringing his entire PC, monitor, keyboard, and mouse upstairs and putting them on the ground next to the router to get a wired connection and download faster. Now I am not an internet genius but from what I have researched I think he is taking up all of our bandwidth. He has multiple PC's, an amazon firestick, a Google home, and his phone all connected to our WiFi. 

So my question is. How do I approach him about this situation? He always gets very defensive and says that I (or my parents) know nothing about internet and ""that's not how it works"". He's right I don't know much but it's very obvious he is needless using all our WiFi. Am I wrong? Any help is appreciated.",19Mar2020,1

704,"In Canada the current recommendations are to remain 6 feet or 2 meters away from everyone else.  They have also recommended that we stay home and avoid social contact as much as possible.  As well, people with symptoms or who have traveled out of the country in the last 14 days are recommended to self isolate for 14 days.  

I am the receptionist.  I cannot do my job from home as my job is mainly answering phones and greeting clients with administrative work to fill the gaps.  My employers have recommended that those who are able to work from home do so.  About half of the staff here could work from home, but it is not being enforced that they stay home.  Many of them are still coming in.  Furthermore, some of the people in my office are still taking on in person client meetings.  If they want to risk their own lives and health, that is their prerogative.  However, as the greeter of clients I am forced to interact with every single one of these clients who are coming in.  

Currently 3 members of the staff are at home due to feeling unwell.  I do not have details of their illnesses, although I did hear that one of them has a cough.  There are only 15 of us in total.  I cannot believe that we are still open at all, interacting with each other, but the fact that we are still taking client meetings in person horrifies me.  Every single person who walks through that door is adding to my own personal risk.  

I have not been in contact with any confirmed cases and I do not currently have any symptoms so I have no requirement to self isolate.  However, I am extremely uncomfortable at work and my anxiety around this is causing me to be significantly less productive than I usually am.  I have reached out to my employers via email to let them know of my concerns but I have yet to receive a response.

The government is saying the time for action is now.  I fear that my employers are going to wait until someone in our office is infected before taking action.  And since we are all here in the same work space, if one of us becomes infected, it is likely that all of us will.  As an employee with no decision making authority in my company, I feel powerless to my bosses.

705,"As the title states, my first job out of college of 2+ years let me go on Monday. This employment was at a small media agency with 15 employees and a fairly high turnover rate. The people who maintained employment were close and it was constantly touted that we were a ""family"" more so than a ""business"". I never really played that game but still got along with everyone. Upper management and sales were struggling to get sales over the last few months and in the wake of this Covid outbreak, they decided to cut 3 employees, rather than potentially cutting back salaries to maintain their core group.  It hurts because I was a valued employee who worked my way into the position I was let go from. I continually proved my worth by increasing my responsibilities while management was very slow to provide compensation. I think it is worth noting that 4 employees maliciously left the company due to mistreatment over the course of their careers which resulted in a long legal battle and days off due to court appearances. I am happy to be out of that work environment but obviously relied on the income.

I am really wanting to be strategic with my next move but I understand that without a salary, my bills don't get paid. I have never been in this situation and I want to handle it with priorities in mind. I  have a BA in communications. At my previous job, I was a videographer (which was the role they needed filled at the time and don't have much interest in continuing) and an account manager. I really liked the account management side and would like to continue down that path. I also love music. I would love to bridge my passion in music and experience with marketing/account management but I don't know if that will be possible at this time. 

My fiance has another semester left until she graduates to become a nurse. That limits me to finding a job near where we currently live. Fortunately, I am about an hour drive to Chicago, living in NW Indiana. 

My reason for this post is to ask for direction. Do I look for an arbitrary job to hold me over while I await my fiance to graduate (I have applied for UI in the meantime)? Do I continue searching through job listing sites for a job related to my career that offers a similar salary? Do I search for an entry level position at a music-related business that can act as a foot in the door in hopes for vertical movement in the future? If so, how do I find these jobs if they aren't listed on job search sites? I am lost, mentally. I feel like my momentum has come to a screeching halt but want to use this predicament to better my career. I have applied for one project coordinator job near where I live. I have updated my resume to reflect my most recent achievements. Now I just need some direction.

Happy to answer any questions to clear up confusion or to provide further insight. Thanks in advance.

**TL;DR** I got let go from my job working at a small creative agency. I want to continue my career in marketing, preferably in the music industry. I'm asking for advice on where to go from here.",19Mar2020,1
706,"I am 20 year old freshman college student. I was very very depressed last year, had suicidal thoughts etc. I don’t want to kill myself anymore but i don’t want to go on either. I mean, I don’t know what is wrong with me. I don’t want to study, plan/invest in my future. I don’t want to socialize because I am tired of people even if they are good persons. For instance, there is an excellent guy who obviously wants to have a relationship but when I think about physical intimacy I get stressed a lot. ( Also, I’ve never had a relationship before but I don’t believe in love. Why would someone stick with me when there are lots of better ones? Or how can people stay in a relationship without getting bored?)

When I think about life (growing up, finding a job, getting married etc.) I cannot imagine myself in it and feel like I will always be the one who watch other people’s happiness. Life seems so mundane and I think we are all trapped in the same *‘’graduate - find a job- find a partner- settle down- have children-die’’* loop whether you add/drop something or not. And the worst part is, when you want to get out of loop, you will be lonely because of society/family. I don’t know what to do.",19Mar2020,1
707,I’m a British National and came to the US early last month to visit my girlfriend (before the pandemic got extreme) and now my flights home keep getting cancelled.

708,"Hi everyone, 

I start a new job on Monday. I was given the offer last week, background check quickly conducted, etc. Given everything going on, I will not be starting in-office until mid-April and will instead start online in a work-from-home arrangement. I assume I'll be doing mostly training and onboarding until I am actually in the office. 

However, as I was trying to be strategic, though it is unethical, I know, I haven't told my current employer I am going to be taking another job. Keep in mind, I am currently in a work-from-home arrangement with my current employer too.

My question is, do I go ahead and abruptly quit my current role tomorrow and start my new role Monday? Do I wait a week? Properly put in my two weeks? Is double-pay worth the risk? Will either of the employers find out (given circumstances it may be understandable or untraceable since I'm WFH)

Not sure what to do, obviously would rather have my new role secured than end up without a job. 

Bear in mind, too, I am moving to a competitor.",19Mar2020,2
709,"I had been planning on moving to the west coast on March 15th for the last six months, saving money all the while in order to do a workaway and focus on developing a lifestyle that doesn’t involve sitting at an office desk 50 hours a week for minimum wage. In December my living situation was cut short due to the son of the lady I lived with overdosing on heroin. My mother offered to let me move in with her while I continued saving money and we set the date of March 15th as the day I needed to be out. In the recent weeks leading up to this date, it’s grown incredibly clear that we were both very excited for that day to come as we don’t see eye to eye on a lot of things politically or religiously.

Fast forward to now and I’m currently still in her house due to the pandemic concerns. We’ve been self quarantining in the house for the last three days as we both got laid off. I’ve spent most of this time in my room to try and ease the tension, however anytime we have a meal together the conversation typically steers towards Covid-19 and what’s currently happening. 

Anytime we talk about it I get rather frustrated that her main opinions on the matter and information she believes to be accurate are coming from sensationalist news sites like Fox News. About three weeks ago she decided to go to San Francisco for several days and then took another trip back again a week later, all while I was warning her it was a bad idea to travel. Most of the warnings and information I gave her were shrugged off as she figured she knew best. She also has spent the last few days criticizing the “millennials” for not adhering to social distancing, citing the spring breakers. While I don’t disagree that that was a huge issue, I feel like it’s directed at me for some reason.

The main point of discourse however happened today. While eating lunch her boyfriend brought up that he spoke to a coworker in Milan today and said that he was told the situation is critical there. I spoke up and said that with the way the USA has been handling this outbreak, we’re looking at being in the same boat in two weeks. She then got really mad at me and said I needed to stop being such a pessimist and seek God’s council in prayer, which has been a common thing for her to say to me any time I say anything that’s not blatantly optimistic towards a serious situation. I have not identified as Christian for over a decade and I’m not really religious in any way, but I have no disrespect to those that are being someone who does have a sense of spirituality with the unknown. With that in mind, I got a little escalated with her and said that it’s the people that choose to “pray” away real problems that are indirectly helping to spread illness as well as many other unfortunate happenings around the world. As I was speaking she cut me off and told me that if I want to speak ill of God I’m more than welcome to leave. My main reason for sensitivity towards that is the fact that as a child I was sexually abused by a youth group leader over a three year time span, and while my mom agrees this was horrific for me and caused years of distinction, she doesn’t seem to understand that I no longer wish to worship God.

As much as I’d love to leave, I don’t have a place lined up to go to and would be living in my car (Which I also don’t mind as it’s been built out with a bed and storage space), but the main dilemma I face is what that would look like for me if they decide to enact a national quarantine, close down gyms, etc. 

So I probably am the main problem here but I wanted to get a second point of view to see what I can do to make this situation better for all of us.",19Mar2020,1
710,"Last summer on a 90 degree day I walked by a car with a dog in it. I called the cops, and left. I should have stayed there, but I needed to get to work. I know someone who knows the person I called the cops on, and said he keeps the dog in there for an average of 11-15 hours a day. And that he ended up having the dog euthanized. I just saw the same guy getting in his car, and he has another dog. I assume it's his dog at least. This guy works at the mill. The parking lot isnt a public area, but the public has acces to it. It would look a bit weird if I went in there looking through cat windows and stuff though. I'm afraid this guy is doing the same thing to this dog that he did the other dog.

714,"So, a few years ago I found myself moving countries kind of suddenly. (I was proposed to by my long term, long distance partner and we decided the next step should be that I move)
We couldn’t afford to move all of my belongings immediately, so we sold most of it minus a few things I just couldn’t let go of. One of which was my antique and vintage book collection. I’ve always had a soft spot for books and antiques, so I was very attached to this collection of mine. We looked into getting a storage unit to keep my things in until we could have them sent to us. My dad offered to hold my possessions instead, since he had already offered to do the sending of my things after I’d moved. I gladly accepted this, but his wife made it very clear that this needs to be temporary because they’ve been trying to clear out their extra belongings in their old age. I promised her that it would indeed be temporary. 

Fast forward six months and we’ve officially got the money set aside to have some of my things sent back to me. I specifically ask for a few of my books first and then we’d go from there. But my dad told me that he’s pretty sure he doesn’t have my books and that I should ask other family if I’ve left them with someone else. I told him I remembered helping him get them into his garage because the box they were in was super heavy. He’s insisted that he would’ve remembered if he had my books. I asked if he would at least check the boxes for me, to which he agreed. I asked other family just to be safe and everyone else has checked and told me that they don’t have the books. So now I’m certain my dad has them. Fast forward a year and a half later (2 years now) and he keeps saying he doesn’t have them but that  he’ll check, only to keep “forgetting.”
We’ve offered to pay literally every last cent he’d  have to spend to send me maybe 5 books. All he has to do is go into his garage, pick out a handful of my books and take them to the post office.  I’ve even asked if my Christmas and birthday presents could just be a few of my books, because I seriously miss them. But I always get random other things instead. He keeps asking what I want and I keep saying “just a couple of my books.” But then he says I didn’t leave them with him or he’ll “see what he can do”

I seriously miss my books and want them back. It’s harder to just rebuild my collection because I now live in a very bustling city with a huge hipster scene, so old books in horrible condition  go for $65-$100 a pop- where as my books from little country antique shops in middle-of-nowhere America would cost me AT MOST $1.25. One of my favourite books, which was printed in  1857 and in pristine condition, I snatched up for 50¢. 
I don’t know what to do at this point. 
He asked me this year what I’d love to see in a birthday care package and I said “just a few of my old books” and he never got back to me... I don’t know what to do at this point. I’m heart broken. I miss flipping through the thin pages, looking at the finer details, and taking in the distinct smell they have. I seriously just want my books. Any advice on what I can do?",19Mar2020,2

Firstly, they assigned us group work, which is not only nonsensical, but also unreasonable, considering recent events. We are supposed to communicate to each other via WhatsApp groups and our teachers probably think we'll figure this out for ourselves. 

Spoiler alert: we don't. The communication is total ass. There are students who don't want to do anything, then those who aren't saying anything the whole time...it's chaotic. 

Secondly, because of some arbitrary reason I only received Emails from a couple of teachers. There are some assignments I NEED to do, but I didn't get them. I tried to talk to my classmates about this issue, but they are very involved in their own assignments, so they're mostly just ignoring me.

She has a boyfriend (whom she lives with) and two daughters. We have 5 kids (including me), so this is going to cause a real struggle.

My parents are gonna take her to court to try and make sure this doesn’t happen, but if it does, I wanna help. I know I wrote this to sound childish, and maybe I do sound childish.

726,"I was with my first bf almost a year ago, and he was my first everything. it was a really spontaneous and passionate love and we fell in love very quickly, it also fell apart very quickly. before him, i was insecure of my ability to find love because no guys were ever interested in me, then he came along and everything felt amazing. the only issue was that he was emotionally unavailable. he came on to me very strongly and excitedly, but when it came time to make it official, he was hesitant because he felt like he wasn't able to commit. idk if it was fears from his past relationship, but i was so desperate to make it work because i believed he was the one for me, that i stayed with him and waited until he was ready. eventually we did make it official, and then he broke up with me before getting back together 10 minutes later. anyway, i could tell he wasn't 100% sure he wanted to be with me even though at times he would be so in love. he also needed a lot of alone time and wasn't always in mood of things like i was.

we were long distance after and that's when we started fighting a lot and then he broke up with me for good. a few months after the break up i got back out there for just casual stuff, and my confidence boosted up because now a lot of guys were interested. met my current bf a few months ago and he's super into me which i love. but in a way, i feel like he's way more into me and makes me feel a lot more secure, like i'm not worried he's gonna break up with me now the way i was worried with my ex because he was so wishy washy. 

but sometimes i can't help but feel nostalgic when i remember things my ex and i did together. i'm aware i wouldn't want the relationship again, because as much as these moments felt like fairytales, there were a lot of other issues i don't think i could have dealt with forever, so my main issue is that i only remember all these positives things that i loved about him and sometimes just feel really sad that i don't have it anymore. i don't know if it's that i'm just more attracted to emotionally unavailable people or something? i keep having these dreams where he'd reach out and want to make it work again, and all i can do is say no and have him pine after me, which i know sounds crazy but it's just how i feel. i do love my current bf right now, and there are things i hated about my ex that my bf makes up for, but at the same time there are things my bf does not compare to like with my ex. how do i get over this? i don't want to get back with my ex because i know that it wouldn't work, but how do i stop these thoughts of nostalgia? can anyone tell me why i am this way and what the solution is?",19Mar2020,1

When he was born someone called child services on us using false accusations well the lady came out and checked and said everything was fine but she needed to hear about what happened in our past 2 cases even though she had already read the files. We told her everything that happened how my family thought that we were unfit because of my past and how they thought at since I was abused by my parents that I continue the cycle.. We told her about how when we were forced to do guardianship with my cousin they claimed that we neglected her when everytime we called to go see her they always had something planned which kept us from being able to see her.. She told us flat out that there was no reason for us losing our girls and that the system let us down. She said it a case of people who had money who wanted a child but couldn't have one vs people who had a child but no money.. She said that everything with my son was settled and the case was closed..

728,"I’m (17 F) a senior in high school and for as long as I can remember, people (even strangers) have been mean or rude to me for no reason. For example, today I was in class, and I asked the teacher a question, and a guy went “just shut up!” I told him “make me” and he said “I just did” and I told him “well, I’m still talking, so,” (I know this is immature but I didn’t know what else to do. He said that in front of the entire class and I got embarrassed.).
A few days ago, I was on the lab, and I washed my hands, and the water was too hot and I burned myself a little. A girl laughed with her friend, instead of asking me if I was okay.
Or, when I’m in class and we have a group assignment, when I’m telling everyone my ideas they ignore them, saying that they’re bad. Then they later pick up my ideas and use them.
I’ve been bullied ever since elementary, so I’m scared for college since I’m afraid I’ll be bullied too.
Once, I was with my brother outside of the airport, and there were a couple of people too (we were waiting for our favorite singer) and when I saw the singer I told everyone “Look! There he is!” And I kid you not, a girl frowned at me, and told me “Just stop being so loud! Gosh, you’re gonna scare him away!” While everyone made small talk with my brother, everyone else ignored me.
Even this happens with teachers; they’re mean for no reason. I have a teacher that makes fun of me (in front of the whole class, mind you) because I go to the bathroom a little too often. 
I think maybe everyone is mad at me because of my voice? When I hear recordings of my voice I cringe, so maybe that’s why.
Other than that, I think it’s because of my social anxiety, I think everyone thinks I’m weird (a few classmates have told me that) 
Even my own friends tell me I’m weird. I have one friend who hits me constantly, then she hugs me and fondles my breasts. Like, why is everyone so weird?
Then, I have a friend who’s dating my bully, and my friends are friends with my ex-bully.
Maybe because I almost don’t talk to anyone in class (other than my friends) , but I’m still nice to them, and I smile to them on the hallways, let everyone copy my homework, etc.
Or, for example, when we’re in class, sometimes they don’t even talk to me. I have one friend that comments a lot on my body, (your body rolls are cute! Your head is big! You’re so short! You’re so beautiful!) again, why is everyone so weird?!
On the other hand, I don’t think I deserve to ask too much out of a friendship, since I’m really weird, and if I’m being tolerated, I think that’s what I get. 
I don’t think I’m a bad friend. I always ask everyone how they’re doing, help them with their issues, hear them, etc. I just wish they’d do the same for me.

My brother felt bad for me so he cleared up an old cot and everything was fine till summer came around and the living room where he sleeps has no fan or ac and it gets really hot. 
so he asked me to go back to sleep with her.
So he can sleep in the cot room with the fan.

I know it's justified that he gets his own bed and room.But I need my own space too.

736,"So, the other day one of my best friends (we’ll call him Jeff) asked if I wanted to call with him and his boyfriend (we’ll call him Mark). Obviously, I said yes because he’s one of my best friends and we don’t call that often along with his boyfriend that’s another one of my good friends. 

So, we ended up chatting and Jeff ended up adding my girlfriend (we’ll call her Maya) to the call. Maya is one of Jeff’s best friends as well. Now, Maya is a very friendly person and is good at making friends and is just very likable. Maya had just recently become friends with Mark. 

Anyways we all were talking and just being nerds about anime’s. We ended up switching from just a normal call to a facetime call cause we all wanted to see each other. Then Jeff and Mark randomly left the call to be in a call together, which I mean made a little sense to me cause they’re together and if they want to talk privately, they can, whatever. So, I went on about my night and watched some anime and we all just kinda stopped talking. 

Later I get a text from Maya saying that the three of them are in a chat without me. This hurt me to the core. They are some of my best friends and to just get kicked out of a group like that was heart breaking. I wouldn’t have been as affected if Maya were also not in the group, but she was. 

I am the type of person to have a lot of doubts and always question things. Both Maya and Jeff have told me that they didn’t like me at first. So, I’m always questioning whether I’m likable enough or if people that I call my “friends” even like me. Not to mention that Maya told me she was in a call with someone (she didn’t specify who) the day before. Maya was also in a call with Mark and Jeff when they announced that they were dating. 

I feel like I’m constantly left out with those two and Maya is always getting picked over me. I still seriously love Jeff (in a friendship way) and he's always been nice to me.

Now I’m afraid that since I’m not going to be able to pay this month and maybe next (I had missed payments before, I was behind when it burnt and they let me pay some interest and catch up) that they will try and say I burned the car and charge me with arson and destroying their collateral.

744,"Hi all! This post is for my mom, not me. My mom (53) is having a very hard time finding a job and securing an offer due to poor results from the background check (previous employers are claiming false allegations towards her). Not sure how to move forward or if legal action can be taken? 

Employer 1: CEOs at company were stealing money from other corporations, writing false checks, etc. My mom reported them for doing this (because it is illegal) and they let her go. When reference check calls they say how terrible of a worker she was and how bad of terms they ended on bad terms. 

Employer 2: Free lanced for her best friends start-up. Her best friend started a company and she did all marketing, marketing strategy, etc. Her best friend almost made a bad business deal and my parents advised her not to do so because she would lost a lot of money in the end. Note: my parents were also planning on investing and becoming stakeholders. They had a lawyer who strongly advised her not to make this business deal. Now, her best friend tells reference checks my mom did nothing for her and tried to run her company to the ground and steal her business. 

Employer 3: Worked for a judge, did all her marketing, ran her books, ran her campaign, campaign events, etc. Judge owes my mom 5K in unpaid wages (there was a law suit - my mom won!) Judge tells those doing a reference check that she was nothing more than a billing clerk, was always late, always left before 5pm, and not to hire her 

All of this is not true. I can attest that she has been an upstanding employee, but because she tried to be the good guy, it bit her in the butt. Any advice on how she can move forward? Is this more in the legal realms? She finally found a job after months of searching and intervening and they rescinded because of it. I feel awful - I don’t know how else to help. She can’t take this off her resume as they are her last working experiences in 4 yrs

745,"Long story short I'm considering about contacting my ex to offer financial support. Here's the situation. Our school closed down and kicked everyone out of the dorms so she was forced to go back to her home, which is an unstable place. Her mom's dementia has accelerated to the point that her mom is now hospitalized . They are very poor and the have not paid their rent in the last 3 months. They have very little savings, she has not other family other than her mom, she has no other family. She might have to drop out of school to support the both of them but minimum wage probably won't be enough. Also since they might be evicted she might be homeless if they don't find a new place soon. 

I still care about her a lot but our break up was messy and it caused us a lot of pain, and we're both basically ambivalent to each other at this point. The only reason we're still in each other lives, if that's even the right way to phrase it, is because we are in the same friend group so avoiding each other is basically impossible. However I'm willing to put my hurt aside to help her out because this is a very serious situation she seems to be in and I genuinely just want to help and I don't want her to drop out of school or be homeless. Should I contact her? Because she basically ignores me at this point and I don't want to make things even worse and this is a pretty dangerous situation I find myself in and I understand that I'm basically involving myself in her problems. I just feels wrong to ignore her and hand wave things as not my problem. Especially when I can actually help.",19Mar2020,1

With that being said, I may have a job offering in the medical field soon. It is two hours away where I used to live, and it is going to be an interesting job from what I've heard.

I don’t know where to post this or if this is even the right place to post this but I need some opinions and advise . Let me give you some background , I work for H&amp;M in Ireland , due to corona virus outbreaks most stores and businesses have decided to close for safety for their employees and customers as advised by the government ... except H&amp;M . They are literally forcing us to come in and work exposing and risking ourselves to the corona virus . My manager has been trying to get answers from the global team , she is desperate to close the store but they won’t let us . We are all worried for our safety and are uncomfortable working since the number corona virus cases in Ireland is  growing . They have shown the upmost lack of care for their own staff . They ( the global executive team )have treated all of us including the managers like shit . They haven’t even spoken to their own staff of sent a message to an update to let us know what’s going on unlike other stores .We have made literally a laughable amount compared to what we usually make on a daily basis , it costs more to keep the shop open then what they’re making , they are definitely losing money so why are the unnecessarily keeping the store open ?We are one of the last retailers in Ireland that is still open . We are all hurt that H&amp;M literally have shown how much they don’t care about us . The worst part is that customers are still coming in to shop ?! People think it’s okay to still come in and buy clothes , just because the store is open doesn’t mean its okay for yous to come in , customers are pretty much one of the reasons why we still have to keep the store open. Not only our customers risking spreading the virus to us but also to themselves , how can people be so careless ? Buying shitty H&amp;M clothes is not essential right now . And on top of that , customers have been extremely rude and demanding lately showing no consideration to us .The government literally advised everyone to stay at home and not take unnecessary trips .Staff have been told if they don’t feel comfortable coming in , they don’t have to but they won’t get paid or they can take holidays .

She does this as soon as she realises it’s locked and doesn’t even give me the time to open it. At this point I feel compelled to open it just so that the noise would stop.

760,"My brother had issues with drugs last year. Because he was going through a rough time in his life. Last year he stole a lot of electronics out of our house and pawned them for drugs. He wasn't exactly reprimanded by my mother. I mean she did shout at him and all that but she didn't really know if it was because of drugs or not. I assume she had her suspicions. I on the other hand knew it was drugs because my brother confided in me. And told me he got himself off of it. And he didn't want anyone else in the family to know because they are very judgmental and I understood why he only told me. So I thought okay if he's recovered then it's fine.


Fast forward to this year around February I'd say. Things were going good he had a job. Then all of a sudden the company he worked for laid off all of their employees and he lost his job and I think that's what triggered everything again. My brother is a very weak person and he let's things like this really get to him. And then things started disappearing again. And of course everyone looks to him because he has stolen before. He denies it obviously. But yeah we know it's him. And now everyone knows it's because of drugs.

So, basically this teacher is making my life worse. I am very young and i understand some of you can think that i am posting this without thinking and i am all wrong. Please tell me if i am. Some may think that this is some petty revenge after getting a call home,  but i have thought about it a long time. She is bad. My teacher is the worst in my opinion.    
Example of my teachers bad behaviour. 

1. Calls or emails my mom for nothing. Like last month i was saying Shit and my mom got a email about it and we almost had to do a meeting. For saying shit. And this is happening constantly.

2. Mistreats my grades. Me and my classmates can do the SAME work and she will give me worse grading. My friend once had to copy MY assignment and he got a B while i got a D. This has happened on both her subjects.

3. Acting like school is not for education. I have some few friends i like and i communicate with them. I dont talk with other if it is not needed. When we have group projects i am engaged in conversations. My teacher always gets mad/calling my parents if i am disrespecting her. And that is that i talk to her with a what she calls annoyed and disrespecting voice. Like, we are not friends. I am here to learn about crap i dont need. Not having fun. She thinks we are in school willingly.

I have talked with the principle and i have done alot to stop this shit. No one seems to belive me or doesnt care.  

My parents belives that the teacher is a saint. Like wtf? Well, they havent supported me once emotionally, they dont even know i am tired of life and depressed so i am not surprised.

770,"Hi everyone,

Lately I have been researching about beta males and alpha males and the similarities of the human social infrastructure and the chimpanzee social infrastructure.

As I go more into this, I realize as a kid growing up I had a father figure and an older brother, me being the younger brother it was only natural for me to take on the role of a ""beta"" since the position of the ""alpha"" role was already being occupied.

I am also surrounded by a lot of feminine energy because I have always lived in a household with females since my parents separated and I lived with my mom and my two sisters. So this makes sense why I would have more understanding qualities in me and care more about my appearance than I guess you can say a ""normal"" male would, heck I am even a slight germophobe.

So this insight that I learned gave me a bit more clarity on why I am so reserved and introverted and I guess you can say ""beta"".

It gave me reason as to why I was attracting so much narcissists, it was because I was too nice.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was wondering if there are any other guys out there that have similar upbringings and what did you do to assume a more masculine energy, I feel like now that I have these qualities from feminine energy I would be able to find my Yang which would be the masculine and combine it with my Yin which would be the feminine and achieve an equilibrium that would give me peace.

I take at least 1 xray per shift. Have had no issues. I do the same method every time of inserting and removing the images from the machine. During my last shift however the machine was ""stuck"" and wouldn't let me insert anything anymore. It wasn't a temporary issue because nothing we did would fix it. So, we had to stop doing Xrays for a few days until someone came in and took a look at it.

My manager texted me that the doctor (my boss) wants me to switch back to a medical receptionist for the rest of the month because I need better training on how to use the xray machine.

781,"So first of all, hello everyone,  I hope you all doing good with all this covid stress that has been afecting  the world, I wish you all the best.

I came here, to ask how can I overcome my fear of missing out, since I've noticed it has been afecting me alot. 

A little background which I think it's what caused this problem in me, was the fact that my parents divorced and my father whom I liked a lot kinda left me behind to get a family of his own. I would still see him every other weekend, but he would do a lot of things with his stepdaughter during the time I wasnt there that would make me feel left out. This would reflect also on my social life, sometimes my friends would make plans and I for some reason couldn't attend them, and then they would talk about how great it had been and I would just stood there not really ""belonging"" per say. 

And so a couple years later I still feel imense stress and anxiety everytime my friends are all together and I cant join, or if my boyfriend is hanging out with his friends.

In conclusion I know that this is not healthy and would like to know ways I can cope with this.

Sorry if this has any grammatical errors or if I didnt manage to make myself clear but English isn't my first language.

Hope that someone who also has problems with this can find their answer here.",19Mar2020,1
782,"Hello everyone! 

Lately i've been kinda down, life has been treating me like shit and i don't know if this is with a purpose on making me stronger or if i'm just unlucky as hell..  i will make a list of things that happened: 

\-My dad died unexpectedly and it was so terrible that on the funeral day i had two spasmophilia attacks (the worst panic attack someone can get) i had been taken to the hospital, my mom and brother were so worried, at the hospital they kept me in drips.. and after a week my body is still weak and i can't get rid of those shaking hands, my anxiety seems worse than before.

\-I tried to focus myself on work at home, cleaning, lifting lots of things and now i have a pain on my appendix and i might need to have a surgery soon, i am afraid to get peritonitis, but i live in a small town that is already infected with corona and i might have no place in the hospital, so i'm doing my best not to overwork myself again at least for a while.

\-I realized that i have so many fake friends, only 2 or 3 people checked on me about my dad's situation or if i'm okay at all and they all watched my stories, it pained me so much, i felt abandoned. I was part of a community where people always gave advice to each other, always kept a nice mood, i was one of the people that would keep the conversations happy and i would give hours and hours to everyone that needed help or company or just to rant, but no one did this back for me, and i never did it with the intention of getting something back or the expectation, but i thought it would only be natural for them to at least ask me if everything's fine.

 I don't have real friends, i know it sounds sad, but i had to cut all the ties with them, because they were toxic and manipulative, so i did myself a favor and ended the connections, and i don't feel bad at all cause i am someone that respects solidarity and i can get enough socializing from my other family members, but i can't lie, sometimes i miss going out and having fun like a normal person.

\-If i ever try to go out and make new friends, i don't know why but creepy dudes come to me, they try to get me in their car, they want to get me drunk, there were even younger dudes coming for me.. i had many problems with mobs, i don't even dress provocatively, but i just never seem to be safe outside, so i was isolated way before the coronavirus and the quarantine, and i wanna be stronger and be able to protect myself, and be free and feel safe.

\-I had a relationship for two years and i did everything to keep it, we lived together, worked together online, i was not only like his best friend but also gave him the love that his mother never gave him, but he just became very toxic, kept insulting me, made me go to work while he stayed at home gaming, his family seemed sweet at first but after a while they showed their true nature, they would scream and insisting on me to go to work, bring money, they showed no empathy. After two years i ended up having mental breakdowns, being anorexic, missing my home but was still bounded to him, it was very hard to leave. My ex was treating me like shit, and only after i left him for good he wanted to get me back, he still tries through this day but i just can't go back anymore.

\-I had a crush on someone that's kinda famous (online) and i ended up talking to this person on instagram, he made me feel special, told me to post more pictures of myself, said i had potential on becoming a model, i knew it wasn't okay to fall for someone like this, but he kept messaging me over and over again, making me believe that i have a chance, and i was in a really dark period of time, i felt so lonely.. this made me get very attached with him.  I was always there for him, supporting, writing, trying to add those damn pictures all the time, he would single me out on his streams, made people believe that he really liked me..

 I wanted to meet him (we are from different countries) but i couldn't financially afford such thing, i wanted to keep the friendship at least, but he started ghosting me out of the blue and i was broken about this for an entire year, and i still am, and i don't know if i should even support this person anymore in what they do because he always talks about some new girl he f\*ed or about some model he saw and wants to f\*ck.  He always calls me on his streams and if i disappear he messages me, but when my dad died he never asked me if i was fine, to think i was one of the first people to ask him if he's okay at the smallest minority.. i feel so bad.. and played, the other people on his community don't even care about this and they act like it's okay, they seem brainwashed, and as a matter of fact, some of them are women past 40 years old.. and they act so wise, but when it comes to his behavior not only online but in real life too, they just encourage him to keep going.. and it seems so toxic to me. I had been away for a while and i just wanted to check on him and all i hear is that he found someone that he spends all his time with and he's talking about her all the time, she's just like me in so many ways as he was describing her, and my heart just breaks over and over again. Why does he still wants me there when all he does is talking about her? I never did anything wrong to this person.

\-I have a business online, but it takes lots of ideas and creativity to add some products, and there's a lot of competition, and with my current situation i'm kinda sinking in, i have no ideas and i barely have any support, so financially i'm low, i can barely afford food and i feel terrible, my mom is also having a hard time at work and i want to help her so bad..but, i can't do anything else, not only because the quarantine but because of my social anxiety too, and now with this pain from the appendix i can barely help at home.  I want to take my baccalaureate exam and find my calling in life, i am very confused on what to choose, but just the idea of being in a classroom again gives me a panic attack, i had sought counseling, but in this small town no one could help me, they all tell me the same thing ''smile, be strong, you have a strong character, you could do anything'', i am thinking on getting online counselling, but again this is not for free.

So i honestly don't know what to do with myself, i wanna start over, i wanna get rid of this messy life style, i'm only sitting at home, being depressed and anxious as hell, crying many nights, i am cursing my life, i feel powerless and stuck. Because of dad's sudden death, lots of shady people are coming over, they come knocking on the door and i'm left alone at home..and i'm scared, life suddenly feels like hell, i wish i could make a plan and work on it for as long as i can, i wanna stop going on that community and get rid of this crush i have cause i know it's never gonna happen, and if it would i'd only end up more depressed than i am, cause he likes women way too much and he's obsessed with models. I wish i could get back to studying, and start working out, and maybe get some real and true friends, but what can i even do with this quarantine and my situation overall? 

I know i have potential for so much more than this, and if i get well i can help others too, but where do i even start and how can i keep on fighting when i always give up after a while?  

Lately i've been thinking on making a youtube channel, i think i could do this if i put my mind into it, but would it work? I am living in europe and i heard that it's not the best place for this, but still i would love to try it. I'm still kinda scared to expose myself like that, but.. why not?

If there's a button to restart my life.. how can i obtain it? How can i push it and how can i work with it?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post and sorry if it was triggering, i also apologize for the writing mistakes, i am still learning english as it is not my original language. 

Thank you for having the patience on reading this and i can't wait for an advice, i don't even know if i'll get an answer. Much love! [❤️](https://emojipedia.org/red-heart/)",19Mar2020,1
783,"Less than an hour ago I found out my dad (mid 40s) tried to have sex with one of my best friends (just turned 16) while she was at my house to go back and grab something alone. My dad has known them since they were 13 (she’s a twin we’re all rly close). He was their father figure, their friend. He knows all the fucked up shit they’ve gone through with their own Dad, he knows all the trauma. And he tried to have sex with her. She said they were talking and he was asking her “so have you gotten good dick yet?” And asking her to show her boobs, asking her if he can give her oral like???? She said she said no and he told her not to tell me and she left. I believe her because she is my best friend and my dad has made a lot of jokes about liking younger girls, I brushed it off as him being creepy or just joking whatever, his exes were all pretty young too.

784,"Holy crap has everything gotten worse and worse. I was laid off like 2 months ago and have been fighting for a job until the beginning of March where I got a Taco Bell job. It’s a decent job but then my roommate gave me an eviction notice because we weren’t getting along. Now I’m being given a month to work at a minimum wage job to save up for a new apartment to rent. I tried getting a roommate, but uh... I’m trans. And not lots of people are okay with that. I’ve met up with like 4 potential roommate and all of them sent me comments on how they weren’t comfortable with having a trans person in their home (Central Illinois is really transphobic). So now I needed to find a place to live alone, even tho the rent will be extremely high living in a single apartment. I was working 60hrs per paycheck. But then the virus happened. And now my 60hrs per paycheck is now a 30hrs per paycheck. No landlords are wanting to have me because my paycheck has to be 3x the amount of the rent. I feel like everything is crashing and the pandemic is going to have me homeless and that is the opposite of what I need right now.

First time poster, long time reader.  I have a stepson who is 18.  His father and I are self-isolating because we believe it's the right thing to do so we don't risk spreading COVID-19.  However, his son will still be going back and forth from our house to his mom's.  While he's been with us this week, we have tried to explain to him the dire circumstances and what the effects can be of selfishly going out, seeing friends, etc.  My stepson has nonstop insisted that he needs a haircut the past few days so he can feel 'fresh'.  We've told him no, that no one will see his hair anyway, and it's not worth risking himself, us, or others.  He left to go get a haircut today anyway.  When I told him to come back, he said that 1. He would not  2. Everyone he's talked to including his mom and her family have told him that we have been brainwashed into thinking this is a big deal/deadly 3. That he'll do whatever he wants including seeing friends because he doesn't care anyway.

Now I'm angry that he would be this selfish and vain and that his dad isn't more upset and didn't take away his keys.  I'm being told that we have to try to make him happy here as much as possible so that he doesn't want to go out 'as much'.  

Is this kid just being a selfish little sh\*t or am I overreacting?  Is it wrong for his dad to be so passive and allow him to keep putting us and others at risk?",19Mar2020,1

795,"As everyone knows the Corona Virus has taken a toll on everyone’s trust of strangers, and the general safe feeling of being out in public groups. My boyfriends father is an extremely kind man, but has an autoimmune disease which may result in his death if he gets Corona. I have the uttermost respect for him and follow his directions when me and my boyfriend get into the house, I wash and sanitize my hands up the elbows, and refrain from touching my face or wearing clothing I may have worn outside. 

I’m extremely vigilant in my own health and the safety of others as both me and my mother work in medical fields. We wear face masks, shower as soon as we get home, all the necessary steps we can take right now besides quitting our jobs so we can quarantine. I have absolutely been avoiding public places, I’m doing the best I can to insure no one in my family or his gets sick.

Here comes the problem though, me and my boyfriend only have weekends off together. We tend to spend the night at each other’s houses and switch on and off on who’s place we’re staying in and when. My boyfriends dad is infuriated by this, as he believes me and my mom are a great risk of bringing this home and possibly spreading it to BF, thus killing him. 

He basically told us upfront that he wants us to only spend the night over at his house, if at all. I’m very confused on my feelings of this, on one level I completely understand; I mean his life is at risk. But on another level I know I’m taking the necessary steps to ensure this virus won’t enter his home or his lungs. I feel as though just because I am in a medical field, doesn’t mean my home is automatically not safe. He is not quarantined either, he still goes to work to do what he has to do, as do I.

804,"So i've been doing computer programming since I was 10, and i'm 15 now, so that's about 5 years of experience. Basically on March 11th I was super pissed at my school for reasons i'm not going to be saying because it doesn't matter but I basically attempted breaching an admin account. It was extremely easy for me to do because I found that some admin accounts followed a really simple password pattern, so all I really needed was basic info on the admin I was hacking. Also, should have mentioned this earlier, but the service my school uses for all of its accounts is called Schoology, which is a super simple school management service, that allows teachers to easily add grades, updates to their classes, etc. On Schoology there are 2 types of users, an admin, and a student. Admins have the ability remove admin from other admins in the school, so if I hack 1 admin, I can completely take control over their entire group.

Anyways, once I got in I didn't want to too much damage, I kind of just wanted to rub it in their face that they got hacked. So I replaced the main picture that all students see when they look at the school's group to a picture of shrek, and I changed the title of it from ""\[My school name\]"" to ""FIX YOUR SECURITY"" just to try to be as annoying as possible. Then I posted a message to the entire school saying ""HACKED BY CORONAVIRUS"", which made everyone get a notification saying that. Obviously this really freaked out the school. Also, the account I was using for all of this was an alt to try to avoid getting caught.

However, I made 1 major mistake while I was doing this, that ended up getting me caught. Before I started the attack, I was testing the password patterns on other admins, and for 1 of them, I forgot to mask my IP address. This was an extremely clumsy mistake that I was aware I had made when I did it, but I just assumed my school didn't log it (which I was wrong). I am extremely embarrassed about making this mistake because I should have known better.

So, they traced the attack to me and they gave me a 3 day suspension, and I was supposed to have a meeting discussing whether or not I should be expelled however it got moved due to the coronavirus quarantine, so I thought now would be a great time to think about arguments I could use to convince them not to expel me. Now remember, I did not do ANY actual damage to the school, even though I could have, and they should have had better security, Do you guys think I should be expelled? If not, what would be good arguments to use during the meeting to convince them?",19Mar2020,1

810,"This is a long as story so buckle up.

I have been dating my roommate for a couple months, we decided to break it off in January, but agreed to continue to sleep together. I found out a couple days ago via his phone that he’s also been sleeping with his ex, who’s our neighbor. I’ve never looked through someone’s phone before, but I just had the sneaking suspicion that something was happening, and he’d told me explicitly for weeks that he had no interest in sleeping with her. I felt like I just needed to reassure myself. 

I confronted the ex first and she said she had no clue that he had been sleeping with me. He slept with both of us on the same day too. I felt sick to my stomach and literally started losing my mind. She and I decided to confront him about it, and as soon as I delved that I’d looked through their texts, he went ballistic. He started cussing and screaming at me, telling me I was an awful person who “broke his trust and privacy.” He then proceeded to leave, come back and harass me again. His ex told me she wasn’t going to leave me alone with him. She decided to sleep in my room with me, and he popped up in my room. He started screaming at me and her at the top of his lungs, and at one point shouted “i’m sorry I slept with both of y’all. I get it, I was wrong.” He then proceeded to run out of the room and grab a knife, and run to his car and drive away. 

She and I were at first laughing because of how insane he was acting, but after she realized he had a knife, she started to panic. She and I both texted him and told him not to hurt himself. He never responded and we both went back to sleep. He showed back up 2 hours later and immediately asked us if we’d slept together. I was so angry I called him a fucking moron. He then told her she needed to leave, and as soon as she got out of bed, he got up in my face and started threatening me while holding his keys up to my face. I tried to leave, and he took my phone and told me I needed to listen to him. 

She came back in the room while this was happening, and she pushed him back and told him to stop getting in my face. He told her he couldn’t believe she was taking my side. She told me to leave and that she was right behind me, and I said he had my phone. He threw it at me, and I jumped up and ran to put on shoes. He kept cussing at me and telling me I was absolute shit. I ran out the door and she followed. She told me not to come back alone, and that she was going to leave. I told her that I wouldn’t.

As soon as I left, she told me he was texting her a bunch of abuse. I told her to not respond to him and to just ignore everything, and that we could go hangout at my house. After we got to my house, I texted an old friend of mine who dated him as well. I told her the whole story and she told me she was sorry that this happened and that she knew he was going to be this way, but that she couldn’t tell me because she knew I wouldn’t believe her. We agreed to hang out with his other ex, and we spent 3 hours uncovering all of his lies. Every manipulative thing he said or did to any of us, we all discussed it. Afterward, she care back to my house with us and we agreed to wait for him to come home and confront him. 

Once he showed up, he was very embarrassed and seemed like he wanted to scream at all of us. He left after that, came back to get some of his stuff, and then left again. He came back in the morning after we’d all fallen asleep and coerced the ex who he’d recently been sleeping with to go into his room and talk to him. He told me she asked about everything from his side and he locked the door. We tried to break in and we almost got in a fight with him. The other ex decided to leave to prevent him from hurting us, and I started breaking down crying. I didn’t want her to be manipulated by him again. Eventually he left and I saw her alone crying. I went up and asked what he’d said to her, and she basically told me he had an answer for why everything had happened. He had gone and covered his tracks yet again.

At first, she told me she didn’t want to choose between us and I told her she didn’t have to. After crying with her for like 30 minutes she left for work. She messaged me all day and asked me if I was ok, she told me she was worried about me, etc. I invited a friend over while I was home alone and she told me that it wasn’t fair for me to be her friend while she was his friend. She basically told me I needed to give her an ultimatum, and that if she chose him to cut her off. I agreed, and I asked his ex to come over to my house. I told her that I wanted to not make her choose, but that I had to do what would benefit me in the end. She told me ok, and that he didn’t care if we were friends but that she’d think about it. She hugged me and left.

I woke up this morning to an incredibly long text from her, basically telling me I was completely wrong for the ultimatum, and that he didn’t have that outlook and I should be like him in that sense. She also spent a good chunk of the text discrediting my and his other ex’s experiences with him as not as valid as hers. She said we were trying to turn her against him and that he had no reason to manipulate her. She told me that if it’s that big a deal to cut her off myself. I responded and said that I was sorry for making her feel so rushed to make a decision, and that if she needed to stop being my friend to bet better that I wouldn’t judge her. She told me she wanted to remove our negative situation from us hanging out and our conversations for the time being.

I’m currently very upset because I just want her to be happy and safe, and I know that if she stays his friend, she will continue to be manipulated. I can’t watch it go down. I’m so scared for her. Literally everyone sees through him but her. This is probably the worst situation I’ve ever been a part of.",19Mar2020,1

I’m graduating college in 2 weeks. I will have a bachelor’s in nursing. I took an accelerated program so it was only 1 year. It was a lot of work and I feel like I didn’t get any breaks. I’m now stressed out about what I will do after I graduate. I know what will make me happy, but there are a lot of barriers in the way. I wish I could get my nursing license and then take a break to travel the world. However, I have $45,000 in students loans. I also feel pressured to get a nursing job right away since I’m still living with my parents. I’m excited to become a nurse, but I feel like I need a break for my mental health.

813,When me n my current bf were seeing eachother for about a month I started talking to another guy and met up couple times one of the times we kissed. I feel really guilty about that now (me n my bf have been dating for 6 months now). During that period of time me n my bf were having fights a lot and had a lot of issues and I wasnt sure if he even liked or cared about me. Now I love my bf and would never cheat. We have fights sometimes but I would never cheat again. I know if I tell my bf it's over. My bf doesn't know the other guy but the other guy knows my bf's Instagram.

Even though I love her so much I feel like it’s time to release and she is saying she is sorry for her behavior after I finally argued with her about the one-side friendship that we had. I must say that she did everything a manipulative person could do. On other years and in this years too she would talk about her “shitty” ex boyfriend for hours and I would listen but when I had to talk about my feelings she would ignore me not answering or delaying, she would excuse her behavior saying that she was depressed or saying that she didn’t wanted me to know how terrible her family was, fight with me with no reason and then talk to me the next day and say that it was my fault, never accept to be wrong, ...

Don’t have access to a therapist rn because of COVID-19 so I’m gonna give reddit a try because there’s actually some really smart and nice ppl on here, and I rly need help! 

Ok so I’m a 17 year old bisexual male and I dated a guy in the summer, who I was really in love with. He showed me A LOT of attention which was rly new to me considering my past girlfriends haven’t rly cared for me in the same way. I feel like that attention all kind of went to my head because I began to crave it. I craved the adrenaline that came out of being needed by someone. I started to lose feelings near the end of the summer, and I had no idea why, but looking back on it now, I feel like it’s because I started getting less attention and eventually got bored. 

I KNOW that sounds really bad, but I had no idea what was causing me to feel that way at the time, and now that I do, I don’t feel good abt it. I broke up with him, not only because of this though! 

This wasn’t rly a normal relationship because after I ended it, he texted me like three weeks later and tried to get me back, and though I was kind of into it, I played hard to get because of the rush that came out of being needed by someone that I don’t necessarily need. We’ve been on and off like 5 times in the past year and now we’re just friends but time to time he flirts w me and I play hard to get again, except this time I’m not actually into it. 

We always talk and I find myself always talking down on him to make myself feel better. I don’t want to keep doing this, I ONLY do this with him. I’m not a bad person, but I lose all control of my judgement and feelings when I talk to him. And I’m sitting here ashamed, I rly don’t want to be this person, but I’ve started resenting him, he bothers me when he doesn’t even do anything. And one minute I rly want to talk to him, and the next I’m mad for no reason. This is the first this has ever happened to me. Plz give me some advice. 

I know I sound toxic and like a bad person. I kept convincing myself that I’m better off without him, but the reality is, I’m the only one with a problem and I’m clueless... I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO MAN! It’s bringing me into constant anxiety and depression.",19Mar2020,1

829,"Some back story:

So I was hit by a drunk driver about a month back, and the drunk driver totaled my truck. 

The drunk driver t-boned the bed of my truck, and caused me to drift down the highway as her drunk-self barrel rolled over the cab of my truck and continued to flip until coming to a stop in a ditch. (She lived ofc, no injuries, limber drunkies)

After the wreck, I was completely fine other than some obvious whiplash/soreness and puking my brains out on scene from the pure adrenaline rush. So no medical bills or anything crazy. Just overall kinda bummed about the truck and sore. 

The truck was in my father’s name, and my mom and him had the truck paid off. I did not make any payments on the truck. 

After settling with the person who hit me’s insurance, they agreed to pay 15k for the totaled truck and 5k for personal “pain and suffering” 

Since then my parents have bought me a new car, completely paid off with the 15k, and have kept the 5k for themselves. 

Now I completely understand that I am very lucky to not only be alive, but also having parents willing to pay off not only the truck but then use that money again to buy me a car after the fact. 

But is it wrong that I feel like I should get the 5k for “pain and suffering”?

I can see both sides, but I personally think it is unfair that they get to keep the cash settlement even though they didn’t have to go through a near death experience like I did. 

Am I being a spoiled brat? 
Or am I entitled to that money?

831,"A few days ago, the CEO of the small start up that I started working for admitted that he’s into younger women in a joking context. He’s double my age and to be honest, it made me a little uncomfortable to hear. Though it doesn’t necessarily mean he’s into me, I fear that it could jeopardize our professional relationship, let alone my career, if he gains interest.

I am one of 3 women in the whole company, otherwise it’s rather male dominated. It was a risk that I took leaving a very secure job so that I could really make a big difference and I’m damn-well good at what I do.

That being said, I am essential to the team and if I left, shit would really hit the fan very quickly. It makes me believe that he won’t try anything, but I still can’t be sure.

He is a very kind and empathetic person. I want to believe he has good intentions, but I’m afraid. I want to set professional boundaries and haven’t yet had experience doing that with a superior. I don’t want to offend him.

For context, we don’t yet have in-house HR, so I don’t have anyone to go to.

Has anyone, male or female, had experience setting boundaries with their superior? Any advice?

832,"All my life I wanted to leave my hometown. I had dreams of getting a job and moving far away. But it just so happens that in the last few months I’ve grown surprisingly close with my old friends and have began making amazing new ones. I also have been out on a few dates with a girl who so far seems incredible and really into me. Frankly, I am the happiest I have been in 5 years.

I recently graduated and have been looking for work nonstop. If it wasn’t already tough to find a job, this coronavirus could keep me unemployed for who knows how long. But I received an offer when I least expected it from a company I applied for on the other side of the country. It is a company directly benefiting from the pandemic because of the products they make. This is an excellent company to get in on but the job is a low level inside sales job. I ultimately want marketing or management but recognize the importance of sales. The job will be a grind and I know barely anyone in this city.

Ultimately, I am afraid to take this job but I am thinking I have no choice. I’m also thinking it could very well be my big break. I don’t think I have time to wait for something better now. Or to wait at all, I need to make money because I am absolutely broke and in student loan debt, living at home, and I need to get my career started.

I have no idea what I should do! I feel like I know that it would be stupid to pass up this job right now, the economy is flooding with unemployed workers. But do I leave behind my best friends? What about the girl, do I have to break it off with her? We are starting to get more serious and I’m afraid if I sleep with her now knowing that I received this offer, then we will both get more attached and it would be for nothing. How can I break it off with someone I’m falling deeply for? Now I feel like it’s all for nothing and I should just let her be but it’s so hard.

If anyone has some insights they can share or an opinion about this, I would be very happy to hear it and respond to your feedback. Thanks for reading.

TLDR: Got a job offer across the country. Coronavirus has made it impossible to get a job so there’s pressure to accept this opportunity. It’s a great company with growth potential but it would mean leaving all my friends and a new love interest who I’m very into. I’m the happiest I’ve been but feel as though I must leave it all behind to start my career because I am in student loan debt and need income.",19Mar2020,1

Catch is, I have to be back in my college town late May for summer sessions for my program, but that’s only IF we aren’t still online because who knows at this point? 

I want to be home because I feel I’ll become depressed just sitting in my apartment with no one to interact with. Also I don’t have a job because COVID has forced my job to close. So I’m not sure what to do? Do I take the deal and leave the apartment (it’s not that nice but it’s cheap) and hope I find another place for summer (I probably will?) or do I keep paying rent while living at home.

Her words:
My dad (54 y/o) has been experiencing sever pain in the chest area for about a year now. The pain is not consistent, it appears out of nowhere, repeats two to three times per week, lasts about 10 mins each, and usually goes away on its own (he sits down, takes a glass of water and the pain calms down). Last month the pain has moved to his upper back, too. Besides the pain in chest and upper back, he also feels pain in the sides of his neck (not sure how to explain this any better). Now, the pain lasts anywhere from 15 to 20 mins, however, the pain still does go away on its own. 
He has been physically active all of his life. For fact, this strange pain never appears during any physical activities, just the opposite – usually the pain appears after he comes home after work while just casually watching TV or surfing the internet. 
At first, his doctor did a general blood test, which showed him being generally healthy (including his cholesterol). He also has a normal blood pressure reading (even when read during the time when he feels the strong pain). His doctor suspected vascular disease, therefore my dad underwent cardio angiography, the results did not confirm any problem. The doctor says it may be caused because of everyday stress as he has no other explanation for such pain.

We live in Riga, Latvia. Even though my dad has already accepted that there is nothing that can be done to make the pain go away or at least make his day-to-day life less uncomfortable and also less unpredictable as he never feels the pain coming, I am looking for an advice on what could be causing this pain, or experience by anyone else who is undergoing the same symptoms. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you!

His personality is very sarcastic and snarky anyway, but it feels more malicious toward me. 

It sucks because everyone in the group is like best friends with this guy. It’s not so bad that I can’t enjoy myself with these people, but it does make me feel bad sometimes.

845,"alrighty hello!!

ima jump right into the details. 

basically, i’m fairly young, still in my teen years. i’ve never met my dad, and frankly i was neutral on that since i have a great stepdad. 

i’ve recently found out the reason that i’m even here is because my dad was cheating on his wife with my mom, while his wife was pregnant with his second. 

that information really tipped me off. my dad and i email every now and again, but finding out that stuff and that i also have siblings (three sisters) is a bit wild. 

i’ve searched every social media for his name and just generally the last name, with nothing back. 

i do really wanna meet them someday, but first, i don’t know if his wife even knows he has a kid aside from them (who knows he’s probably had other affairs), and second, he barely responds to my mails anymore, and i think that’s partially because he doesn’t want to super close to me. 

yeah, i guess i get that, but the fact is i do want to know my dad and siblings. as great as i’m living my life right now, i do want to know them but it’s so complicated because of all the details i’ve mentioned before. 

they live on a whole different continent then me, which makes things a tad harder, and everytime we even email and i ask him to tell me more about himself, he doesn’t, and only says that he’s having trouble on his end. 

what to do? any tips on what i can do, or say to him? or maybe i should just wait this out until i’m older and have more options?",19Mar2020,1

Everytime I see her I  feel at peace with the universe as if there is nothing that could ever  upset me. Her smile is infectious and her laugh warms my soul. Just being around her is enough for me to be happy. 

We will hangout at each other's houses. We will spend hours together most times with vague ideas for plans. A couple of times we have spent the  entire day just watching movies and talking together. 

I thought it was clear that I wanted more in the relationship, but that wasn't the case. I decided to make it clear that I wanted the relationship to be more than just friends. I honestly didn't expect much of a reaction. I had the feeling she didn't feel the same way about me as I did to her. Part of me still believes that there is something between us. 

When I told her how I felt she wrote me a long explanation over the subject. The main point she made was that it would be unfair to me because she is emotionally unavailable and how she isn't comfortable doing anything that a couple would do with anyone, and has never felt comfortable with anyone before with that type of stuff. She also said that she hopes my feelings don't get hurt because she isn't ready for anything with anybody.

Is this just an elaborate rejection, or is this someone that doesn't think they have ever felt that way for anyone?

I personally can't wrap my brain around this response. The part of me that wants more between the two of us hopes that the reply is just expressing thier lack of understanding for thier feelings. They haven't ever dated anyone before and u could understand not knowing understanding how you feel. I have dated some other girls before and know exactly how I feel.

Almost two years ago when I was between jobs, I applied for and received unemployment. Those benefits ran out in February of 2019, and the claim ended in July of 2019. I have been trying to apply for unemployment again this because of this virus, but the UI online website won't let me file a new claim. It still shows that old claim as if it's still active or something. I have tried calling the contact us number all week but haven't even been put on hold because so many people are calling in the whopping 4 hours they're open each day.

860,"At a really down point in my life I found this guru guy who inspired me not to commit suicide. In retrospect, this guy preyed on me. Luckily I never payed for his crazy courses and whatnot and only ever spent less than $100 on his books, but I found out he's a Scientologist (and one of the highest ranking ones too: OTVIII, friends with Miscavidge, the whole nine yards). Then I looked into Scientology and realized his teachings is basically scientology but for entrepreneurs. So basically I've been brainwashed into Scientology over the past 3 years and only now, when the other circumstances of my life are way better, am I realizing this is holding me back from being happy, and in fact is starting to make all the progress I've made turn around. It's weird too because I've been led to think that all the good in my life is thanks to this guy and what he taught me (instead of my independent thoughts and actions and efforts) and all the bad is my own fault and because I didn't follow his teachings strongly enough (when, honestly, the only bad in my life now is the mental prison I've been brainwashed into). I'm proud of myself for always being weary enough not to buy his courses or go and join his company/cult (and I had two opportunities to do so) and not join Scientology when they tried to get me in.

862,"Without too much detail, here’s a bit of background. I’m 20 and the last time I felt in control of my life was the very start of high school (when I was 14). The past two years especially have been terrible. After a lot of stuff that happened, my plan was to start at my local community college this summer/fall and go there and work until transferring to a four year school for the last two years. Going straight to a four year school isn’t an option. While in community college, I can live with my parents rent free and they’ll cover all of my essentials and phone. I’m extremely grateful for this and realize how lucky I am to have this option. 

But at the same time, I want to move out. I have so many memories in this house and town and they’re taking a toll on my mental health (I have depression, anxiety, and potentially PTSD). I also want to feel in control of my life and the plan above isn’t by my choice. With all of this, I’ve been thinking of moving out once the Coronavirus is less of an issue. I’ve known for awhile I’ll end up across the country so I looked there. I found a town with one bedroom apartments for under $1k a month (not including all utilities), it has another location of that store I currently work at that I could transfer to, and it has a community college with direct transfers to four year colleges, at least one of which has my intended majors. 

Would it be a bad idea to move out to this town I found when I have the option to live at home, expense free, and focus on saving money and my education, even though doing so takes a toll on my mental health?

863,"I really don't know where to post this. The ChildAbuseDiscussion subreddit appears to have been dead for a year, so I'm posting here.
I'll try to keep it short.

My former partner has a lot of siblings. They all grew up in a dangerously abusive household. Things have been better since their mom left their dad, but it's still not great. A few of the siblings are now adults, my former partner included, as well as two of his sisters. The other kids are all under 18 and still live at home.

One of the siblings, we'll call her Emma. She's 17, and has really bad age regression, sometimes. She also has a habit of taunting the younger kids, trapping them, and putting her hands over their mouth and nose. I witnessed it for the first time yesterday, but I know it's happened a lot. One of the adults had a baby and had to move out because Emma was doing this to her infant.

I don't know what to do. Emma is already on meds, and she's in family therapy, but she won't really talk to anyone about what's going on, or why she does this.

I'm really worried about the effect it's having on the other kids, and obviously the effect it's having on Emma. And Emma was saying the other day how she wants a baby, and honestly... I kind of think she might kill a baby if she ever has one while still in the mental state she's in.

Anyway, guess I'm just wondering why this child is trying to suffocate other kids, and what I can do to support the family while I'm there.

872,"I feel like many can relate to this potentially... I have been with my company for two years and I must say the content of my work is NOT my passion (I work in insurance). I am 3 years out of college and the pay was decent, I get good benefits, plentiful paid time off, and it’s a very well known stable, corporate job. 

I turned down other better paying jobs to be close to my fiancé who obviously had a job opportunity to make a lot more money than I do, so I feel like I settled with my current job. Before this pandemic and financial fiasco was heavily impacting all our lives, I would occasionally apply for jobs every month. I was dedicated to find a company and role where I could challenge and utilize more of my skills. So I have a upcoming phone interview with a marketing and sales tech start up company that’s only 4 years old but very successful. The role and culture is more of what I’m looking for. 

My fiancé and I got in an argument and he is really deterring me from even doing the job interview because of global crisis and the fact that we are headed into a recession. We have over 35k saved up which we planned for our wedding and to save for a house, but worse case scenario, could use for an emergency. He is by no means even close to being laid off but the uncertainty of the economy is his biggest argument and says I need to ride it out with my current stable job. I have some animosity and resentment built up since he makes over six figures and I make less than half of that. But due to the economy faltering, he could be making a lot less (75k) since sales aren’t blooming for his company, and his worry is that my new job wouldn’t be stable. I feel I have already sacrificed turning down other opportunities. I also know we would be able to manage with our savings and his salary.

874," Hi all, I've been in a really tough spot and I don't know what to do, any and all advice would be appreciated.

So I'm wrapping up my first year of a PhD. program (Mechanical Engineering, direct admit without a Masters). When I was applying to schools last year I originally had a list of 8 or so schools I wanted to apply to, but due to a combinations of factors (poor advising, lack of funds, self-doubt, etc.) I only ended up applying to 2. I got into both, and had to choose between a well known P.I. at a small school in a city I didn't think I'd like, or a new prof at a large school in an area I loved. Not knowing what I was looking for exactly in a grad school experience, I opted for the later out of a want for adventure.

Fast forward to the first quarter of this year, I was already beginning to doubt my decision.

For one, my P.I. had given me the opportunity to choose a project in an area they weren't quite familiar with but which she was excited about (part of the reason i choose them). This was starting to create some problems though, mainly that they knew next to nothing about the topic I was interested in, but insisted that I persist with the path I had began going down. While I understand this was my own choosing, I underestimated how frustrating it would be when the answer to my question of ""I don't know if this has been done before, can you help me?"" would be ""Go read so more and tell me what you find"". This is also compounded by the fact that there is no other faculty at this school who do research similar enough to mine to be of any help. I keep thinking that, if I just went with the well known P.I. with the large lab and a project laid out for me this would be so much easier.

Second, I am starting to realize that I do not like the way my P.I. manages. In short, they are very controlling and manipulative. Compared with P.I.'s that I worked with as an undergrad, they seem to want to control every aspect of the work. While I understand that they may be trying to teach us things they see as best practices, often it causes headaches for me and my colleagues, leading us to have to spend more time completing a task than if we did it with methods we knew were easier for us. Beyond the simple micromanaging, their personality just seems toxic to me, with them make very condescending remarks about other professors in the department, other research groups we may be ""competing with"" and also about me and other students in the lab.

Third, the quality of courses and administration at the school are worse than I could have ever imagined. Maybe I was privileged to go to a school where the professors actually cared about their students and made an effort to teach relevant material in an effective manner, but I have experience nothing but frustration with every instructor and administrator at the university thus far. As with many schools, this has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. The school refuses to shut labs down and is intentionally making it more difficult from students to work from home so they have no choice but to continue to work in labs, even if it is an unsafe environment. The school has even gone as far as threaten not to renew our fellowships if we travel and get sick while traveling.

In short, I don't know what to do? Is this a normal thing a lot of grad students experience? Will this go away with time? Should I stick it out? Masters out? Who can I talk to?

Ideally I would like to reapply/transfer to other schools, but I don't know if that's a thing/possible? If anyone has done that please let me know, and how you did it.

Again, sorry for the long read, and I really appreciate any and all advice that y'all could give me.

Thank you!!!",19Mar2020,2

Quick details: Studied Modern Language in uni (German.) Lived in Germany. In Germany, met my GF (she's from Spain.) Got a job teaching English in Spain. Shit is hitting the fan.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a young (25 y/o) in shape guy with a really healthy diet, so I am not worried about serious complications if I get sick.

&amp;#x200B;

I have, so far, committed to staying here, as I am more or less confident that I will be paid during the quarantine. Even if not, I have savings to last a few months comfortably. More if I needed to. I really have no interest in being away from my GF.

&amp;#x200B;

Here, I have healthcare. The quarantine is being handled responsibly. I have income. If anything goes horribly wrong, my GF's family has offered to take us in (they live very close.) The epidemic is already in full swing here, and going back home to the US seems not only irresponsible and dangerous, but it would also effectively take me back in time a few weeks- adding to the length of social distancing and stress. US is a month behind Spain, is a month behind Italy, is a month behind China, ya dig?

&amp;#x200B;

US seems to be, so far, handling this quite poorly. I feel more confident in Spain. However, I just got an e-mail from the State Dept. that US citizens are STRONGLY recommended to get a return trip home by ""any commercial means necessary."" Between this, and my family insisting as much as passive-aggressive-midwestern folks can, it's got me doubting.

Last night we fell asleep in my bed after watching Bohemian Rhapsody. When we woke up, we hugged and talked for like three hours.

I told him this feels like I'm leading him on, he says he doesn't mind. He also says he doesn't know if he's crossing his own boundaries and admits he doesn't know if he should be letting himself do this since it feels so nice and comforting, but he wants more.

I don't.

And I don't want to be the villain if he gets hurt over this.

I know that socially, I should have put a stop to this ages ago. But society is dumb, I thought, and I'm not hurting anyone. We're both very clear on the fact that I don't like him in that way and that the moment either of us get into a relationship, this affection should end out of respect for the partner.

895,"Hey everyone, I’ve been at a battle with my thoughts here and wanted to see if people have gone through something similar.

As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic has obliterated everyone’s plans and has caused loads of worry - meanwhile the most important thing is keeping us and the people around us healthy. That’s where I run into some trouble.

Some backstory: my girlfriend (18) and I (20) have been together for a little over a year now. We’re from Canada but I study in the UK, so we’ve been doing long distance. In fact, our relationship started as an LDR. We only see each other during Christmas (~3 weeks) and Summer break. Although we haven’t had as much time together, our relationship’s progressed a lot ofer the past year and we’re more or less obsessed with each other. 

Then comes the news about this pandemic, and schools begin to close so I get on the soonest flight back home. Understandably, to keep people safe, we’re recommended to undergo a two-week isolation period upon our return. 

I’m currently four days into my self-iso and it’s harder than ever. We make our best efforts to talk over FaceTime and everything but having not seen my girlfriend in months (although she did visit me for two days last month while in the UK with her friends), I’ve been dying to see her.

I’ve always been pretty health cautious and since the announcement of the pandemic I’ve been more than cautious, particularly at the airport when I arrived. Nonetheless, I took the health advice provided and started my self- isolation. 

It’s gotten pretty hard and that’s why I want to hear people’s thoughts on potentially seeing her sooner than these two weeks. I study in the medical field so I’ve done loads of research on the incubation period for the virus and all its parameters. I obviously don’t want to put her nor her family at risk, and so I’ve kept that as my motivation throughout the past few days.

Has anyone been going through a similar situation? Love to hear some thoughts.

TL;DR: Back from studying abroad cause of the virus and dying to see my girlfriend (LDR) before my self-isolation’s complete.",19Mar2020,1

We started mainly by making stuff in creative, but eventually we wanted to make a serious survival world. No cheats, no keep inventory, hard mode. I think you can guess where this is going from the title.  
I had OP on the server, everyone did. It was a honour system, seeing as we'd often revert to the creative world and need to use OP commands to make our cool stuff.

When it comes to singleplayer games, I love creative-type modes. When I'm mad at a game, I usually use cheat codes to spawn stuff in so I can have fun. Multiplayer taught me to start liking that struggle a little. So eventually when I spawned in some food when I was about to starve in our survival world, I thought little of it.  
Eventually, I spawned something in without thinking when someone was watching my discord stream (I was showing them a build). Obviously, they were upset, and I think I'm viewed as a cheater now.  
I could try and apologize, which I did through DMs, but I think the fact that we play D&amp;D made a forgive and forget scenario kinda difficult to create.

908,"Am I being selfish for wanting to leave my awful job for a riskier more desirable job during an upcoming recession?

I feel like many can relate to this potentially... I have been with my company for two years and I must say the content of my work is NOT my passion (I work in insurance). I am 3 years out of college and the pay was decent, I get good benefits, plentiful paid time off, and it’s a very well known stable, corporate job. 

I turned down other better paying jobs to be close to my fiancé who obviously had a job opportunity to make a lot more money than I do, so I feel like I settled with my current job. Before this pandemic and financial fiasco was heavily impacting all our lives, I would occasionally apply for jobs every month. I was dedicated to find a company and role where I could challenge and utilize more of my skills. So I have a upcoming phone interview with a marketing and sales tech start up company that’s only 4 years old but very successful. The role and culture is more of what I’m looking for. 

My fiancé and I got in an argument and he is really deterring me from even doing the job interview because of global crisis and the fact that we are headed into a recession. We have over 35k saved up which we planned for our wedding and to save for a house, but worse case scenario, could use for an emergency. He is by no means even close to being laid off but the uncertainty of the economy is his biggest argument and says I need to ride it out with my current stable job. I have some animosity and resentment built up since he makes over six figures and I make less than half of that. But due to the economy faltering, he could be making a lot less (75k) since sales aren’t blooming for his company, and his worry is that my new job wouldn’t be stable. I feel I have already sacrificed turning down other opportunities. I also know we would be able to manage with our savings and his salary.

Am I selfish or stupid for continuing my job search? I can’t put up with my role much longer. 

PS I would never leave my company until I secured the job offer.",19Mar2020,1
909,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

Okay, here goes.

For some context, my brother (mid 20's) has always been a weird guy. Delusions of grandeur, kind of incel-y, closet trans, stuck in the same dead end job since high school, you name it. He's always been much more comfortable spending time with girls than guys, and they are often much younger than he is. Many of them are still in high school, and he works with most of them. Nothing too crazy so far, I've always just found it odd. 

But, we had a conversation last night that scared the shit out of me

We're hanging out at home, and he complains to me about an underage girl who added him on Facebook and is exchanging messages with. I tell him not to engage, block her and move on. Brother says no, if she's adding him, she's likely adding other people she doesn't know and could get herself into trouble. 

I tell him it's not his concern nor his business, he's not the police and he's not her dad. But brother is full on whiteknighting this girl. Saying ""not everyone is as nice as me and I worry she'll get hurt. There are lots of predators out there and I'm a nice person"" Sure. Nothing wrong there. 

I reassure him that the law enforcement for child abuse and child porn is very sophisticated. Any questionable Google search or web activity will put you on a list until the end of time, and the police take this shit seriously.

This FREAKS him out. He freezes, and takes a few seconds to respond. Asks me questions about what they do with that list, if they take any action to people who search that stuff, etc. I tell him I'm really not sure, because I'm not a cop.

But here's the kicker. After some silence he gives me a ""controversial"" stance on child porn. Says it's bad, it's horrible, obviously people who participate should be in jail. BUT, people who just write STORIES about child porn shouldn't go to jail.

What. The. Fuck... Who says that? ""Controversial"" is putting that LIGHTLY. 

I can't look him in the eye, I'm terrified of the shit he might be up to or into. I don't know if I should take any action, I don't know which resources to contact. I want to chalk this up to overreacting but I have a very bad feeling in my gut that something is wrong.

He's my brother, I don't want to conspire against him, but I can't shake this and I really don't know if I should.

I really don't know who to talk to, so any insight would be helpful and I'd appreciate it so much

910,"My partner (30) and I (27) have been together for four years. We've met as roommates, so we've been living together from day one and splitting expenses absolutely 50/50 to the penny. He earns about 20% more than me, but that's okay. We agreed to split our bills proportionally once we're married and it's all shared anyway. We have no plans to marry any time soon, maybe in two or three years I suppose?

Anyway, when we met I had absolutely no savings because I just finished my education. My parents are not the supportive type, so I can't ever expect any financial relief on that side.

He had about 15K saved up from working for three years (our age difference) and his parents are often happy to give money. He's made it clear from the start that if we ever buy a home together, he expects me to pay half towards it or I'd have to pay him rent.

I think that makes sense. I don't want to be a gold-digger. So basically I've been saving plenty since we got together and I'm at 20K now. But I still can't catch up. He's saving more due to higher salary, even though he once took a few months off just to relax. In the duration of our relationship his parents have given him about 50K which I - as petty as I feel for it - am quite jealous of. I feel anxious to catch up, but the numbers just don't make sense. I don't think I will be able to.

Another point is that we just moved into his deceased grandparents' bungalow for a limited time and are using his parents' car. Due to the move we had to quit jobs and Corona is making it difficult to find new ones. I'm glad we live rent-free in the house, but money is still flowing for bills and renovation, so I'm worried.

The car is a problem now. Basically his parents paid to have him on the insurance, but won't pay for me to be on it, so I can't drive at the moment. My partner said I could pay for it myself which is about $80 a month here which is another expense that chews away at my savings and not at his. That's a bit much right now.

His parents said they'd pay for the car, but he says he doesn't really intend to share that car long-term, so I'd have to get my own eventually and pay for it and all expenses by myself. He might help me with the initial buying price, but only if I stick to a car under 2K.

He was very upset when I thought it wasn't very fair to suddenly separate car costs, with him not paying any of his part by himself, even though he has much more. We used to share a car and 100% of every penny spent on it. I expected this to be the same, just distributed over two cars of equal value.

We had a fight. Multiple fights over the last few weeks actually. He says if we marry in a few years, we'd pool our money anyway, but honestly he hasn't given me the impression that his absolute 50/50 plan would change. When we eat, he even gets stroppy if I have a crumb more food on my plate.

Bottom line is I can't drive by myself anywhere and find it unfair of him to have me pay for everything on my own. I moved to his parents neighborhood, my whole family and everyone I know live in a different country, so I have no support system while he gets everything sorted for him without lifting a finger. I'm getting very frustrated that ""meeting in the middle"" has turned into changing my entire life to move to his parents' town in the middle of nowhere, being completely dependent on my partner and socially isolated due to unemployment.

I'm angry at myself for feeling like a gold-digger because I like to pay for my own things, but it makes me feel like an idiot if I'm the only one doing it. I'm angry at my parents for their life decisions, leaving me in a tough financial situation for many years leading up to my relationship and constantly complaining about every penny they spent on bringing me up.

What do I do? This is virtual word vomit, so please don't be too harsh on me if I'm being a complete idiot here, but what is your opinion? Am I being in the wrong here? I feel like my vision is clouded by other frustrations.",19Mar2020,1
