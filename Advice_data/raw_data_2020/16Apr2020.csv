1,"'m a 16 year old guy and I am sick of my mom and sister. My parents got divorced and I moved in with my mom because my dad isn't the greatest person. I don't want to live with either of them. My mom is fucking crazy. All she does is yell and scream, she never takes responsibility for her own fuckups. For example right now, she lost her nametag for work. SHE did, and she's freaking out and panicking and screaming at my sister and I because she can't find it and is blaming us. Or also, sometimes when I ask he what we are having for dinner, instead of just saying, ""I don't know"" or just simply TELLING me what we're having, she yells at me and says ""I DON'T FUCKING KNOW YET.""She has always been like this but it all got amped up once we moved into where we are now. She makes everything so difficult. 

I visited my dad during spring break back in my old home, and it was the most relaxed I've been in a long time. It made me realize how much my mom stresses me out and how much I hate living with her.

I'm only 16, and I've been trying to find jobs but it's been difficult due to quarantine. I've been trying to do things to just stay away from her like working out and watching my favorite shows and movies but, every single day there is something new for her to scream about.

How can I just suck it up and deal with it until I'm able and ready to move out on my own?",16Apr2020,1
2,"Forgive any mistakes, first time poster. Due to covid I am currently jobless on top of the fact that I could barely afford monthly bills as it is. I am a paycheck to paychecker that is just the unfortunate reality. I'm intereated in opinions and advice as to whether or not I am handling this properly. I can't figure out how to add screen shots so I will rewrite the conversation word for word. This is between me and my landlord. She is trying to collect rent from me(rightfully so) but I literally do not have it and do not know when I will have a sense of normalcy back considering the current lockdown. Full disclosure: I have been late on rent but do always end up paying with fees in full before actually being evicted. When she needs to collect this month I explain my current situation, that ive applied for unemployment am looking for a job and still may get back to work if restaurants reopen in may.This is what happened when I asked her about the current stop on evictions and having 120 days to get caught up.

LL- I am very concerned because in 2 weeks you will owe 1800 dollars - if this is something you cannot dig out of you should think about moving and giving your apt back to us-the rent will not stop accruing- I don't see how people are going to get caught up
LL-its very concerning for renters - its a protection but its not at the same time 

ME-I agree and understand, unfortunately is what it is  don't think anyone knows how to handle it properly, that's why I'm trying to see what happens on the 30 with the lockdown

LL-tomorrow call this person asap [insert name and number]- they are paying partial to full rent for people affected by COVI9- 

I say thank you and she also sends me a list of places hiring (appreciated)
Next morning I call the rental assistance and they are willing to help but need a few documents from me as well as my LL so I will need a little bit to collect the info-no big I thought. Then I receive this..

LL-[my name] did you talk to [rental assistance lady]? she hasn't called me about you yet

ME-I think I'm eligible? I'm applying? She said the check will be cut to you guys directly  if/when. I'm doing all in my power to pay bills that's all I have as an update for you, in the meantime you can send her a w9 with a statement of what is owed as part of the application to [assistant ladies email]

ME-I have not recieved a stimulus or unemployment yet. I am looking for a job but we are still on lockdown.i have no money coming in at the moment so unless you are serving a formal eviction I can't really do anything else,Until then yes I plan on paying when I can and I don't know what else to tell you

LL-Weird because I have 400 other apartments and everyone else has been up at 7am calling Gail getting rent paid, 3 people got jobs today that rent from me - Sounds like you might need to get out and try
And your not ""off the hook"" for paying rent - it will continue to accrue and I will evict you as soon as the stay lifts - So you need to figure it out or move out and not ruin your credit which this will 

ME-I understand my rights once again if you read what I've wrote multiple times I plan on paying and am doing what I can considering we are on a lockdown, I told you what [rental assistant lady] needs from you and I am getting what she needs from me. Bad credit versus being homeless is the reality and I'm taking it into consideration this is bordering harassment, again I do not know what else you want me to say or do for you

LL-Okay [my name] you win I will stop helping you - good luck 


What in the actual fuck. Am I taking this too personally bc I am so stressed out in general?. How should I continue contact? I do not want to keep saying the wrong things but also don't want them to think I am trying to ignore them. I'm not an idiot I know that I will still owe the rent but that's for me to deal with when that time comes berating me doesn't magically make money appear.",16Apr2020,2
3,"Some background: For the past three years I have been struggling with depression (I‚Äôve recently started to see a councilor). The confidence that I had in myself was completely demolished. I gained a 25 pounds and  have struggled academically(I kept all As though). This year I worked up the courage to ask for professional help for my mental illness. I am trying to build my self up again by working hard to improve my life. Along side feeling like myself again, I want to start working out. I was never really into to fitness.I also have a medical condition that prevents me from sweating enough, so working out can be dangerous if I don‚Äôt take proper precautions like spritzing myself with water and taking breaks to allow my body to cool off. However I‚Äôve had it since I was born so I can manage it pretty well.  

Recently I watched a video on YouTube of a young lady pole dancing. YouTube recommendations work in mysterious ways. She was dressed in what looked like gym clothes ü§Ø( I grew up being told everything who was a pole dancer was a slutty whore so this shocked me). And she wasn‚Äôt super revealing at all. I was taken aback by how beautifully expressive her dance was and how confident she was. Her dance was an amazing show of athleticism. It inspired me to want to try pole dancing. I want to feel sexy, confident and strong so I thought that this would be a great way for me to get healthier and become more confident. I don‚Äôt want to go out in front of a crowd and do it, I want to do it in private for me. However, as a nearly 17 year old female, I have to have my parents approval for my activities. 

I love my parents and appreciate everything that they do for me, but communication is something we struggle with plus they use religion as a club. My mom thinks that me and my brother staying up too late causes demonic activity in the house that gives her nightmares and that mental illnesses are from Satan. She is also big into modesty culture. I  also think that she has self esteem issues because of her weight and being cheated on by my dad three times with three different women. In past I have tried to help her by doing workouts with her and eating healthy with her but she ends up giving up. She gets snarky about other women‚Äôs clothing choices in public and says that Victoria‚Äôs Secret is for hussies. Despite her having panties and perfume from the store. I had to beg to be allowed to use my own money that I earned from my job to go to the mall to shop there. Buying a bra and thong set from that store was the most empowering feeling I had in a while. She got very upset about it and I had to explain to her that I was doing it for me. No one would know if I was wearing the set I bought or a sports bra. I felt confident and that‚Äôs all that mattered. Her response to her kids having different ideas than her often are: ‚ÄúYou better go to God with that‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou need to repent!‚Äù Along with crying. 
My dad gets aggressive when I tell him that I don‚Äôt want to go to church because I am tired (Depression is an energy/motivation leech) and teams up with my mom to make snippy comments to me throughout the week when I don‚Äôt go. ‚ÄúxXAccount1234Xx can do the dishes because she didn‚Äôt go to church‚Äù(I do the dishes frequently so I‚Äôm not complaining that I have to do chores it just the way he says it hurts my heart) he also calls me a heathen . My church post services online and I listen to a radio program as well so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm giving up on religion. I‚Äôm just tired from pretending to be happy all the time. He sets different standards for me because I am the only girl. My older brother can sleep in the same tent as his girlfriend when we go camping but if I get a boyfriend (I‚Äôve never dated before) I can‚Äôt until we are married. I‚Äôve never had a male friend because I was raised to avoid them. He is very passive-aggressive and I wish that I could talk to him without being made to feel like my thoughts don‚Äôt matter. For example, Whenever he asks what I want to eat he ends up shutting down my idea and goes to the restaurant he wanted to go to. Stuff like that. 

I love both of them and they are decent people despite their flaws, but they have very archaic and downright strange views(a lot that I have had to unlearn).  I have All As, work a part-time job, manage my own finances and am responsible enough for them to feel comfortable leaving me and my younger brother(15) alone for a week while they went on a retreat. I am very obedient and have given them no reason not to trust me. I think that I am an age where I can decide what activities benefit me. 

My question: How/Should I approach this situation with my parents? Should I even ask them? Am I wrong for wanting to try pole dancing? Should I just give up on the idea entirely? 

PS I‚Äôm sorry this is so long and rant-y  

Edit: Added a question for clarity",16Apr2020,3
4,"My sunglasses get my nose oils from the sebaceous glands all over. I don‚Äôtwear sunglasses as much as I should. My regular glasses are the main issue. I have the Kind where there aren‚Äôt any nose pads and the whole black matte finish plastic frame is one piece including where it sits on my nose. That part gets so dang oily and greasy that I have to wipe it off and wipe the part of my nose every 20-30 minutes because it‚Äôs so greasy that it feels disgusting and starts to slide. What‚Äôs worse is that If I take them off for a minute and put them back on while greasy, then it feels like cold greasy oil between hard plastic and my nose and it feels like acne waiting to breakout. Rubbing them off with a dry cloth or tissue is ok but after a couple times I have to just use rubbing alcohol to really dry and disintegrate all the oil. Is there any sort of black tape of a rough fabric or anything I can put on the nose area of the glasses so that it isn‚Äôt so slippery and sleek?",16Apr2020,1
5,"We started talking on omegle.

7,"I am in my second year of uni and I am getting ready to apply for my major, Urban planning and Sustainable Development and recently I have been questioning myself if this major actually interests me or I just choose it because I listened to my brain thinking that the major is a stable choice. 

To give you some background, before I went to uni I thought of majoring in Computer Science (cs) because it is an open-ended field that can be applied to many fields like gaming, web dev, and health care. I liked that you can create a program to do a task more efficiently. When I entered uni, I dropped pursuing (cs) because my teacher's teaching style made cs was very hard to understand basic concepts. I tried a business major but dropped it because I was not interested in learning about accounting, economics, ect. I also tried Design because I am creative, however not in the sense of painting and art, I was more interested in web design because you can create cool websites using code and applications. 

Recently, I tried urban planning and sustainable development because I was interested in urban design and architecture, I liked the idea of how you can shape the physical features of cities. After taking some classes, I am starting to question myself if this is the right major for me because it's more liberal thinking, like the theory of cities, human development, and government systems. 

I've been questioning if it's something I really want to pursue my career and enjoy or if I am just choosing this major because it aligns up with my interest in urban design and architecture. I have been feeling lost in the major because I feel like I'm just doing the work just to get it done rather than truly enjoying what I do. I feel like a failure. Apart of me wants to go back to computer science because I liked the structured and logical thinking, I was able to challenge myself and I could be creative with projects. But I feel like it is too late to switch majors now because I'm already taken many urban planning classes, and I would have to take math classes again for cs. I am just not sure what I want to do in life and time is running out. I am not sure who to reach out to for help.

TL;DR: I feel like I am losing interest in the major I choose and feel lost.",16Apr2020,2
10,"I don't know what to do. Since the quarantine started I've realized that I follow a pattern of only speaking to my friends at school and sort of ""losing them"" while we're on breaks. To be honest I neither feel like any of them really understand me, nor that they try. I'm usually always the one who initiates conversations unless someone wants my help with work for school. 

Should I just forget about it or try to talk to them about it? If so, how can I do that without upsetting them and making my situation worse?",16Apr2020,1
11,"So I kinda fucked up this entire year. I had a mental breakdown about 4 months ago, that I for some reason told no one about. I ended up not going to school for a while, and build myself 25% absence for the year. Consequently, I got expelled. I know they‚Äôre fully in their right to do so, but it kinda blindsided me, due to the school not notifying me about anything until it was too late.

This happened approximately a week ago, and I‚Äôve so far told a couple of close friends and my dad. I‚Äôm 18 and live with my mom (parents hate each other with passion). She will without a doubt kick me out of the house, leaving me with literally nowhere to go (dad lives in another country). My mom is the kinda person that once sued my dad for 100$, and have kicked me out before for much less. Now that I‚Äôm 18 and legally an adult, there are no laws prohibiting her from completely disowning me, and I have no clue about what to do. Me and my dad are too scared to tell her and amidst the pandemic, getting a replacement job is near impossible.

Also it feels like I just ruined my life.",16Apr2020,2

15,"I started playing an online game I left a while ago and found I was basically so far behind that I was pretty much a newbie. I was picked up by this guild that helped me get back on track and I really enjoyed being with them. I've gotten to know them personally, and they're great, great people. We shoot the sh\*t around quite often and even have drinking games set up. We've also helped each other through different crises in our lives. It's a family. I got all caught up in the game, became an officer and took on more responsibilities, and have an active role in representing the guild in discussions with the game developers. I've ended up in the top rankings of the game myself alongside them, ranking even higher at times.

I eventually found out they mostly all used to be the top top players in the game who have since retired from that lifestyle to play more casually (which is funny, because they're still in the Top 10 or so rankings of the game lol). They've since constantly told me that the lifestyle of playing in the top top echelons of the game is not sustainable, and it's terrible. Horror stories of toxic people obsessed with the game, backstabbing,  unrealistic expectations, not having a life, feeling empty and cynical...

I believe them. But at the same time, I can't help but feel that competitive itch. I've gotten good enough to shoot higher and get more in-game prizes and I want to see our entire guild do the same, but they're content staying where they are and aren't interested in pushing the guild to go further. When I bring it up, they tell me all the stories and lessons they've learned and how they've had a history with that life and I shouldn't subject myself to it... but I don't know it for myself. I'm not that type of person. I can't live my life acting only based on what others have told me. I need to know it for myself, too.

I feel this is like a situation where I'm considering not going to a top college so that I can attend a lower-ranked one to be with my friends. I guess I'd be happier in the short run, but selling myself short in the long run.

So I've been considering asking the guild master and my officer friends if I can take some sort of ""break"" from there to go join a higher ranking guild, see if it's for me and the type of experience I want out of this game, and then come back if it isn't the place I should be. I've gotten several invitations to be in higher ranking groups, and have made friends in those groups, too. I want to have a better understanding of the ""history"" they tell me that's so terrible, because I'm not quite seeing it. I don't feel burned out like they do, or as cynical about the competitiveness of the game. And it wouldn't be fair for me to sit in the guild disgruntled and act like I'm not frustrated.

But I can't help but feel guilty. These people basically put me back on the map, and now I'm leaving them because I'm unsatisfied with the rewards. It makes me ungrateful. These people are also my friends, so I'm not sure if they're going to take it personally, though they are pretty reasonable overall. At the same time, being an officer, I feel a lot more attachment to this guild than a casual member, and I have responsibilities to transition out of. I'd also lose out on my spot in speaking with the game developers since I'd no longer be an officer in the new guild I'd be joining. And I'm not sure I'd be given this position again if I were to leave and come back... not that that would be the worst thing in the world, I guess. But I have been a prominent voice in it.

I'm pretty sure I'm making this issue more complicated than it is. Thanks for any advice!",16Apr2020,1
16,"TLDR last paragraph. This Saturday I'm going to have to say goodbye to my best friend for the past 5 years and first real pet, my ginger cat named Ed (I have plenty of posts about him). 

I've had him since he was a kitten, born and raised, and ultimately rescued him from my negligent family when I moved out in 2016. He's only 5 years old, but he has developed splenomegaly (an enlarged spleen) through an unknown cause (could be cancer, could be anything else). The vet made it sound unreasonable to pay for a $2000 surgery that we can't afford and may or may not allow him to recover. 

I can't help but feel like I could be doing more than giving him a loving final week. I feel guilty and helpless. He's literally my best buddy and only friend. I'm already going through the stages of grief but I don't know how to keep myself mentally healthy while I get over this, since I have a bad mental health history with bipolar disorder and depression, which he helped me get through. 

Should I get another pet? Should I spend the money I don't have and risk a life of surgery for him if it's malignant cancer? Should I just ride the waves and hope for the best? Or should I try something else? What have you all done to help yourselves?

19,"Lately I've been feeling really touch starved, it's not just because of the quarantine, but it certainly has been intensified by it. I've never been cuddled before, and I crave it so much. I hear everyone talking about how they're always cuddling with their boyfriend/girlfriend, and while I do feel happy for them, I sort of wish I could experience what they're experiencing. Just to feel what it's like to be held by another person, to feel wanted... 

I'm in a long distance relationship right now, and even though my boyfriend is the most charming, considerate guy I could ever ask for, I still feel like there's something missing. I know it's extremely selfish of me, but I just can't keep the distance off my mind. I want to be there with him, I want to be by his side, I want to hug him and never let go, but I have a sinking feeling that'll never happen.

26,"*Disclaimer - This post is not intended to be political, but an objective understanding of why I keep thinking this way.* 

Good evening this is a difficult concept for me to fully express or even understand fully, so please bear with me. 

I find myself, defending the President, and I'm not sure why. 

Part of it may have to do with my relationship with my father who has been a lifelong Republican but fucking HATES the President. Every morning at breakfast he echoes what he read on the new at the table. 

*I land much more on the libertarian side of things, but it's sort the ideological equivalent of a cat - thinks it's superior, but hopelessly dependant on others to exist. I guess Amish fit that bill too.* 

But it goes beyond that. The internet, the news, anything that is basically illustrates what the President isn't doing correctly irritates and even angers me. Even if it's a completely valid, objective critique. 

I didn't vote for him (and definitely not for her). 

But I feel like I owe him the benefit of the doubt? A defense? And I don't know why. 

I don't have a desire to be in the populist side of things in rallying against the president (I'm from the SF Bay Area).

Nor do I have a desire to support him (I served in the military under two Presidents) as many of my friends have. 

Calling people deplorable or racist because they support him drives me crazy.

Calling people who oppose him communists and stupid fucking Californians also irritates me. 

I tell myself, ""I don't like the way he acts, or what he says but I like what he does.""

&amp;#x200B;

It's a very conflicted feeling, that I don't enjoy. I'm comfortable with disagreement, but it feels so volatile and it's a point of stress. 

I don't know how to understand my belief system, how to rationalize it and would like some advice about effective methods for self-relfection. 

I want to understand why I feel the way I do.

Thank you for your time.",16Apr2020,2
27,"I‚Äôm 25 years old. I‚Äôve never had much stomach trouble my whole life. Even with the anxiety I‚Äôve dealt with, my stomach/digestion has been well off. The last 6 months or so, however, I‚Äôve noticed more gas pains and bloating than ever before. Sometimes I get such bad bloat in my stomach that my back hurts and I feel like I can‚Äôt move. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a rock in my stomach. It usually settles down after a couple hours. I notice it more late at night, before bed. I can‚Äôt do anything but lay down. Once I‚Äôm asleep and wake up in the morning- I‚Äôm fine, usually.

These severe gas pains are not consistent. In fact, I can go weeks without them, but when I get them.. they‚Äôre so bad and extremely uncomfortable! I do experience nausea at times too.

Last night I had the bloat and uncomfortable pains. I woke up feeling better this morning, I ate oatmeal with fruit, and even worked out. After I ate lunch, I developed an annoying stomach ache. It was different than the bloating pains I get, but it came and went and my stomach felt unsettled. I ended up having diarrhea one time a couple hours ago. Since then, it‚Äôs felt a tad better, but not 100%. 

I just feel a lot of tightness in my stomach/abdomen, even when there‚Äôs no pain, it feels uncomfortable and tense. I do NOT get diarrhea often at all. I know that‚Äôs a symptom of IBS, but my bowels are usually pretty normal except today, after a random stomach ache. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs a food sensitivity or if I have a digestive issue. I can‚Äôt pinpoint exactly what I might be sensitive to because, as I mentioned, these are random occurrences.

29,"I really like my friend, she‚Äôs a wonderful person, but I go through cycles of feeling with her. When we initially met I was physically attracted to her, but because we sorta worked together it wasn‚Äôt appropriate. I got to know her and we just hit it off, always a fun night with her, and we both made an effort. After we graduated I thought we‚Äôd never see each other, but we see each other at least once a week if not more now. The only issue is that she‚Äôs polyamorous.  I‚Äôm okay with polyamory, I‚Äôve been in polyamorous relationships before, but never with fiends. 

Since the pandemic, we‚Äôve spent more time time together watching movies, cooking dinner and other activities. All this time I‚Äôve spent with her has just made me see how much I like her. Just listening to her giggle at everything, make fun of me. Just stupid things like the fact she feels comfortable getting comfortable and cooking at my house, and just likes to play flirt with me. Stupid things, like I have to keep wading my throw blanket because she cuddles up in it when she‚Äôs over and it smells of her.  I‚Äôve found myself picking up her lingo and facial expressions, it‚Äôs just infuriating. I smile at the thought and then get mad at myself.

What‚Äôs even hit me more is the fact that when I‚Äôve just been venting with her about how I‚Äôm going stir crazy working from home, and she said she‚Äôs some over and distract me. She does this all the time without any prompting. I try and do the same, just cause I like her as a person. I don‚Äôt feel slighted if I‚Äôm in the friend zone.  Most of the time I wish I didn‚Äôt have these feelings.

31,"Im a senior high school student that is enrolled in an online school, currently taking a total of 10 subjects in this sem. Those are the certain subjects that i wasnt able to take in my previous year due to the difference in track. Doing those 10 subjects made me realize that self-studying is harder than i imagined. Ive been given a number of lessons, activities and quizzes which im supposed to finish in a 3-4 month deadline.

The modules for each lesson was longer than i expected and had about 15 lessons per subject. I had a hard time reading and understanding it by myself. Whenever i ask Qs to my professors i had to wait for a few days to get an answer because theyre not available 24/7 and you cant bombard them questions about every single thing you dont understand. I guess you can say questions that you can ask are kinda limited.  Its not the same as the schools i used to attend where i can just ask about everything i dont get through chat when i get home.

Studying online, I often felt like i was running out of time and as a result i rush it and either get bad grades or cheat. I've been having a hard time sleeping lately because of this. 

When i checked the subjects that i am to take in the next sem its doubled from what i am taking now. This sem is already too overwhelming for me so i honestly cant imagine myself in the next sem.

I personally dont think im cut out for self-studying.

Ive been staying in the same room as my parents to lessen the anxiety but thinking that they are really nice and patient yet they have a kid that contemplates about stopping makes me feel guilt instead.

should i stop or continue and just think about my parents?

I know this problem is small and stupid for other people around my age but im extremely worried and scared. i just need an advice. please. thank you.",16Apr2020,2

35,"To give context, I am a junior and I attend a boarding school and rarely see my parents. My plan was to do well in school, get accepted into a good college, and hopefully never have to see my parents again. However, during this quarintine, all students had to return to their homes, and school is going to be closed for the rest of the year....

My mom and I don't have a good relationship. Somedays, me and my mom don't speak a single word to each other even though we live in the same house. When we do speak, it is mainly criticism or an order. Every single mistake of mine causes her to lose it. Even when I do good, such as when I made a 35 on the ACT, she only offered criticism and belittled me, This makes me suspect that she doesn't really, unconditionally love me , and this is worrying me. Not because I care if she loves me (our hatred is mutual, although I keep my hatred quiet), but because I have to rely on her so that I can have a good future. For example, I need her so that I can attend my boarding school. I need her so that I can take the SAT. I basically need her so that I can have a good future. If she simply decided to stop supporting me, then I would lose everything and I would probably kill myself ( which she would probably regard as a victory ). 

To get back on topic, this quarantine creates a problem; we have to actually live together, and her opinion of me is only going to go down quickly. Before, I was at a boarding school and we did not interact much, thus she wasn't able to see my faults. Now that we live together, everything I do is visible to her.  As stated before, I feel she doesn't genuinely love me; instead, I think she only pretends to love me because she feels it is her obligation as a mother. However, it feels that the lower her opinion of me goes, the less she feels obligated to love me and support me. The signs of this are already evident. Recently, she threatened to send me back to live with my dad.  This worries me extremely; it's not that I hate my father, but I won't be able to attend the boarding school if I live with him ( this boarding school is an absolute necessity for me ).  Another time she threatened to not pay for my SAT, but I was able to convince her otherwise. Still, I feel the longer we stay together, the more she will despise me and the more likely it is my future is ruined. I am confused as to what to do about this. In approximately a year I will be out of highschool; I would hate for my future to be ruined while I am only a year away from freedom. How do I convince her to support me for just one, last year?",16Apr2020,1
36,"I apologize in advance this is long, but I wanted to give enough context. 

Edit: apologize for formatting I am on mobile!!

I am stuck with my parents because of COVID-19. I had to move from my off campus apartment to be with them because they are overprotective and don't think I can handle it on my own. 

I don't like my parents at all, everytime my mom talks it's in a condescending tone. My dad babies me too much and thinks I can't do anything right. 

Along with this I have depression, anxiety, and PTSD. (Which my parents refuse to acknowledge even though I got diagnosed. I can't afford therapy or medication on my own without their insurance) 

It's been very rough for me being stuck with them at home all day on top of my school and work responsibilities, I got so upset last night that I wanted to punch out my window to my second story bedroom and get out. 

Then today this situation happens: (in January I got my bangs and my parents hate it and tell me how ugly it looks everytime they see me) 

Me: goes down to walk my dog
My Dad: ""get your bangs out of your face. Don't go out like that.""
Me: ignores 
Dad: *physically puts his hands on my face and pushes my bangs upwards* 
Me: ""Dad?!?!?!""
Dad: ""why are you talking like I did something to you, what's wrong with you?!?!"" 

I can't take it here anymore, do you have any tips on how to manage my emotions so I don't act drastically? I just can't wait until I can go out again.

Today, my mom, brother, grandma and myself were in the living room talking about our family and traits that get passed down. My grandma then starts talking about my brother and said, ""Yes, we have a smart one in (brother's name)"" Without thinking I asked her if she thought I was smart. She just shrugged and said ""I guess so"" and then went back to boasting about my brother's intelligence

I have struggled with my intelligence my entire life. I was diagnosed with a learning disability later in life, so I struggled in some classes without support for at least half of my school years. Whenever I mess up on something, even today, my brain keeps telling me how I'm not good enough, not smart enough, that'll I'm not as good as my brother and that people love me less because of it. 

I've gotten into college and i do my best, I get good grades. It just feels like no matter what I do I'll never be smart enough or good enough for anyone, let alone myself. I thought I was doing fine, and I had self confidence, but my grandma saying that to me kinda broke me down. Maybe I just have to accept that I'm an idiot and I'll never be anything else.

43,"Okay so, my last relationship went absolutely terrible, and when I say that, I mean that I was lied to and was given a false sense of security. She was my first ever girlfriend and I was scared of most things intimate. She went through multiple stages of not even remotely liking me, and having a crush on my best mate. Keep in mind, me and her went to different schools, so there was always this fear in the back of my mind. 
But, after a decent while of dating she had broke up with me. Not too long after she had a sleepover, and my best friend went to that sleepover. The next day or so, my other mate had told me that they hooked up. They were snogging all night and he held her tits and ass blah blah blah. From then on I haven‚Äôt spoken to her and I don‚Äôt want to. But I found out that she found me boring and for most of our relationship fancied my best mate.
I was absolutely blown away and didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I felt lied to. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt a good enough person. As if I deserved it almost. 
But anyway, fast forward to now.
The most popular girl in my school has a crush on me, and I really like her back. But I‚Äôm scared that things will turn out the same way. We aren‚Äôt dating but she‚Äôs said she likes me and I‚Äôve said it back. 
Although recently she‚Äôs been more blunt with me, hasn‚Äôt called me, ignores my messages, all of it. 
What do I do? I always feel like I‚Äôm the one putting in all the effort, and behind my back or something she‚Äôs texting another boy and is just lying to me. I‚Äôve already told her how I feel about her, but the most she‚Äôs said to me is ‚Äúofc I like you too dumby‚Äù

45," 

My girlfriend\[22F\] and I\[22M\] live in a major capital city. She is living in my house and has been for just over a month. She has no income, and I pay for all her food, toiletries, etc., out of my own money. I don't really mind this as I have always paid for everything in the year and a half we have been together. She also does not pay rent or anything, she has no expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She describes herself as a workaholic although through no fault of her own, she lost her job a few months ago. She wanted to get a job in Tesco's (major supermarket in England) and a couple of weeks ago got a call back from the hiring manager, and due to the coronavirus situation was practically guaranteed to get the job. She was very excited at the prospect of working.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I told her that as she's living at my house, and has no expenses whatsoever to pay as I pay for everything, I would not be happy for her to accept this job, the reason being that it is an exceptionally high risk position, and I don't want to risk being infected with the virus. I don't want to risk getting permanent lung damage, I don't want to risk dying, and I don't want to risk passing it onto my dad who had cancer a year ago and invariably ends up seeing me every couple of weeks, just to pass letters through his letterbox which he needs but get delivered to my house. My argument is that her desire for a job does not outweigh my or my family's need to stay healthy, and seeing as she has no expenses whatsoever, she should respect that. I said to her if she wants to work at Tesco's, I can help her find a room to rent nearby, and she can live there and work whilst isolating away from me until this is all over. Otherwise, it is not fair to risk my health simply so her desire to go out and work can be fulfilled.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A point to add is that I went through a tremendous effort to ensure that we could self isolate safely. I spent a huge amount of my money (I'm not flush with cash and don't have an income either at the moment) on stocking up on food (2 weeks worth, not panic buying months worth or anything) so that we could leave the house as little as possible and therefore maximize our chances of staying healthy. It also felt to me as if she was ungrateful for this effort, as she wanted to sacrifice it all so she could fulfill her desire to go outside.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She cites part of the reason that she wants the job is so she can help me with money as I pay for everything, but I said to her that I don't want money, I want to be healthy, so that doesn't matter to me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She cried a lot, said it wasn't fair for her to be locked in as she's getting depressed, she said that people have to work, amongst other things. I said to her that we are all having to lockdown, we are all getting depressed, and many people cannot work. This isn't a job she already had, it's a job she wanted to get only once the viral pandemic broke out. She is acting like I am being controlling and just saying she can't live with me whilst working in order to be difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR my girlfriend lives in my house and has no expenses as I pay for everything. She wants to get a job in a food shop because she is bored/depressed/feeling unproductive, and I said I don't want her to so I and my family don't get ill. She says I am being horrible because of this. I feel she's not thinking of my and my dad's health and is prioritising her own desire to have a job.",16Apr2020,0

His boss just sent a work wide email with a link to Swiss propaganda research‚Äôs information on Covid 19 which seems to really minimize its severity. This appears to be an attempt to get employees to shut up and no longer question their choice to have people return to work. Is SWP a viable and accurate news source?

49,"My best friend of many years came to me and told me he is experiencing increasingly hard to deal with delusions. 

My friend is in his 20s, he has a brilliant mind and a lust for any and all knowledge. He keeps an open mind and prides himself for his ability to see different points of views and as such, entertains all freely as objectively as he believes he can.

He is HEAVILY into AI, quantum computing, surveillance topics, etc 
I have watched him grow increasingly more emotional and paranoid at times about these topics over 6 years. He does hide it well. He recognizes it as a paranoid-schizoaffective type personality. 

I've seen it culminating to this and today he was lucid enough to ask for help and grounding.
I could read it in his face immediately it was escaping him. He flat out told me he can't distinguish between some delusional thoughts and reality and it's crippling him.

Everyone's phone is recording at all times. They are listening.
Satellites with insane resolution are creating mathematical markers about your traits and can track you.
Anyone could be listening to your conversation, he avoids any topics that would raise concern.
He avoids doing ANYTHING that could be potentially questionable or seem ""weird"" where anyone could see.
The inevitable singularity of AI and it's destruction of humanity 
He said he couldn't even drive sometimes becayse he was scared of being followed.

I told him he needs help STAT. He was receptive.. But he won't go to the hospital for evaluation. Also the situation in the US doesn't help. 

What can I do? I'm afraid that this is the ugly horns of severe mental illness?

If this is any help:
He grew up around a VERY abusive drunk with very similar delusions of surveillance and people. He was often the victim of them.
Also, I noticed this has coincided with him completely falling head over heals for someone for the first time in his life. Has this dramatic change added fuel? 

How could I, a man with no remarkable mental health issues get him help? Ground him during his delusions? Approach things better?
Any advice or insight is welcome.",16Apr2020,1
50,"I hav a 2004 dodge dakotan. This first happened a year ago. I was driving along when my rpm dropped, and my truck shakes. The check engine light came on.

53,"Hi all, 

I (20 F) feel like shit. My ex and me dated the entire length of high school until shit hit the fan and we broke up before I left for college (he‚Äôs a year younger).  I was *that annoying ex* for a while and constantly nagged him after we broke up. It was shitty, I know. I‚Äôve since moved on completely and him and I have maintained a decent friendship. We smoke together occasionally, we have a snap streak, we text sometimes, but over the last year it‚Äôs become much less frequent. 

We still have a snap streak but other than that - there‚Äôs no contact. we can‚Äôt hold a conversation. we have nothing to say to each other. i forgot how to talk to him. if anything, i initiate more conversation than he does. not that i text him very often, but when i do he ignores me now. 

only a year or so ago he was telling me he still felt connected to me. he was telling me he felt so comfortable talking to me and only me. 

i should mention that i have a boyfriend who i love very very very much. we are perfect together. i love him. however, i can‚Äôt help but feel some sort of way now that me and my ex, a guy who has been such a big part of my life since I was 14, just don‚Äôt click anymore. i feel so guilty for getting sad about my ex considering i have a boyfriend but I just can‚Äôt help it. 

I‚Äôm tired of feeling guilty for being sad that my ex, whose been one of my closest friends for the last couple years (not sure if that‚Äôs mutual), ignores me and that our friendship has dissolved. 

I‚Äôm also frustrated with my ex for just ignoring me and flip flopping how he feels about our friendship. I get he might be trying to move on from me still maybe and maybe that‚Äôs what is causing this - i completely respect that - but i just want to know. It‚Äôs a shitty game i feel like i‚Äôm playing with him. 

I want to know why we don‚Äôt talk like we used to. i want to know why he barely puts effort into our friendship. we‚Äôve been split up for almost 3 years now but up until last year we‚Äôve had a really great, platonic friendship. 
 
is it wrong to straight up ask him if he doesn‚Äôt feel like talking anymore? should i tell him it‚Äôs cool if he out grew our friendship? i just can‚Äôt deal with this 400 day streak we have on snap when the man can‚Äôt even answer my ‚Äúhey you‚Äôve you been‚Äù texts anymore. I would rather just not talk to him at all anymore. 

TLDR: my ex and me maintained a great platonic relationship for years after we split. over the last year, he‚Äôs cut my out of his life and barely answers me anymore. Am i wrong to be upset about this? is it wrong to text him for clarity?

EDIT: my relationship and feelings towards my ex, like i said, is completely platonic. people can break up and remain friends

I wouldn‚Äôt ever facilitate a relationship/friendship with another man (or woman, or anyone) that would undermine the boundaries of my boyfriends and I‚Äôs relationship or dynamic. Likewise, I have never and would never facilitate a conversation that, if my boyfriend read, would make him feel deceived or lied to.

My boyfriend also went to school with my ex and I and we were all friends at a point. my current boyfriend knows i keep in touch with my ex. he could read through our convos if he wanted. i am honest with my boyfriend and have nothing to hide. I‚Äôve even talked to my boyfriend about this problem. my boyfriend and i trust each other and are very secure in our relationship.

We're quarantined like everyone else, but every week or so I catch my mom, fully dressed and with her make up on, obviously going out. ""I'm just going to the park"", she'd say when I'd ask.

I look at her phone's home screen occasionally and see texts from an unsaved number, basically saying ""how are you baby"" in Vietnamese.

I'm torn apart and I'm too afraid to say anything to confront her/tell my dad. We're already in a pretty bad place. My dad has a million other things to worry about, like paying rent.

I have a medical mask and a makeshift cotton mask over, I just don‚Äôt see the point of working here, the little that I do, when I have no idea whether other employees have been tested and if they‚Äôre not going to be careful.



I had already asked this group of employees ‚Äúwhy do you guys keep taking your masks off‚Äù I was met with an attitude ‚Äú because it‚Äôs hot as fuck‚Äù


I came to work and my comfort is not as important as avoiding this virus. My brother is a a manager here so I might still be at risk.

61,"I met a guy online when I was 16, and he became my first boyfriend. We were in a relationship for about a year when he came to see me (I was 17 by that time). My mom, knowing she could trust me, allowed him to stay at our house as long as he slept on the couch (which he did, and no- we did not have sex). He was a wonderful guy! Thing is, while we were together, we were both pretty nervous and he's just a more quiet person in general (or was, he might be different now). 

Anyway, shortly after he went home, I broke up with him. I don't know if it was the distance, or my own insecurities, but I broke up with him. 

I'm 33 now, so it's been 16 years, but I still think of him and miss him. I found his profile on FB and I guess I'm just debating as to whether or not it would be super weird for me to contact him after all of this time? I'd truly just like to see how he's doing as a friend. The worst he can do is not respond, right?

I'm taking mostly science courses but I've also developed a love for classics (Latin) and could see myself going down a language path too. I don't know how to prepare myself though, because at this point I feel like if I take more language courses than science, I'm starting to go down a whole different path. I guess it's just scary for me because my whole life I've been so science-oriented and to now suddenly switch gears to language or classics classes is terrifying.

70,"ever since i was 9 i have hated seeing my dad. my parents have been divorced since i was 3 and since then (mostly) every other weekend i would have to spend time with him. when i was 5 he got remarried and my half brother was born. my brother was diagnosed with autism at a very young age and my step mother decided that for a year my dad shouldnt visit me and should focus solely on my brother. that year i didnt see my dad but my uncle made it a point to still see me. 

as i started going to school, i started hanging out with my friends more and eventually i got a cell phone. on the weekends when my dad picked me up, it was an hour drive to his house for the weekend. this drive was always hell for me, he would talk about how much i would disappoint him all the time. he wanted me to call and spend more time with him even though it was never enjoyable for me. this would lead to me crying in the passenger seat and him just turning the radio up louder to fill the silence. basically my entire life was filled with him emotionally abusing me, every conversation with him ending in tears (further disappointing him because all i do is cry). 

now that ive gotten older, my dad has been constantly telling me ""when i pass away you have to take care of your brother since he cant take care of himself"". i feel like instead of letting my brother think he can constantly depend on me, he should help teach my brother how to support himself. 

recently i needed my dad to fill out his portion of a form for college. if i dont get this form done i wont be considered for financial aid. in my opinion this should be a very simple ""hey dad can you do this for me?"" and him saying ""sure no problem"" but of course it isnt. for some reason he keeps saying he doesnt want to do it. i called him and i explained its just for me to be considered for financial aid, that i wasnt going to ask him to take out a loan, that i was going to pay for college on my own. he goes silent for a bit and then i hear my step mom telling him what to say. his excuse is ""oh you wont get aid because i made too much money"" which is bs because i would at least have the chance of getting something. if he doesnt do it i for sure get nothing. something as trivial as this lead to a screaming match between us (which ended with me crying, my mom calling him names and him threatening to beat us up).

if my father wont do this small thing for me, i feel like he isnt going to help me with anything else in the future. even my stepfather (who ive known for the past four years) is willing to help, taking extra hours at work to save money for me, even though he has another biological daughter who is also starting college this year. my dad clearly cares about my step mom more than me and isnt willing to  support me. i know this is a lot and im not even sure if anyone will read this whole thing but i need help with this. the main reason im so torn is because i dont want to never see my brother again. i know that as long as my step mom is alive, she wont let me talk to him without her present. hes autistic and is only 15 so theres no way for me to talk to or hang out with him without his parents shutting it down first. i dont know what to do i hate my dad and i want so badly to just cut him out of my life but i know i will miss my brother. im not sure if its worth it.",16Apr2020,1
71,"I was an only child for 14 years. When my mom found out she was pregnant with me, my parents had already received student visas to immigrate to the US. Since they had me at such a young age by accident and still had to continue their studies, I grew up with my grandparents and extended family. As a result, my parents never gave me much attention (maybe a phone call or two a year) nor financial support, which caused me to believe that they didn't want me. When I was 8, my parents graduated and had me come and live with them in the US for the first time. 

I was happy and really scared: Scared that they were going to abandon me again if I did something wrong. Thus, I was a really obedient child. Whatever they told me to do, I did. 

Flash forward to when I'm 14. My parents, being more financially stable, planned to have a second child. My mom's pregnancy was successful and everything looked healthy. However, I wasn't aware of any of this. My parents did not tell me or ask me anything. In fact, I found out from my family's friend's children who had overheard my mom telling her friends about her pregnancy. That moment verified the fear I had my whole life: I wasn't a part of the family. My mom finally told me months later, but at that point, it was already pretty obvious that she was pregnant. 

Since that moment, I saw my sister as ""my parents' other child"" and not my sister. My parents give her a lot of attention and spoil her with things now that they have more money and free time on their hands. In fact, because she's more high maintenance, they devout all their time to playing with her and helping her learn. On the other hand, I'm almost done with college. My parents rarely call me, and when I'm home, they are always with her. When they do talk to me, my sister would approach us and ask for my mom to help her with something or ask for them to talk to her because she is bored. I've tried talking to my parents about this, and asked them to spend more time with me. However, they don't see an issue with this. After all, at the age of 22, I can do independent activities, but my sister, being only 8, cannot. In fact, they don't want my sister to feel the same way I feel, so they are giving her a lot of attention at a young age. They also claim that I should be grateful because they have ""given me everything I asked for to the best of their abilities"". For this reason, I can't hate on my parents either because after all, they were trying their best given the circumstances. All this combined with my sister saying ""well MY mom is..."" instead of ""OUR mom"" or ""mom"" in general makes me really angry because it stills feels like I'm not a part of the family.

I don't ever take my anger out on my sister nor my parents. Maybe I'm just angry that I'm still bitter about this whole situation after 8 years.... Maybe I'm just angry at myself for being jealous that my younger sister is getting more attention than I am. Maybe I am disappointed at myself for wishing my sister could experience the same levels of uncertainty that I had experienced growing up. I don't really know who to talk to. My parents don't really get it and my sister is too young to comprehend. The biggest problem right now is that all this anger and jealousy is turning into coldness and distance between me and my sister. I don't hate her (after all, she didn't do anything wrong). But I can't say I love her either. I just... don't really care for her. But I WANT to. The issue is, even if i get enough attention now, I still can't say for certain I will love her. I just... don't know how to be a sibling, and I don't know how to start. Nobody else thinks this is an issue and everyone thinks I'm crazy for ""trying to fix something that isn't broken"". Should I just tell my parents I don't love her? idk what to do... :/",16Apr2020,1
72,"I work for an eye doctor in a town of 14,000 and we just got a confirmed case of 400 cases of the coronavirus. He wants to open his business back up on May the 1st to patients for appointments and walk-ins, as I'm his only employee, he naturally assumes I'll be there as well. Even though he has one employee, he has a TON of patients, some with lung disease, are immunocompromised, or bad hearts, etc. He only has one box of mask, one box of gloves, limited cleaning supplies (two bottles of lysol wipes). I was just about to be tested for asthma before this kicked off but they changed my appointment but I still met with a nurse practitioner who gave me medicine for asthma/allergies that I take twice a day, daily and I only have one semester until I finish school.

On one hand, I barely break $100 dollars a week working for him currently because I finish all of my work fast due to there being no business. Plus hes my boss, so if he says I come in then I have to, right?

On the other hand, I work face to face with patients and could get really sick if I get corona and I know he wouldn't pay for my sick leave. Also, I feel shitty telling these patients that are at risk that its safe to come in, risking their health and life as well.


My therapist mentioned that I should call the CDC on him, as they don't want him opening, but I don't think they can do anything.


Honestly I don't have anyone to talk with. I'll offer to check in/be a pen pal (if interested) if they can give me some advice. I'm kind of scared.

75,"Hi everyone.

This is the first time that I (26,F) am writing and penning down about one of the main reasons I've been depressed for a long time.

Throughout the 26 years of my life, I've met many many people, had many friends and acquaintances along the way and experienced many things with many different people. Hence I would not say that I have a problem with making friends or that I am friendless. However, there is just one problem. Or maybe 2. A disclaimer that this lost is going to be really long so please be prepared if you'd like to read on. Thanks in advance for hearing my story. 

1. All my friendships seems momentary (basically, come and go) and end because of issues 1 after anothetrthat are not entirely my fault and I feel like I'm cursed. 

2. I don't have a main group of friends right now in my life. 

Let me explain both points. Point number one, all my friendships seem momentary. First off, when I was around 17 to 24 years old, that's the period where I was still in school and I made a huge number of friends. I had multiple groups of friends. Some I even travelled with overseas with to have fun, or for graduation trip. I had 2 graduation trips with 2 different groups of people. I joined many ccas and camps and I knew lots of people. A few things happened. I was in bowling, and I was very close to my team mates. They were like family. We saw each other daily, spent so much time together. I thought that was the closest friendship group I could ever have. However, things changed. I got together in a relationship with one of the guys from my team and after we broke up, I sort of drifted away from the group because of some misunderstanding with my coach that I wasn't attending trainings as frequently or some sort, and one of the girls also broke up with someone else in the team. Being young and immature, she told me to accompany her to avoid trainings for a while to heal our hearts as we just broke up. I agreed to it and then because of that, we didn't see our team mates much anymore. However, she betrayed me and went back for trainings without telling me. I only found out later on when things were too late. Disappointing thing was, despite this, my team mates never quite contacted me to ask how I'm doing or anything. I thought our friendship was a separate issue from me being a member of the team. Turns out it was only for the moment and for the purpose that I was a teammate. I was devastated when I saw that they were all at graduation and I wasn't invited and slowly but surely, this group of friends that felt like family just disappeared from my life. Years later, I happened to bump into one of the teammates and we went overseas with her boyfriend. She explained to me that things weren't my fault and why things happened this way was that, that girl who asked me to avoid trainings was actually jealous of me back then because everything I did was better than her and she just didn't want to see me in a good place. Hence she did what she did to sabotage me. I was heartbroken and disgusted because I used to be close to her. However it has been 4 years since the incident already so I deceided to let it slide. To me, if they wanted to maintain the friendship with me, they would have reached out. I accepted it and moved on. 

2nd hit for me was that I used to have a very close guy friend. We hung out alot with one of my ex boyfriends who's a mutual friends. We used to drink together, and talk alot about life together. However when this friend got his girlfriend, his girlfriend was extremely possessive and she banned him from contacting me entirely. I found out one day that he unfollowed  me on all social media platforms and didn't contact me anymore. I then reached out to him crying asking what's wrong and he admitted to me that his crazy girlfriend made him do it, or else she would leave him. I told my ex boyfriend about it and he was pissed but he couldn't do anything either. From then til now, he got married, but she committed suicide last year and I attended her funeral even tho I was so mad at her for ruining my closest friendship. He was like my best friend. Til this day my ex boyfriend still hang out with him but I guess because of the time distance, they don't ask me out anymore. I saw him at her funeral and he thanked me for coming down however even though his wife is dead now, he still doesn't seem comfortable with mending the friendship anymore. So there. I lost another close friend. 

3rd thing, I have another close friend however he went over to Australia to study and stay there for good. Hence, long story short, I kind of lost him too. We are no longer close like before and he already made new and close friends in Australia. 

4th thing, the rest of the friends I used to be close to have alresdy moved on because they went to a local university while I moved on to a private university and in local universities, they have much more opportunities for making new friends and crafting new memories. For me, all my friendships in the private university were more of just activity based friendships. I joined a few clubs and competed in a few competitions, did group work with some people etc. But all these time spent with these people were only for the actitivites. We were alright close, but I didn't manage to forge deep friendships as everyone was alresdy about 25 during this period and everyone had no need for forging new deep friendships. My old friends have all moved on to new friends in university, and we all drifted apart given no new common experiences shared. 

So I guess that sums up my part 1.

Part 2. I don't have a main group of friends. What this means is, I realise that most people my age have at least 1 main circle of friends they turn to for most things. Be it to hang out, or to rely on. I do not have even 1 main group of friends for that. Maybe they used to be my bowling team mates but ever since then, I haven't been able to have 1 solid group of main friends. I do know alot of people, but not on a deep level, or either that they all have moved on to new stages of life and friendships. I also attribute this to the fact that over my years, Ive had a few relationships, maybe they add up to 4 years worth in total. Throughout those years, maybe I never felt this as a huge problem because I was attached to a partner and I relied heavily on my partners to feel like they were providing me what a main group of friend would provide. The reliance and someone to constantly hang out with. I am now single for the longest time and hence, it all comes to light more clearly, that I do not have a main group of friends to turn to. Just to add, I have been making efforts to sustain friendships and I am always kind and helpful to people. They do not dislike me. It is just that circumstances have it that people have their own main group of friends already and hence, I'll always just be an extra friend they have no reason or motivation to force deeper connections with or to consider a part of their main group of friends. 

Basically, I feel very alone. I feel like I am too old to have a main group of friends. I do not have any contact with friends from my childhood anymore either. I feel so pathetic and depressed to know that if one day I get married, I'll not have any close friends to be my bridesmaids. I feel unlucky that alot of things happened out of my control, friendship wise. 

Can anyone here advise me on how to deal with this and also is it possible to still make a main group of friends or clique at my age? Thanks in advance.

77,"My boyfriend was a recovering alcoholic when we met. I was fine with it, as I drink rarely. We've been together for over a year and during this time, I had an occasional drink. I always asked if he was cool with it and he said he was. My other thought is that I am not in charge of his sobriety anyways, that's his responsibility. Regardless, I always asked.

With the ongoing events going on and his personal feelings towards his life, it's made for an unhealthy situation for him. He's ""bored"" now that a lot of things are closed and he can't do what he's used to doing. He's turning to drink when he's upset or bored now.

Just today I got ingredients to make him his favorite dinner, to help him feel better. I won't lie, I also said was going to drink margaritas tonight too (just me). Coincidently, he was at a liquor store buying bourbon. I had a bad feeling.

3 or so hours go by... 

As I am on my way to his house, I get a text saying he is now too sleepy and is ""being a dick"" and to come back tomorrow. I am pissed off and told him so. I said I didn't think he would get drunk so quickly and I'm upset. He calls me to tell me I can still come over (I guess he changed his mind?). I verbally repeat what I messaged him, the reply was ""that just how I am."" I do agree to come over, as I have to put away the groceries I had bought for his dinner. 

I get there and he's brain dead, watching a movie. Doesn't say anything to me, nor I to him. I put the stuff away and see the bottle. It's 750mls and 50% alcohol. It is now almost half gone. 

Which brings me to now. I wanted to spend time with him tonight, but now it's like, what's the point? He's passed out drunk. I feel like I should just go home :(

79,"Hey Reddit,

I hope everyone is safe during this time. I'm feeling very anxious, worried and upset. I have a family of 5 within my household, and I am the middle child with a little brother. With the quarantine going on, I have two essential workers within my family, both my mom and my older brother are nurses. Recently, their hospital had a couple of cases of COVID-19 and it's pretty much an outbreak. 

What is frustrating, is how both aren't taking it as seriously as possible, and are simply joking about it. They would playfully cough or jokingly say how they have COVID-19. What is also frustrating is, my dad and I are concerned because we are wondering ""Should they be home?"". It's making the rest of us uncomfortable, and we do not want to kick them out or separate of course! We love them, but it still worries us if they truly are exposed. They joke about it a lot, to the point where I have been avoiding them and sanitizing the house when they arrive, and when they leave for their shifts. My brother's clothes from the hospital, he throws them in his room, and throws his shoes there as well, and say's it's fine because he sprays sanitizer on it. 

Another conflict is, I have a long-term girlfriend, who both my family and hers are close, and established that we can exclusively see each other. Since quarantine, we have had no contact with friends, except each other. She comes over almost every day. Yesterday, my mom and brother were RECENTLY assigned to the floor with COVID-19, and now I have to put a halt to my girlfriend visiting for her safety. What do guys think? 

I'm worried and anxious. I don't want to feel as if I'm overreacting. I don't know how to explain this to my GF, as well as express my concern to my mom and brother. How can I approach this situation without being aggressive?",16Apr2020,1

When I saw the post, I was so shocked and hurt because it looked so similar or at least had a very similar vibe but obviously theirs was so much better.

My sister said it looked similar but it might not be copied so I just forced myself to forget about it until last year, I was browsing through Instagram and I saw that the artist had reposted it and again, I was too chicken to say anything.

He has had a few initial talks with therapists but never followed up. He's been prescribed antidepressants and antipsychotics but doesn't keep up with taking them. For the past year we have lived together and he has convinced himself that alcohol or weed was the only way to relax. I know that it's a coping mechanism and his way to try to escape his depression and problems, but he tells me that his drinking and drug use isn't a problem and that I'm projecting onto him because I have a parent who has substantial alcohol abuse issues. Now that my boyfriend is 21 he's smoking weed everyday. When I come home from work he's already high. I'm not someone who hates weed, but I'm uncomfortable about spending time with him when he's high all of the time. He says that it's the only thing that makes him feel better and that I shouldn't have a problem with it. He says it's better than taking the antidepressants that he's been prescribed and that I need to have a more open mind. I'm feeling less and less attracted to him and don't want this to be a reason to leave him. I feel like he needs to get real help and that this is just a bandaid to cover up the problems. Is there anyone who has gone through depression and felt the way he's feeling who can help me understand? At this point I'm not interested in being around him and just do things on my own because it makes me upset to be around him when he's high.

84,I keep getting called into work even though there is a state mandated stay-at-home order due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

86,"Hi Reddit, I‚Äôm a 17 year old female so please be kind I‚Äôve never gone through something like this and I‚Äôm just very emotional and sensitive right now. I was recently sexually assaulted 2 months ago I‚Äôm currently going through the process of getting justice but i‚Äôm having a very hard time coping with my feelings. It‚Äôs already a very hard subject for me I get very emotional talking about it. 

My problem is I have a very hard time watching crime shows and my mom loves them. I used to love them too but after all of this it‚Äôs really hard for me to watch because a lot of the victims are women who were raped or murdered by people they trusted. I cannot watch these anymore or even hear it. I know I might sound dramatic but I get very anxious. I tried telling my parents, It took several times until I just broke down in front of them after asking my mom to change it again. 

On the other hand, I‚Äôm just tired of the sexual assault jokes. My dad has posted a joke about Joe Biden assaulting women and of course that‚Äôs the first thing I see when I open social media, I told him just stop it‚Äôs not funny. If you‚Äôre going to post things like that then just block me from seeing it. He got mad because he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not like I posted it to offend you‚Äù. Well, I believe you shouldn‚Äôt post things like that on social media because you don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre going to offend making jokes like that. 

I‚Äôm sorry but it just pisses me off. I‚Äôm tired of feeling like i‚Äôm being dramatic, If I am then please let me know how I can cope with this. I‚Äôm currently feeling very anxious so please be kind. 
Also I want to add, I don‚Äôt know anything about Joe Biden so please don‚Äôt come for me I don‚Äôt know anything about him.",16Apr2020,0
88,"I am 18yo girl from Brazil that has mostly worked as an English teacher. I have never completed any formal education after high school, however, I do have some very interesting life experiences that I believe make me stand out. For example, I have studied filmmaking in LA, and lived a year abroad in the Netherlands. I think highlighting those things really show my adaptability and even my drive to pursue different skills and do creative work.


A potential employer - a tech company - wants me to hand in an English CV detailing experiences and projects. On my Portuguese CV, I highlight my experiences by pointing it out in my education section (since I did attend some level of schooling in the Netherlands), but I am not sure how to proceed with this. What projects to include (I was mostly involved in short film productions and tried my hand at private online teaching for a while), what education to include, etc.


What is the best way to showcase relevant experiences in my life that do not necessarily amount to professional experience?",16Apr2020,1
89,"This is my first time posting something on here (20f) and this will be a long post so sorry in advance!! And sorry about the format i‚Äôm on mobile. So my sister (22) has been dealing with depression and anxiety for a while, I don‚Äôt even remember if she was ever professionally diagnosed or not but by the ways she‚Äôs acted for years now I don‚Äôt doubt that. 

She almost died when she was 18 and was in the hospital for months and after that she became a very different person. I‚Äôm sure a lot of factors went into that like her body completely changing and her skin being scarred and her losing her hair, and to top it off her boyfriend at the time eventually started to make fun of her for all that. He called her names and told her to kill herself and all these things and it was a very confusing time though because she kept latching onto him even after all that and him even insulting our family. It made me resent her a lot that she would call him in our backyard and be screaming and begging him to stop being mean to her and yell at him about talking to other girls or something like that. She wouldn‚Äôt listen to me or my mom she would like tune us out when we begged her to come inside so the whole neighborhood wouldn‚Äôt hear her screaming anymore and think something was wrong and call the cops. She would harm herself in front of us too whenever we tried to take her phone or gave her tough love. 

Once she started to hit me whenever I said something she didn‚Äôt want to hear when we argued about all that she did, I stopped trying to help her. She also would say horrible things to my mom that were personal attacks against her and that was the end for me because Im really protective of my mom because she is so sweet and would do absolutely anything for us and does not deserve any disrespect from my sister. My mom tried to be really understanding of my sister and her emotional well-being because of her mental state and how hard things were for her after her stay in the hospital and things were her ex boyfriend. She gave her a lot of slack with her not getting a job or even doing community college classes because for a couple years after the hospital she still had a lot of urgent care visits and was sick a lot. 

But now it‚Äôs like 4 years after she was in the hospital. My sister has still not gotten a job, she is barely taking classes at the cc. She has crashed our family car multiple times without paying anything back. My parents didn‚Äôt want to let her drive anymore but my sister would be guilting my mom and say that being in the house and not being able to drive to see friends makes her crazy and suicidal. We have tried to get her into therapy but it seems to be really hard and long wait lists for them to see her and the ones she had seen she doesn‚Äôt like. But my sister doesn‚Äôt even seem to put an effort to find one and instead just tells my mom how much she needs to see one. 

The issues that are present nowadays with my sister is her and her new boyfriend. The day she crashed our car last week she was fighting with her boyfriend. When she finally came home, she barely apologized to my mom and when my mom started to get mad at her my sister gets defensive and says ‚Äúthis is why I can never come to you when I mess up.‚Äù Which is manipulating as heck to me because my mom is understanding and will do everything to help us but my sister has messed up so many times without doing anything to fix it. And she isn‚Äôt even supposed to be driving out right now because we‚Äôre in quarantine!! 

Anyways she came home and that night she started fighting with her boyfriend and started doing all the same things that she used to with her ex like screaming and crying on the phone loudly and not caring about her family or our neighbors hearing her. It destroyed me that the same things that happened years ago are happening now again. We told her she shouldn‚Äôt be in a relationship because she went straight from her ex to her new boyfriend and she is in no state to be in a relationship because she has major insecurity and emotional issues and should just focus on herself. She didn‚Äôt listen. She was even still talking to her ex sometimes when she started dating this new guy. I won‚Äôt get in detail seems to be hyper sexual in the things that she does and says to other guys, even while dating someone. 

I just don‚Äôt even know what to think or do. Me and my sister barely talk anymore. I‚Äôve forgotten what it was like to have her be my very best friend in the world and it hurts. My mom is at a loss, she cries every time sometime happens and cries to me saying she doesn‚Äôt know what she did wrong with raising my sister. She knows my sister manipulates her with guilting her sometimes and she‚Äôs so mad at my sister for everything she puts us through but i know she‚Äôs scared to like kick her out or cut her off because of how unstable my sister can be. Any advice would be greatly appreciated but I know this is might be a confusing post and I might‚Äôve missed important info. Thanks for any help and for reading.",16Apr2020,1
90,"(This is quite long, but I really could use some advice)

For a short background, I met my (26f) husband (25m) when we were both 21 and his daughter was 3. He didn't have anything to do with her for most of her life and was actually in the process of court/ paternity testing. Her mother made his life a living hell and in the end of their relationship, when his daughter was 6 months old, told him she wasn't even his. He believed her because 1. She looked NOTHING like him as a baby. And 2. His whole family nailed this in his head because they also despised her mother and wanted him away from her (his daughter was born in 2012 when he was 17). She was only coming around at this point because after having another baby who's father didn't want to deal with her, his baby mom was wanting him back and was insisting on him taking a paternity test but had not previously encouraged or spoken to him at all.

So, we end up getting visitation with my stepdaughter, who lives 3 hours away, when she's 4 years old. Every other weekend. For 3 years, this arrangement failed and succeeded off and on depending on when her mother wanted to be friendly with me. She swerved between adoring the stepmother I was to her daughter, to resenting us for doing so well in life where she was not. She is currently on her 4th child by 4 different men, none of which stayed with her past learning she was pregnant/ immediately after the births. For what its worth, I did my very best to be as good a friend to her as I could.

I recognized early on that my husband had little to no interest in his daughter. To be fair, he had warned me of this; he admitted to me, before we went to court to establish the visitation, that he had no interest in her or in changing her life. He hadn't raised her, hadn't seen her as his for her entire life, and resented her mother too much. He was 100% willing to pay support and put her on our insurance, but beyond that, he wasn't interested. I understood......... but I decided I could love her enough for the both of us, and that a relationship with her bio dad was essential in her upbringing as her mother was going through men like laundry. 

It didn't work out like that, and it was she and I who developed the bond. Her mother recognized this too little too late, and decided to cease the visits in the guise of telling me that my stepdaughter ""hates me, hates her dad, and tells lies on us to avoid coming here"". She did indeed tell quite a lot of lies on us, but I was certain it was because she knew her mom didn't want her enjoying her visits with us. 

It is important to mention that my stepdaughter was extremely sexually explicit even at the tender age of 5.... this scared me, and when I addressed it with her mother, I was told ""she is just boy crazy like she was at that age"". I do not believe she is being exposed to predators, but I do believe her mother has been less than discreet in her sexual escapades with her children in the house. It really scares me for her. 

So here is where I need some advice: am I crazy for still stalking her Facebook to see pictures of my stepdaughter? She claims she doesn't want to speak to me, though stepdaughter never told me that herself. So talking to her is out of the question. Also, we could force the issue in court, but with us being 3 hours away its really not feasible. My husband is content to leave it as is and let his daughter grow up and come to him when she's ready. But my heart is broken. I miss her. I want to see her. I want to talk to her. I want to figure out what went wrong. But none of this will happen because her mother is insecure and does not want her only daughter comparing her mother to her stepmother, and finding her mom wanting.

Also full disclosure - I love my sister to bits, she‚Äôs always got my back and can always make me laugh. 

Anyways, my sister has a tendency to come into my room, watching TikToks - not necessarily showing them to me but just for my company I guess.

So, for some background, I am a 20yr old partially disabled vet. I enlisted because I wanted to help people and use the military to become a doctor. That didn‚Äôt quite work out for me as I have a partially paralysed leg and chronic pain. I also have to wear hearing aids (that‚Äôs partially military and partially my genetics I think). Despite my disabilities, I work my ass off as an EMT at an amusement park(pre pandemic), I pay taxes and am a pretty successful college student.

This pandemic has really only brought about the straw that broke the camels back I guess you could say. My parents have been hyping this stimulus check and I was really excited for it. I was going to put that money towards a laptop for college, one I could take to classes and to the library. But I just found out I was claimed as a dependent in 2019, so I won‚Äôt get anything.

I just bought a new car, I‚Äôll be driving over 600 miles a month for school and work, so no one trusted my ‚Äò08 130k mile car to get me reliably there and back. So I was talked into buying almost 4 years before I originally planned to. 

So now I can‚Äôt afford the laptop I needed for college, and my mom acts like I should have no reason to be upset. This same woman wants to download the app that connects to my hearing aids (I can control settings of my hearing aids through this app) so that she can TRACK MY LOCATION. These things have an awesome GPS that will track down to the address/nearest building. I told her about this just in case I ever go missing or something she can probably contact the company to find the hearing aids and hopefully me. 

She also wants to meet all of my friends, and if I ever show remote interest in a guy or bring up a guy she wants to meet him before we even go on a first date. She‚Äôs convinced I‚Äôm somehow going to find and try to date a murderer or kidnapper. 

But she refuses to really talk to me about who I am, not who she wants me to be. I don‚Äôt care for gender but my parents both desperately want me to be straight and have a nice husband, kids, and a picket fence. 

Sorry this is long, I just don‚Äôt know where to go or what to do from here, has anyone else had to have the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a little kid anymore‚Äù conversations with overprotective parents?

117,"Alright, lemme lay this out. I am bisexual, and my sister (26F) and her husband (36M) are extremely religious (Catholic) along with the rest of my family (excluding my brother and some cousins). And that‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt have a problem with that. 

But one day, my sister gave me a Catholic book about the ‚ÄúTheology of Body‚Äù or something, and it mentioned same-sex marriage in there. I think we all know how the Church feels about homosexuality, and plus I‚Äôm absolutely not religious at all, so I verbally announced my distaste with that part of the book (by the way, my sister knows I‚Äôm bi) and when did that, her husband put himself in the conversation and started saying very homophobic things as if he would change my mind.

Stuff like, ‚Äúbisexual people are only bi because they want more people to have sex with‚Äù, ‚Äúlove in a gay relationship doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù, ‚Äúa gay relationship is the same thing as bestiality‚Äù (I‚Äôm not kidding, he actually compared a gay relationship to BESTIALITY), that gay relationships are against the bible, that gay people aren‚Äôt born gay and stuff like that. Obviously, that made me angry and when I admitted to him I was bi impulsively in a fit of rage and frustration, he kept on saying how I didn‚Äôt know anything (since I‚Äôm still a minor). I ended up crying, but I left the conversation at that.

Now, a week or so after that event, they came over to our house for dinner, and after, I wanted to tell them about a school project I‚Äôve been working on. The project I did was on a gay man and I admit that the project wasn‚Äôt centred around him being gay, but I still brought it up in front of him anyway because I sort of wanted to provoke him and see what he would say so that I could get a chance to argue my feelings with him again. 

I told him that the dude was arrested and mistreated for being gay since it was illegal to be gay in England at the time. After I said that, he straight up went ‚Äúit should be illegal to be gay everywhere.‚Äù After he left, I went crying to my brother. He told me I should definitely talk to my sister about it because he thinks that what he said was extremely rude and hateful. 

I feel like he hides behind his religion when it comes to things like this. And it kept me up at night. So, I want to talk to my sister about it but I don‚Äôt want to stir up anything unnecessary (since this happened like weeks ago, but it still very much bugs me whenever he comes over) and I definitely don‚Äôt want to be the cause of a fight between them, because I know my sister really loves him.

119,"TL;DR I wanted to move away after graduation but there are advantages to staying here for a few years before grad school. One of those reasons is being close to my SO who has a year left of school, but there are other financial and career benefits to staying here. So why am I so nervous about staying? Why does it make me feel weak? 

I'm a college senior who goes to a big state school in a college town. I am in the process of looking for jobs, and although I know what I roughly want to do I am flexible on my job options since I am planning on going to grad school in a year or two. However, I want to chose a job that's out of state (or at least in the other big city in the state I live in). I originally wanted to go to an out-of-state school for college, but I went to the state school that is two hours away from my hometown because it was cheaper (a decision I don't regret, I wouldn't change my college experience if I could). But since I didn't move away for college and satisfy the itch I had to move, I really want to move away for my job. I honestly think my mental health could suffer a bit since I've been longing to move for the past four years and if I stay here (especially with my parents), it could crush me. I keep telling myself that two years isn't much in the grand scheme of things, but I've waited for so long and it makes me antsy.

Since I like to keep my options open, I've found some jobs both in my hometown and in my college town that I will apply to in addition to ones outside of my state. The ones in my college town genuinely sound good and I wouldn't mind working there a year or two while I save up for grad school. Plus, I believe there is a good chance we will have COVID wave part 2 in the upcoming fall/winter. My college town is fairly big but it is pretty well isolated from any major city in my state, has great hospitals, and I can be close to home if anything happens. Plus, it's cheap so it is a great place to save up money. It makes logical sense to stay here another year or two despite it really fucking with my mind and breaking my heart.

Another advantage to staying in my college town is because I started dating someone in December who is a year below me. We've known each other since August and although I was dating someone else at the time, I subconsciously knew that I was interested in my SO. I remember thinking to myself when I first met him, ""wow, past me would have been all over this guy."" When I broke up with my ex, I wanted to be single. I like being independent and I didn't want to take into consideration someone else's feelings or career when I decided where to move after graduation. Once I realized I liked him, I decided to take a chance and date him. It's been amazing...I would be okay with him being the last person I ever date. He feels the same, and was interested in me the moment he met me too. I know that I'm still in the honeymoon stage but I don't think this feeling is changing.

Ultimately I will go wherever I find the best job. At this point in my life, my career is my primary focus and I'm a very driven person who takes satisfaction from their academics/job. But...I've been weighing the idea of staying in my college town (or at least two hours away) so I could be close to my SO. Since we're currently in different towns during this pandemic, we've been doing long distance and it's rough. I could handle it if that's our only option, but being in the same town is much more appealing. Plus, now that it is getting closer to graduation I'm getting a little nervous to move alone to a new city. It would be nice to move with a friend or SO that would keep me company.

But having him be part of the reason I stay here makes me feel weak and clingy. It scares me a bit because if we do break-up, I will be heartbroken and I will feel like the reason I stayed in my college town is gone (which isn't entirely true). I could have traveled but instead I stayed in a town with no reward. It scares me. We aren't even living together, but it feels like a big commitment step. I didn't think I had commitment issues but both my SO and therapist pointed it out to me. And even after he graduates I might continue working another year, meaning he has one year to work as a teacher. I feel like it would be bad for his career if he worked here only one year before leaving, so I might stay here three years total. We want to move in together after he graduates.

Why am I scared? Why does this thought make me nervous? If I get one of the jobs I am working at then it won't even hurt my career, so why am I scared? Why am I scared of us breaking up even though it probably won't happen?",16Apr2020,2
120,"I made this account so I could get some advice without some of my friends knowing. Anyways, I took an exam where I did terrible and didn‚Äôt cheat until the last question. This was the first time I have ever cheated and I hate myself for it. I don‚Äôt like the principle nor the purpose, but in the moment of taking the exam I got so stressed. I have GAD and everything just piled up on me when I took that exam. My husband and I lost our jobs, family member sick and taken to hospice (now passed), can‚Äôt communicate with family member in nursing home, father was laid off, the idea of getting a divorce after Covid was over (still living together because we didn‚Äôt want the other to not have a place), etc. I just thought about how I had so much going wrong and I didn‚Äôt want another thing to go wrong. Cheated crept in the back of my mind and I pushed it away easily until I thought of all the other college kids who are getting away with. I see them make videos/tweets/posts about it and I had classmates that have gotten away with cheating in other classes. It infuriated me that I worked so hard in all my classes (20 credit hours), worked 15 hours a week, and practiced 6 hours a week up until online classes and now other students get to cheat and bring their grades back up so easily. So I looked up one problem because I was running out of time. 

After time ran out, I hated myself for it. I cried to myself because I want to know the material but I just didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not doing well with everything online. I‚Äôm not doing well with just PowerPoint slides and YouTube videos. I‚Äôve cried and stressed everyday after and my anxiety and depression has not been this bad in years. Suicide HAD been on my mind and I didn‚Äôt have any medication nor anyone to see. I just sat and waited for them to catch me. 

My professor emailed me several days later saying one problem‚Äôs answer looked a lot like an answer on a homework website and that she had reported me for cheating. I talked to one classmate that I am sure had cheated on the exam about it and he said to appeal it. That the similar looking answer means nothing and they have no more additional proof. 

I‚Äôm wanting advice on what I should do. Should I appeal it and show that they did not see me cheat and that a similar looking answer isn‚Äôt proof? Or should I admit to my mistake? If so, how? 

Please. Give me a lecture on why cheating is bad. I want to make sure I never do it again because it has stressed me out and does not solve the problem of others cheating. I do not believe in it for any reason and I‚Äôm ashamed. I don‚Äôt want that on my record. I just want a second chance.

122,"So I've posted before about my situation with my ex girlfriend of 31/2 years. In 19M and shes 19F. It's now a week later and I know more about the situation. So she told me that she feel anxious about being with me in the future. She's happy with not being in a relationship with me right now. She told me that she lost feelings for me. I've been pretty upset because she never came to me with out problems before ending it. Im not crying everyday it's just like every couple days I get down and I just don't feel like I wanna talk to anyone. She's still hiding stuff from me like she never gave me a definitive turning point or why she lost her feelings for me. She dosent hate me, she's told me she doesn't. She wants to be friends we've actually talked everyday since we broke up almost 2 weeks ago now. I called her last night and I vented my feelings for her for about my hour she wanted to hear and let me do it. I told her I still have feelings because she never gave me a chance to let her go. I even asked her like do you still have feelings for me or love me. She didn't say yes or no she just said idk. There's a part of me that thinks she still has feelings for me but it just lost in how to feel. She told me some stuff about why she lost feelings but in my opinion it's stuff she should of came to me with to talk about. I told her that we can grow from this and become stronger as a couple instead of just ended it because you don't wanna even try. In my opinion of this situation I feel I made me anxious like she said. I made her feel anxious about our future together in that thinking like a big picture. I never talked about being married and stuff but I feel she's making it about that and dosent want to think that. I don't want her to think that and I don't because we're too young. I've been writing a lot about her and my feelings but im not sure when the time is too share it because I don't wanna mess any chance up with her. But I also understand if I have to move on without her. Im just scared that she be with a guy that uses her for like sex or misstreats her bad. Becuse I want to think that I can be the best for her. I just miss her so much because I haven't seen her in person in over a month now. So im just confused on what to think.

127,"My brother, and I bought a mobile home over a years ago. There has been a slow leak in one of the bathrooms for over a year now. We would need to go to a town several hours away to get the supplies to fix it. Metal roofing. I dont know how to install metal roof, but my brother does. We would also need to borrow my dads trailer. My truck could probably tow what we need, but I'm afraid to be towing a heavy trailer around for 100s of miles. We would probably end up borrowing my dads truck, and my dad would probably be going with us to get the material, as we've never done it, and won't know what we are doing. I've told my brother several times since the leak started that we need to go and get the material. He usually just says ""I know, well do it soon"", and essentially just brushed my suggestion off. Sometimes he even gets mad, and tells me I worry too much. I eventually just stopped bringing it up, since its bothered him. I realized we weren't on the same page, so I moved out about a year ago. Since them my brothers friend moved in, and was paying us for a room. Heres the think the leak has caused mold. When I lived there, I would keep the mold away, but my brother hasnt since I've moved out. A couple months ago, another leak appeared in the other bathroom. I once again bugged my brother about it with the same results, so I got him to agree to buy my half, as I dont want to be responsible anymore, but we cant do that until things are back to normal. It's not exactly essential, so I dont want to go, out in public to have it done in paper. We agreed on a price, and a payment plan. We just need to put it on paper. Heres were I feel guilty. My brothers friend it renting a room, and the house has a substantial amount of mold in. He doesn't seem to care, but since I felt bad, i stopped accepting rent form him. My brother tried giving some to me, and I said no. I'm afraid to bring the leaks up again to my brother out of fear of him getting mad. Hes also taking ove rmy fathers business, and hes under a lot if stress as it is. Am I a bad peson for just standing by and doing nothing while I'm waiting for us to finally go and sign the papers so I can sell my half? Also, we'd be using my dads trailer and truck. My dad told me not to worry about convincing my brother to do the repairs, and just seek my half to him. Everytime I bring up ther repairs my dad gets mad now, and tells me to forget about, even though I know I still own my half, and should be legally, and morally worried about it.

130,"I‚Äôm not quite sure how to explain this... but as ive been laying here, on my bed, in my bedroom, I suddenly had this strange experience.

I‚Äôve been battling lately with feeling very misunderstood and realizing the perception of who I am to my friends is very different to who I thought I was. And I also am starting to think that no matter how we put ourselves across, it will always be perceived through the filter of someone‚Äôs different outlook on life. So we can never truly decide for ourselves who we are. Other people will always do that for us. We can only provide the best sides of ourselves for them to use in their image of us.

So as I lay here, I had an out of body experience. I saw all the things in my room as if they belonged to someone else. All the purchases Ive made... the drawings I‚Äôve done.... the items I‚Äôve chosen to hang on the walls .... even the clothes I wear... and I‚Äôve realized everything is just there. It lacks meaning. And it all lends towards a person I didn‚Äôt realize I was being. 

I feel very worthless, but not in a depressive way. I think that feeling often gets associated with negativity - maybe there‚Äôs a better word. I feel very... plain? Unspecial? Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôve done all I can in life and think it would be nice to close the chapter on this life (again not in a depressed way - I‚Äôm very very content).

My question is... how do you push past that kind of contentment with a plain life and start to find vigor? Excitement? Or a purpose? 

I know some need a form of medicine - I want to stress I do not. I am not suicidal or upset or anything like that. I‚Äôm just very ... I‚Äôm just existing? 

I used to be so insanely active and a workaholic in my teens. I‚Äôm 30 now. I feel like I overdid the working at a young age that I should be in retirement now Hahahahah I was the kind that has a 7am to 10pm day each day. I was in school, yes, but I also had many after school activities or jobs. Weekends and lunch breaks didnt exist. Not many friends either cause I was so busy. But my point is, back then it felt like I was living. I was doing things. Now I‚Äôm just very mundane. Still doing a lot but no real aspiration. There‚Äôs genuinely nothing upsetting or wrong with me. That‚Äôs why it doesn‚Äôt work when someone‚Äôs solution is ‚Äúwell you‚Äôre clearly upset if you have no motivation or drive‚Äù. I‚Äôm honestly so bland. Think I‚Äôm just stuck in the routine of having a routine. Does everyone have to have drive? I feel like it‚Äôs case by case.

Does anyone know or relate to this ‚Äúcontently existing‚Äù feeling? Is it something that can be broken? Should I be trying to break it? How can I break it? My only concern after my experience tonight is having an identity disorder or crisis if I‚Äôm starting to see my life not as mine - let‚Äôs hope not! Haha",16Apr2020,2

136,"Hi there

I've noticed that for months and even years now I've been starting to lie more and more. They're always little lies but for the last year they've been more.

Usually they're things I also tell myself: like, if I'm both tired and lazy before going somewhere, I say I don't feel great. But I might just be tired from thinking ""oh no i have a thing tonight"" and that exhausts me.

It's not that I don't like being with my friends. I do. But...

1. Sometimes all the time before the event feels heavy. I feel like I'm gonna hate, because I'll be anxious or tired or not ready or something.

2. Sometimes... those things really do happen. I'm anxious and tempted to look at my phone and just go home. Other times (maybe most times) it doesn't for the most chunk of it. (one time in a birthday party the music was so loud it was hurting my ears and I wanted to cry but I didn't have a ride to go home so I would go outside take some air alone feeling terrible, sad and angry and anxious like an anti-social... but I couldn't be inside... here another lie: I pretended I was sad and didn't want to talk but I was okay and would go back inside soon, so that they all could keep dancing and singing.

Some things are hard most of the time, others are hard a bit of the time, but most of all, it's the time before that makes me dread it. And an heavy feeling of responsibility. I want to be invited for stuff, but I also hate feeling tired and thinking ""oh no tomorrow's [thing], I can't be home relaxing in my pajamas.""

I've been having the temptation to lie more and more though. I don't wanna go somewhere, I don't feel great/I have to work for school (which is true). I still go to the things most of the time but I'm always waiting for a good excuse/reason.

Now with the pandemic going on I was asked to join some videocalls of various things (friends or volunteer things) and I've been avoiding my phone at all costs so I almost missed that message for the next thing. But I did see it... and it's for the thing I was most glad of avoiding with the pandemic.

I am thinking of pretending I didn't see that message (darn, I wish that was true...) I thought the pandemic would let me put my life on hold at least on that specific thing. (I do have to do my studies too, those can't be on hold, but I was struggling with it before and am struggling even more now.)

I would like to run away from everything and not worry anymore.

I would like to not attend these meetings. I'm not sure how much that'll make me happier. Just I thought maybe I could drop that burden. And now apparently I can't since there's gonna be an online meeting.

I feel a lot of responsibility and fear of missing out too so I'm afraid of confronting it, being honest and doing decisions if needed.

Anyway in all these cases it's easier to do little white lies. Is it bad? How do I stop it? What do I do? I'm tired and I'm afraid.

138,"Hi I am an 18 year old female, I am using a burner account cuz a couple of my friends know my username. A few months ago in mid December I broke up with my boyfriend who I spent a lot of time with. And when I wasnt with him, I was trying helping out my homeless heroin addicted brothers; now I am not with that guy, one of my brothers got a gf and still has trouble with relapsing but hes busy with life and I dont see him very often, and my other went to california for rehab and decided to live there. Therefore I have started hanging out with my friends again. Which I did with ease. But now i guess I want to segregate away from them lmao. I think I am in the early stages of developing schizoid personality disorder. I just find myself faking reactions around people and I am very apathetic in general. I feel close to no one. And with context about my last relationship aligns very well with defintion of limerence. I try to lie to avoid hanging out with my friends yet they are just too persistent. There are only so many lies I can think. They really love me and feel close to and consider me a very good friend, but I just do not feel close to anyone. Nor do I have the desire too. I dread having to hangout and the whole time proceeding all I think it that I just gotta power through and I am done torturing myself.

 The person I am considered ""closest"" with is extremely dramatic (and a tad narcisstic) and my lives rights down the road. So I know that if I explain how  I do not want to be friends with any of them especially her, will have a fit and I do not want to deal with confrontation. She is not very understanding when people have any negative things to say about her so i just know that it would not bode well. But they are so persistent and love me for whatever reason so when I try to lie about coming to hangout they find a way around it. Quarantine has lowkey been a blessing but they just recently realized that we can sit far feet apart outside but I just cant torture myself. If I just ghost them I feel like they might come to my house. And If i confront the issue then they are going to be upset and not understanding and I do not want drama!!

Would it be too foolish to leave everything behind and start a degree in fine arts. 

- what degree can I do since I don't have a bachelor's degree in arts? 
It's not possible to start with a five year bachelor's degree at this point. 

- Is it possible to get a scholarship? 
If there is scope for a master's degree I can manage with a scholarship and a part-time job.

- What is the guarantee that I would get a job post my degree to get by?

Unfortunately (and i'm not blaming anyone for this) the school is closed. I am forced to take all this work home with me.

154,"Hello, i'm 15 turning 16 in like 2 months and my parents are getting are getting  a divorce. my mom and i were talking about me wanting to get a job because ill be 16 by the time the pandemic is over, and she said she had a friend who runs a diner and needs someone to bus tables and such, so she agreed to talk to her friend and look into getting me a job there and i was really excited to finally be able to have some financial independence! 

But then she dropped the bomb, she wants to set 2 rules for if i get the job, rule one is that she gets to dictate if i keep it or not at all times, I do something she doesn't like, she can tell me to go quit my job right then, and two is that I cant tell my dad about it, now i didn't like rule one AT ALL but i kept my mouth shut because she cannot be reasoned with about certain things (the existence of my personal rights being one of them unfortunately.) but I did not understand the second rule at all, my dad is a cool guy, i love him a lot and we get along very well and he is very supportive of me and my endeavors. He even tried to get me a job himself but it just didn't work out. So i asked my mom why i can't tell him about the job if i get it, and she tried to convince me he'd be angry, but i knew that was bs and asked again. and she looked around and kinda whispered to me, ""Because it's more child support that way alright?""

 I am appalled. I knew my mom was planning on cleaning my dad of all his funds in the divorce (that's not even me siding with my dad, i overheard her talking to my aunts on the phone about how that's exactly what she wants to do, same wording even.) But i don't want her to and I DEFINITELY don't want to help her do it! it's been almost a month and i've been talking with my dad a lot and still haven't told him what she said.

 what do I even do? do i still take the job from her to save myself the trouble but don't follow her rules and risk being forced to quit and try again? to i just get a different job that could take months to get? and most importantly, do i tell my dad about this, or do i keep it to myself? he's already very sad because of all the other things my mom has been doing over the course of the process, and he doesn't want me and my sister being involved at all. i want to tell him so bad, because it feels like being quiet helps my mom take advantage of him. she already has him paying all our household bills while she pays nothing except groceries, and he feels so guilty about us kids having to deal with divorce stuff already.

We would probably end up borrowing my dads truck, and my dad would probably be going with us to get the material, as we've never done it, and won't know what we are doing.

I've told my brother several times since the leak started that we need to go and get the material. He usually just says ""I know, well do it soon"", and essentially just brushed my suggestion off. Sometimes he even gets mad, and tells me I worry too much. I eventually just stopped bringing it up, since its bothered him. I realized we weren't on the same page, so I moved out about a year ago. Since them my brothers friend moved in, and was paying us for a room. Heres the thing. the leak has caused mold. When I lived there, I would keep the mold away, but my brother hasnt since I've moved out. A couple months ago, another leak appeared in the other bathroom. I once again bugged my brother about it with the same results, so I got him to agree to buy my half, as I dont want to be responsible anymore, but we cant do that until things are back to normal.

I haven't been feeling so good since right about the end of 2019, however, I have felt things such as what I believe to be depression many years ago, however that was temporary and nothing of the sort has ever been diagnosed for me. Now to the point. Recently I've been feeling a way that I didn't know how to describe. At least until I stumbled across some generic video intended to boost the ego of children, or tell people that they have depression if they happen to be undergoing an episode of sadness. This video was titled: ""Signs That You Are Emotionally Numb"". I brushed it off at first, however, I didn't know what emotional numbness was exactly. I had an assumption, though. I decided to do research about it. And the thought started eating at me, as I realized that it described how I was feeling pretty well.

Recently, I've found that I only really have 2 emotions. One is a weird mishmash of every other emotion I had before, and the other is anger (self explanatory). Happiness, sadness, etc. have all come together into this grey, ugly puddle of emotions. When something sad happens, I feel the same as when I'm laughing my ass off at some meme I found (that's also happening less now). I haven't even been getting angry as much either. I find myself letting things go much more, which I guess is a positive; I can't find the strength in me to put my foot down against anything anymore. For example, I have a little brother, who has a tablet, and even though I tried explaining to my parents that it was a bad idea, eventually it ended up in his hands. And he'll do things like watch videos with swearing and watch horror videos, and my dad knows and has told him repeatedly not to, but he does it anyways in the comfort of his room. Dad will ask me about this, and I say no to his questions about if I've heard watch videos of this nature, because I can't find it in me to put my foot down. I just went on an unrelated tangent...

Not sure if this is related either, but I've been getting aroused less too, like, not at all. I can turn on my favorite hentai (Itadaki Seieki) and it still fails to turn me on. I can look at the hottest hentai available, but I stay flaccid the whole time. Even though it's natural for my age, and I did a little while ago, dirty thoughts about girls don't happen, and I don't pop a stiffy for no reason anymore. I don't care if it's gross, I'm really concerned about my mental well being. (Before you ask, I'm going through puberty).

tl;dr: If you actually look at these instead of reading you are scum.

Edit: Instead of sleeping, I'm going to elaborate.

I have been accepted into a college, however they put me as an out-of-state student which I don't think is the case, and would have to pay 15k extra for the school year, I was born in the state of Georgia, lived abrod from 1 to 15 years old and moved back to the same state at 15, since then I have lived with my grandmother who lives here and is a citizen, my parents are not citizens and only lived here for a shorth period, and havent come back ever since I was 1. Anyways, since I have lived in this state for 3-4 years and being an in-state only requires 2 I didn't think that would ever be an issue, but turns out it is, they asked for some documentation and one of the papers is ""A notarized statement from your grandparents saying your parents do not live in the U.S., your parents do not provide for you financially and they provide 100% of your financial needs, you live with them with the address listed and the date you moved in.¬†""

So my question is, in order to notorize this statement am I gonna have to prove anything? From what I undestand notarizing means taking this statement to some gov office and having a notary sign it, is the notary gonna ask for anything? One thing that could be a problem is that my grandmother didnt put me as a dependent on her 2018 tax return(last one she did) mostly because she didn't even know she could do that and neither did I, but we do have other types of proof I have lived with her, also, am I supposed to write this statement myself?

Backstory: we have been together for about 1.5 years now, and we have had a pretty solid relationship. Minor fights and bumps in the road that we have gotten over. Mainly over my insecurities, or him messing up. He is a very non-chalant guy, laid back, and goes with the flow on all his life decisions. He is terrible at reassurance, and words of affirmation is not his strong suit. But I know that he loves me. We have briefly discussed our future together. And when we do, I never really get answers out of him and I just feel like im pestering.

He is moving about 1.5 hours away from me for work-related reasons in May. This seems to not concern him whatsoever. I‚Äôm still in college, I have about a year left until I graduate. I‚Äôm concerned because I feel like we are going to grow apart, but he says that will only happen if we let it happen. And he‚Äôs completely right. We are already used to seeing eachother on weekends due to me being at college an hour away from his parents house he is currently in. 

Something I‚Äôve noticed is that he never reassures me about our future together. I‚Äôm worried about after graduation, our future, him moving away, etc. I expressed my feelings on this topic today and got answers such as (and I quote) ‚Äò And nobody can predict the future? I‚Äôm in a relationship and I do want that with you. But yes at the same time my mind isn‚Äôt on that all the time ya know?

And I‚Äôm left confused and wondering. Should I be expecting more since we have been together for this long now? Or should I just stop asking him questions of what he sees with me in the future? 

I feel almost as if I am pressing him for answers he does not have. But he never reassures me with things such as ‚Äòyou‚Äôre the woman I want to marry‚Äô or ‚Äòyou‚Äôre the woman I see a future with‚Äô.

175,"Context: My parents decided to would be best for us to temporarily relocate out of New York to Pennsylvania to wait out the remainder of the COVID epidemic in the city. I was already devastated because I'm a hs senior and I couldn't stand being separated even more from others distance-wise despite quarantine being a thing (I haven't been hanging out with anyone since quarantine began). 
We bought a house here a few months ago and this is my first time living here. This is only week 3 and I'm losing my mind. I try to call or interact with my friends online often to compensate for the long distance strain and stress I've been dealing so hard with. I've had numerous breakdowns over this but my family seems to enjoy living here.

Actual situation in question: Yesterday I was in a call with my friend after which my mom pulled me to the side and said that I was being ungrateful and lazy for not helping them as much as I should because I ""constantly talk to friends"". My dad was quick to butt in and yell at me further, creating an echochamber so that once he snapped at me I tried to explain myself but both took it as me talking back and proceeded to call me black tongued and evil. 

What was worse was the fact that as soon as I tried to explain myself my dad began spitting in my face and saying that he won't even listen to my side and that I am completely wrong. I couldn't yell over his voice anyways. 

The issue is is that it's not like I don't do anything at home. Whenever they ask me to do something for them I do it without question, and if I'm busy in the moment and can't get up to do something I do it immediately after I'm done. 

I also tried explaining to them the fact that because of social distancing I'm trying very hard to maintain a healthy social life with people and my dad said the insensitive statement of ""but where were they before quarantine?"", and as someone who is usually introverted it struck a really bad nerve. He is the type to be brash with his words and sometimes physical (he never hurt anyone of course), but he sometimes takes it out on objects (eg. throwing a paper plate across the kitchen which he did then). 

Both parents at that point were yelling at me so I ended up shutting myself in my room and then had a pretty bad breakdown in the basement. 

Today: I couldn't speak a word to them. I felt tired and numb and didn't want to be in contact with anyone. Later today I needed to refill the printer ink and before trying to ask where my dad left the cartridges I began rummaging in a few boxes, after which my dad who was in the room became enraged and told me that once HIS social life was satisfied, he'll locate the ink (referring to what I said the day before). 

I had another confrontation with my mom about what transpired yesterday and what struck me as funny was the fact that when I began listing the things that I have done for us and for them while staying here she immediately twisted her argument to say that it's my attitude that's the problem. 

I'm honestly at a loss. This isn't the first time we've had arguments like these, and usually we come to short term resolutions only to rekindle the same or similar argument shortly after. I'm the type to want to sit down and talk but my parents dont prefer listening but rather recieving instant resolution which isn't how things normally work.

Edit: during the same confrontation with my mom today she brought up the fact that she was hurt I was giving her the silent treatment when I didn't want to speak to her. I find that bold of her to say that considering how much shit I had to deal in terms of them these past few weeks.",16Apr2020,3

Violin is my passion and I thought that I could take the pre requisites and get involved with volunteering and research during that time. I don‚Äôt want to make a career out of violin due to an injury I sustained but I would enjoy continuing my violin studies very much. 

I am currently seeking out clinical experiences and shadowing opportunities as well. 

For reference 
My undergrad cumulative GPA: 3.85 
My undergrad bcmp GPA: (basically nonexistent because only 2/3 science classes have been taken) 
I would be 24 during the application process

186,"Hello, 

(I apologize for the long post, it's been hard to organize my thoughts)

First off, I do want to state that this is a very self centered post, and I am aware of the deaths and other much more horrible situations occurring as a result of the pandemic. 

So, I am a freshman in college. I came into university hoping to major in Astrophysics, but due to other realizations that can be saved for a whole other post, I am most likely going to be switching. Anyways, I received a summer research position working in my University's observatory studying quasars. This is something I had only dreamt of. But, as my school is in CNY (Colgate), it looks like that's not going to happen. This is probably going to be my only chance to do so. 

I was also approved to travel to a conference in spain, and following this, observe in the Canary islands. This was also canceled. 

In addition, I got into a sophomore program which takes me to Uganda, all expenses paid, for two weeks as a sort of extended study to the class. Now, there has been talk of potentially halting this as well.

Finally, I'm not sure if the firefighting program at my school will persist for the following year, and this is something I have been looking forward to applying to again, as I had to decline last year as a result of a physics class interfering with training. 

These are all life changing experiences for me. I have never left the country, I come from a very low income household, and I'm the only one in my family to go to college. 

I am very grateful for where I am now, don't get me wrong, but thinking about all of this, it's been eating away at me. I'm not sure how to handle it.",16Apr2020,1

189,"I'm stressed out right now. My everyday routine depends on remembering a number of small details.

So before I go to work, I need to remember to bring (1) my wallet, (2) my home phone, (3) my work phone, (4) my watch, (5) my work pass, (6) my house keys, (7) my motorcycle keys, (8) my lunch, (9) my caffeinated drinks, (10) my galaxy buds and an assorted of other items.

This doesn't happen often but when I do forget that ONE thing, it inconvenienced/ruins the rest of my day.

Accidentally forgetting my wallet means I have no money. Forgetting my motorcycle key on my motorcycle risks it getting stolen. Forgetting to bring my caffeintated drinks means I'm a zombie for the day at work. Forgetting one of my two phone limits my communication. Forgetting to weekly reset my motorcycle camera risks losing footage of a potential accident. etc etc.

Again, this doesn't happen often but forgetting that ONE thing can have disastrous consequences. 

I'm hating myself now coz I have accidentally left my galaxy buds in my pants when I put my clothes in the washer. Its ruined now. $200 destroyed just because I forgot THAT ONE THING. Man this sucks.

How do you guys cope with having to remember everything?",16Apr2020,1
191,I‚Äôm 18 years old a boy and leaving soon for Air Force. My parents have me on a tight leash. (Way before the virus) I have major self worth issues and the one person I feel completely comfortable talking too is my best friend. My parents HATE her (yes it‚Äôs a her) she has issues herself not only mentally but physically and smokes pot to help with her major back pain and anxiety. I met her 5 years ago but only became very close about 2 years ago she helps me a lot with my issues and I do the same for her. My mom has the issue with her smoking pot and says that it‚Äôs a bad influence on me. I‚Äôve never smoked pot and I tell her that constantly. I‚Äôve taken to seeing my friend only in secret and sneaking over when I can (there nothing between us she even has a Boyfriend who I‚Äôm extremely close with too) I want to finally stand my ground with my mom and tell her what I really feel but I‚Äôm honestly very scared of how she will act. My mom genuinely scares me and I almost never argue with her. If it goes really bad my friend has offered me to stay at her place. Which I‚Äôm okay with.

197,"I think my father has become somewhat eccentric since the quarantine started. While we‚Äôve both played on PC for years, he is now wanting to buy a new PlayStation, even though he hardly plays games at all. When I was younger I kept asking for a console and he told me that I could do mostly the same things on my computer and that I would hardly use it. He was right and I used it for a few weeks before going back. Now, he wants to shell out a few hundred dollars for a new console which I feel like he won‚Äôt use at all.

198,"this may seem like a ridiculous question to ask but it consistently bothers and often hurts me so i thought i‚Äôd come here. i am a teenager, and a few years ago when i was 14 (young, i know), i got drunk for the first time. i was only with a few friends, and the boy i liked at the time was there. before any alcohol was involved, we kissed and went to 2nd base, and although i made a point of this being a huge deal to me it was completely consensual.

anyway, later on i got drunk and this boy decided to stay sober, which didn‚Äôt bother me. we both went upstairs and after kissing for a little bit i told him i was tired and wanted to go to sleep. i was very drunk and i told him i could barely see straight, which was true as i‚Äôd consumed a lot of alcohol.

he told me it was fine and he decided to lay next to me on the bed, which i didn‚Äôt consider a big deal as we were close. however, he started to make advances and i told him to stop it because i didn‚Äôt want to do anything right now. he continued to ask me and said that we‚Äôd done it before, so what difference did it make? me being drunk and tired allowed him to carry on touching me as i didn‚Äôt want to argue. he asked me to go further (3rd base) and i said no, but his ‚Äî- was already out and he kept pushing my head and asking repeatedly.

when i woke up in the morning i was mortified at finding out this happened, and my friends encouraged me to speak to this boy about how i felt, but after expressing my discomfort about the situation to him he just laughed at me. he said he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and that he eventually got me to say yes so it was consent. he then ignored my text messages after claiming i was ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù for bringing it up, and we never spoke again, despite the fact that we were very close.

even though i felt uncomfortable i accepted this and didn‚Äôt argue any further, but this incident had made me almost scared of sexual encounters and i haven‚Äôt done anything since. i am pretty sure what happened was wrong but he consistently called me dramatic so i constantly question if he actually was in the wrong? anyway it drives me insane so i just wanted to know if anybody thinks i‚Äôm being dramatic or if he actually did take advantage whilst i was drunk i guess.

ps- if you think i am overreacting please don‚Äôt hesitate to say so, i‚Äôm not looking for validation i‚Äôd rather a genuine opinion!",16Apr2020,1

200,"I think I had the weirdest dream in my entire life and idk how to feel about it. I'm almost weirded out by how weird and out of the blue it is since for the past month I've had the best dreams. I think what's freaking me out most about this dream is the shock of how random it is. 

Basically, I'm working at a department store and theres these uniforms that each person, depending on what job you have, has to wear. So for example, I'm wearing a tight body con dress because I'm a saleswoman and all the sales people wears the same dresses. Although the dress isnt weird I fucking hate wearing those dresses because I'm severely self conscious so idk why my brain would want me to wear that. 

Anyways, I'm working and my manager introduces me to a new employee who is gonna shadow me today. Its meghan markle but get this, shes pregnant and blind. Like eyes white, blind. And apparently no one knows its meghan and apparently only I do. So, I show her around and get her into uniform and we're climbing the steps of the store and I'm very nervous because shes blind and I dont want her to trip and fall. Thankfully she doesnt. 

But when we reach the top, theres this black man with waiting for us with a brown beard and the bluest eyes I've ever seen and he starts talking to meghan about the baby (which irl I think shes already had) and I'm watching them talk and then the weirdest thing happens (as if all of this wasnt weird enough), i hear screaming. I turn to look at who is screaming but i cant see anyone screaming and then i realize I'm screaming and i start to cry and meghan and the man are looking at me and for some reason the man starts to look familiar but I cant place it. Then the man says my name and tells me that it's not my time. Then, idk how, but something inside me tells me that this man is God and before I can ask what's going on I wake up. I've been thinking about this dream all day, I'm kinda spooked. 

So I guess my question is what the fuck does this all mean? 

And what's your craziest dream?",16Apr2020,1

A year ago, we saw each other again and tried to talk things through. We were okay and learned that it was a mistake that we let that guy (who ruined us) come in our way.

I know everyone's on their own rat race, so the competition it always going to be high, but I know im driven enough to get it eventually get it, but it's not happening as fast as I'd like, I hold a huge amount of pressure over myself to achieve and always push not matter how much stress it causes me, tbh I really just want to release myself from the stress but I really can't, it has a hold over me and there is nothing I can do to forget it, if I don't hit my milestone of success that iv set for myself I wouldn't be happy, I understand I'm very fortunate to be where I am, there are so many more less fortunate people then I, but this is a personal goal that I thinks bad for my mental health. My family see it in me when I'm going through s rough time and constantly reassure me to relax, but in scared of being stuck and trapped, I honestly feel that this is probably greed and I find it quite grotesque as it's not an attractive quality I like about myself, but I simply can't find satisfaction in my current success so far and I'm always chasing the next best thing for advance in my life.

I made sure I sanatized the computer carse, monitor, power cord. There are still some more cords in my care that I need to get though. This is what I feel kinda bad about. I work at an old mans house doing yard maintinance. I make sure I bring my own tools, so I'm not using his. Well, I tell the him that I'm really worried about the what's going on, and that I sanatize everything I touch at his house. Well, today I want able to bring my lawn mower, because it was in my truck, which was being worked on. Of course he wanted me to mow today, and wanted me to use his mower. When I was done mowing, I realised I rubbed my hands all over that mower, and didnt even know were to sanatize it. Also, if I wanted to do that, then he would have to go inside his house, and get the wipes for me. He seemed kind of annoyed, so I said ""well, am I the only one who touches this mower? He said ""you have been for a while, since you've been the only one mowing"" so, I just went and put it away, making him promise he wouldnt touch it. I'm afraid he forgot, and went and touched it. I usually clean the lawn mower by spraying it with a hose, but I didn't this time, because I just wanted to get the heck out of there, and not risk further contaminating the mower. Also, he likes me to empty the grass from the bag in the back of the mower into big plastic bags. He touched them, then I touched them without much thought. I figured if he had it, then hed probably be gravely I'll seeing as hes 90 years old. I put those with the mower, and made him promise not to touch those either. Another thing is he puts those bags under a 2√ó4 so they wont fly away while I'm mowing. I may be just getting paranoid, but I told him not to touch the 2√ó4 either because it was lying on top of the bag I touched.

220,"So basically, with the entire virus going around, and college campuses being shut down,  my friends and I were kicked out of the dorms. The thing is that there was one friend who was pretty quiet and didn't hang out with the rest of the people on our dorm's floor, but I was pretty outgoing, so I often would hang out with him separately from the group. We're pretty much as opposite as they get. Over time, we got closer and became pretty good friends. 

Since we were forced to leave the dorms, we obviously don't see each other as often because we live in different states. We both agreed to keep in touch, and we jokingly said that it would probably be me initiating the conversations we have online. But, now I really only hear from him once a day, and, even then, it's a pretty short reply. We've video-called once in the past few weeks. I don't really want to overwhelm him with multiple video-calls because he said he doesn't really do them often.

I just found a small collection of items that they've taken from my room while I was out of it- things that I bought myself or have been gifted. I am uncertain if they've taken any more of my stuff before this group since I have good reason to believe that they started taking my things when I was around 13/14. They've also previously thrown away/stolen clothes of mine (socks, underwear, and shirts) that they didn't think were ""stylish"" enough or something. And I've frequently come home to drawers in my room left open with the items inside clearly shifted through. My siblings are not to blame, since we have completely different sizes and tastes. Each of us has a different body type- none of my clothes fit either of my siblings, and most of the items I notice missing they have absolutely no interest in.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the items in this particular stash that I have found has rainbows on them, so I can only assume they're taking whatever they deem ""gay"". (They're not that accepting of anything LGBT)

&amp;#x200B;

Another item within this stash is a small box containing blades... I'm going to assume that whoever is reading this knows what that means. I \*\*am\*\* grateful that my parents took those from me, however, I do want the rest of my items back.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have a right to feel upset? Am I allowed to ask them for my things back? Do I have to move out first? How do I let them know that I don't want the box back, but just the rest of my things?

(Any sort of help is appreciated)",16Apr2020,2
233,My younger brother is 16 and a sophomore in high school. He has been falling behind since way before this coronavirus thing and refuses to do any assignments. Since he has been home all he does is coop himself up in his room and play video games with his friends. My parents and I have tried everything to make him do his assignemnets. Being strict doesn‚Äôt work. If we take away stuff he‚Äôll just sit in his room and stare at the wall for hours or take naps. He won‚Äôt listen to reason or when we try to schedule times to all do work together and even offer to help. I‚Äôm really at my wits end and have tried everything we can think of. He just does not care about school! Any help or tips for this situation would be greatly appreciated.,16Apr2020,0
234," Tldr: im a really bad person and made the same mistake 3 times, my girlfriend is really hurt but can't decide if she should break up with me, should i break up with her even though i lover her?

my girlfriend is my first girlfriend, she was my first everything (kiss, sex, etc) and i started dating her when i was 17. The thing is, i was/am very immature and a piece of shit. Between those years dating i had the same situation repeat three times, and the situation was: i started talking to someone around my age (girls) and because it was interesting to have someone's attention i would do the same, just to feed my ego basically. I did this three times, and even though i regret them, i did the same thing again. I knew it was immature and wrong, but i still repeated. Im not sure why, but i did. The point is, im now pretty sure that im not a good boyfriend (actually a pretty shitty one) and my girlfriend is very sad with all of this. The problem is that even though all of that happend, she still loves me and doens't know if she should break up with me. She's very confused and apparently can't make a choice, but i love her and even though i really really want to be with her, i can see how bad of a partner i was. Therefore the question, should i take responsibility of my actions and break up (for her) or just let her choose (even though she might be blinded but her feelings) ?",16Apr2020,1
235,"I remember my first time being insulted when I was 6 years old. I never knew about insults that time and didn't care about it too much. However, the insults got stronger when I was 8. I never understood what I did wrong every time I was called stupid by someone who was my former friend.

The year I was bullied a lot (mainly insults) was back when I started 4th grade. I was called things like ugly, weird, r word, d\*ck, and many others. I remember being angry and hit the table (kind of a light medium hit) and I got in trouble for it. It only taught me that I shouldn't stand up for myself. However, the biggest mistake I've ever made was when I started taking insults personally.

I would always get told to ignore or let it go because I brought it up multiple times because I was low-key a brat and wanted care and attention and compliments. I always heard let it go as ""get over it, other people have it worse than you."" The main issue was that I didn't know how to let it go.

I've been insulted multiple times in middle school and I remember trying to think of comebacks since no one was around me and no one would snitch at my middle school. Sometimes these insults led to me being interally homophobic (since I was called gay a lot) and having low self esteem. 

I never told the teachers until I was forced to by my mom because I thought it would be like me in elementary school when the teachers didn't give a heck about me being hurt.

I was never insulted for a while and it gave me the chance to let it go without realizing I was doing it. However, I was suddenly insulted multiple times again online weeks ago and it was all over my preference of cereal and milk. I was told that I was a mistake and I remember holding my tears back in class. It took me a while to realize that these people don't know me and they shouldn't call me things like that.

The worst insults I was given was when I was on a different platform online and said a satirical joke along with a video that were deemed to be controversial even when they're not (kpop fancam). I was accused of being racist towards white people. I was called ""Chinese virus"" multiple times and I was told many other racist things by idiots online. I even stated something that was controversial without the intention of harming anyone and I was told things like ""Imagine being skinned alive.""

I cried myself to sleep multiple times and felt like I've done many things unforgivable. I know a controversial opinion I stated was a bit too much but I didn't know any better since I was never taught these things. I took a break from the internet to reflect on myself and ended up closing my account from a specific platform and restarting it. 

I really have a struggle of letting these things go. I also don't want to be hurt and perceived as a crybaby when I express how upset I am after being insulted. I really need to know what to do. I know it's best to ignore but no matter how hard I try I still end up being in a state of frustration and confusion. What should I do to get out of this madness?",16Apr2020,2

However I am finding it very difficult to figure out what I should do due to a lot of factors which I'll outline here:  


‚Ä¢I've never been able to hold down a steady job, nearly every place I've worked at has caused me so much mental stress due to PTSD triggers; most of the jobs I've worked at the boss or entire workplace has been fired/shut down for their conduct. (Extremely unlucky)  
‚Ä¢Because of this I no longer want to work for anyone but myself.  


‚Ä¢I have finally reached a point where I no longer hate myself, and recognize that I'm only human with many flaws that can either be accepted as just that or changed for the better  


‚Ä¢I have a LOT of interests  


Those are some of the few complex reasons for the current state I am in. However the most glaring issue is that because of years of abuse and societal judgement I find myself having a lack of empathy for the world, and also a sense of apathy to it. I realize this is because of two reasons:  


‚Ä¢I don't think that the world deserves any help  


‚Ä¢I don't think I can offer anything to the world because it would never accept me  


I understand, and recognize these are fallacies. I love gaming, I love art, I love coding, I love playing with friends, I love music, I love games. I love games...  


I found something called the Ikigai Venn Diagram which, apparently, is popular in Eastern culture. When looking at the chart... I find the only real thing I'm missing is ""What the world needs"". I'm passionate about gaming but I also have so many interests... I'm lost and hoping someone out there has an experience, or soul like mine and can offer some advice (hopefully) from past experience and having moved onto a greater future.  


I've been looked down upon by my friends, my family, and everything inbetween because I've never had a successful job or income and I hate the materialism this society has bred, the world has bred... I just don't think it's important. Some people like to look at me and say that ""you're living off others"" but I don't find it true, because I contribute anything I can to the people I'm close too. This includes manual labor, maintenance of the house and its facilities, and anything they need. But still I'm plagued by incessant cries of ""you're taking advantage of everyone!"" ""You're so selfish and self-centered"" ""You're so entitled"", etc. etc.

253,"So, long time lurker and first time poster and i figured this was the best place to ask advice on what to do before i lose my nut. 

I have a friend who i met when i was 15 on yahoo Roleplay chat ( Shoutout to anyone who toured Ayenee and such ), we have spoken for year's online and phone and met twice in person, the time we met i also met another person i knew who was a friend of her's, online we hated each other ( Well more her me because i pestered her out of amusment ) and we ended up actually becoming very good friends.

So, i lived in Queensland and in about November of 2019 i was let go from my job doing council based work ( got shafted, but that's another story ), after only being able to find some work doing labour hire i was starting to find my mental health spiraling worse then it was, suddenly the housemate/House owner told me that i had 2 weeks to find a place, this was because she wanted to move her daughter and her husband in, no biggie. So i was sort of freaking out then a friend of almost 15 years asked me if i wanted to move to Sydney, after putting out some resume's and hearing back from many i decided it was the best move for me and my dog.  Go to Sydney, stay with my mate for a few weeks until i find work and in meantime move out, during this time i was told i wouldn't have to pay towards rent.

&amp;#x200B;

So driving to Sydney a few weeks later i made it 4 hours from Sydney before my car came off second best to a kangaroo, car was a write off as it caused me to go into the guard rail, alright, another setback but no problem, my mate came to get me and all seemed fine. But after a couple of day's i notice that the housemates are acting funny, my mate in the meantime spends alot of time at her boyfriends which is no big deal. it was also at this time the pandemic hit and pretty much all work in my field as labourer was pretty much halted, so my move for work went pretty much bust until eerything sort's itself out.

&amp;#x200B;

 Suddenly after 2 weeks the housemate start's complaining that my friend is behind in the rent, by almost a grand, so i message her on facebook as she was at the BF's and i get the "" oh he's mistaken, don't worry "". It's also at this time i find out the housemates had utterly NO idea i was coming, something i'd asked her many times if she'd checked and she told me yes and they were ok with it. Then the housemate came to me asking why i "" Ran to tell my friend what we discussed "" and i simply replied "" i simply asked her, to find out the truth ""

So for the last 3 weeks i have seen her about 2 times, she is always constantly at her boyfriends, during this time i have been crashing in her room on the bed and my dog has been confined to the room alot as the housemates hate that he shed's, love him as a dog but get upset he shed's alot "" Border Collie X Cocker Spaniel, what else do you expect? ). So the last few weeks he has been getting more and more vocal that my mate it is behind in rent, so sitting down i had a good talk and am still unable to find out who is bullshitting me. Now, the housemate has decided i have to should take over the room, pay rent but "" Don't tell your friend, let's see if she pay's what she owes "" which for me send's up red flag's. 

Now, my problem is that he want's 250 a week for the room without utilities, 250 a week for a room i don't want but i am stuck here until i find something else, since i am on centrelink my pay a fortnight is 600..........How the hell am i supposed to feed me, my dog and be able to look for work and pay rent when the rent will take 90 percent of my pay. I am at a loss at what to do because if he kicks me and the dog out, i literally have nowhere to go and if anything, i'm more afraid of my dog having nowhere to sleep safety. At the moment i am trying to save for a bond for a place but it's hard when i am trying to just barley survive, so sorry for the back ground rambling's but my question's are. 

&amp;#x200B;

What the hell do i do?, i know nobody in sydney apart from this friend and one other and with the damn pandemic going on, i'm basically stuck, at the same time i suffer severe Depression and anxiety and have daily thoughts of suicide ( 24 year's struggling, still surviving ), how do i get out of this situation when i physically don't have the fund's to move?

257,"I'm a healthy 27 year old male, and a year ago I thought I was dealing with the worst possible life-ruining situation but that was only the start....

I have been very sexually active for years but not reckless, and a year ago out of nowhere I got a genital wart on the shaft of my penis.

**First Mistake:** I thought it was a pimple and tried to pop it making it much worse

**Second Mistake:** I was too embarrassed to see a dermatologist

**Third Mistake:** After a bunch of research I decided applying Apple Cider Vinegar would kill and remove it and it would be a thing of the past.

The Apple Cider Vinegar treatment ended up working in the worst way possible...it was pretty effective.

After a few applications, the wart ""died"" and turned white and fell off and I was fully expecting the surrounding dead skin to clear up in just a few days, it was barely even noticeable at that point.

Instead, the dead-wart area slowly began to grow back (apparently ACV only kills the top of the wart and not the root of it or something like that).

**Fourth Mistake:** I did some more research and saw some stories of success after a few tries and by being more aggressive with the ACV treatment, so I went for it and still somehow convinced myself it was working. 

I got so aggressive with this second round of treatment that I literally saw no sign of a wart and the area had tons of dead skin but nothing close to potential scar damage. I even happened to have an unrelated primary care appt at that time and showed my doctor and he said he would have to refer me to a dermatologist for any additional treatment or advice but he literally said he thought it was completely gone and said I should be good as new in about a week, and if not, then call back for a dermatologist referral.

**Fifth Mistake:** During that ""recovery"" week, it happened to be the fourth of july and I drank excessively, barely slept, and had terrible hygiene; so by the end of the week when the wart was ""growing back"" once again, I figured it was a result of me being stupid and compromising my immune system but I figured I had proven that the ACV treatment worked so thought I just need to do it one more time but be much healthier over the next few weeks.

And this was the beginning of countless turns for the worst that I could never have imagined:

1. The wart that was growing back began to form as a ""superwart"", it literally became a cluster of one large wart and 2-3 other warts developing under the skin that looked like one MASSIVE wart
2. I still went forward with the ACV treatment but went as aggressive as humanly possible. At the time, I was getting fucked up in the head by this thing and was not thinking rationally and just wanted to fucking destroy it so strongly that it wouldn't have a chance to come back
3. I wold apply the ACV for hours straight without diluting it and feel like I was being tortured the whole time, and then I'd have to wait a few days to even tough the area and then did this again and again...probably like 5 times total.
4. As I'm sure you can tell, I'm no expert, but it seemed like it actually worked but also destroyed the entire area so I finally made a rational decision and got a referral and went to a dermatologist.
5. At the appt, he said it looked like the wart was gone but he couldn't tell for sure because the area was so inflamed, so I had to wait a full month and simply moisturize the area and then come back for a follow-up
6. In the follow-up the dermatologist was thrilled and said it's ""just a scar"" and recommended I keep moisturizing and come back in a month. So I did exactly that, and literally saw no improvement. When I saw him again he said it takes time and to keep moisturizing and come back in a month. For some reason he thought I was stressed because of the HPV virus and potential risks from it like getting cancer, so he kept telling me to just relax and said it's all going to be alright. Meanwhile there is a large fucking weird looking hard red area spanning a third of my shaft!!
7. It's now been 7-8 months and it maybe looks a bit better but still instantly noticeable, very off-putting, and isn't showing any signs of major improvements to appearance any time soon if ever. Two months ago was the last time I went in for another follow up and I freaked out about how he was misunderstanding my concern and said I will do anything to get close to a normal appearance, and he recommended ""silicon scar sheets"" which I have been using for 8 weeks now with little improvement. 

Any advice on literally anything about this would help (expect just telling me what I already did wrong)

I'm still trying to be optimistic but my social life and dating has been completely ruined and doesn't look like it's going to get any better any time soon.

261,"Hey, using a ...somewhat throwaway because my friends know my other account.

I've noticed recently, although this has always been an issue, that I don't really have any drive to do anything. This is usually, when I'm locked into a system like school, a good thing - it means I will do a lot for others and honestly don't mind, and I'm okay fucking around aimlessly because as long as I have music or my friends the situation is good. But I have poor future vision and bad decision making.

To give you a sense of perspective on the poor foresight: I don't really want to do anything as a job more than any other job. I would mostly just like to go for the easiest and most lucrative. I don't have any hobbies that I really enjoy consistently except social media use, which doesn't really count. I switch between hobbies on a monthly or yearly basis. I feel like I would be happy just living in the current moment I exist in forever. It's like I've accomplished everything I want to, and I'm pretty content. 

The issue being when I see my friends progressing and it makes me worried - should I also progress like they do? Should I be striving to achieve some kind of goal? I just want a basic job and a room to live in with a bed and computer. Ideally I'd have a bike too. That makes me kind of insecure because it doesn't seem like I have any real identity. I'm weird, I know that much, but not in a way that means I have obsessions, just in a funny way to my friends.

I'm currently at uni studying in foundation year (which is quite general and transferrable) geology. I'm doing this cause I saw a youtube series (called your dinosaurs are wrong) where a dude evaluates the realism of dinosaur toys, and I suddenly felt I quite liked palaeontology. That isn't offered as an undergrad degree so I'm doing geology as a way in. But I don't care that much. I just want to be at uni for the social aspect really.

I got pretty poor results at the pre-uni (A-level) stage because I gave up on my exams towards the end of the year. The deadlines were too much and I hate institutional education. Uni is much better, but I'm still crunching if I work at all and usually failing.

266,"So I‚Äôm in my first year at college studying screen acting in a UK city, the people there are nice the tutors have massive faith in us all. 

In the first couple months I was very certain I did not want to get into any romantic relationship as the college group was small and it could make things awkward. Well I ended up with this girl who was 6 feet tall and seemed to have a genuine thing for me, she never labelled it an official thing but I was ok with that since I hadn‚Äôt had any female contact like this for well over 6 months (the transition from near the end of secondary school or high school into college) so I was just happy to have this. 

Now that I look back at it the whole thing were red flags as she was obsessed with my genitals and how big they were bearing in mind no one at college except the boys knew that. And one issue she had was height. This is where the jokes started. We did a lot together but mostly met up on the set of an online series being shot at the time with me getting her a semi leading role in said show, after about two weeks she cut things with me because I was too short. 

I was really upset when this happened and when I went to ask her what her issue was with height so I could better move on she blocked me on all socials and told me ‚Äòshe didn‚Äôt want to be my friend anymore‚Äô and ‚Äòshe didn‚Äôt know me anymore‚Äô. So I asked her close friends to know help and in a matter of a few days a few people in the college said they no longer saw me in a positive light. It became apparent that she was spreading this story when people I hadn‚Äôt really spoken to are getting involved saying I‚Äôm a bad person etc. This is where the height jokes started to become commonplace.

Before this my height wasn‚Äôt an issue and no one raised it as a point. But afterwards it was a constant rain of height jokes left right and centre usually with the room dying of laughter, it was awful. I explained to certain people the history behind the jokes and I asked them to stop, some listened while others shrugged it off. Usually I wouldn‚Äôt get upset over jokes but since these ones had a negative history behind them where I was made to seem inadequate or ‚Äònot enough‚Äô I got really torn up over them. 

I tried explaining in group chats why I hated the jokes but they were always ignored. I didn‚Äôt want to cause scenes or be dramatic so I just assumed they got the message.

About a week or so after the initial split this girl pretended to date a guy who had the same height as me. Which got me more angry than upset with me calling them out on it very openly, they claimed it was just a joke to wind me up, which got some people to suddenly find it funny. 

So fast forward around 7 months and the height jokes haven‚Äôt stopped, and in the space of two days I discovered my ex girlfriend after this 6‚Äô tall one slept with 7 guys while we were together, and the tall girl made a tiktok where she ‚Äòintroduced‚Äô the people in her group chat, I was still in this group chat purely because I knew the other guys still liked this girl and I wasn‚Äôt going to make them choose between me or her. In this video she claimed, I was short and got offended over height jokes for no reason, then proceeding to post footage of me having a panic attack at a party and saying I do weird things when drunk. 

With that I‚Äôd had enough I told the girl she was a waste of a human and cut myself off from her completely, I‚Äôd decided she was no longer going to be a part of my life. The guy she pretended to date got mad. Wasn‚Äôt his arguement, and I had done nothing against him to instigate anything but he decided to message my now current girlfriend asking her to sort me out, she didn‚Äôt since she didn‚Äôt believe what I was doing was wrong, well I messaged him asking him to explain why he‚Äôs mad. Proceeds to tell me that I need to grow up and take a joke. Gets this guy who left college in the first month due to police trouble to tell me to grow up. I cut both out of my life, blocked all socials and phone numbers. I heard he‚Äôd messaged my girlfriend again, so I unblocked him on Instagram to try and talk things out. This guy failed GCSE maths, so I made a joke about it to which he got extremely annoyed saying it was offensive, I raised the point that if he gets upset when one joke is made about something he is insecure about imagine having that for nine months non stop and not being able to get it to stop. He blocked me on Instagram and proceeded to use his friend as a ‚Äòmessenger‚Äô. 

I waited a day before asking him through his friend if he wanted to talk things out since I reckon he just wanted to be a white knight for this girl, he ultimately said no and has cut me off, its a shame since he was a nice guy this girl has just been a bad influence on him. 

All in all I‚Äôm just not sure if me putting my foot down on jokes was worth it since I‚Äôve had to cut two people out of my life. Sorry its lengthy I just needed to give all the details. Thanks for giving this the time of day.",16Apr2020,4

276,"For context, let me explain the situation. We've had 2 flea infestations, one 3ish years ago and one starting 13, 14 months ago. Both times, my parents allowed the infestations to worsen because they though no one was getting bitten but the dogs. Luckily for them, I was the only person getting bit by fleas. To put it in perspective about how bad it was, I'd get at least 10-20 bites daily. My feet and legs are scarred from the first infestation because I wasnt getting any medication to help with the itching and I ended up scratching myself until Id bleed. 

So, the first time they bombed the house, getting rid of fleas for the time being. However, this infestation they didnt flea bomb the house. I've been literally begging them to do it for months, but they ignored me. I've come to the SOBBING because I was so tired of scratching myself raw and being so paranoid about the fleas. They said they want it done 'professionally', but it's been 3 months since they said it.

278,"Neighbor lets their dog roam and it‚Äôs always in our yard

Some backstory/insight:

We just moved into this house a few months ago. It is a rural neighborhood in Texas with 1/2 acre or larger lots and no HOA or anything. Our backyard is fenced for our dogs, however if we are in the garage or the front yard working we will let our dogs out (we have 2 labradors).  
Our neighbors have a German Shepard, no fence and they let the dog roam free all the time. The people that owned our house before us didn‚Äôt mind the dog coming into their yard. Now we moved in and this dog is CONSTANTLY in our yard, even comes to our front door and/or windows and drives our labs nuts (our one lab and the German Shepard do not get along and have gotten into a fight, which the German Shepard started by snapping at our lab), she even comes into our garage if we leave the door open, if we come outside and she is in our yard she barks and charges at us.

Our dogs NEVER leave our yard and always stay right by us so letting them out isn‚Äôt an issue because they stay on our property, but it‚Äôs gotten to a point that we can‚Äôt even let our dogs out on our own property because we are afraid of another dog fight. Which isn‚Äôt fair to our dogs.

I‚Äôve casually brought up in conversation with our neighbors that our dogs do not get along and they need to keep their dog in their yard but they just laugh it off and say ‚Äòoh she‚Äôs just used to being able to be in your yard because the old owners didn‚Äôt mind‚Äô. 

I‚Äôve started saving video footage from our security cameras of their dog on our property and am very tempted to call animal control but I don‚Äôt want to start a war with my neighbor. I am torn but am about to snap. My husband is at his wits end and is ready to shoot the damn dog, not really, but he‚Äôs pissed to say the least.

I went to vocational school for a trade for 1 year. There was a guy in a cohort behind mine (about half a year). We rarely talked. He was often seen with a girl who had a boyfriend back home. The way the school was set up it was a government program where one trained and lived at until their training was up.

I graduated and did not hear from guy for about a few months. We chat on Google plus (we live in different states, far away), then I guess somewhere down the line, he drops hints of liking me. I don't give any hints back and try to ignore them.

_when I go to Hawaii he suggests I visit him instead so I can have 'someone show me they care' (something similar to those lines
_I mention going to a Thanksgiving dinner with a classmate (older in his 60s) and his family. We were in the same art program. When I mention this man was older he said something about the fantasy being ruined.
_1.5 weeks ago, he mentioned coming to visit my area and asked if I go boating with him. I tell him I can't swim and I'm not comfortable in the water
_today he mentions he crushed on me 2 years ago during school but that it was over. His recent actions suggest otherwise. 

Should I abruptly end this relationship? I'm honestly not good about letting down people that don't take hints and end up ghosting them. I dislike the act of ghosting but it seems I might not have a choice here.

We had a long talk where he said I was always there for him when he was down, which in my personal opinion is not true because I‚Äôm pretty sure there were other people that were more involved in supporting him than I was, and I even told him this. He responds by saying that even though I wasn‚Äôt there literally, I would always take his mind off of what brought him down and I would always cheer him up when we talked, and he bought the games just so we could play together.

He took a portion of the money from his stimulus check and spent it on me. I told him that I greatly appreciate the gesture, but I could just spend my own money when I find it.

So, any advice? ESA now and just make it work for the move, or should I just suck it up and wait until I‚Äôm more certain about where I‚Äôll be living? I havaen‚Äôt owned a pet as an adult, just family ones as a kid, so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overthinking the moving problem.

312,"I (30/M) met my current girlfriend (33/F) a decade ago. Due to reasons, we didn't communicate much although she was already attracted to me. Long story short, in the end she had a really long relationship with this dude, they had a child, and four years later they broke up, a relationship that was already on its fall. We communicated again a few months after that (she took the chance once she knew how to see me regularly), we met each other, and about a month ago we decided to become official. And our relationship is just awesome!

Turns on, this week she realized this is a rebound on her end. Not like I was surprised at all, she had already mentioned she was trying to get over her ex still, but the fact she is in this rough patch at work, the fact she cannot work from home, and that despite her best efforts she hasn't really sorted out what her feelings on her ex will be, left me with a really sour flavor as of late. And she has realized she still hasn't made a conscious effort to get to know *me* better.

Now. She has told me she doesn't want to leave me, and that she is very satisfied with us. On top of that, she has said she wants to get to know the real me, and how being someone due to free choice rather than necessity feels. All of this, while sorting out her emotions.

Now, I also found out that in my favor, rebound relationships aren't inherently bad for either party, a study says (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407514525086). And I really really like her, so breaking up is not an option either.

We're both in therapy, and my therapist told me to not worry and make up any stories in my head about ifs or buts, for I'm no diviner. Even her therapist emphasized we should just enjoy ourselves.

How do you go through a rough patch with a significant other you both KNOW is rebounding? I'm trying to keep my spirits up, and to convince myself she won't break up overnight with me. What do you do or say? How am I supposed to support her, without getting on her way of figuring things out? I want to be a better boyfriend for her but I'm out of things to do or say... I'm at a loss here!

In 2013 my brother was shot and killed. He was murdered. He was 39 at the time. This, coupled with underlying mental health conditions sent my mother (75 at the time) into a tailspin which would result in her requiring assisted living going forward. During the period between my brother's murder and her new living situation, she was living alone. In this vulnerable moment of grief and confusion she collected our small family's photo albums and threw them away. By the time I learned of this, it was too late.

And so, this is where I need help.

The grade school where my brother and I went has since been turned into a nursing school. The police department has been unresponsive and so my hopes of even a mugshot (he was arrested a lot) are dashed. For good reason, I do not have connections to my brother's old friends. I've Google searched extensively and have learned things about my brother that he probably didn't even know üòî but no. fucking. picture.

319,"I've been seeing someone for about 6 months, met him 8 months ago. We're not dating because I told him I'm not dating someone with no job. I had beliefs he was trying, and he even got two jobs around beginning of February. One was only part time, therefore ""not good enough"", so he left it for another. He was late his first day of the second job and never got called back and pretended like he didn't know what happened. Now all of this COVID-19 stuff is happening and I'm stuck with him because I don't want to social distance by myself and I live alone (I moved here less than a year ago - far from friends and family). He lives at his parents otherwise, never having to pay bills or anything even if they could use the help. Now that I'm working from home, I'm becoming really disgusted with the fact he either goes on facebook or plays xbox ALL DAY - I'm talking 12 hours straight constantly. I counted how many times he smoked weed per day about a week ago and it was like 12 times in one day. I kept a literal tally. (Weed's legal in my state recreationally) 

I've had a rough couple of weeks, losing someone close to me, having to deal with endless questions and calls from countless people regarding the sudden death, people I haven't talked to in ages. I finally feel a bit better yesterday and today and my SO is having a bad depression day I guess. Honestly I don't want to deal with it. I don't want to deal with the bitchy attitude he catches and the constant woe-is-me mentality. He's immature and whiney, and I often feel he's acting more like a stereotypical female than I do. 

Now I'm bipolar so I understand depression very well which is why it's strange. I think it's more of an I'm-fed-up-with-him type thing rather than the depression but I honestly just want to be like ""wah, get over it"" (yes I know that is highly frowned upon). But I still feel this way. 

This morning he lays in bed in the room on Facebook until like 1pm. He sleeps in late but I saw him posting on Facebook and post a snapchat of a sad emoji so I went in there to see what's wrong. I convinced him to get out of bed, out of the dark room and he told me nothing's causing it and I didn't do anything. He smiled and was fine. I worked all day while he did his Facebook and xbox. At 9:30pm he just gets up without a word, goes into my room, shuts the light and stays on Facebook.

I don't know what to do, because I didn't realize many of these things about him beforehand, like he ***literally*** plays xbox all day with no intention to get a job. It's making him become repulsive to me. So I especially don't want to deal with the depression and poor-me attitude he's so used to having. I might just be selfish in my thinking, but I'm exhausted, after talking someone down from suicide multiple times in the last two months and making someone who got rejected from grad school feel better since she takes it personally and thinks she's not good enough. Now my close friend dies and now my SO is acting like this. I know depression doesn't work like this and I'd never say it but I wish I could just be like you don't have any obligations, no job and no bills to pay so what is there to be upset about?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My deadbeat SO is depressed but I'm burnt out from recent life events &amp; my close friend dying last week and don't want to deal with it. I don't feel bad because he has no job, no bills to pay, and is on Facebook/xbox ALL day every day - since last May. My attitude towards it is based on a feeling of ""I'm-fed-up-with-you"" rather than sympathizing with his depression. And we're social distancing together so my alternative is being alone.

320,"Okay, this is a problem that I have been struggling with for a couple of years. Basically, I did 4 years of university right out of high school, but I wasn‚Äôt focused, and I messed up a lot, and I fell off the curve. I ended up taking a full time job and deciding to take a gap year to grow up a bit. 

That full-time job became a little career for me. It‚Äôs now been about 5 years since I was a student, and I‚Äôm making excellent money. I bought a house with a $2500 mortgage. I have a car with a $600 payment. I have utilities, property taxes, insurance, etc. My total household bills are about $5300/month plus spending money, gas and groceries. 

I cannot think of a part-time job that is going to pay that much plus my tuition, and I‚Äôd REALLY like to avoid going into more debt for school, but I will if I have to. However, there‚Äôs no bank that‚Äôs going to lend me $100,000 per year to pay my bills and my tuition. 

I did think about continuing to work full-time while finishing my degree, and while I think that I could do it, I know that my grades would suffer. And anyways, I want to go into medical school afterwards, and I definitely can‚Äôt work full time in med school. 

SO, I am looking for ideas! Has anyone in this situation ever successfully gone back to school? How did you pay the bills? Is there a way for me to passively earn enough money while I‚Äôm in school that I won‚Äôt need to work more than 20 hours per week? Any suggestions are SO appreciated. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Relevant info: 
- I am a single woman, no kids, no spouse. The bills are paid by me alone.

323,"Hey all. 

So I'm a bit confused here. Someone who was formerly one of my closest friends, let's call him F, hasn't spoken to me for three weeks after I stopped initiating every conversation because I realized that he wasn't actually talking to me if I wasn't forcing him into some sort of conversation. And sometimes he wouldn't respond even the, even to a simple text like ""good night"". A few days passed with me trying to initiate and getting no response, no matter how simple the message. So, I forced myself to stop initiating to see if he'd actually say something.

Well, you've guessed it, it has been three weeks and I haven't heard a single thing from him. Back in January/February, he was still talking to me a bunch and initiating, and I have no idea what I did in the time between then and now to make him not want to speak to me anymore. 

This is a situation I've been met with before with this person. Whenever I try to say that it doesn't feel good when it happens, he just says that he's been busy. Which I've been understanding and coping with but...come on, I'm not insane here, right? It doesn't take more than two seconds to write back ""good night"". And I...he's one of my closest friends and we've been through a ton, so it really hurts when days pass and I hear nothing from him in spite of me trying to keep talking to him. And we're in quarantine, so it's not like we're doing anything right now, which contributes to it being hard for me to understand why he won't speak to me.

***So the question***; should I say something to him? If so, what? I don't know what to do, and I'm really sad because I don't understand why he isn't speaking to me anymore.",16Apr2020,1

names have been changed. molly is a good friend of mine i was just in a group facetime with along with a bunch of others. mark is a friend of mine that i went to jewish sleepaway camp with.


why can‚Äôt i answer this question. it should be yes. so easily. if i was a good person i‚Äôd know i was good and if i was a bad person id think i was good even if i‚Äôm not, right? i don‚Äôt know. 

if i am a bad person i know why. its two things. first is that i cannot be genuine in certain situations. most of the time in person or even over facetime i cannot apologize. i don‚Äôt know why. it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm a dick middle-aged man learning i‚Äôm a dick for the first time and just can‚Äôt accept it. why can‚Äôt i apologize. does that make me a bad person? i don‚Äôt know.

the second id also a repeated issue. i feel like that‚Äôs even worse than individual stuff. if i do a bunch of unrelated bad things they‚Äôre probably j mistakes, but when i do basically the same thing over and over, doesn‚Äôt that say something. i suck in groups. it‚Äôs not that the groups make me bad, that‚Äôs an excuse, it‚Äôs that i focus on getting instant laughs instead of more important things. i‚Äôve had this occur so many times. the most recent was tonight. i was making mean jokes to molly and people were laughing so in the moment i got a smile on my face. (that‚Äôs another thing. i get so happy whenever i make someone laugh it‚Äôs weird. i feel like i‚Äôm a robot who‚Äôs task is to make people laugh and i achieved my goal. it doesn‚Äôt feel normal idk.) but then after molly told me abt how upset it actually made her. i‚Äôd like to think i didn‚Äôt know in the moment, but what if i did? what if deep down i did know what i was saying would hurt her feelings, but i pushed it aside for the momentary satisfaction of making others laugh. i fucking hate it. i‚Äôve done it much worse and many other times. 

the worst time by far was with sean in tsofim. we made a ton of jokes abt him and i was at the forefront. and this was only whenever i was with a group. he confronted me abt it and told me to stop and i would for a day or two, until i would j conveniently forget and go right back to joking w everyone else. flash forward a week or so and it‚Äôs shabbat and he‚Äôs been in the bathroom for a while. me and max go to joke around with him and see what he‚Äôs doing. he was trying to kill himself. he was trying to cut himself and bleed to death in the camp bathroom. because of me. i thought i was his friend. i drove him to try to end his life. after talking to him i stepped outside the bathroom and immediately started bawling. i thought it would be a wake up call. HOW THE FUCK WAS IT NOT A WAKEUP CALL. my friend (ig not anymore all bc of me) tried to kill himself bc of the way i was. 

and i haven‚Äôt changed. it‚Äôs not the way i was it‚Äôs the way i am. and i‚Äôve hurt many people bc of it. so am i a bad person? how can I say i‚Äôm not? i drove my friend to try to kill himself because of how i am. i gotta be a bad person.

in all honesty, i don‚Äôt want to be a bed person. obviously. but i don‚Äôt see how i‚Äôm not. im posting on here because just maybe i can stop the wondering. obviously i want them to tell me some thing i never thought of and me be all ‚Äúoh yea that‚Äôs great i‚Äôm not a bad person!‚Äù but if they do end up telling me that i‚Äôm right then at least i can stop wondering. because i honestly don‚Äôt know which is worse, knowing this makes me a bad person or questioning myself.",16Apr2020,0
326,"I‚Äôve been thinking about this for so long and I can‚Äôt decide what to do. My girlfriend(19) and I (m19) have been dating for almost two years now and she has a severe anxiety disorder. When we first started dating everything was fine, she says she never showed that side of her but I feel like I somehow caused it. I‚Äôd say it started getting bad at 4 months and only got worse from there. She would have severe panic attacks just from overthinking things that I‚Äôve said, or if I‚Äôd have to cancel plans for any reason, and even when I‚Äôd have to go home for the night. 

I was there for her every time she needed me and took care of her the best I could but it kept getting worse. She is rarely understanding and always makes a fuss when I hang out with friends I barely see. I decided I needed a break after 1 year and that only lasted a week, I still loved and cared for her and I couldn‚Äôt leave her especially how bad her head was. Since then she‚Äôs gotten better, she‚Äôs seen a doctor and gotten medicine that helps but there‚Äôs still times where it feels like it did when it was at her worst. I work a labor intensive job, 50 hours a week, and she feels distant when I don‚Äôt spend all my free time with her even though I‚Äôm exhausted and need rest sometimes. 

I constantly feel like I‚Äôm not good enough as to any minor disappointment or change of plans can still set her off.

HOW THE FUCK WAS IT NOT A WAKEUP CALL. my friend (ig not anymore all bc of me) tried to kill himself bc of the way i was. 

and i haven‚Äôt changed. it‚Äôs not the way i was it‚Äôs the way i am. and i‚Äôve hurt many people bc of it. so am i a bad person? how can I say i‚Äôm not? i drove my friend to try to kill himself because of how i am. i gotta be a bad person.

in all honesty, i don‚Äôt want to be a bed person. obviously. but i don‚Äôt see how i‚Äôm not. im posting on here because just maybe i can stop the wondering. obviously i want them to tell me some thing i never thought of and me be all ‚Äúoh yea that‚Äôs great i‚Äôm not a bad person!‚Äù but if they do end up telling me that i‚Äôm right then at least i can stop wondering. because i honestly don‚Äôt know which is worse, knowing this makes me a bad person or questioning myself.",16Apr2020,0
341,"So , I have a lot of male and female friends and some of them date each other, simple enough, 

so In October I go to this haunted house kinda halloween fair with a guy friend and a couple girls, so two of them are in relation ships with my guy friends, one just kind of mutual from football.             and one from just meeting new people, me and that guy are really chill, me and his girlfriend are good friends to, 

so we get there and just go through all the things that were there and we decide to play spin the bottle, the two ones on relationships didn‚Äôt play (actually one did) so after a while both in relationships were playing and personally I skipped when it landed on them because it went against my morals and stuff. And both of the girls boyfriends were my friends, 

so after a while there all like just do it they don‚Äôt have to know and I still wasn‚Äôt gonna do it, so after a while I just kind of kissed one of them, and I physically got up and hit my head against the wall and said what did I just do, that meant nothing. And she was saying it‚Äôs fine he doesn‚Äôt have to know, and I wanted to tell him so badly what happened, but for a lot of other peoples sake I didn‚Äôt say anything cause I knew she loved him and that moment was equivalent to a hug, 

so the night passes, and so that night becomes a past thought, it might as well has never happened, but it has been on my mind a long time, a month ago they broke up, So it‚Äôs been about 6 or 7 months since this, I have a lot of moral standards, and what happened that night to me even if the kiss meant nothing, meant that I was betraying my friend, And one of my freinds told me that they knew what kind of person I was, and that it doesn‚Äôt define me that I made a decision I regret and that we all do and that if nothings come of it by now than nothings meant to come of it,

it‚Äôs just been on my life this entire year, what do I do to free my mind and also leave that in the past without bringing it back up into other people‚Äôs lives",16Apr2020,1

350,"Hi! This is gonna be long so bare with me.

We've been friends for over 2 years. I met him my freshman year of college (I'm currently a junior) and it was clear he was interested in me from the beginning. Long story short, we talked for awhile, eventually kissed (thats the furthest we've gone) and I eventually asked him what his intentions were. He said he didn't want a relationship at the time and we left off on good terms and stayed as good friends. Sophomore year came along and we still stayed as friends and he would ask to hang out here and there but we never did anything physical or anything.

Summer entering this school year, things changed completely. We began to talk a lot through Snap, he would tag me on things on Facebook. Immediately when classes started in August, he asked me to hang out which then became a consistent thing throughout the year. From August to March, he did a lot of things for me such as: asked to hangout a lot more often, always pay for my coffee several times, always try to hold my hand when we hung out, bought me wine, cooked for me (even bought me a steak because I specifically asked for one), asked to hang out in the city and Facetime over winter break. We were at two parties together this year and he stayed by my side the whole time which was unusual because the past two years he would be hooking up with other girls. At one of those parties, I was dancing close with another guy and I knew he got jealous but just didn't say anything. Anyways, he also remembered my birthday and bought me a bottle of wine after I jokingly asked for one. At my party, I got really drunk and was apparently flirting with his friends and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Fast forward to March, our school required all of us to leave because of COVID19. The day before we all left, he asked to hangout with me because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, he pays and holds my hand. Eventually, we go back to my room and we talk for a bit. Eventually, he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I say I'm not good at this physical stuff (By physical I mean like kissing/making out - i have no experience) and he ensures me its fine. I say I'm only comfortable with just the cheek and he just kisses me on the cheek and kind of just makes out with my neck. We then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he's coming too. I dance with my guy friends and then later, I see him hooking up (making out) with another girl. I then got kind of pissed so I find another guy where I eventually sit on his lap and I knew he saw it.

I like him but I'm still confused on whether he wanted a relationship or not but I‚Äôm leaning more that he did want one and just started to realize this now.

I know I should‚Äôve asked what his intentions were but I feel like he should be the one making it clear if his intentions from freshman year changed ‚Äî not me. I'm not sure if I should reach out because I don't know if he still has feelings for me or if he even thinks about everything that has happened. We‚Äôve barely talked since all of this happened (it‚Äôs been around a month)

Should I reach out or just move on and wait for someone who‚Äôs more mature and has better communication skills? I‚Äôm tired of the immature games and not knowing. I‚Äôm well aware that I need some growing up to do too and need to work on communicating better.",16Apr2020,1

357,"I work in a small company where we don't really know what the rules are. The other day, I was joking around with my manager about some silly thing in his office, and he pretended to get mad at me. It was all in good fun, until another manager saw us and yelled at me that I have no respect for my own boss. Neither my boss nor I responded, because we were so surprised at the response. And we couldn't, because the guy just walked out, mumbling to himself and shaking his head.

My boss said that I should've asked him what his problem was, because that kind of behavior is uncalled for and no one should treat me like that. Anyway, I told him I'd talk to the yeller in a bit, maybe he was just stressed out, but of course he couldn't treat me that way.

So I texted the guy to ask him if he had time to speak to me, and he said he was busy, then left my follow-up message unanswered about what time suits him. He spoke to me condescendingly that day again, and I was so mad, so I've been pretty cold to him since then. But I'm also sad because I hate being on bad terms with someone in the office. On top of it, it's not the warmest place to work at, and it's caused problems before, so I also can't understand what my next move should be, if any.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I've (F, 24, USA) been living overseas on and off for the past four years. I met this perfect guy a month before I left for a year long study abroad in Japan (we'll call him A, USA, 28), and it went on to be the best summer of my life, and by the end of it he confessed that he loved me. I was extremely immature at the time and didn't respond well, but he knew my feelings were there, too. We decided not to pursue anything while I was away but still kept in contact, and promised to see each other again when I went back to the US. Time went on and I think out of loneliness of being abroad I started to see someone, but nonetheless A stayed on my mind. I kept pushing the feelings away. When I went back home to the US, things with my partner of the time went sour and we eventually broke it off, but not until about a month or so before I left again to move to Korea. I hadn't contacted A when I first went back to the US because that wouldn't have been fair to my partner at the time. Once things ended, we met up, and ended up spending the entire day together until 3 am just talking and having a great time. We saw each other for most of the summer until I left, and this time I knew the feelings were real. This man is truly a perfect math, but this time, I was moving abroad indefinitely to South Korea. I always felt like as much of an incredible connection that we had, our timing was never right.

&amp;#x200B;

I have met an incredible guy while being here (29, Korean). This man is an angel on Earth. I feel so loved and cared about by him, and I give him all of my love in return. We always have an amazing time together, and I know he would be an amazing husband and father, but I'm worried that I couldn't be the best me for him if I'm still lingering onto these feelings. It's hard now because he's preparing for a huge exam and we can't see each other as much as I would like, but I do my best to be patient and support him. My friends and family all love him, too.

However, it's been almost three years since I last saw A but my feelings are still there. I love my boyfriend, and I feel as though these lingering feelings are incredibly disrespectful to him and almost hindering on emotional cheating.

A and I still stay in contact now and again as friends. We talked awhile ago and he said his feelings have not changed. Although I knew my answer, too, I bit my tongue. A knows my current situation and that I love my partner, which is why we decided to remain friends. I can't really think about cutting him out of my life completely.

I always just wonder if it's because we never had the chance to experience a relationship outside of the honeymoon stage, or the real challenges that come with it. But I also feel as though if that's never tested out I can never be completely truthful to my boyfriend. I haven't talked to him about this situation because I'm not even certain of what to do or say.

Now, I grew up in an abusive household, and due to that I'm very avoidant and self destructive. I know it's not fair to anyone around me and I'm working on that. I'm afraid that because of the feelings I have for both of them I'm pushing away, hard, and I don't know which one it is that I'm pushing the most. I hate living like this. Sometimes I just wish I could hop on a plane to see A and sort this all out once and for all. But if I did that, how would everything end?

It's truly driving me crazy and I don't know what to do. Please help, but please be gentle. I know I'm a terrible person for being in a relationship and having all of this happening internally (I've been cheated on before which makes me feel so much worse about this).

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?

TLDR; In a long term committed relationship with an amazing man, but still have feelings for a summer romance from a few years ago that has recently admitted to still having feelings for me.

I don't feel suicidal but I have been down that path before and do not want to head there. I've never really grieved before and never lost anyone close besides aunts and uncles (which never felt this way). I always assumed I may have been a sociopath because I never cried over death until now. Today was my first day back at work, my dad and I worked together in the same industry for years but I took a new job in October and am now feeling so angry I didn't stay to see him more. I don't know if any of this is normal but I feel like I'm losing my mind.

Sorry to unpack all this, I don't really have friends and with all that is going on, I don't socialize much to begin with but was close with my dad. What I'm asking for advice on is, where do I begin to seek help with this? I don't have a GP and haven't been to one since I was a child and had a pediatrician. Do I seek a GP then go from there? I know that's not what I need but everyone is telling me that I have to be refereed to a therapist or psychiatrist by a GP. Please, any help would be appreciated. Thank you.",16Apr2020,1

And it's hard to constantly ask him for it as he's also suffering from lock down issues, and keeps saying that he'll pay me, but i don't think he will. He think's i make money so his rent wouldn't affect me too much since the amount is so low. but infect it's the opposite. I rely on his rent to survive myself. And ever since the start of the month I've been starving myself, eating very scarcely in order to save up the money from last month's rent.

377,"Hello. I am 18 working at a childcare centre as a kindergarten teacher. I study full time to be a primary school teacher grades 1-6 (not kindergarten). I live at home and dont need a lot of money at the moment, just enough for petrol, phone bills, car bills, etc. I have enough money in my savings to go atleast 6 months without an income. Here are some of the features of my job:

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros**:

\- i love working with kids

\- i am in an industry similar to that i hope to work in later in life (i hope to work in teaching not childcare)

\- i make between 500-1000 per week which is enough to live comfortably and save over half my pay check each week

\- i have a strong bond with the children in my class

\- i get on with most of the girls i work with and have a somewhat friendship with them albeit weak

\- my manager is not mean but sometimes comes across less than competent

**Cons:**

\- i feel im not treated right sometimes illegally i find myself working 12 hour days no breaks 6 hours overtime 

\- i strongly disagree with their values and morals and the way they treat the kids 

\- i know of educators at my centre who ive personally witnessed portraying abusive behaviors towards the children something i refuse to stand and a person i feel unsafe working with

\- this educator is still employed after investigation, and also gets a lot of my shifts and has high priority over me. she was even offered my position without my knowledge however she declined. 

\- i applied for a part time 3 days a week 3 month fixed term contract which i did not get at first. another woman got the job, then quit after 3 days and i was offered to fill in for her as a casual until they found someone new. i think evenually they stopped trying and just left me in the role i am under-qualified for and under paid/no benefits. i feel like a second choice.

\- i am constantly left alone in the classroom with 10+ kids under 3 even though my role is assistant educator not room leader, i find myself taking on work of a higher role without the pay or benefits

\- i cannot mentally or physically handle the stress of being alone with so many young childre. i find myself often not eating or sleeping, fainting often, and throwing up all the food i eat

\- i also throw up often at work after meals in the childrens bathroom, which my manager knows about yet never sends me home 

\- ive fainted at work once from stress and an ambulance was called which work did not cover and i had to pay for ($900 which i did not have. also i did not ask for the ambulance to be called and was in the hospital for 6 hours to find out i was completely fine just hungry and tired) 

\- this is kind of silly but the girls often make fun of me for what i eat on my lunch break (im italian so its often pasta as thats what my family cook). they tell me im unhealthy and will get fat which has made me extremely insecure over time

\- i get none of the benefits my collegues have as i am casual yet work as if i am full time + overtime. if COVID-19 shut my centre down i will have no payout and find it difficult to claim money from the government.

\- im only 18 i live at home and study full time online. i dont need a lot of money to get by and can live off my savings until i find a career somewhere else

\- my manager has lied to me multiple times about contract and hours.

\- i signed a part time contract months ago which never went through as the COVID19 outbreak started they decided they didnt need the commitment of keeping me on. im not sure oif this is illegal but it is extremely unethical.

\- i often dont get my full break if any break. however despite not taking a break i still lose pay for this time i was meant to be off.

\- i would like to work especially in this industry but preferably in primary school, OSC club, or another centre who treat the children and staff better. childcare and kindergarten are now free in australia so these places are hiring at this time.

\- i often deal with violent children who throw tamtrums, bite my until i bleed and bruse, hit and throw things etc. i know this is apart of working with children but it has become extremely violent and unsafe.

\- i often change nappys/diapers despite kindergarten aged children needing to be toilet trained to enter the centre, many are not. i was never trained on how to do this so taught myself and fear i may do it wrong and hurt the children

\- my manager often severely understaffs us making me work long hours and putting the kids in danger as they are not properly supervised

\- the treatment of the children in all aspects goes against everything i believe and value about childcare and childrens well being. this job goes against my morals and makes me feel guilty often for supporting them

&amp;#x200B;

I have bad anxiety and always have. i am very scared to quit my job and want to. be extremely sure it is the right move before i do so. i desperately need some advice. reading this list over i see the answer may be obvious but i would be comforted by others opinions. 

thankyou so much.",16Apr2020,1

Yesterday I texted him in the morning : ""hey wanna hang out in the city? Or do an outdoors workoutüëå"" (Ps. We live in a small country in the middle of nowhere and there is no corona or lockdown here).
He didnt reply or see it but im sure he got the notification that i sent it. He called me tho later that morning to tell me he got into the uni he applied to. I was very happy for him and congratulated him and he was like ""you should have applied there too... that way u would already have a friend there (him)"". I was like ""yeah well its too late but ur right"". And then I asked if he read my text and he said no, so I asked him if he wants to hang out and he said ""umm we can do a workout. I need motivation"" and then he said ""tmr if the weather is good"". I told him im meeting my friend tmr and he said ""we can meet before or after"". So I told him ""yeah alright check the weather and let me know"". But since then he hasnt texted or anything and now its the next morning. Should I just let it go/ignore him?

389,"I am new to Reddit and on mobile so please bear with me.  Also This is a long post TL;DR at the bottom

I met my dog Jack and adopted him from Petco for $350 dollars. When I adopted him they guessed he was around three months old. He is a male, black lab mix, who is medium built. I‚Äôve had him for about a year and he is a little over one. I‚Äôve been attempting to house train Jack since he was a puppy. I suffer with major depression and had a downward spiral that caused me to neglect his training. Jack really isn‚Äôt the best listener and I would say he‚Äôs only about 70% potty trained (only having occasional pee accidents in the house). He is a great dog and I have become increasingly more guilty every single day. Now that I am feeling a little better, I am coming to the realization that I am not a good dog owner. I fed, watered and took him to the vet when needed but I couldn‚Äôt keep up with daily walks and attention. I realized this was very selfish of me, so I attempted to re-home him.

I made an add detailing my complex situation and posted it to Craigslist and several local Facebook pet pages. I listed Jack with a rehoming fee of $100 dollars and wrote I would require photos of your home/lawn. I also wrote I would like to keep in contact with the person who adopts him. The same day I received a text from a man named ‚ÄúTorey‚Äù saying he would like to meet my dog. Torey and I exchanged texts for the rest of the day and he even went as far as to say he would like to pick my dog up right now/ASAP. I was hesitant as I wasn‚Äôt expecting someone to respond so fast so I told him I‚Äôd like to meet him tomorrow at one. The meet happened the next day and we talked for about an hour while he hung out with Jack.  I explained everything that I just did above a long with instruction on how to take care of him. I explained he is very high maintenance, needs daily walks, and needs to be reminded to pee on occasion. I also explained my dog Jack is crate trained at night and he‚Äôs never slept anywhere at night but in crate. Torey and his wife looks excited and they seemed like normal people, so I agreed to let them ‚Äúadopt‚Äù my dog. They seemed like genuinely great people who just wanted some company during quarantine. I told them to keep their money and to spend it on getting jack a new bed or a bigger crate. I gave them a bark collar, a regular collar, his bowls, his dog food, his very old bed and I attempted to give them his current crate. When it came to the crate, they firmly declined and said they wouldn‚Äôt be needing it. They both said they wanted to try it without the crate (keep in mind I told them that my dog has never slept anywhere at night but in a crate). I reluctantly agreed but I knew keeping him in a crate at night wasn‚Äôt necessary. They seemed up for the task as they explained they were very bored at home. I was sad when Jack left but Ive been feeling guilty for awhile now and convinced myself it was for the better.

Later in the day I started to receive pictures of Jack in his new home as per my request. Everything seemed to be going well. It wasn‚Äôt until 10pm at night that I started receiving texts saying ‚ÄúJack won‚Äôt calm down‚Äù and ‚ÄúJack won‚Äôt go to sleep‚Äù. I texted them reminding them of his crate training and that this was all new for him just like it was for them. I then received another text from Torey saying, ‚ÄúYour damn dog just peed on my brand new mattress!‚Äù At this point I didn‚Äôt know what to say, so I apologized and reminded them to take him outside to potty. He messaged me again saying, ‚Äúthis mattress is absolutely ruined and you told me he didn‚Äôt piss in the house at night!‚Äù I responded saying, ‚ÄúI said he was crate trained and didn‚Äôt pee in the house at night because he‚Äôs in a crate.‚Äù Torey and his wife then started demanding that I take the dog back right away or he will take him to the pound/shelter. I currently have my kids with me while my husband is at work overnight so this wouldn‚Äôt be possible. I basically begged him to wait until the morning for me to come and get him. I also told him because of the Coronavirus, pounds and animal shelters aren‚Äôt open to the public. This really pissed him off and he said the only way he will bring the dog back (or give me his address) is if I pay to have his mattress cleaned. He also told me he wanted me to reimburse him for the gas it took him to pick Jack up. He did not text me an exact amount but informed me he was going to bed and would continue this tomorrow. He said this leaving me absolutely zero information on wether or not Jack was okay.

I personally have $70 dollars to my name and I have no idea what to do now. I am afraid he will set my dog loose in the middle of the night or something worse. I don‚Äôt have his address to go and pickup my dog and he isn‚Äôt responding. I really need some advice on what my next move should be.





TLDR; 
I tried to re-home my dog and upon him arriving at his new owners house he peed on their mattress. Now that the new owner found out the animal shelters are closed (due to Coronavirus) he is now saying he will only bring my dog back if I pay for the damages/gas money.",16Apr2020,1
391,"I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm depressed or if it‚Äôs something else but I‚Äôve been feeling sort of....emotionless I guess? I‚Äôm the the type that will feel like being social one moment then the next moment I will not want to talk to anyone at all for no reason, lately I‚Äôve been wanting to stay distant from my close friends. I don‚Äôt want them to think I‚Äôm pushing them away but I just... don‚Äôt feel as attached to them as I used to be. Even with my partner, (I‚Äôm in a LDR) before I‚Äôd always get excited to talk to him but nowadays I don‚Äôt feel as attached to him anymore (I still love him loads) but I feel like I could go days without talking to him or anyone at all. He has noticed that I seem very ‚Äúsad‚Äù lately but I don‚Äôt think it is exactly sadness, could be something else. I‚Äôve also noticed that the longer I go without talking to someone, the more detached I become. Recently me and my partner don‚Äôt talk as much because when he‚Äôs online I have school and when I‚Äôm done with it, he‚Äôs sleeping because it‚Äôs nighttime there and he also sleeps late so when he wakes up I‚Äôm asleep by then. But before we both used to make time to talk to each other but it isn‚Äôt happening these days.Why do I get detached so quickly and have this voice inside me telling me that I don‚Äôt need to put effort into sustaining my relationships and that I‚Äôll be fine by myself.",16Apr2020,1
392,"Im in my 3rd semester of a Master‚Äôs Program at a pretty good school. The degree is basically an MBA but for the ‚ÄúMusic Industry.‚Äù This whole program has seemed like kind of a pyramid scheme due to the super basic knowledge we are getting, with none of it being incredibly practical unless you already work in the industry. 

Just some background, I got my BA in Broadcasting and am a musician, so naturally I found myself bartending and working at Starbucks as well as a bunch of other dead end jobs. I was super depressed when I couldn‚Äôt find a good job out of college so after 3 years I went back for my masters. I‚Äôve always had trouble sticking with things, call it lazy if you will, but I have a hard time staying focused on things. 

I wanted to prove to myself I could stick with something so I‚Äôm sticking out this program despite some red flags. The red flags include the basic knowledge, unmotivated professors, and a lot of the people in the program just seem flat out dumb which in my opinion devalues the degree, and just makes me feel like if they‚Äôre in the program than anyone could have gotten in. 

Anyway, it‚Äôs not cheap but it‚Äôs not super expensive, about $25k for the whole thing but I had to take out a bunch of loans and will definitely be in more debt after the program ends, on top of my debt from undergrad. On top of that, I just got in trouble for posting a pic of a test online.....aka cheating.....so I automatically failed the class and will have to pay to retake this particular class next year. 

Is it worth staying in this program if I‚Äôm A) not guaranteed a job, B) poor as fuck because I‚Äôm out of work from COVID-19, C) going to be in more debt at the end, D) not satisfied with the legitimacy of the program? I want to drop out but I feel like I should stick with it to prove to myself that I can do something and not quit.",16Apr2020,1
394,"These last few years, life has dealt me (26) some shitty hands. I met a girl, fell in love, did everything for her, and got ditched by her after 2 years. Pain is still there but I'm trying to deal. 

Recently (last month) my job at a hospital of 5 years as a phlebotomist fired me because someone went to HR and claimed I threatened my assistant manager who wasnt even working the day they claimed. The whole situation was that my holocaust and cancer surviving grandmother passed away a month ago. I called my job and my assistant manager told me I only had 1 day of bereavement. I go in to work that weekend, missing the funeral, to find out I get 3 days of bereavement. I called my manager directly and she told me she will have it handled and will handle the assistant manager as well. When I returned, I got put on investigative suspension for supposedly threatening my assistant manager over the weekend with physical harm. Regardless, they ended the investigation 2 weeks later by terminating my contract because my assistant manager told them she felt unsafe if I were to return.

I finally got accepted by the university here to work on my bachelor's towards eventually becoming a neuro surgeon. But it deeply feels like a goal that'll never come to fruition. If I cant get a job, I know I wont be able to afford university, even with a student loan. Mainly because I need to cover rent. I have no family here and cant really rely or ask anyone for assistance. 

Now while the quarantine is going, I'm struggling to find a new job in the medical field or in general, since no one seems to be taking interviews. I'm running down my funds, and I'm feeling a weight on my chest that wont seem to go away. I miss my ex, but cant tell her that, and feel alone.

397,"I‚Äôve (18M, USA) been told for the past few years almost every single time I‚Äôm at a sleepover or sharing a room that my snoring is unbearably loud and prevented people from being able to sleep properly. People have complained about it in the morning and even thrown pillows at me in the middle of my sleep.

399," It's all my fault, I know. I've been taking online classes for about a year now, and I started off fantastic. I had in A in just about every subject except one (B), but that B didn't worry me, as I knew it wouldn't be hard to work the grade back up. Early on this year, though, my grandma (who I was very close to) 's cancer started to worsen unexpectedly. This was a sign to our family that we should visit her as she was getting closer to her final days. Everyday for a few weeks, we came by when she was laying in bed and played music to her, (as my grandma was pretty much the musical core of our family, so she enjoyed hearing us play music a lot) and played games around her until she passed away. 

&amp;#x200B;

During those weeks, I wasn't able to turn my assignments or study because we stayed until morning to after midnight, and I wasn't able to bring my books or submit anything. I got zeroes during those weeks. We emailed the teachers, and of course they understood completely, and had all hope in me in recovering from those weeks and continuing on my relatively good streak of grades. I understand this may be excusable, however, since that time (roughly 2 months ago) it started a spiral effect into me simply slacking off. A lot. I stopped doing homework, I stopped submitting things, and I got zeroes left and right in every class. I didn't just submit my work late, I just simply didn't submit it at all. I accepted the zeroes and moved on with my life as if school was some TV show I woke up and watched every morning that had no impact on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I kept doing this, but worry started to grow in my mind. I know I don't have a GPA yet, but I haven't even checked my grades in about 3 weeks because I am simply too scared of the feeling I will get when I see them (they're probably all below 40% at this point). I design and sometimes play games, although the game problem actually is quite limited, but regardless, I know they're distractions. Even though I knew this, I kept on procrastinating. 

&amp;#x200B;

I may call it *procrastinating*, but really it's worse. It isn't delaying, because I have nothing to delay, for I already know at this point I'm not going to come to the conclusion to submit something. It's fear that my parents may look at this and do something that I deserve to me; it's fear my teachers will look down upon me; it's fear I won't know enough once I enter into high school, and it's fear that I'm not going to turn into the person that I truly want to be. I know I can do better, and I know this definitely is not who I want to be. I just don't know how I'm going to get out of this. I know this is a really long paragraph to put on Reddit, but I just have to get out all of the stuff that's been worrying me half-to-death. I need something to boost me in the right direction.

Keep in mind I‚Äôm now a freshman in college and we still talk but he has now moved away about an hour to a different college not in our home town. For some examples of what I think is toxicity and would like some other viewpoints on, here is just a few:

1) brings up past mistakes from years ago over and over again to bring me down

2) has stated ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to care about you‚Äù multiple times. (Which in my mind I thought that‚Äôs what friendship was)

3) calls me names such as ‚Äúretarded‚Äù ‚Äústupid‚Äù ‚Äúdumbass‚Äù ‚Äú a bitch ‚Äú and etc. (he claims he‚Äôs joking most of the time when he says things like this)

4) is not supportive of any dreams or aspirations I have in life and constantly tries to shoot them down

We have had arguments in the past that we have blown up at each other for but we always end up somehow working our way back into each others lives cause we are kind of in the same friend group. All of my friends are in a group Snapchat but we are all going to different colleges so we obviously don‚Äôt see each other that much.

Also one more thing to throw in is I have personally talked to him and stated the problems I‚Äôve had with him and why I get frustrated with how he is. He blames anything that has happened, on me being ‚Äúweak‚Äù but he usually says he‚Äôll work on them and then a week goes by and it‚Äôs back to the same thing.

A huge fight happened the other night based off of a simple question and me stating where I wanted to live after college and he said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs where dreams go to die good luck making it out there‚Äù 

So I hope that is enough examples of kind of what I‚Äôm dealing with. Any advice on this situation and what I should do would be very helpful, thanks.",16Apr2020,1
412,"My bf and I (25 and 24) are great sometimes. Live together, but the past while he's been not having as much compassion. I want one of those ""fairytale relationship"" level of caring for one another. We used to have that, but now he just can't. He says he can't pretend, and thats okay I don't expect him to care at the very high level that I care, but lately when we fight I feel like he goes overboard with his reactions and he doesn't even care about me in the slightest. I have a few examples. Sorry if they're very vague. 

I jokingly put something of his outside (like neatly, I didn't just throw it). Well he locked me outside until I agreed to pick it up and then and only then would he unlock the door. Didn't care that he hit me with the door while shutting it. He said I crossed a line putting it outside and none of my jokes are funny. 

He doesn't care when I'm crying. He always thinks I'm overreacting or I'm dramatic. But I always feel like he's overreacting. When I try to explain my side of things he tells me to shut up. If I don't he will quickly get up and get in my face to intimidate me. Sometimes I feel like he will hit me, but I know that he probably won't. 

When he was mad I asked if he cared about me and he said ""Not right now I don't."" We talked about this later and he said that I get defensive when talking about my side. I don't know how to not sound defensive when trying to explain why I did what I did and how it never comes off as hostile which is how he always takes it. 

If I touch him when he doesn't really want to be touched (like if my hands are cold) instead of gently pushing my hands away he chooses to slap them. After a couple slaps he starts punching them (like knuckle on the back of my hand). I know this is probably my fault for touching him. Sometimes he will say he doesn't want to hold them, but after a while I'll jokingly tell him they aren't that cold anymore and touch his hand with mine. I still feel like its an overreaction though.. After he sees I am upset he starts ignoring me and sometimes will say he wants to be left alone. After this happened he only said sorry after I said sorry. But neither of us did anything to comfort or make the other feel better because he just wouldn't come back. If I would have tried to come near him he probably would have pushed me away (I've tried this before. So I usually let him be by himself when he's like this. But I tried to get him to willingly come back). 

I feel like partners should help each other. I lose my stuff a lot (like I put my phone in some random place and forget about it. Sometimes he even hides it from me as a joke). I spend a few minutes trying to look for the thing I misplaced, then after I check for a while I ask him if he's seen it or to help me look/call my phone. He thinks I ask for help too much. He doesn't want to help me. Once I asked him to run and get something for me (he was at the door, I was at the car and we were about to leave. That's the only reason I asked) but he said he felt like my slave, and when he eventually went in to get it he dropped it on the floor right in front of me and told me that I can pick it up. I still made him pick it up for me, so thats probably my bad for pushing him a bit but I still feel like dropping it on the floor was uncalled for. He's actually told me to my face that he hates that I ask for help too much. I told him I'd return the favor if he needed it 100% but he says that he doesn't ever need it. He said I started this by asking him to grab something for me when he didn't want to. I don't want him to ""feel like a slave"" but I think partners should help each other wherever possible. 

I feel at a loss. He's hasn't been caring about my feelings as much lately, and hurting me probably unintentionally a lot more lately but when I point it out he still doesn't give a fuck that I'm hurt. I have plenty of other examples but I just want advice. Am I in the wrong or is he actually overreacting? Because I can't even tell anymore. His side from what I gather is he feels like I do something wrong and he reacts to that, so its basically my fault. I also need advice on how to not sound defnesive when explaining my side. Much appreciated. 

Sorry about the book. TL;DR: 
Bf hasn't been caring about my feelings lately or apologize/show sympathy after he hurts me. 
Need advice on if I'm wrong and how to not sound defensive when talking about my side of things.",16Apr2020,1

414,"So about a year ago, I went on a trip abroad with my High School. At the time, I had my girlfriend (who I have been with for a little over a year now, and who I love deeply, and will definitely marry). At the time of the trip, I had been with my girlfriend for about a 5-6 Months, and we had become best friends, and the love of each other‚Äôs lives. I go on the trip, and I go with only 5 people from my school (one of whom being my sister, and none of them being my GF). Once in the foreign country, we meet up with other High Schools from across the US. There are several other girls my age, and some may say that they were attractive. I knew I had a GF, so the idea of even hooking up with one of them didn‚Äôt even cross my mind. 

The trip is 14 days long, and I had a lot of fun with my sis item and the other 4 students. On the second to last day of the trip, one of the girls from another school and I start talking, and we eventually make out. I felt guilty at the time, and still do. The following day (the last day of the trip) I went to her room at night, and we made out again. I ended up staying the bight in her room (nothing sexual happened). 

I get back from my trip and foolishly still talk to this girl via text. My gf finds out and asks who she is, and I just tell her a girl from the trip that I just chatted with. My gf says nothing really of it.

Now, while on the trip, the girl i made out with (Aubrey), told another girl on the trip (who went to my school) that me and her had made out. This girl from my school (Emma) told my gf, and my gf asks me why she would say that, and i tell her that Aubrey must be lying. 

My gf contacts Aubrey, and Aubrey denies everything. My gf is confused, and naturally paranoid, so she continues questioning me, Aubrey, Emma, and my sister.

I explain everything away, and make it seem as if i never made out with Aubrey. She believed me. fast forward a few weeks, and Aubrey tells my gf that me and her really did make out. i use her telling the truth to my advantage, and say that Aubrey can‚Äôt be trusted, and is clearly trying to ruin mine and my gf‚Äôs relationship, because her story keeps changing. my gf agrees, and hadn‚Äôt brought it back up for around 6 more months, until last night when my gf told me that she still thinks about the situation every night. 

She tells me that she still has worries about it, and that she still has a little belief i was lying to her.

I feel like i‚Äôve dug myself so deep into the lie, that i‚Äôve started believing i didn‚Äôt make out with Aubrey. But i feel like i‚Äôve dug myself so far into the lie, that i couldn‚Äôt possibly tell my gf the truth. 

i don‚Äôt know what to do, please help. 

do i tell my gf the truth, 1+ years after the fact, or simply keep up the lie, and reassure my gf that nothing happened.

TLDR: Cheated on GF, feel guilty, but have dug myself in 1+ year lie denying it (my lie has held up), and our relationship is very stable and healthy now. I know what i did was wrong, and haven‚Äôt done anything of the sort since...i just feel like i‚Äôve dug myself too deep in a lie to ever tell her the truth.

i greatly appreciate anyone who responds to this with advice. :)

416,"Hi there. Lemme explain some background, as anonymously as I can.

I play an instrument every weekend in a band at my church. It‚Äôs a very large church, mega church. I‚Äôm playing and as I look out, I see this INSANELY attractive person staring at me. We occasionally meet awkward eye contact, and I eventually notice her looking at her phone with her friend, up to me, and back down to the phone. Later that night she followed me on Instagram, and of course I was stoked. I saw some of her posts and noticed that she has a boyfriend. Huh... weird.

So I decide to not dm her or anything like that (not that I would have the self confidence to anyways.) 

Nothing has happened, until today. I posted some videos of me playing a song on my Instagram, and she complimented me on my skill. We got to talking about the song and the band that wrote it, and eventually that fell into small talk.

I really was crushing on her but I didn‚Äôt want to make any moves until I discovered her personality. Tonight I did. She loves all the same things as me, same genre of music, goes to my church (duh), even likes jazz music. 

Everything tells me to kind of let this fade away because she has a boyfriend. Should I keep talking to her or just let it be? I don‚Äôt really meet people often, so it‚Äôs hard to let this chance go. Please don‚Äôt be too hard on me lol.",16Apr2020,1

420,"My husband is a musician for a couple of bands. One band he is in started with him and the artist. This year they added 2 musicians. 1 (we will call him drama) started trying to get them to kick my husband out because Drama didn't like that he plays for more than 1 band. Drama even quit the band for 3 months then came back. Then he attacked me publicly on social media out of nowhere. He deleted it but not before a few dozen people saw it. It was bad. Fast forward 2 months and my husband just found out what the post had said and got very angry (I'm over it... I cant stay mad and am always nice to everyone...*I call it a side effect of cancer survival!) 
So he tells them he just found out about the post and needs a break from being around Drama. Now I am a cancer survivor... diagnosed 3 years ago February and cancer free or ""In remission"" for just over 2 years but developed multiple autoimmune disorders because of it. I have had 12 surgeries in 17 months and still have 5 major surgeries to go. I pass out and fall alot and recently had a bad spell breaking my front teeth and had to have them pulled and will need a partial when my gums heal. I dont let anyone see me. I'm in my 30's. 
I spent the day convincing my husband its fine and I'm fine and dont give up playing music with them because he loves the other 2 guys. He agreed and plans to message them tomorrow. 
But an hour ago Drama contacts me through facebook messenger with an F you and called me a succubus and made fun of my issues I have from cancer and chemo and called me a ugly toothless B. I dont want to tell my husband, but my husband is signed in to messenger on the computer and Drama messaged him some even worse things that popped up. My husband was already asleep and I was working on some ads for another artist. Again talking bad about things related to his cancer. 
Needless to say when my husband wakes up I'm pretty sure he will be quitting. But through the last year I have connected them with people that are helping them take off. They are also booked at some events. My bestie does their booking but wont be after tomorrow. Here is the big dilemma, most of the people I have connected them to, had or have cancer. I met them in Chemo, surgery preop or post OP, oncologist or immunologists offices. I usually wouldnt let my issues with someone cause issues with others. Do I tell these people what he has said specifically regarding the cancer and chemo and the hateful mocking? They have it too and they are helping him. What if he does that to someone more sensitive? And should someone with cancer be helping him if he feels okay trashing all people with cancer? I cringe to think he can say stuff like that about people... I'm sure plenty of his fans have cancer and autoimmune  disorders. Mine just doesnt work because of the chemo and I have vitamin deficiencies from it. I have never had this happen or experienced this even online let alone from someone I know so I am just not sure what I should or shouldn't do, share, keep to myself, etc. They are even supposed to play a concert in honor of a music producers 3rd anniversary as a cancer survivor in a few months.

424,"I'm gonna be honest, I'm very mixed about this so I just need a general idea as to whether or not I should check in on my ex girlfriend. I haven't spoken to her since I broke up with her several months ago. The reason we broke up was two fold. I'd noticed that she had not changed much from the last time we had hung out (as friends back in 2018ish(?)) as she was very dependent on me as a way to discuss and leverage her emotions. It was how I learned that she felt very lonely and vulnerable. Over the course of 1-2 months of talking with her about it, we broke contact and I told her to go to therapy if she wanted to stay friends. A few months after I'd stopped talking to her until she went to therapy, I shot her a text bc I felt that I'd abandoned her for not trying to stick with her when she felt the way she felt. I asked her if she wanted to talk the thing over coffee so we could get off on the right foot. One thing led to another and we ended up dating for about a month. I ended it after she slapped me over an argument (I reasoned that if that had happened that early in the relationship, that it might get worse if it continued). FF to today. It's been a good 6 months since I last talked to her and I've been getting the urge to text to check up on her. Though I'm not sure I should bc I don't want to do anything foolish or give her hope about any future relationships or rebounds. BUT. I do sincerely worry about her. I know she has a tendency to feel depressed and isolated. I'm just not sure whether or not I should shoot her a text asking if she's doing okay given the circumstances.

Friend B

So friend A is dating friend B,after about a week of them dating friend A came out as polyamarous(polyamorous basically means 3 or more people being in a relationship)
Friend B was not poly but he said it was fine but he didn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with anyone else
So a few days go by and everything‚Äôs fine we FaceTime regularly and we‚Äôre really close friends,but one day Friend C texted me and told me she was going to add me to the call but she told me to mute myself the second I was added and not to say anything until she told me to. I was confused but I said ok and she added me 
Friend B wasn‚Äôt there it was just me,friend C and friend A

I was there for about 5 minutes unnoticed but Friend A
He basically went on about how much he loved me but he also loved friend B
friend C then texted me and told me to unmute myself. I did it and the minute friend A realised he left the call,I kinda felt bad so I played dumb and texted him ‚Äúyou ok?‚Äù 
He left me on read 
I immediately left the call with friend C and spammed friend B until he answered 
We called for a while and talked about it and friend B felt like he wasn‚Äôt good enough and we‚Äôve been friends for a while and it makes me upset seeing him like that 
2 weeks go by and this all seems to have died down until I‚Äôm on call with friend A and he says he knows someone who has a crush on me so I kept asking him until he said ‚Äúme‚Äù and hung up
I texted him ‚ÄúWell I knew that....and my answers still the same,sorry bro‚Äù
He said ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine‚Äù
So I got on call with friend B again who I‚Äôd like to was not told about this at all
And he said he wants to break up
I didn‚Äôt blame him,so 2 days later they broke up 

Friend C and friend B are now dating

in my country enlisting to the army at 18 is mandatory, as annoying as it is having them steal 3 good years of my life, its also a slight relief. the way i see it, i have 3 more years of time to aquire a skill, or a set of skills before i begin life.  but what do i know? i dont know if thats actualy the plan, i dont know if there is even a plan, and i dont know what to do. so i was hoping some older and more experienced people in this sub could help me out here. and please understand that growing up in poverty, actual poverty, like 1 meal a day on good days, had me wanting more. i dont want to live on minimum or slightly more than minimum wage. i have my standards. i dont want to live on the verge of nothingness again, and i dont want my kids to live like that.",16Apr2020,1

Both of us moved across the country to live with the guys (m25 for her) (m27 for me), we were seeing, who happened to also be best friends. Tensions instantly were high for some reason, and it turns out her bf didn't like me, I didn't like him, and she didn't like my bf. No one addressed this except me, who was very open, but still cordial with her boyfriend. 
She ended up putting him first, allowing him to treat me like trash, and eventually started to ghost me. However, she also started accusing me of doing the exact same thing. Unfortunately, we both fell on hard times, and things came to a boiling point. We lashed out at each other, and essentially broke off the friendship. I was the first one to really pull the trigger, as I deleted her off social media without really telling her first, which caused her to get upset. Bad call on my part, but 20/20 hindsight, there was too much going on outside for me to really be thinking straight with this issue.

Now that we have had a year to let everything settle, I want to reach out and apologize for pain I know that I caused, and reconcile. However, at this point, is it too late? Is it even worth it? It's stupid looking back and thinking that so many little things got in the way, when they could've been avoided with proper communication and effort on both parts. I regret how I personally handled the situation. However, there were a lot of underlying issues that needed to be addressed outside of the dislike of each other's bf and apparent prioritizing of those relationships. I don't regret bringing them up, but I regret that they came out during a blow up in our relationship. 
Is it worth rehashing in order to reconcile? Or should I just let it be and be glad I at least got to say my part, and move on?

Me and my friends play Xbox, from Minecraft to Battlefront II, been friends for 2 years now. For the last few months I‚Äôve noticed an increasing in trust and honesty, I just recently learnt he started mainly playing PS4 2 months prior which I don‚Äôt have, started locking parties to inv only, we no longer play the same games and conversations between me and him when they do happen feel distant and almost awkward. Am I being paranoid or have I somehow ruined the friendship? I have trouble making friends but also pressing quit on a relationship, I‚Äôm afraid to lose the people I got to play with and end up alone. I‚Äôm dealing with a lot of issues rn, the virus not helping at all, I see a counsellor about symptoms of severe depression and this division between online friends is taking it‚Äôs toll on me. What do I do?",16Apr2020,2

I have convinced myself I‚Äôm don‚Äôt make him as happy as his past girlfriends may have and I really need some hot tips on how to calm my mind about it.

C is best friend
G is best friend also
K is another best friend
D is me

So, to start, I am a 19y/o guy and I graduated high school in Canada in June of  2018. I work in film, which means 14-18 hour days, 4-6 days a week. I also have mental health problems, which I mostly won't get into. The only important pieces are my depression, anxiety disorder and a rather severe problem with physical or verbal affection. Through a combination of my amazing support system (love you mum!), medication and some serious work on mt part, I'm able to say that I manage a life I thought I would never have even two years ago. And I'm still working hard, because my mental health is a daily obstacle that doesn't have a finish line unfortunately.

My friend C and I became friends when I was 15, through my mum. He, K and G are all three years younger than me, and still in high school. C is best friends with K (that's how I met K) and has bee for years. He is not often on his phone or online, and is not heavily involved in this story. That being said, he's a big part of our friend group and this is going to completely shock him if I lose my frienship with K. 

I only met G last summer even though she also went to the same highschool as C, K and I. G is a fucking angel, and has quickly become a very close friend. One important thing about her is that she is very, VERY physically and verbally affectionate with her friends. She is very careful with me, as I have a pretty serious problem with touch and affection. I only ever had to tell her once how scary is was for me, and to this day even if she accidentally bumps my leg, she immediately apologizes and makes sure I'm okay. She is very aware of her actions, but has a hard time saying no, and dissapointing people or voicing her discomfort. Both K and I actually developed crushes on her, but I refused to act on it, and quickly worked on getting over it as I (at the time) was 18, and 3 years older than her. K, who is the same age as her, held onto his crush for a looong time, and to this day I'm honestly not sure if he still has feelings for her. 

G pretty much became good solid friends with me, C and K within a few weeks, because we did a theater show with her last summer. And that was sort of around the time K had started to change, not necessarily because of that, but at that same time. 

K and G had some awkward times, with her liking him, but being very open about not wanting to be in a relationship, before and after he kissed her the first time. Over the course of a month and a half I was constantly hearing both sides of their stories of what was happening. K, was hopelessly in love and confused by her, wishing he could just talk to her like a normal person or stop crushing on her and just be her friend. Eventually, they had mutually agreed that they weren't going to date, as G was not ready to be in a relationship and had bad experience with being in them and K didn't want to force her into anything. G's crush on K faded, and we all just began hanging out as friends. This did not last long. Soon, K began acting totally off with G. He would take what she was saying wrong, and his crush just got worse. One afternoon, G, K and I were at my house. G asked K if she could demonstrate a self defense technique on him to show me, and it quickly became weird. He was getting oddly into it, telling her she should do others, getting chocking involved. I ended up having to leave the room, as I have some issues with sexual/intimate contact even if I'm not involved. Things went ""back to normal"" not long after that, but later that day G messaged me and we talked about how uncomfortable it made both her and I. In four years I had never seen K act like this. 

Weeks later, K's mental health started declinimg quickly. His home life (controlling mom, younger sister and baby cousin all in one small apartment) made it difficult for him as well. K has jokingly called me dad, and I call him son, as we both grew up without dads. However, he started doing this with every conversation, and relying on me for advice and other parenting type things. He came to my house unexpectedly, talked about his darker thoughts, obsessed over G, and started freaking out more and more. However, he knew I struggled pretty fiercly with mental health, and so he also shared his thoughts with G as a way to minimize dumping it on me. Unfortunatley after not too long I noticed a dip in my mental state, after one night where he shared that he had been self harming and I had to take him to a doctor by myself. The next day I couldn't get out of bed until 6pm. Something I hadn't done in over a year and a half. I had to sit K down and explain that while I love him very much, I cannot be his therapist as I'm not qualified and I'm just not able. We had a very genuine conversation, and he understood. I set boundaries, like when he could come to my house, asking before sharing things etc. At first it worked like a charm, and I was able to get him to speak with his mom, and to a counselor about what he was going through. However, he suddenly turned to G and started venting to her and manipulati g her in an awful way. 

Its a long story, but to shorten it, here are some of the things he did.

-Sit on the phone with her at 10:30-12:00 or latet, sharing dark thoughts about suicide and self harm
-Hang up on her after describing how he would self harm
-Kissed her while crying after she bandaged his self harm wound for him
-Make her skip class to console him while he freaked out at school
-Tell her things like 'I just don't know if I can look at you,' then litetally run away when he saw her the next day
-Go between insulting her and complimenting her
-Tell her not to touch him/be affectionate and then freak out and cry in her arms about how much he misses her or text her about missing her
-Victimize himself when she expressed concern for how he treated her (ex. ""God I'm such a fucking ass, I'm sorry for being such shitty friend. I'm the worst."")

Needless to say I was beyond angry as I saw this happening and I would often sit him down and talk about why xyz was not okay, and he would get better for a few days then return to his previous behaviour. This all happened for a few months, and eventually I called him and explained he was losing myself and G as friends. It really sobered him up, and he actually made good steps towards genuinley changing himself! But after a few weeks, G started showimg me new conversations they'd been having and I lost it. I will be fully honest when I say I love K dearly but he has been treating G like fucking garbage. It's like she's some fucking cardboard cuttout therapist who he can treat like trash and then forget about it two minutes later and act as though they're the best of friends. 

Here's my dilemma. I cannot be a therapist. These months have fucked me up. I am having almost daily anxiety attacks again, my depression has me staying in bed until 1 or 2pm everyday, and if it weren't for my mum I wouldn't be getting out of bed or eating during this pandemic. Which sucks because after 6+ years of fighting this never ending battle of my shitty mental health, I was in a place where I was happy and really, truly okay for the first time in a long time. And now I am falling back into my hole, even with medication and living with my family, who have my back no matter what. 

K is clearly struggling, and I know he's a fucking sweetheart under all his shitty decisions. G, despite all this, has remained a constant in his life and doesn't want to lose him as a friend either. But tonight, somethung changed. G sent me this tect exchange between the two of them:

K: Also i no longer trust ur memory. i trust u, just not ur memory
G: what? why?
K: Cause you've said sum things that don't add up
G: explain
K: No, a lot of it is stuff that makes me uncomfortable
G: what the hell K explain please. its so unfair to tell me u dont trust something and that stuff i say doesnt add up and then not tell me anything
K: okay, fine. give me time to dig deep into my memories of things i dont wanna think about
... 
nope nope i'd rather u not like me for awhile then remember some things u said
sorry g
G: fucking excuse me what have i said that's so insanely bad
K: u never said anything bad i promise
G: if i never said anything bad then why the hell wont u tell me
K: Coz
G: not an answer
K: i remember like 2 things but they feel stupid and insignificant u hear. i know theres been other stuff as well it doesnt matter

After this, I sent him a message. Keep in mind, I've seen him treat her terribly for months. He does stuff like this, telling her she did something wrong, or he thinks she lies or gossips, and then backtracks. Usually, she isn't so direct but she is genuinley getting angry with him now. Now, my messgage was angry. I have, up until now, waited a day or more any time she shared stuff with me. To K, I have been composed and while sometimes strongly worded, never angry. My message came as an absolute shock to him. 

Me: why, why would you do smthing like that to a friend? what the hell dude, do you even recognize how fucked up that was. what the fuck dude. 

He knows she has been sharing their interactions with me, as I am the one to talk to him about why she's hurt, and what he's doing that is upsetting her or I. For months. Just so y'all know, her sharing this with me wasn't a surprise to him. G also wasn't aware I messaged him, though she wasn'y surprised. Anyways, he msged her and didn't respond to me at first.

K: i upset d again, v much 
G: what makes you say that
K: did you tell him? did you tell him?
G: yea of course i did you seriously hurt my feelings
K: yea i seem to be pretty fucking good at doing that to people
G: what the fuck did you think was going to happen when you said you don't trust my memory and that the things i say don't add up. 

I haven't seen his response to her, but he messaged me and wrote this:

K:I'm not rlly the same person i was when u first met me. I'm a person who doesn't think about how anything they say is going to hurt people. I don't deserve to have G as a friend or u. U guys have put up with enough of me for long enough. Goodbye
I enjoyed being ur friend
A lot
Me: listen dude, i dont think im gonna answer this tonight, just like i dont think i should have msged you right after G told me what was up
im too angry and worked up
i am almost always THAT angry when i speak to G about what happened and usually i wait to say anything bcuz ik my only msgs to you are gonna be angry and im not gonna communicate what i actually wanna say

I wasn't sure what to say, and I was still pissed. So I typed up a quick reply, and silenced him so I wouldn't see anything else from him tonight. I care about him so much, but I'm fucking 19 y'all. I work too much, (well, not right now), and I'm not actually his dad, or a therapist. I'm the eldest in my friend group, and I think I'm the dad-friend as much as that's probably a terrible idea. But I can't be that person anymore. I'm not this all knowing being who can save my friend. I've called suicide prevention lines, and non-emergency lines for him, I spoke to doctors and fuck, I only just got myself up on my feet less than a year ago. I just can't, but I am terrified I'm going to lose a friend because I can't take care of him in the way he needs. He's spent months asking me why he's still alive and here but fuck, I don't even know why I'm still alive. 

Listen, this may only serve as a venting post but jesus christ, if anyone has any advice I'm lost, and honestly scared. I don't talk about how I'm feeling, and at this point it's a constant state of anxiety, wondering if K is harming himself, dead or just emotionally abusing G. I'm all ears, (eyes....?) and if you have any questions let me know. 

Sorry for the long fucking post, and my lack of grammar or spell checking, it's all up to auto-correct and god at this point. I hope everyone is staying safe and mentally well during these times. 

TLDR
My friend, 17, is having a mental health crisis and is treating our mutual friend like shit. I, 19, am losing him as a friend because I can't shoulder his life's problems. What the fuck do I do?",16Apr2020,1
443,"I have recived all my decisions I got into almost every school I applied to ( coast guard academy, merchant marine academy, and recived a full ride to syracuse university with an Air force Rotc scholarship. I also got into every instate school and recived full coverage of tuition for nau.) Around my junior year of highschool I rember talking to my uncle, who was an engineer for Budweiser and spends his time flipping houses and managing his properties, I asked him how he managed to do so well for himself. He told me that it was a combination of hard work and intelligent investing. He told me to read the book rich dad poor dad  so I did. After reading that book my passion for finance and investing consumed me. I took a lot of my money and invested it into the stock market ( p.s I my money has grew 12%). My plan for life is to get a high paying job and continue investing my money. I hope to one day have enough money to buy a duplex and rent out the other half to establish cash flow. I also want to own a number of other rental properties. I realize that having a high paying job earlier in life will allow me to achieve my goals.

 I have always had an interest in serving, but am not sure how service will fit in with my life plan. No one in my family was in the millitary, but a very close family freind was in the air force and told me that it was one of the best experiences of his life and provided him with so many opportunities down the road. My parents are very irresponsible with money as such I have no college fund and my relationship with my parents is very rocky. Once I graduate they want me out of the house. I decided to apply to the millitary academies and rotc, because it will provide me with the many opportunities and help me pay for college and pursue a career i have been interested in. 

Truth be told I am hesitant to accept these offers. I realize that millitary service is a huge commitment and may not be right for me. I can imagine myself as an officer, but realize I will be giving up completly diffrent life I cant experience. I guess I want to know if the connections and training I will recive while serving could help me get a high paying job down the line. I am confused on how much money I will make once I commission as an engineer/officer. I belive that the leadership skills and technical education I will recive will help me become successful later on. Is joing the military a smart fincial move and do you think I should take the opportunities that I have been granted? Also will I still be able to pursue my interest in real estate while in the millitary? 

1. Coast guard academy (their engineering is top teir and when I am serving in the coast guard the odds of me being serving near shore is higher than most of my other options)  after graduation I will serve 5 years active duty and 3 in the reserve.

2. Merchant marine academy ( they specialize in the maritime industry and graduates can choose to serve in the maritime industry or commission in any other branch of the millitary and some have even gone to become FBI agents or join the DHS. I am interested in the maritime industry, but am concerned about the current state of the maritime industry and I dont know how well I will respond to being on a boat for 6 months out of the year. The benefits is that graduates make anywhere from 80k to 100k and are guaranteed a job. I am leaning toward this option because I could make a lot of money out of college and still play an important role in maintaining the economic security of the u.s.) 

3. Syracuse or instate school with air force rotc ( I will recive room, board, a monthly stipend, and full tuition as well as have the opportunity to live a more civilian lifestyle.)

4. I could go to NAU as a civilian where my tuition is covered but not room and board plus not as many opportunities to make connections and not as many opportunities. 

5. I could go to an instate school and take out loans.

6. I could go to instate with rotc then transfer to embry riddle.",16Apr2020,1

449,"Kinda a long post but I really need advice,

So I've had this friend for about 2 years now. Let's call her ""A"".
""A"" and I had always been like polar opposites, her being bubbly and extroverted, and me being more shy and introverted. 

Now I never had a problem with this until she started changing in our first year of high school. 

""A"" started getting into boys and started dressing differently.
She started caring more about her looks and started to date these guys who weren't good for her.
I never understood it (I'm a guy)
I figured that was a stage she would go through and that it wouldnt effect us as friends.
Until this whole quarantine shit.

She started becoming more bubbly and annoying.
Now normally I was okay with it, yeah it annoyed me but that was just her personality. 
Until ""A"" was wanting to call all the time and wanting to play video games all the time. Now I understand that since she doesnt come from the greatest household that she'd want to distract herself or just be constantly talking to people.
But her being that clingy was getting to me. And I wasnt the only one feeling like that.
My boyfriend, who's also apart of our friend group said that she was getting annoying aswell. It even sounded like our other friend ""B"" was getting annoyed as well.

""A"" spammed our gc and would call every night. Now I always had enjoyed her company but now shes become like a chore to me.
Shes even left our gc (multiple times) and made long paragraphs to me (and me only) about how I was a bad friend and I wasn't there for her.
She'd say things like ""I'm always there for you and your never there for me.""

""A"" just found out that shes moving, and I don't know what to do.

I know I should be talking to her more but, with all of this drama and how shes become like a chore to me, I dont even want to talk to her. If I'm going to talk to someone, I want to enjoy it. But I dont enjoy talking to her anymore.

Am I being a bad friend? Am I in the wrong for feeling annoyed with her?",16Apr2020,1
450,"Long ass post sorry....

Some background ‚Äî I have grown up in a severely abusive household my entire life, my dad I believe is bipolar and flips from one mood to the other at the drop of a hat. He‚Äôs physically abused my mum her whole life, she‚Äôs been with him since she was just 15 years old. I have 3 other siblings and each of us have copped the brunt of his physical abuse over the years too. But his psychological and verbal abuse is the worst of it all. He calls my mum every name under the sun on a daily basis, makes everything out to be her fault. He particularly picks on me because I‚Äôm tired of his shit and always stick up for my mum. He‚Äôs told me numerous times ‚Äúbetter luck next time when trying to kill yourself‚Äù, he calls me names, belittles me. Honestly, it is the most toxic place I know. Yet I‚Äôve managed to get to the age of 20, I‚Äôve had enough now. I can no longer go on listening to my mum tell me over and over again that we‚Äôre all gonna get out. I‚Äôve been told that for as long as I remember. 

So this brings me to my massive dilemma, a place has come up to rent that I would absolutely love to live in with just me and my dog. That‚Äôs all I want. I‚Äôve been looking at moving out for months now, but every time I try and ask advice or even dare bring it up my mum shuts down and says what a shit person I am, tells me I‚Äôll never survive out there in the ‚Äòreal‚Äô world. Which obviously it worked on me, because here I am. Still in the same position that I‚Äôve always been. 

I have been in such a good headspace lately, the best I‚Äôve been in years. I feel good, I‚Äôm happy for the first time in years. I‚Äôve got a great job. Because of all this corona virus at the moment, my mum lost her second job. So I am currently working and giving my mum $600 a week to put on her mortgage so that the bank does not foreclose on our house and take it away. Obviously this benefits me too, because I have a roof over my head. But my dad is getting worse and worse, he smashed our tv the other night and is starting to escalate more and more. I am in such a good place right now and I just need out. I can‚Äôt live here in this house anymore. Being verbally abused by my own father every day that I wake up. My mum lost her bundle that I put an application in on the rental that I found, told me that I‚Äôm a piece of shit that‚Äôs just leaving her high and dry with no way to pay her mortgage. That what‚Äôs she gonna do now without my money. 

I might sound selfish, but I want me making this step to move out to tip my mums hand and make her finally break away from my dad too. She can afford to rent an apartment with my other sister. But apparently that is not good enough for her. She just doesn‚Äôt want any kind of solution to her problems whatsoever. 

I just want to ask, do you think I‚Äôm in the wrong? Moving out whilst my mum is relying on my payments for her mortgage?",16Apr2020,2
451,"Since about a year ago I've been receiving phonecalls from a private number. I can't block it because the number is blocked from the caller side.

The first time he called it was the middle of the night, my SO wasn't home and it was very early in the morning, in my sleepy state I pickes up assuming it was my SO. 
There was alot of panting and some words, mostly sexual. After that call I stopped picking up but it didn't help.

Sometimes it goes weeks without a call, sometimes I wake up to 12 missed calls in the morning.
My SO often works away from home so I'd like to have my phone volume on in case he needs to call me, but I just can't assume this person is going to disrupt my sleep at odd hours. 

We tried everything, letting my SO pick up, whistling loudly into the mic, just picking up and leaving it.

I don't really want to take a new number, for unrelated reasons. But at this point I don't know what else to do anymore.

455,"So about a month ago me and this girl started dating and we like each other. We FaceTime call every night on Snapchat and sometimes twice during the day as well(because the coronavirus). We sometimes call just to enjoy each other‚Äôs company and vibe. It‚Äôs a good relationship we got going on so far.

But recently a week ago she told me she was on good terms with her ex and she never told me he called her the night before to see if she wanted to date again(she of course said no). I was understandably concerned with this and felt jealous. Due to this I told her I was on good terms with my ex as well, that me and her are best friends even cuz I thought we just telling each other the same thing anyways yanno?

To clarify I do not have feelings for my ex/bsf because I‚Äôve moved past from those feelings for my current girlfriend but once I told her she got jealous and confused because I would talk bad about my ex to her(my ex only wanted to be friends and never told me to save hurting my feelings, was confused and kept flirting with other guys. Sometimes people work best as friends). So she suggested that we both block our exes from Instagram and I was agreeing with it at first but then I was skeptical cuz my ex/bsf is complicated and ik how she is with her emotions and how out of control they get cuz she has bipolar disorder and panic attacks at night and she‚Äôll say things she don‚Äôt mean and will later apologize to me for her behavior.(this is how she reacted to me blocking her beat for beat).

I blocked her cuz it was too much stress from her getting mad at me and getting jealous of me and my girlfriend even tho she was talking to some other dude at that time.So 1 hour later she had her friend apologize for her(I blocked all her other accounts) for telling me things that I didn‚Äôt like. I forgave her because she went thru a lot of effort to apologize to me but I told her the reasons I blocked her and told her we couldn‚Äôt talk no more and that maybe one day we can be friends again but for now I had to focus on my current gf and my future and that she should too. 

Her friend said she told her everything I said but I never heard what my ex/bsf said after I told her. And it has currently been 1 week since I blocked her. So rn I‚Äôve been thinking what she said and how what I told her affected her because she removed all her posts and private her Instagram account. Did she actually think about her mistakes and wants to make change? Does she hate me for what Im doing for myself? Does she actually understand what I said and forgives me for making the decision I made? The suspense is killing me and I‚Äôm wondering how she is doing for some reason.

Somehow, when he's attacking me, I'm to blame and I'm the one who's told to calm down or drink a chill pill, or whatever the phrase of the day is. 

I'll clarify anything in the comments, but what can I do?

458,"Long story and I'm writing from a mobile device so sorry if I've missed anything. Also my first post I think?

So to start at the beginning, I (F25) grew up in an awful environment and there was lots of violence and various forms of abuse. I was abused first by my ""father"" who left when I was 8, then my ""mother"" and brother, then eventually my mother's partner. This wasn't just violence, there was a mass of psychological, financial and emotional abuse. For example, my ""mother"" would have little tests for us (she would hold these tests in her head and we wouldn't know about them) and if we failed or didn't do as she expected we were severely punished. I would have most of my income taken away and then would locked out the house for a few nights with no money to look after myself. All of this abuse caused me to obviously go into a mass depression which I continue to suffer with, anxiety, self harm and suicidal ideation. It also caused physical effects which only stopped when I met the love of my life who got me out that terrible place.

Needless to say when I moved in with my now FH I cut all contact. I'm now at a point with my partner where we are currently buying a house together, it will be a house filled with love and cherished memories. 

Here's where I get to my point. 

I love going to his parents house and looking at their photos, especially seeing him grow up and their family days out. It also makes me sad because I would love to combine our pictures together so that as we grow oldee we can look through them. 

What I'm asking is. What should I do to get my photos from my ""mother""? Or do I cut my losses and just live with it?

Thank you for any and all advice

460,"my mom and i have always had an insanely complicated relationship. i can‚Äôt remember it enough to say much about it. sometimes i can remember but most of the time those memories are locked off from myself. some say she was emotionally abusive and i tend to let that color my judgement of our past. but i know you only see what you‚Äôre looking for. and i KNOW there was good. i loved her so much. i was a mommas girl until the very very end. it broke my heart to walk away from her but the constant fighting was getting to be too much. the driving for hours screaming at each other. her breaking down and crying. me doing the same. the nights she would lose herself in a bottle because she knew she was losing me. but that was towards the end. when i was younger we argued and fought a lot too. but not so much. but even then i was alone. probably too much. she spent a lot of time in the backyard with a cigarette in her hand not letting me outside. but we slept together always. i was a mommas girl despite everything. even when we had two bedrooms we‚Äôd fall asleep on the same couch. it was like that until i moved out. that was freshman year of highschool. moving out nearly broke me. but not right then. right then i was okay. i withstood the begging. the calls with her crying saying she missed me. the first christmas without her and her crying into the phone and me screaming my lungs out in the rain at her because i was so tired of not knowing whether i hated her or hated myself or hated everything because i loved her so much but she was so bad for me. screaming in an empty public park. 
anyways about 6-12 months after i moved out was when the i miss her and the guilt REALLY kicked in. it hurts 
shit was rough. 
but overtime i healed 
i‚Äôm not totally better i‚Äôm not over it even now like five years later because she‚Äôs my mom. 
and i want to completly cut her out of my life because it hurts so much. because i feel bad for her. 
because she loves me so much but i don‚Äôt want to help her or let her in. 
because she‚Äôs homeless and family has tried to help but she has this way of pushing people away because she‚Äôs entitled and screams and pushes people too far even in their own homes. 
my aunts have let her stay with them before but always she ends up escorted out by the police. because that‚Äôs just what she‚Äôs like. 
if i give her rides she asks for money or shows me to her homeless friends or we argue. 
honestly when we argue it‚Äôs better because i feel justified for not answering her calls for the next however long i can take it. 
when we don‚Äôt fight when i pick her up for lunch and all goes well it hurts because i love her and i hate to see her like that but i can‚Äôt fix it. 
and i know i can‚Äôt heal with her in my life like this. 
halfway in halfway out. 
disappearing for months just to pop up again asking for a favor. 
and then if i say no i get the i hate you‚Äôs the i hope you dies. the words spoken in anger that i know she doesn‚Äôt mean but they still hurt. 
then she‚Äôll call again. like nothing happened asking for a new favor. 
it‚Äôs a cycle it repeats. 
i‚Äôll hold off seeing her for months but eventually crumple because she‚Äôs my mom and she loves me and i feel bad that she loves me so much and i can‚Äôt love her back like that because i don‚Äôt see her as a mom really anymore but i kind of do. 
i‚Äôm confused really. 
but the big problem is i‚Äôd feel guilty forever if she died wanting to see me. and i didn‚Äôt go see her. 
this was always a small possibility because she‚Äôs in her late fifties and homeless and really doesn‚Äôt treat her body very well. but recently she‚Äôs been diagnosed with lung cancer and it‚Äôs a real possibility now. and she keeps asking for favors and i‚Äôm torn between standing my ground and saying no or doing it. because i KNOW she‚Äôs milking the whole i have cancer thing which i know. i know she does. but that doesn‚Äôt mean she gets everyone suddenly waiting on her hand and foot like she seems to expect. 
i‚Äôm. not sure what to do. 
i don‚Äôt know how to heal with her still always popping back up in my life. 
even if i ignore her she‚Äôll leave messages and call over and over and text me. blocking her number doesn‚Äôt work because she almost always uses a different phone anyways. besides. i don‚Äôt even know if i want to block her out. 
but if i see her it causes just as much pain.

She also said not everyone will understand so I can't tell people about it. I told her she's scaring, she said she's still the same person she just has true perspective.(ik this sounds wrong)  She is not really the type of person to suddenly become overtly spiritual like this, we may talk about how big space is and how if we die did we truly exist and stuff like that but after that we would laugh it off, and go do dumb stuff.

Now he wants an object from eBay, a huge object they won't send because of quarantine. He went to the bank and the lady who worked there did everything wrong and didn't put the money on my card to shop online. I tried to do it from my computer and the app/account doesn't work. So obviously my dad gets mad at me and blackmails me into not helping me when I'll need something in the future, as he always does. 

Fun fact, he wants me to go out and put the money in the card from another shop, if police stops me I'll have to pay a fee (300 euros) for it. Why can't he just wait? He always gives orders and want them done as soon as possible.

Both my parents with any kind of argument give me the cold shoulder and stop talking to me and start criticising me with the other (btw I'm a decent person, not agreeable - but so are they- but still did everything right in my life).

468,"I‚Äôll try to keep it very short and simple so that you guys don‚Äôt have to bother too much. 

Me and my girlfriend (27&amp;25 y/o) are together since 3 and a half years now. 

She‚Äôs the most caring person I‚Äôve ever met. She‚Äôs very loyal and I fully trust her in our relationship. She‚Äôs career orientated and also objectively very good looking (although she‚Äôs not my type completely).

But there are quite some issues I have with her character that now since we moved together show off very hard. She‚Äôs somewhat egoistic and stubborn to a point you cannot discuss any issue with her without her ending up crying and making arguments like a teenager OR just completely under digging my criticism or Problem by completely devaluing it. Making it completely impossible to be my own person since if I don‚Äôt come as her pleases the arguments and problems slip in in no time.

TL:DR for that paragraph: if I don‚Äôt play exactly as she wants (including absurd things like ‚Äòhaving a nicer facial expression‚Äô) she starts to be upset about everything and the biggest issue is her inability to take in criticism and at least try to work on it or even acknowledge it. 

The other issue is that her parents are just annoying beyond imagination. Shortly put her father still try‚Äôs do control her in every way and her mother is the most sassiest grumpy ol‚Äô b*tch I‚Äôve ever met. This woman would judge a newborn child for eating with its hands. The thing is she adapts more and more characteristics from them both and I‚Äôm kinda scared that one day she will be their mini me. 

I just feel like sometimes I‚Äôm asking for too much since I‚Äôve had way way worse experiences with women. At least she‚Äôs not a cheater, she‚Äôs generally funny, she‚Äôs not disrespectful, she‚Äôs fair in a lot of things, she supports me in my life choices (kinda) and doesn‚Äôt ask for much besides the mandatory things.

I became ridiculously insecure from the constant shit thrown at me and it still affects me everyday. My parents wanted to keep my hostage literally (talking rationally doesn‚Äôt help, ive tried for years) so I sneakily moved out with ny boyfriend. They weren‚Äôt even angry!

My relationship with my parents has gotten so much better now that I left, but I cant escape the harassment. And I know someones gonna tell me ‚Äúthey just care about you and love you‚Äù OK but when I was depressed, suicidal, easily irritable, distant, cold, and anti social my whole teenage years because of them were they worried about me then?

I do have a nice room at my parents house and obviously them to take care of me, i think im mostly trying to get my youth back and not waste my young adulthood too.

But when in public, there is always people that give us dirty looks or sometimes people tell us (sometimes they have yelled at us) to speak English or go back to our country.

I confronted her politely and she just started ranting about how we ""don't even belong here anyway"" and should go back to where we came from.

Even from since I was a young child I was the only non-white kid and the other kids and teacher would say racist things to me. But back then I accepted it and only realised later that I should've stood up for myself.

Nothing too serious (at least the fight itself), but during the fight the other person slapped the top of my head a few times. Initially I thought nothing of it, but the following lesson I noticed a mild headache, that later developed into a REALLY bad fucking headache. I saw the nurse and lied to her saying that I was just feeling unwell about an hour later without mentioning what happened because if my mother found out someone hit me she would go crazy. 

I only experienced one symptom of concussion that needs to be checked out (aside from migraine of course) and that was vomiting. A lot of it, too. Like I couldn‚Äôt eat or really stand up without being sick. I fell asleep that night (I didn‚Äôt know what to do at that age) and woke up feeling a lot better. I still only had a light headache, but I could eat and move and do everything I could usually do. 

I read another story recently about how someone experienced a minor concussion after hitting their head died in their sleep thinking it was nothing and it got me worrying and I found that if you experience vomiting during a concussion to report to ER immediately. I spoke to my gather about it recently and he told me that it was nothing to be concerned about and that the body is more resilient than given credit for, though I still worry.

I don‚Äôt know if I have any symptoms of anything now (I‚Äôve always had tinnitus so I‚Äôll rule out ringing in the ear), and not blurred vision but I see thousands of little dots when I focus or remember they‚Äôre there (especially in the dark). Could that be associated with concussion?

The university is on the other side of the continent and I went there all alone after a very painful breakup and PTSD of being abused by my previous partner who also lives in the same city. My mom knows nothing of the abuse part.

The year started off well, until my ex partner started stalking me and trying to turn my newly acquired friends against me. That really affected me and my mental health and I could not pass any exams from the first semester. I am currently in the second part of the semester and I am still struggling to collect enough credits to go into the second year. I recently got advised to get checked for ADHD as one of my classmates noticed some symptoms, but the country‚Äôs healthcare system is kind of complicated and my only option is to get treated at my home country (I did however do an examination with a doctor who evaluated that I do have 90% of the symptoms but cannot proceed with the assessment). I believe this also really affected my study results, as it is very hard for me to sit down and focus to study. 

I finally tried to get my shit together and passed two exams with so much of my blood sweat and tears, but I have no motivation to keep going - I suck at mathematics and i dont enjoy what I study at all. Every time i try to bring it up while talking to my mom she starts talking about how much money she has invested in me and how I cannot miss out on such an opportunity and if I do I will regret this my whole life &amp; etc.

What I just really want is to apply to an university in my home country, and get my Bachelor‚Äôs degree from there. It might not be as good as my current school, but I will feel more complete there as I have not made any meaningful relationships in this country, I‚Äôm unhappy and the living expenses stress me out and make me feel guilty for my mom. I believe after that I can get a Master‚Äôs degree from a good university abroad, but I‚Äôm just not ready to be a fully functioning adult. 

I would really appreciate any advice on how to approach my mom and have this conversation with her or any advice on what I should do even, any motivation can help me at this moment. Thank you!",16Apr2020,1
494,"**How do i deal with family issues like this.? especially during quarantine.**

&amp;#x200B;

**I would like an unbiased opinion about this story.**

Minor Disclaimer : it does involve a fight. So if you do get triggered easily, do not read.

It starts off around noon, where the issue was seeded but it didn't grow until later in the evening. Where things erupted.  Around 12 o'clock, my sister asked me to stop by the grocery store to get some grapefruits for my mother. When she asked me I barely made a decision as to whether I would like to go or not , as I was feeling pretty down and kinda weak,  as I paused . My mother immediately yells, forget it, this girl is hassid. ( Which means evil in our language.) I said I would go afterwards, however I didn't bother to tell my mom when she never asked me in the first place to go.  A few hours later, and to to be brutally honest with you I really did not want to go out for her once she started calling me names. How do you expect a person to do you a favour and you want to verbally abuse them? I am certain it does not work like that.  Because I was between going based on its my mother, 2 I shouldn't go because I'm literally being played with emotionally.  Long story short, I end up going.

Although the grocery store is not to far from my home, the bus takes time. And because of COVID-19 I am really careful of my surroundings, especially with people.  I was unable to take one bus because there was a rider on the bus whom had an extreme cough, so I chose to wait on the 2nd  bus's arrival .  After the wait I finally got on to the bus and was on it only for a few stops till I arrived to my destination. The plaza.  As I was heading near the grocery story I seen the line up, it was pretty long. So opted out to pick up some stuff from a next store next door, thinking perhaps by the time I get the other things over there maybe ill get back to a line up that's not too long.  Not longer than 10-15 mins I go back to the grocery store and the line didn't really move much so from this point I make the decision to go home.

I entered the house, and sort was excited to show my sister what I had purchased for her since she kind of got into baking I thought it would be a help for her.  I told her about the grapefruits, and what happened as I tried to get the grapefruits. ( \*\*\* looking back at this a day a later, its kind of crazy why this even started. My mom is very manipulating. seriously. )

I put the stuff I brought which was parchment paper( for her ) and I when I had purchased this I seen some cookie mix so I picked those up.( Thinking it may be fun, baking isn't always a thing in this house in the first place so change is nice) .

&amp;#x200B;

My sister was busy, which I had clearly seen-- and clear for anyone to see she was, busy. Prepping chicken.

at the time I was a little excited to see how the cookies would turn out so I read the cookie packet's directions on how to make them. For me, it takes time to focus and concentrate. And so when there people around me talking or sounds of any kind, it can be quite difficult.

I asked her to stop talking.   (and to be mindful, its not so hard to see that I was doing something. There was a clear lack of mindfulness from her at this moment)

&amp;#x200B;

She continues, I ask her multiple times. ( At this point I knew she was looking for problems when she literally kept dragging on, and was looking for things to emotionally hurt me)

At this point I was beyond annoyed, and frustrated. I thought to myself how inconsiderate are you.

As this was going on my mom was just watching. And I always wonder why she doesn't just get involve and say stop. This is not the firs my mother has done this, this in itself enables her behaviour.i looked at her like wtf.

So I called her (my sister) out for it. I was fed up. and there is no way that im going to take this B.S to be normalized in this home.  Truth got her angry and riled her up to continue fighting.  not once, but about 4 times. on all four times she laid hands on me first.and not only that she threw a plate which broke and demanded that I clean up her mess. As if.

Now the only time my mother decides to roll in to stop the fight is to say, ""not in my house. if you want to fight go outside to fight.""  And as she said this she kept saying to her take my phone. Because I never felt safe there was a point in time where I decided to record for my own safety.  and to clear the constant lying of her filthy behaviour. I was hoping shed stop.

One of her items got damaged in the process in our fight.. From this she requested I pay for it. Mind you, she has broke a few things of mine, that didn't occur on this day except for my new glasses-- the old glasses were on a different day, which I never asked her to pay for.  I recently got a pair of glasses, I bought these because my old frames which I had carried for a about a year were broken, she damaged those ones and snapped my new ones. ( Total combined its more than the amount that she had purchased for her item. )  Going back to when she asked me to pay for it, I offered to e-transfer her.  She kept saying go to the store. I said I am not going to the store, till I have my glasses back. ( they were not broken yet at this point) . I said, No. Not only did she have my new glasses,( at this time they weren't broken yet )  she even took my broken spare glasses.

My mother, who is just watching this unfolds, batters in and says this girl is so hassid. Picks a side already. and when I ask my mother to ask my sister or at least tell her to return my things back, she says ""I don't care.""  I asked her again, no result.

I call my sister out on her behaviour, and tbh the kindest words were never said. SO im not going to pretend like I never swore.  Every single time there is a fight and its crazy to say but how my mother feels about her kids ultimately results in the conclusion. She doesn't give an absolute fuck for justice no matter how hard I fight for the peace to remain in this house. Its quite disgusting to me.

Late last night I thought about asking my step-dad to help me. Even so asking him to do this is not a great look. But if not him who? I asked my other sister, who does not live in this house to help me out. And she isn't much of a help. She literally said call the police, it doesn't make sense to me for the police to be involved. its a waste of time. When it could be handled easily, however she does not want to act right.

back to asking my step-dad for help -&gt;  I know for a fact if I ask him to help, my mother will say why did I ask him for help. Like am I being a bother if I do? To ask for help? when to begin with all she could've done to deescalate the situation was to tell her to stop doing what youre doing. Literally.

Like this is not normal.  I knew she was looking for an issue the moment she kept rambling on how I should speak and commanding me to talk a certain way to please her. If you're asking for something just ask nicely, is my point.  Kept verbally jabbing me instead.

&amp;#x200B;

\-

Still don't have my phone.

she has not returned it, and she also turned my phone off. ( I tried calling it off my laptop and it seems like the FaceTime audio is down from that device. )

I would like to ask my step-dad. And I'm afraid of the possible outcome of that at this point. 

\*UPDATE- step dad probably, and most likely would not help.  I remembered he also allowed her behaviour once, and did not step into help. Most of these incidents happen when either no one is home and she literally corners me. ( but on that day before I headed off to work, I later found out in the evening that my step dad was home but didn't come out to help me when she yelling at me and beating me.) 

what do I do ? ( I got my phone back. but now I guess my advice question has changed. Cause clearly I do not want to be taken for granted to no more here. Its sickening.)

And I have been through cancer 3 times before, almost completely alone. I was a foster kid, and became one because my family isnt capable of taking care of my medical care. I've been medically emancipated since I was 16, and it's been so unbelievably difficult being alone and constantly fighting for my life. But now, I've built myself a small but supportive family, my bestfriend and my boyfriend mainly. And now back to my current situation, I'm the girl in the plastic bubble level of isolation. Completely alone even from my roomate. Except from a care team who comes in PPE and admististers treatment to me. I'm alone and living through hell in my own body. The thing is I wasn't supposed to be alone this time, I wasnt supposed to have to be alone now. And I'm sad and terrified and in so much pain its not funny. I'm scared, and I cant be with the man I love. I cant have someone get me water and give me a bath, or someone to just hold me as my body is wrecked by treatment. And I'm angry....and I feel selfish and horrible about that. So many people are suffering right now, and in my day job I help people. And I work in the medical field. And I'm not able to help, and people I know and love are in danger and fighting for their lives. But...so am I.

503,"I have no idea why but I always say something so insensitive or bad , it hurts them. It has been happening so often now ( thrice a week almost).

Beginning of this week , mom asks me to do laundry, but I make an awful face and say ""Ughhh okay fine"" and she gets mad at me. Gets super mad at how I don't want to though I was already heading towards the washing machine.

2nd time: I said how dad doesn't do the dishes before mom has to make lunch and that is why I am not able to put the dishes back in the drawer in time. Mom dad get mad at how I keep commenting. The same night mom said I can be so insensitive that I don't see the sacrifices she has made for me and my sister. And that I am very selfish.

3rd time (today): Mom asked me to upload my sister's homework (she's 12 yo) on a link shared by her teacher. It was taking time and she asked me What's wrong and I am stupid enough to reply ""nothing wait"" and she gets mad at that about how she asked me for help and I am being pricey and selfish. I uploaded her homework and she asked me to teach it to my sister. I told her that I will need to upload the homework again on the same link to teach her, she got mad again that I am making excuses and I have lost my respect to my younger sister.

At the end, I really feel that either my hormones are going off the board and if I cant say something nice, then I shouldn't say anything. Though I have noticed this only happens when I get too comfortable and relaxed around them. 

I really hope someone can help me figure out what's wrong with me? I do like kissing my mom on her cheek and hugging her, but she avoids it saying she hates it when I do it because I can be so mean and insensitive sometimes. She told me that I might have bad relationships if I don't learn how to talk to people.

508,"This is probably going to be a slightly longer post as I need to explain everything that's happened since lockdown.

My mum has been emotionally and physically abusive to me (18F) in the past but when I was 14, I told the child protection officer at school and they had a meeting with my mum and she stopped the physical abuse. The emotional abuse has been the same but recently it's been amped up. She doesn't let me close my bedroom door unless it's to sleep, and even then she'll leave it open when she wakes up. She confiscates my phone every night and reads through my WhatsApp messages. I have snapchat and Instagram but I can log out of those. Recently she's been asking me for my passwords to those and also to my Facebook. Her logic behind it is that because she pays for my phone, she gets to snoop through my messages even though I'm 18. I try to keep in contact with my friends, but every time she hears/sees me on the phone with them she gets extremely passive aggressive. She doesn't say anything to me directly but she'll start slamming doors and walk around with this angry look on her face. She also controls basically everything about my day. What time I wake up, when I sleep, when I eat, even what I wear and what times I can shower. It's humiliating and I feel like I can't say anything to her because a) she's my mum and b) its not like she hits me anymore.

Other than that, before lockdown, I was never allowed to go out with my friends and if I did would have to ask her permission a few days before. She also searches my room when I'm not home (I know this because all my school work, books etc are moved out of place and the only person home is her)

I don't know if this counts as abuse of any kind and if so, what I should do about it. I have a younger brother and she doesn't to any of this to him. She doesn't check his phone and he doesn't need permission to go out. I feel suffocated being here all the time due to lockdown. I applied to university 5 hours away to get away from her, but because my A level exams were cancelled, I'm anxious about whether or not I'll get in. 

I don't know what to do, or how to cope, my mental health is deteriorating and I unfortunately had a relapse back into self harming. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you all so much.",16Apr2020,4
509,"I know this is probably a very common topic and I apologize for repetitiveness but I feel that personalized response towards me would do me a lot more help than reading some advice given to somebody else I also realize that there is no quick fix or solution to this problem but I think that maybe people that are or have been in similar situations could at the least provide some helpful input.

Starting off I'm sorry for such a long post but I would like to give an in depth explanation to my situation and mindset, I realize that everybody has an equal opportunity to be who they want to be and do what they want to do but no matter how much I try to persuade, nag, motivate, or any other variation I just never seem to stick with changes if I even start at all. 

I have always been pretty lazy and growing up I was always a chubby kid but never too extremely or unhealthily and then when I was about 14 I started smoking marijuana often which then turned into daily, and I would like to say now I don't agree or disagree with adults legally indulging in marijuana but I definitely don't agree with minors doing it and I personally don't see a point for the average person to do it either. 

But anyways it actually was pretty good for me I started hanging out with a  small group of friends some new some old and it was the start of the summer so we would hangout every day from morning till night, my friend with a car would pick us up and we would go do outdoors stuff and by the end of the summer I was for the first time ever in extremely good shape. 

School came back around and two of my friends went back to school but one of my friends and myself just quit going but still every day he would pick me up and we would go to the gym and I started working out different muscles and I was so happy with who I was.

We eventually got caught and I got put on probation I wasn't that sad about the pot and just quit smoking no problem but about 3 days later I had the worst feeling in the entire world and I thought I was having a heart attack I made my mom rush me to the hospital and I even started tensing up and couldn't move and the doctors were certain I was actually going into cardiac arrest, turns out I had my first anxiety attack ever and I went home after they gave me some anti anxiety meds. 

The next day I started feeling it again and even though I knew it was anxiety I was still extremely scared, I only drank a handful of times at this point and honestly wasn't a fan of it but I had some alcohol from a night with my friends left over and I knew my probation officer only tested me for weed so I drank the alcohol just hoping it would calm me down and it worked, way too well in fact, to the point where I started drinking daily, at first it wasn't that much but it quickly turned to bottles daily and my motivation to go out and be social and workout went completely down the drain. 

I was still in good shape at this point and this girl that I had a crush on for the longest time but thought I never had a chance with due to always being chubby until then saw me on facebook and saw how different I had become and we started dating, then things happened and we broke up and I became pretty depressed which on top of the anxiety and already alcohol dependency made me fall even deeper into this pit, (I'm about 15 and a half at this point and about 6 months into daily alcohol addiction) 

So things kind of stagnate for awhile just drinking and sitting at home everyday and finally I get off probation become friends with a kid whos parents let him smoke weed and I would hangout at his house every day and drink and smoke weed again, I eventually try opiates and I become addicted to those as well however the accessibility of them would vary greatly never being able to have a steady supply for more than a month thankfully. 

So then I'm about 16 and for the next 2 and a half years I just sit around drink smoke weed occasionally binge pain killers and I gain more and more weight at this point I was about back where I started not unhealthily overweight but not in good shape by any means, I get put on probation again and when I get off I smoke weed and this time around weed is what gives me anxiety so since then and still now I am not a fan of it. 

A couple more years pass to about 5 months ago and I find a steady supply of oxycodone and I started smoking it, I lose my job that I was very fortunate to get with hardly any job experience and basically only up to 9th grade school knowledge, then I can't get it anymore and I try MDMA and I of course love it too the problem is I can get it basically whenever and I have no self control I will snort grams a day if possible which is crazy because the average dose is like 100mgs and then maybe a re dose of 120 a couple hours later and then people will take a break for weeks even months. 

I am sorry for such a long post but I really need help whether it be words of advice encouragement or whatever I just need to get out of this slump I want to be clean from everything drugs, alcohol, tobacco, junk food, I want to be the person that made me happy all those years ago but I just can't seem to find the will no matter how many times I've tried in all these years I just can't do it and I'm afraid I'm going to die like this. if you took the time to read this thank you and thank you even more for a reply negative or positive I understand I put myself in this position.

I try to play games own a ps4 but hardly play it because I can't play well and feel sorry and frustrated after playing as I am usually a noob(most of the time its because my net is terrible for gaming).

Should we take the leap and move to the States now and make it work, try to get any old job and live there for a year? Should we buy a house here as a stable home, get some more experience in our industries and then move in several years and either sell the house or rent it out? We have been going backwards and forwards and we just aren't sure what the best move is. Our other concern is that his family have helped us with money in order for us to afford a house and so are concious not to upset or snub them in any way.",16Apr2020,1

My hair is about shoulder length-ish now, and I've been asking my mother (since before the coronavirus thing, its not circumstance lol) if I could get my hair cut short. I've been trying to convince her for almost 6 years? And everytime I get close she tells me, ""No, I want you to be yourself, not what others want you to be."" 

I offer to pay for it myself, I offer to meet in the middle, I've tried everything I can think of. I'm kinda at my wits end.
Normally I'd be fine just waiting but with this quarantine, I'm so dysphoric and I can't go out and escape it. 

We had a little heart to heart earlier and she said that when she says no, it doesn't mean no forever, it just means not right now, but she also told me to stop asking for a haircut.

Any advice on how I can ask her to let me cut it myself? I considered telling her that during the quarentine we can see how we like it and if she doesn't like it I can grow it back out, but I'm not sure how to approach it. Please help! Thank you.

534," 

Day  before yesterday, a wonderful lady put up a beautifully crafted post on  one of the thread where she expressed her interest in getting to know  other people here on Reddit. I liked that post and hit her up and within  a few hours, she responded positively. The conversation was going  really well and due to Reddit's glitchy chat platform, we decided to  move to Snap.

Furthermore, we made  a pact of sharing our photos to get a hang of another person's being.  Since I've had bittersweet experiences before, I decided to send a  random photo from Internet, but she actually shared her own photo,  plunging me deep into regret over my actions.

When  I confessed before her, she told me how she has also had bad  experiences in the past and I've broken the covenant of trust. I tried  to convince her of the rationale behind my actions,but to no avail.

She later blocked me from all platforms.

I believe that my past experiences continue to dictate my present actions and made me inadvertently break someone's trust today.

535,"So when I was in my first year in middle school, my brother was mentally unstable, he had a big shock and that caused him a lot of mental damage. That year, my dad suddenly had to work in a far away place so it was just me, my brother and my mom. 

My brother was so violent and aggressive, he is older than me and all the attention was given to him at that time, I was a little bit jealous but I understood that he needed it the most, as I said before he was pretty aggressive toward me, he would hit me and stuff, the problem is that I don‚Äôt remember exactly what he did to me at that time, I was pretty young and its been too many years since that cursed year. 

Well i didn‚Äôt notice anything at first, but because of the absence of my dad and what was happening everyday, i became week and was easily bullied at school, I used to be an energetic and strong kid, for some reason I don‚Äôt remember the details or most of the events that happened, but after awhile I couldn‚Äôt stand the lack of attention from my parent (it wasn‚Äôt that bad tbh, I was just jealous) and how my brother was the main subject everywhere we go, I became... weird I think ? Idk how to explain it but I would say some none-sense stuff, even lie sometimes, but what I remember clearly is that I told my mom and some members of my family that my brother abused me, well they were no consequences, I don‚Äôt even think they took my words seriously.

But after all this years, now that i‚Äôm an adult, I feel extremely guilty toward my brother, I think that I over exaggerated what he did to me and honestly I don‚Äôt even remember that period for some unknown reason, like everyone get hit once or twice by their siblings right ? And what I told them was more than that and would be considered disturbing, i dont know what was wrong with me at that time, being young isn‚Äôt an excuse, I think i‚Äôm the worst person for doing that to an already mentally sick person. 

Now I don‚Äôt know what to feel, I don‚Äôt even remember the extent of what happened, and some of my family probably see us in a weird way, my brother is still struggling really bad and Its killing me whenever I look at him, I feel so guilty, I‚Äôm the worst person.",16Apr2020,1

I need help with a very sensitive situation. 

My father is very very sick. My family is poor (in the past my dad had a heart attack and a stroke) and I'm unable to do a lot financial to help my dad. He also lives in Iowa, and I live in Colorado. I'm very heavy because I'm their only child, and I feel responsible for their care/happiness. 

My dad's illness doesn't have a name. They can't figure out exactly what is going on, and now because of the virus he can no longer go to medical appointments that have been scheduled months out. The only hope my dad had was for the appointments in Iowa city Iowa because mercy in Des Moines gave up in him. All we know is that there are masses inside of his spine, and he can no longer use his hands or arms. It's very difficult for my dad and mom to get thru each day. 

So here's where I need advice...my dad's birthday is coming up. I have no idea what to get him. He's a simple guy, and used to fish. I always got something related to his fav hobby/therapy. Now he can no longer fish, which is so depressing. All he wanted was to retire &amp; fish, and fish with me. I don't want to only get him ""sick"" gifts. I got him a heated blanket for Christmas which has really made him feel better. I want to get him a Alexa or something similar but it freaks him out. (Old hippy, ya know) 

I want it to be thoughtful, useful, and make him happy...I'm lost!

539," I‚Äôve been contemplating for a couple of days, partly because I have endless time to just think in quarantine, the idea that my ability to achieve fair results with minimal effort, is in fact a blessing, and not a curse. Of course, it comes with the great opportunity cost of never being fully satisfied with what you get, as it is only average, but then again, imagine if you wouldn‚Äôt even be able to have that.  

However, I can't help but think that maybe that's as far as I'll ever be able to get, and it's a terrible realization. I used to be a good student in high school, without trying much, but then sticking to the same way of doing, my university performance ended up being way below average. I've been stuck for years with 4 exams to pass in order to graduate, without being able to actually bring myself to put an end to it. I still have reason to believe that I have never really tried hard enough, as I have great discipline and commitment issues, but then again, what if I lack the ability to try harder altogether? 

If acknowledging the problem is the first step towards solution, how do you actually go to the next step? Why can't I put my self awareness to good use? I am not sure what answers am I looking for, but do you think it is possible to break your own cycle of self-sabotage and that with good will and your own timing, you do eventually get where you want to, or do I just need to accept that maybe my expectations aren't realistic and they don't meet my abilities?",16Apr2020,0

That was a week after second term started and I didn‚Äôt really want to go because I was worried about missing school but it was the last time I was going to see him for a while so I agreed. 

I was working on school on vacation and was fine for a while. A week after, I was sick. I had to stay home for a week even though I was scared of missing more school my parents didn‚Äôt let me go. 

After that week, I went back to school for a day and a half because at lunch I got a call from my mom without any explanation saying I had to go to the hospital (you may see where this is going). When I got in the car she told me to wash my hands and put a mask on and my twin brother was there too doing that same thing. 

I was tested for the covid and therefore had self-isolate for the rest of that remaining week until I got my results (they were negative my family had influenza A). 
The weekend during my self-isolation we got a call from the school saying though x and y we would have no school. 

I‚Äôve gotten so behind and I‚Äôm really trying to get back up there but the stress is so horrible.

543,"For context, she has confessed that she thought she liked me a few months ago. I had suspected it for a while, but ignored it since we were friends, I wasn't interested whatsoever and was already talking and invested in my current bf(17M).

I told her I appreciated her honesty, that it was okay if she was confused, but always made it clear that I loved my boyfriend, and never gave her any reasons to believe I was interested in her.

Now, I know she has gone to a psychologist when she was younger, because her mother suspected something wasn't quite right about her. She has all these weird dream and parallel universe theories she's fixated on, and still ""plays"" as if she were a  younger child when she's at home. She's also very detail oriented and remembers things very sharply (which can be creepy at times) and socially awkward. Even though I knew this, I tried to be as chill as possible about the situation because she doesn't have bad intentions and they have been waiting for an appointment for a few years now. She still has a decent amount of friends, and the whole class tries to accept her, even though we find her weird. She isn't made fun of or anything like that. All of us probably thought leaving her with no friends would make it worse.

However, today I've received a very, very, very long text from her. I had to do 5/6 entire screen scrolls (my screen is about the size of my hand) to read it. In excruciating detail, she described a dream she had about telling a few of our classmates that she thought she liked me. It was detailed to the point of her describing the entire surrounding area, how long it took for her to say it, how she was looking down and things like that. 

She said that, in the dream, she told a mutual friend that she thought that I would, even dating, consider it for at least a second, followed by her saying ""something I believe would happen in this parallel universe"" or something to that effect. 

I try to a very tolerant and understanding person, but I think this has surpassed all of my limits. I don't know why she thought it would be a good idea to text me that, or how she thought I would react, but I feel like my relationship isn't being respected, as well as extremely weirded out. I mean, she always tells us about her dreams in fairly long texts, but I don't think this is okay.

I have no idea what to respond. We have group projects together and I don't want to be unfair to someone who clearly struggles with some kind of mental illness, but this is a bit much, right? I don't even know if I should bring this up with my bf, because he already knew that she was a bit weird when complimenting me and that she had admitted to not being sure of her feelings towards me. I think he's a bit creeped out and, tbh, I am too. What should and how should I tell her?",16Apr2020,1
544,"TLDR; New, less attractive, boyf repeatedly lied about being STI tested. I chose him for personality &amp; shared values, should I leave?


I have been in a few bad relationships before with very attractive people, with fun personalities but few morals. It has not gone so well for me as a result.

My friends said I need to be less superficial, and I have come to realise that shared values is the most important thing in a relationship.

So I ended up developing a friendship with a guy, and we eventually hit it off. We get on really well, laugh a lot, seem to have similar values. But there have been red flags, like him telling me that he pretends to have values around others.

From what I know of him, he‚Äôs got some values and possesses the ability to empathise, but of course this is a very low standard. This is just basic human decency.

Very early on I caught him red-handed lying about whether he had been tested for STIs or not. He only admitted to lying because I was able to prove he was. 

After a web of messy lies, he apologised and felt bad. But he knows how much I value honesty, and knows that lying about things like this put my health at risk. He also lied about this not only before but after sex, and I don‚Äôt know why he upheld this lie so desperately.

He is going to get tested now. But the trust is broken. I gave him a chance for his personality, rather than looks, and he can‚Äôt even be honest with me.

546,"So I live with my sister who is under 18 because long story but our mother is terrible very neglectful and unsupportive! 

The issue is that she has severe anxiety and depression so her outlook on things is very negative. She tells me that she feels alone and when she spends time on her own she feels more depressed hence why she wants to hang out with me. 

She stays in bed until the afternoon so I don't see her before then so by the time my boyfriend comes over to see me is when she wants to be there with us. So we could be sitting watching TV and she comes in starts talking to us about really negative things and her opinions on TikTok really childish things in general that don't interest me or my boyfriend. I'm a positive person so I don't wanna hear moaning and criticism about things all the time!! Also don't really know how to respond to her when it's things that don't interest  us! Kind of awkward! 

She is quite disrespectful in an ignorant way as well like kind of in her own dream world bubble. If me and my boyfriend are having a conversation occasionally she would just interrupt with something irrelevant going on about what's on TV or her phone etc! I've told her it's rude to interrupt and she apologizes but it's like she is clueless to why it is rude! 

Also she doesn't tidy up after herself or do any chores and I've forgotten how many times I've mentioned this now and does annoying things like leaving lights on! Seems petty but it all adds to the frustration! 

So yesterday my boyfriend revealed to me that he is unhappy how she behaves and he feels like she is always there and so negative. He says it's having an effect on our relationship because he feels like he is second best and she always comes first. 

Now I feel stuck and frustrated because I understand why he feels this way but I don't know how to approach this with my sister or come up with a solution? I have spoken to her about chores, being mindful of me and my house. I've suggested that she seek professional help for her mental health problems but she doesn't seem to think anything will work for her? I'm not her mother so not her legal guardian either so it feels like I'm more of a housemate but I need a bit more authority. Just do not know how to approach this because she is super sensitive also and now we are in lockdown and I live with her I don't want confrontation or an atmosphere in the home! 
I also love my boyfriend and I feel sorry for him. He was talking about maybe leaving me because of it!

This all has been building up for some time he's a very verbally abusive and manipulative man. Hasn't had a consistent job the whole time they have been together leeching off my moms hard earned money working 12 hour shifts for the NHS, and twisting her so she basically hates me and my sister now. 
He claims to suffer with depression and has tried to kill himself numerous times causing massive problems in the house but what annoys me is iv suffered with depression for better part of 3 years now and had to endure a lot happen to me in 2018 (thankfully things are looking up in life bar this) but whenever I was struggling I was told to get on with it but my moms boyfriend always got all the sympathy and care for it and she didn't give a shit about me I had to find help on mostly my own and some real good friends.

My mom told me I was a selfish, immature and impulsive person for breaking up with my boyfriend. My mom and I have never had a good relationship, but that was the final straw for me... I'm cutting her out of my life because I'm all set with everyone making me feel like a bad person all the time because I cry too much for their tastes or because I have mental problems. 

I'm really not that bad of a person. I work hard and I try my best to be a good person despite my mental health, which I guess doesn't do much because everyone still always abandons me and hates me at the end of the day.

But I'm thinking, when my lease is over, since I'm single and I have no idea what to do with my life, I should just go into the air-force. My grandfather is a Vietnam veteran and I have no future so I really don't have any big plans on what to do with myself

I'm also just really depressed and kinda wanna die, so that could either be a great idea or a terrible one. I could quit smoking weed and see where it takes me, but is not knowing what I want out of life an awful reason to serve this country?

Kind of want advice from people with experience in the military but I will take any advice because my life just feels empty and over :^)",16Apr2020,1
553,"Hey redditors. I'm 17 years old and this year I'm going to university (fingers crossed). My mom is a very controlling person and it's hard to change her mind. So she obviously is going to decide which university I'm going to. This annoys the crap out of me and has made for a lot of discussions about this.
Anyways because of this coronavirus outbreak I want to take a year off college, but she isn't letting me do that.
How can i change her mind about which university and what i just said above?
Mind you, the university I want to go to is very lenient grade wise but she still won't let me go.",16Apr2020,1
554,"So a few years ago me and my friend created a board game between two materialistic species fighting each other. I have chosen clay, and according to the opponent, ‚Äúthe weakest material of all time‚Äù as they chose Legos (it‚Äôs really Mega Bloks, he just calls it Legos). So the opponent ‚Äúleader‚Äù is pretty much a god who can withstand anything, even their troops can withstand anything. I‚Äôll provide an example, a singular troop on the opponent side can withstand 50 Nuclear Missiles on direct impact, can teleport to the other corner of the universe,  spawn anything out of existence, and even escape a black hole.

Now for my side, ‚Äúthe clay‚Äù have technology around the Iron Age (or further back) and have imperial architecture. Even in a dungeons and dragons game, one soldier from my team can‚Äôt even deal a single decimal of damage to the opponent soldiers, and if I do manage to deal damage, he will deny everything and declare victory ‚Äúby default‚Äù. I forgot to mention, he is very sensitive about his army and if anything is fractured, he will straight up and leave the game. Unfriend me, and begin spreading rumors.

Hopefully people can give me ideas on how to withstand this and I can be able to defend myself from any sort of attacks.",16Apr2020,0

558,"There is a house I pass almost everyday  that I believe someone is possibly being held captive in. The reason I think this is because:

Edit; This house is not in the type of area where people have a lot of money. But I also never see foreclosed boarded6 up homes anywhere in my town. That's why this is so weird. And on top of that, the fact that it was bought so recently- it's red flags.


-The house is maintained on the outside yet

-Almost every single window is boarded up except for a few at the top, in the back of the house that don't make sense.

-The wood boarding up the windows is brand new wood, as in not something you would see on an abandoned home. It looks like someone literally purchased it at Home Depot recently, and there are 4 bright metal studs on every corner. (It doesn't sit well when you look at it. I should have taken a picture of this house, but I only remember it as I see it. I haven't passed by it in a few days and I started thinking about it today.)

-The house blends in/is set back and you would never notice it unless you were a passenger every day on that street like myself.

-The lawn has all kind of lawn ornaments like gnomes and flamingos. Even the homes around it aren't as well ""polished"" on the outside as this house.

-On Zillow, it says the house was purchased in September of 2018, so...why would it be abandoned and boarded up?!?

I don't want to say where it is for fear that it could cause a potential victim further harm. But if I was in this person's place(if there is one) I would hope someone like me would go out of my way to help!!",16Apr2020,0
559,"I'm on mobile, so I apologize for any grammar or spelling mistakes

So, basically my BFF is really controlling and doesn't see anything wrong with ANYTHING she does. For me specifically, she makes me feel invalid and like I don't matter. She always makes decisions by herself, and whenever we're just messing around roleplaying, she makes me just stand around while she goes out and does stuff with our other friend. I don't feel like I'm important at all to her.

She'll yell at our friend because she's doing something she finds normal, and joke around with everyone in the ""close friend group"" and make fun of her because she was raised differently. She says our friend is bragging when she's just happy she got something new, and straight up says in an annoyed tone, ""I don't care"" when she's telling ME something.

She was the fourth friend I made when I moved here, and I know this isn't how a normal friendship works, but I'm unconfrontational and usually a ""people pleaser"". I don't want to make her upset, and I don't want to mess up our usual routine. I meet up with them in the morning, we talk a bit, I head outside with another friend and talk with them, then we head to class. And at lunch we all sit with each other. And with what I'm about to say, it might get confusing. So, before the pandemic, I had a crush on this girl. And my best friend became friends with her, and takes the spotlight by repeating what I kind of whispered.

Since school is closed now, I've been talking with my online friends more, and one of them had a crush on me I guess? I used to have a crush on them and they were adorable so they made my damned feelings come back. So I guess I'm in a relationship with them now? But none of my friends know yet, and still think I like this girl. Even though I don't anymore, it still wasn't okay to me that she kept saying things that I was trying to say and kind of making me upset. I still feel invalid, but at least I feel more loved with my boyfriend than I ever did with my best friend. What should I do though? Should I confront her about her behaviour, or let it continue? I want to confront her, but I can't. My boyfriend ssys I should straight up confront her, but I want to tell the rest of my friends about how she's making me feel, and ask if they could help me confront her. What should I do?",16Apr2020,8

564,"Here's the rundown to the whole situation, but it pretty much is what the title is: 

She has this flatmate, who has self-esteem issues and a dysfunctional family. This led to suicidal thoughts, that he started telling everybody in the flat(including her) about this situation. *Aah - he also kind of had a crush on her for the longest time, which doesn't help.* The flatmates, who are tired of this stuff, had started to distance themselves ever so slightly from him. 

The flatmate in question is a lot to deal with. He has a very aggressive nature. For example, there was a moment where I was over, and he punched a hole through his wall - which he later admitted to was because of jealousy. This wasn't the only time - he's being very petty. Frequently shouting out of rage at night, singing extremely loudly, and all these things that can be considered 'attention seeking'. 

The flatmates have reached out to the University's Wellbeing centre, and have reached out to the health services as well. And the flatmate in question, seems to be responsive to these - he's referring himself to these. 

My girlfriend's primary anxiety is around the fact that she's anxious that he will do something to him(which he won't, because he never has, and he never will). More than that, she doesn't seem safe in her own house - in her own environment. She is stuck with this person - something that she keeps on asking me is ""Will it get back to normal?"" She's currently at mine - which is good, but on the other hand, her own place is her own. The past 3 days in her house is just a bunch of stress that she's felt - that is a major problem. She feels alienated from her own home. 

My question is this: what do you think I can do to aid her? Can I say something? Can I do something? Any ideas? Any help is appreciated.",16Apr2020,1
565,"Hi. I'm from Argentina, C√≥rdoba. I have 22 years old, university studen. Maybe somebody who experimented problems like this can help me with a real problem I have with a neighbor. Well.. this guy is politician (and more powerfull than my family) moved with his family to the left house of mine about 2 years ago. He build his house more big, so he used our middle wall (my house was build first by plans). The problems are not just noisses in that wall, the real problem is He stole us energy by a trick and When I saw that (problems with lights and in our Energy account figures a lot of more money we spent in the use than normally). My mother goes to reclaim him and he make a deal with her for 1/8 of the total (yes.. he laugh in her face). After this, he started to parking in the front of our house, in the main entrance (is really uncomfortable shut the main door and see him all days and all NIGHTS). Well.. I leave my home for 3 months and I come back by a bad experience (I be robbed been alone) with a very confused mind and have a lot of traumatic synthoms. This neighbor wake me up me and my family all nights with the high noisses became of the shut door of his big car, so one day about a year and 6 months ago I gone to knock his door at 3 a.m. really pissed off and stay here like 30 minutes and he never leave out. When I returned to my house I talk to my mother of why I was pissed off and talk to her about why I did and she not like that. After this my mom gone to talk to him and he said some like ""I'm the king of this streets"" and he started to stalking us and me a LOT more. I never reacted to him anymore. I see him with his car stalking me in the streets... He and people who him paid knocked my door many times for stupid reasons and He wants to fight me, but he wants I react first and.. I will not react to him because he has a gun. Now he make our lifes really bad, this sucks, We not can sleep more than 4 hours, alldays he has paranoia with our normal noises and parking in the main side of the street of my house and shut REALLY F#CKING up his door in the car.

574,"So, it has been a few months since I deleted all my previous posts because I was upset with myself with the way people told me the situation I was in was all my fault, but I thought I give it another shot at advice, &amp; warning, this is going to be a very, VERY LONG post &amp; I can't think of a way to shorten it, sorry. To start, I am a 22f enrolled in a local community college, but I should probably start from the beginning with my mother.

I have grown up with my grandparents &amp; for the first 4-5 years of my life. I had seen my mother before, but only knew her by her first name, I have a clear memory of calling her by her first name &amp; that is the earliest memory I have of her. I will call her D. It wasn't until after this memory that D finally sat down with me &amp; told me that she was my mother. I don't remember much after that, I don't remember if I just took her word for it or if I went to my grandparents for confirmation or what I did, but I remember wanting to spend more time with her. I should explain, D was in the service &amp; overseas a lot. She also has two other children, my younger siblings, a boy (Z) now 20 &amp; another girl (K) now 19. She had zero custody. Z was the only one she fought for custody &amp; lost. K she put up for adoption. Me, I've had multiple different stories, from multiple friends &amp; family. I've been told she sold me for $15,000 before I was even born &amp; my grandparents found out &amp; stopped it, that she left me alone in a cradle uncovered with a fan blowing on me &amp; I was crying, my grandma said she heard me &amp; found me blue, that she left me alone with my ex step-father who was taking a bath &amp; I crawled in, &amp; grandma never trusted her for me to live with her again.

It was around age 5 that I remember always being by her side whenever she was home. The next memory I have with her, she was playing a video game &amp; I was sitting next to her on the couch watching. I don't remember saying anything, but I remember her getting angry with me &amp; she looked as if she wanted to strangle me. The next memory I have, we were in the kitchen (same day) she took ahold of my face in her hand lovingly &amp; told me I looked like my father before she dug her fingers into my face, I don't remember what happened after.

The next incident, I was around 7. I didn't know she had come home until the morning she came &amp; woke me up. She flung my door open, banging it against the wall, grabbed me by my hair, pulled me from my bed onto the floor, got in my face &amp; screamed ""good morning"". This lasted for about a week, if I remember correctly, until grandma caught her, then it stopped. I don't remember much of that visit either.

Third incident, I was 12. D said she wanted to teach me ""defense"" &amp; so she had placed me in a chokehold to the point I started to see black spots &amp; my knees hit the floor. Now, my house is very old. It makes noise, it creaks when you walk, you can be the lightest freaking person &amp; the house will still shake. My knees hit the floor &amp; this is the first time my grandfather caught her doing something.

Now, my grandfather was my best friend &amp; protector. He was also a former Vietnam Vet. He can be scary when he needs to. 

When my grandfather caught her, that was the last time she touched me to that severity. There were times where I would like accidentally step on the back of her foot (she wore flip flops like all the time &amp; I cannot walk in a freaking straight line. There have been times &amp; even now, I will be walking &amp; lose my balance &amp; go sideways &amp; have to catch myself, like a scene from the Titanic &amp; people are going sideways as it's going down, that bad, but it's not all the time), anyways, I would step on the back of her foot by accident &amp; she would get so mad, she would slap me so hard, my whole upper body would fold over &amp; I would sometimes land on the floor or she would shove me so hard into a wall, I think I've even left dents in the wall.

When I was 16, I lost my grandfather. Like I had said, he was a former Vietnam Vet &amp; so he contracted lung cancer due to the Agent Orange. When we had gotten the call, I rode up with her &amp; her (then) boyfriend (they have since split) &amp; my  granny rode up with her brother, my great uncle. D made me wait in the waiting room of the ICU section (that's where he was staying) with her bf while she went to find out what was going on. I wanted to go see my grandfather, but she wouldn't let me. It wasn't long that I heard her wailing in the hall. I went out &amp; saw her &amp; that is when I knew he was gone. I wanted to go see him, I wanted to be with my  granny, but she wouldn't let me, she took me home. Literally, as we arrived home, one of our crazy neighbors (CN) (and I mean crazy she needs meds or to be placed somewhere) found out &amp; came right over. 

D said she would handle it &amp; I hid in one of the rooms. You would think she would be, oh I don't know, responsible, smart, A GRIEVING DAUGHTER!?!?! &amp; send her home. No, she invited this woman in, entertained her for THREE HOURS before I finally came out of hiding &amp; still continued to entertain her for an additional TWO HOURS until grandma came home &amp; still DID NOT TELL THE WOMAN TO GO HOME!!!!! Later on, one of my friends (M) came over, bringing a food tray (Italians are good when it comes to the food trays &amp; thank God they are), they stayed for like 1/2 an hour to an hour saying if we needed anything to let them know, was there anything they can help with, you know the normal things you say. Grandma &amp; M's grandma go into the kitchen where there is a small table there &amp; talk, M &amp; I go &amp; talk in the room I had been hiding in &amp; she's slowing cheering me up, &amp; D &amp; CN are still howling with laughter like they had been since the woman arrived. To give some context, my grandfather died at 3 in the afternoon, CN didn't leave until about 11 that night.

Now, I should add a new character, my aunt, D's sister whom I will call AJ. THEY DO NOT GET ALONG!!! At this time, AJ had been married with one 1 child &amp; was very pregnant with her second (and I mean pregnant, she had the baby 2 weeks after the death of my grandfather). AJ came in with her family for the funeral (my grandfather didn't want her coming in because she had lost two babies prior to being pregnant with her 2nd &amp; we had one scare with this one so he didn't want her stressed). When they arrived, you can imagine the stress &amp; the hormones my aunt is under, she just lost her father &amp; she is due to have a baby. D decides to make it her goal to fight with my aunt the entire time, D even went after AJ with a pair of scissors &amp; yelled at AJ's oldest, who was 4 at the time, &amp; scared him into tears. Now AJ was also in the service &amp; she can hold her own even being so tiny (she was on the line of being underweight for the service, she wasn't anorexic she could eat anyone under the table, but she has always &amp; still is small). She fought back, but grandma &amp; I were worried about her &amp; the baby because again, she had two miscarriages before this one. Oh, &amp; the reason D went after her with the scissors, they were fighting on how to set up my grandfather's shadow box THE DAY OF THE VIEWING.

This is probably a good time to mention D does have a past. She is known in the area for STABBING ANOTHER STUDENT IN THE LEG WITH A COMPASS BEFORE HIGH SCHOOL. She's also shoved students down flights of stairs, bloodied one kid's nose because he grabbed the railing to stop himself from falling down the stair, justified her action saying he shouldn't have grabbed the railing, &amp; has also thrown her trumpet OVER an ENTIRE band &amp; halfway up a hill because the band director said something to her she didn't like.

Another incident that had happened during this day, after the first viewing (we had two) AJ, grandma, me, &amp; my one cousin who is close with AJ &amp; I went out to lunch. D, on the other hand, took some of the other family members (I think mostly my grandfather's family) to the house, they had alcohol (my grandparents DID NOT allow it in the home because of my one uncle I mentioned previously as he had quit I believe 5-8 years at that time, I don't really remember, but still he quit &amp; he was previously an alcoholic) &amp; left the cans &amp; a mess for US to clean up when we got home. We were NOT impressed.

Fast forward to my Senior Year, by this time grandma's brother had moved in after my grandfather had passed. I was excited (even under the circumstances, but he was my favorite uncle), but that had all changed the fall of my Senior Year. Grandma had gone to the hospital because of pneumonia, I couldn't drive so I relied on him. One night (it was a Thursday), I noticed something different about my uncle. He was acting weird &amp; I didn't know why, but then when I was getting ready for bed, I was in my PJs, he kissed me &amp; was running his tongue over my lip &amp; grabbed ahold of my breast. I stayed calm &amp; twisted out of his grip &amp; said I had to go to bed because of school, but I was so shaken. I messaged AJ &amp; D (I know dumb move) &amp; told them what happened. I think he was drinking because his breath tasted weird? if that makes sense? Anyways, AJ said she would handle it while D told me not to say anything because grandma needed my uncle more than my situation needed handling. I'm not going to go in detail about how I feel because you probably know how I feel.

The next day, he asked as if he wasn't feeling good like he had a headache (another reason why I think he was drunk). He took me to school, I was messaging my aunt &amp; I had told him I was going to stay at M's that night (she's like a 7 min walk away from me). When I got to school, I called AJ &amp; we talked about what happened. She said she talked to grandma &amp; told her &amp; grandma was having him kicked out of the house when she got home. I did go against D &amp; I told one of my close teachers, he took me up to the office to talk to the principal &amp; the school officer (he's with the Sherriff's department). I told them what happened &amp; the officer said there was nothing that could be done, he left no mark, he didn't rape me, I had no proof, it was my word against his. I did tell them that I would be staying with a friend until he was removed from the home &amp; my teacher had my number since he was my band director &amp; it was to find me if I were to get lost or was running late, like for all the other students. This was the Friday night Homecoming game, that is why I remember. M's grandma came &amp; got me, &amp; when M came home from the concert she went to, I told them what happened &amp; why I needed a place to stay. I ended up sleeping on their couch that night. Grandma kicked him out the next day when she came home. We didn't speak for about 6 months &amp; then we started forming some ""normal"" routine. I have since forgiven him because a) I don't need that on my conscious with everything else b) he as not tried anything before or after &amp; c) he as asked for forgiveness in the biggest way, he has placed me in his will over his son &amp; daughter who want nothing to do with him for totally different reasons &amp; they are adults (my uncle is in his mid-70s).

It was also during this year I had my wisdom teeth removed. D came in for the surgery &amp; I begged her to stay for the recovery because a) it was Christmas &amp; the last time I had seen her was for my grandfather's funeral my SOPHOMORE YEAR &amp; b) I was in pain &amp; wanted my mom, but her &amp; grandma had a fight about my mother's bf (same guy still) &amp; she left me &amp; told me she was not coming back. I remember crying. I wasn't mad at grandma, I didn't particularly like the guy either (he kept calling me his step-daughter even though they were not married &amp; D was thrilled about our ""relationship""). I know I should have done this a long time before this, but it was then I started pulling away from her. I still call her mom &amp; tell her I love her to please her, but I don't talk to her much now.

In college, after I finally got my license, I totaled the car because I hit black ice &amp; launched the car into the guard rail &amp; then 6ft in the air to crash into a hill side. I should note, Z had an accident 6 months prior. Yes, his was bad, he cut his stomach open with the seatbelt, but I need to also note, he was speeding, driving in the middle of the road, &amp; hit someone head-on. Everyone lived, but he did go to the hospital. D &amp; Z hadn't talked in 7 years... 7 YEARS. She gets the news &amp; rushes up to see him &amp; they are magically a happy family again. She bends over backward for him. I, on the other hand, call her &amp; tell what happened. This woman proceeds to tell me MY accident was not that back, that SHE has had 28 accidents &amp; knows what's bad. I shouldn't be complaining. I told her she didn't say the same to Z &amp; then she says ""Well, his was a little more serious than yours.""

I. LOST. MY. SHIT.

I lay in on her saying that she has always compared me &amp; Z, that she has always favored him more. She has done more for him than either of her daughters. She doesn't even acknowledge the youngest because K wanted to know who her father as &amp; D refused to tell her so K stopped all contact. D said K can die for all she cares, she doesn't have a younger daughter. He was the only one she wanted. I didn't understand why she didn't abort us if she didn't want us. I didn't want to speak to her ever again until she starts to act like a real mother. I hung the phone up on her &amp; tossed it across the room. She called grandma &amp; said I was being unfair &amp; that I had hung up on her. She said that she never compared her children because she would never do that since my grandparents did that with her &amp; AJ (AJ was a permie &amp; so she was sicker as a child, of course, they are going to take care of her).

I do want to note something before we move on in the story. Remember M because I'm going to talk more about her later on about something she did to me only months after my uncle molested me.

So, now, this is where we get into the college part of my story. After I graduated from high school, I started going to my local community college while still staying with grandma (since it was just the two of us). It was my second semester (Spring) that I met two brothers whom I will call J (my age so 22 now) &amp; RJ (two years younger so 20). We had three classes together that semester &amp; I ended up meeting their mom, Mrs. V, &amp; then later in the year their dad, Mr. V. I also took their classes later on since I changed my major from Anthropology &amp; Archaeology to Environmental Science. They became like my parents because that's how they acted, they had taken me home (still didn't have my license yet, but close), let me sit in their office in between classes, Mrs. V had even given me food (even though I protested), I even started going to church with them, they gave me their number to call if I needed anything (mostly it was because I had walked to church my first day &amp; it was 3 miles to get there, downhill mostly, but she wasn't impressed &amp; told me she would ""beat some sense into me if I tried it again), &amp; I called. 

The first time I had called for a non-church ride incident, it was Christmas and, of course, it had to do with my mother. Grandma &amp; I were staying at AJ's so gram could see the kids. D decided that every time she came over she would start things. To make that story short because I don't remember everything word for word, she was complaining about parking &amp; about how it was a good thing she had experience with parking in tough spots, I had made a comment about her doing the same at home jokingly, &amp; she had called me a bitch, went to hit me, changed her mind, &amp; went out to smoke because AJ doesn't allow it in the house because of the kids, mostly the youngest because of her allergies. Grandma made some comments about how she wished she could die &amp; be done with it in front of AJ, one of AJ's friends who came over to help, &amp; of course the two kids. I told AJ what happened (her &amp; her friend when to go do some quick shopping to get some things for cookies, I think).

It was after that I went upstairs &amp; called Mrs. V. I told her what happened, crying, &amp; said I needed a mom to talk to, but my problem was about my mother. She listened to me, calmed me down, &amp; made me smile. I told her I wish she were D &amp; she told me she thought of me more of a daughter than her own (she doesn't have a good relationship with her since she does drugs, is in &amp; out of jail, &amp; has lost custody of her daughter, Mrs. V's granddaughter). That was when I became closer to them than my own family.

This is also how I met Mr. A, the Chem Professor; he was good friends as well. I would like to note that I don't know how long Mr. A had been teaching, but he is the youngest non-adjunct professor I have ever met. He is the same age as my aunt (he told me that he is 38, the same age as her, that's how I remember, but hence the keywords TOLD ME), he VERY kind (I mean like chivalry is not dead kind), shy? (he never really looked at any of us when he taught, he just looked at the grown), gullible? (he seemed the type), I think you get where I'm going with him.

I had gotten to know him over the Spring semester &amp; the following school year &amp; he even helped me with some of my projects for Mrs. V (I did a presentation on Agent Orange &amp; the effects it had on the environment as well &amp; genetics, &amp; a project on different elements &amp; how well they boost plant growth), so I had gotten to know him pretty well to the point of taking his into class in the Summer.

I think you can guess by now, I didn't know my father or his family. It was around this time that I started hunting. AJ got us DNA test &amp; I found a great aunt who then confirmed who my father was (D told me &amp; brought the man for me to meet when I was 13, but with my past history with her, we really didn't believe her, plus he never came back). I also found a cousin who then led me to another great aunt who took months to contact. I then got in contact with my father's brother, my uncle, met him, &amp; then got in contact with my father again.

Well, I had made plans to meet up with the second great aunt &amp; my great uncle the following Monday (this all happened on a Friday of talking to my great aunt, meeting my uncle, &amp; messaging my father), but I should say, my labs for Chem were on Monday, hence why I picked that day, I would be at the college &amp; then just go straight to lunch which the restaurant was only a few yards away. However, in my past, I had gone to therapy because a friend &amp; his gf were attacked at my school &amp; she was raped. I was there when it happened because I was helping with the school play when they came running in to tell us, the school did nothing. Anyways, I went to therapy because I kept breaking out into hives every time I walked into that school. Turned out I had (and still do) severe anxiety.

Back to class. I had this one lab partner who was completely worthless (she was a nurse who couldn't do basic math &amp; she was in charge of giving medication &amp; didn't know why she needed Chem for nursing, oh &amp; to mention, she was a grandma whose husband was going to come beat up Mr. A, her sons were over 6ft, &amp; her grandchildren liked to bite people...fun class \*enter sarcasm\*). I made it very to her (and everyone else in the class) I wanted to leave at EXACTLY the end of class if not earlier because I was meeting my family for the first time &amp; I wanted to make good first impressions &amp; that I COULD NOT stay over an hour like we did last time to do EIGHT SIMPLE MATH PROBLEMS!!!!!

We did get done 45 mins early (grant we were still the last group to get done), but Mr. A asked if I could stay for a little bit to talk. I did seeing I still had time, &amp; we talked. He asked me questions about my life, about why I didn't know my father, about my mother, about growing up with mt grandparents (he knew about that from previous chit chats, but this was the first time we really talked), etc. I told him honestly because I didn't see anything wrong, I trusted him; I knew him for about 1 1/2 years, didn't see anything wrong. I told him about my mother, about how she is bi-polar (something she told us in the past, but she is now denying &amp; saying its PTSD she sustained from the kids she went to school with starting from elementary). I didn't tell him everything (like about my uncle) because I didn't see it as important or that he needed to know (at the time). He told me about how he knew about people with bipolar syndrome as he has a friend who is bipolar &amp; she acts out. 

He told me that if I ever needed to talk, I could go talk to him. He said that he has helped students in the past, one particular one, he told me, when he first started, he had a female student who would come to class with bruises. He said he found out her ""bf"" would beat her &amp; lock her in a dog cage, that he was a drug dealer &amp; he made her his ""bitch"" (the man literally spelled it out, he didn't say it, he spelled it). At the time, I thought I made a connection with someone who could help me, someone I could go talk to. The meeting went great, btw, &amp; they are wonderful people.

Now, jump to Fall semester, I signed up for his next Chem class, General Chem I. It was also around this time I found out D has plans to move back to the area (both her &amp; AJ live in a different state than grandma &amp; I). I also found out that she is not happy with me that I was in contact with my father &amp; his family (the only one she was happy I was in contact with was my uncle, my father's brother). I was literally scared she was going to kill me.

When I had gotten the news, I had bought a lockbox &amp; had taken things that belonged to my grandfather out of his &amp; grandma's lockbox (they were mine anyway because he promised them to me) &amp; placed them in mine. I wanted the stuff to go to my younger cousins if anything were to happen to me, but I knew D would sell or pawn the things (they were coins, two-dollar bills, papers, things like that, but they were important the oldest coin is a penny from the late 1800s). I was panicked &amp; wasn't really thinking straight, but I had plans to bury the box &amp; give the spare key to Mr. A along with the coordinates as to where it was.

I had asked to speak with him in private after class one day (the worst day that could possibly happen so I was already in tears). He asked me what it was about &amp; I said about what we had talked about the previous semester. He knew what I was talking about &amp; pulled me out into the hall. I told him about the news I had received with D &amp; that she was coming home soon to start bringing her things &amp; how she wasn't happy I was talking with my father. I said I thought she would try to kill me &amp; that I asked if he could take the spare key I had. We had talked about it &amp; he had some good points like how would he get to it, what if I got a lockbox from the bank. We talked some more about the issue &amp; he asked me what my plans were if things didn't get better. I said that if anything, I would leave everything &amp; everyone behind &amp; go start a new life somewhere else where no one could find me. He told me not to do anything &amp; to wait to see if there was anything he could do to help. I agreed &amp; waited.

The next day I received an email from him. He had talked to his dean (whom I will later find out had decided to ""invite"" himself into my business. I will call him Dean K) &amp; told Mr. A we had no therapist at the college for me to go talk to, but he did direct me to someone who had an outside source for me to go to. I met a wonderful therapist (who I'm sad is leaving to go back home since he is done with his schooling here). I told Mr. A I found a therapist &amp; he said he was happy for me, but he continued to keep asking me how I was doing &amp; everything, keeping up on me. However, D would come home once a month &amp; my mood would change drastically. Mr. A noticed every time &amp; would make comments like ""what did she say this time"" or ""why can't she just stay out of yours &amp; your grandma's lives"" or ""I wish I could meet her so I could give her a piece of my mind"", things like that. His class would be the only thing I would look forward to, but things got so bad with her that I didn't do one of my homework assignments for his class &amp; failed one of his tests which dropped my grade significantly. 

I tried to bounce back from it &amp; was working twice as hard, but then I found out about a report filed against me. I had a friend who worked in Security who sent me the notice &amp; like an idiot I emailed my professors asking if I had done something wrong. I wasn't supposed to find out about the report. The thing my friend sent me said if any professor had a problem with me, they were to remove me from class. I had asked him what it was about &amp; he said the head security guard said a professor came in &amp; said I was stalking them (I still don't know who filed it since all my professors denied it, &amp; I only had like five I talked to, the three I had &amp; the Vs). I went into hysterics because I received an email from Dean K saying he wanted a meeting with me &amp; Mr. A.

My mind immediately went to him that filed the report. I couldn't understand why he didn't just talk to me about what I was doing wrong. I go to the meeting &amp; this man tells me that I have been very inappropriate with ALL the staff &amp; students, that I was too nice to people, &amp; that because I was a female, I needed to watch what I said &amp; did, that I had to be less social, &amp; that I wasn't supposed to call my former teachers mom &amp; dad (that was a joke that J &amp; I started, he thought it would be funny &amp; they never corrected me for over a FUCKING YEAR. I never called them that in class &amp; there was another girl who did the same thing, but she called them that IN class as well &amp; they never corrected her). I was told I was never supposed to find out about the report so I couldn't fix my actions. I would have been thrown out of class &amp; possibly school &amp; never know why. Then Mr. A put in his two cents saying that I insulted him &amp; made him uncomfortable. WHAT? I was so confused, why didn't he say something? Why did he keep asking me if everything was ok? Why didn't he just stop me if I started to say something that made him uncomfortable? I was so hurt, I wanted to cry, but I held it together because I didn't want to cry in front of them.

I then asked about my friend. I didn't say his name or say he was my friend. Dean K told me that my friend lost his job &amp; because of it he was now probably going to try &amp; kill me for my role in getting him fired &amp; that the school would then have to take legal actions. I was shocked, but my mind then went to a dark place &amp; I thought I would just save him the trouble &amp; do it myself.

After this meeting, the Motherfucking asshole gave me his business card &amp; said if I ever needed anything or wanted to talk, I could call or email him at any time. I pitched that damn card in the garbage as soon as I got to my car. Some people I talked to said I should have smiled &amp; ripped it to pieces &amp; throw it in the air like confetti before leaving.

I somehow made it through Mr. A's class (yes, I went to class directly after this meeting. I did think about skipping, but I couldn't bring myself to do it, probably because I paid out almost a $1,000 out of pocket for my classes &amp; for someone who is a student worker, we don't get paid much). After class, I sprinted out of that school &amp; went to the graveyard to cry next to my grandfather's grave. It was NOVEMBER, I was OUTSIDE under a TREE, CRYING, for like 20 MINS. 

The next day, I woke up with bronchitis. Wednesday, I had to go to, you guessed it, Chem class to do a presentation. Mr. A decided to go back to being buddy-buddy with me &amp; asked how I was doing. I told him I wanted to stick a bullet in my brain, but other than that I was great. I gave him a hard time for a week before I finally snapped at the end of class the following Wednesday. I yelled at him &amp; asked him how he could pull some twisted prank like that. How could he pretend to care &amp; then file that report against me (at this time I thought it was him because of the things he said &amp; because why else would he be at the meeting)? 

He told me that he wasn't the one to file that report against me, he said he was there because he notified Dean K that there was a security breach. I deflated at that &amp; cried. He told me that the day that report was filed, he &amp; Mrs. V had gone to Dean K &amp; told him that they were worried about me. They said my grades had dropped &amp; that it was a cry for help &amp; that they didn't know what to do to help me. Mr. A said that Dean K said if they didn't want to deal with me then they needed to call security to deal with me. Mr. A said it wasn't that they didn't want to deal with me it was they didn't know what to do. He said that ""God forbid she does, but what if she tries to commit suicide here at the school?"" He said Dean K said, ""then that's when you call security &amp; let them deal with her."" Mr. A said he told him ""That's not helping the situation. We need councilors in here for students to talk to."" (They still have no councilors, btw). He also told me that back when he was looking for help for me, he had gone to Dean K &amp; Dean K asked him who I was, what was my problem, why did I need to talk to someone, why couldn't I just work it out, etc., etc. Mr. A said he replied with ""that is between me &amp; my student. If she wishes to share with you she will."" Mr. A said that Dean K requested they write reports about me &amp; the situation &amp; that he would look into it. He offered to show me the report, but of course, like an idiot, I declined. Oh, &amp; Dean K also told Mr. A the security guard was probably also going to try &amp; kill him as well after I had left.

I thought our relationship was fixed. We seemed to had gotten back to normal. I did write a couple of letters, the first apologizing for almost getting him fired &amp; the second saying I didn't think we should talk about my issue anymore because I didn't want him in trouble. I failed his class (big shocker), but what did surprise me was he stopped all contact completely. It wasn't until I was called to have another meeting with Dean K (WHO CALLED ME IN A FUCKING THERAPIST SO HE COULD LISTEN TO MY PROBLEMS). I told him I had a therapist &amp; he said he knew, but he figured a second opinion wouldn't hurt.

Motherfucker literally asked me how I was doing that day. I replied with ""well I haven't put a bullet in my head so that's a plus."" He said, ""You do know that if I were a parametric &amp; I heard you say that I would have to take you to a physic ward, right?"" I replied with ""Yes, my mother

lets me know every time she seems me about how I'm going to be her next patient she would need to take."" (She's a paramedic, don't ask me how.) He then told me I was no longer allowed talking to Mr. A as long as I was a student. He told me Mr. A showed him the letters &amp; said that they both believed my letters were a way to get into bed with Mr. A. He said after this semester I was not allowed back as a student, he told me not to enroll there anymore.

WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. FUCK.

Nowhere in my letters did I say I had feelings for him. I said I would like to still be friends, but not that I wanted to sleep with him. I even told Dean K that those letters were not my intention that they were only an apology. He said he knew that, but he said they were afraid there were ""deeper meaning"". I didn't know if I wanted to storm out of that office, strangle him, or bash a chair over his head, but I was pissed. I was more shocked though so I stood there with my mouth open like &amp; blubbering idiot. Then the therapist arrived from the other campus OVER AN HOUR AWAY.

She was nice enough, but she allowed his man to sit in on our meeting for 1/2 an hour before he finally left for a meeting. I thought ""fine, since he wants to know so much, I'll tell them."" I told them about the abuse D inflicted on me. I told them about how she was ashamed that I was still a virgin &amp; tried hooking me up with 30 yos (yes, she took my underaged ass to a bar &amp; tried hooking me up with 30 yos because she was embarrassed that I was virgin &amp; that she didn't want a 30 yo virgin daughter). I didn't say anything about my uncle in front of him because it is still too hard for me to talk about &amp; I refuse to cry in front of that asshole. I told him how she says my only purpose in life is to take care of grandma. I told them about her reputation in the area. I told them that thanks to my mother, I don't see myself doing anything with my life &amp; that I probably will just kill myself if she doesn't do it for me. 

This Motherfucking dean places his two cents into this conversation saying ""well, you never know if you're going to get somewhere unless you try."" &amp; ""you really need to get over this thing with your mother &amp; move on."" Motherfucker, did you not hear me say she has threatened &amp; tried to kill me in the past? How the fuck am I suppose to ""move on"" from that bullshit?""

Finally, he left &amp; then I told her about what happened in the previous semester. She was shocked when I told her about the report &amp; what he said to me about the security guard. She was also mad when I told her I was told there were no councilors for me to talk to. She said they could have called her since she was the one for both campuses, but they told her that year they were going to go with a local agency (go figure it would be the one I'm going to) so she wouldn't have to drive the distance (they never did fill the contract with the other agency if you hadn't figured it out). I also told her about my uncle &amp; she said that it sounded like I was still suffering from survivor's guilt. She told me I wasn't the problem, but my family was &amp; the people around me were not helping &amp; poorly trained. She said I didn't need to see her anymore, but gave me her card &amp; told me if I needed her we could talk, but I wouldn't need to see her again unless I requested it.

After I left the meeting, Dean Asshole walked in &amp; I don't know if there were any words exchanged. I haven't heard anything from anyone; no Dean K, no Mr. A, no Vs. I have so many damn questions &amp; D is still making my life hell. 

Oh yes, this is another thing I should mention. Grandma has not been having the greatest year. New Years she had a heart attack &amp; had to be rushed to the hospital. I called my uncle to tell him who then called D. I was with the parameters &amp; police (they came down too because the ambulance was taking so long. It had snowed &amp; it took them about 1/2 an hour to arrive. D called &amp; was screaming through the phone about how I didn't call her &amp; She was the next person I was supposed to call. I told her I was dealing with the police  &amp; paramedics &amp; that my focus was on grandma. She told me to give the phone to one of the paramedics &amp; so I did. She is now screaming at him &amp; telling him how to do his job. Everyone can hear her &amp; this poor guy has the phone pulled away from his ear because she was so loud. Finally, they get her off the phone 20 mins later &amp; we are now making our way up to the hospital. It took an hour to get her to the 15 min hospital from the time they arrived.

She came in the following morning along with AJ &amp; of course, D decides to make it about herself. ""Of course AJ has to be here because she's the perfect child"" &amp; ""nothing is ever wrong with AJ"" etc. etc. etc. AJ stayed with grandma the entire time up at the hospital while D decides she's going to take me &amp; ""clean the entire house in 11 hours"" (she gives the entire list of things to do &amp; she does nothing but takes the credit)

Anyways, why I'm telling you all this. This motherfucking dean asked me word for word ""did your grandma die from the heart attack?"" I looked at him like he lost his damn mind &amp; replied: ""No, she is fine, even after waiting for 1/2 an hour for the ambulance &amp; no help from D while she screamed at these paramedics about how to do their jobs &amp; about how they are so incompetent &amp; that they are stupid.""

In February, D was home again &amp; of course brought her two giant dogs, pit &amp; lab. Grandma has osteoporosis. Grandma was letting our little Pom out to pee &amp; D's 2 yo pit charged at her to get out, plowed right through her &amp; launched her about 5ft across our kitchen. We heard her fall &amp; cry out &amp; that's how we found her. Now, remember, I said D was a paramedic. Instead of assessing the situation, this dumb ass tries to pick grandma off the floor. She calls out &amp; so D puts her back down &amp; that's when she notices grandma's FUCKING LEG WAS BROKE! She's yelling at me to go wait outside for the ambulance she was calling. I didn't have time to grab a coat. It wasn't a 1/2 an hour later she's yelling at me to get a coat. I'm still trying to figure out what the fuck am I going to do once they get here, not like we live in a large area, plus every paramedic pretty much knows where we live. 

They arrive &amp; she comes storming out &amp; starts barking orders on what to bring up to the house. They bring one wrong thing &amp; she goes into, ""this is why I told you to bring this."" Then she tries making friends with them &amp; is all jokey, jokey, I just roll my eyes &amp; check on grandma. Finally, we get her on the stretcher &amp; to the hospital. D makes me sit out in the waiting room for 5-6 FUCKING HOURS with one update. Then we get ready to leave, I go see grandma for like a whole 10 mins before I leave (she's out of it because of the pain killers). I get the car started &amp; warming it, D is smoking outside before going back in to get grandma that we were leaving. I'm waiting before I finally get a text to just go ahead home &amp; she will call when she is ready. I'm over this shit by now so I just leave, deal with the dogs, call in dinner, &amp; wait. Finally, like 2 hours later, she's ready to come home. I go get her, we go get dinner (I made her pay), we get home, &amp; then she starts.

""Of course I'm never going to live this down. Everyone is going to tell me it's my fault because it was my dog who tripped her. I'm the villain in this whole thing. Everyone is going to hate me."" On &amp; on &amp; on. I didn't say anything, I didn't see the point.

The next day, grandma got a partial hip replacement. We waited for hours for her to be done (grandma was never good with anesthetic). Finally, the doctor came out &amp; D, of course, made me wait out in the lobby. I know, I'm 22. I can do whatever I want, but the last time I stood up to her, she came at me like a fucking bull who saw red &amp; grabbed me by my neck. I had to do some quick talking to calm her down. This had only been a few years ago.

Now, we come to the most shocking part I think in my story. Remember when I told you to keep M in mind. Well, my therapist told me he believes I need to talk to D about my past with her. I decided to do a little test first thought. A few months after the incident with my uncle, M had raped me. She had told me if I didn't do things with her, she was going to force me. I wasn't comfortable with the whole thing, but I did it because she was so much bigger than me (close to 200 lbs bigger). I felt dirty about the whole situation after &amp; every time I see her, I want to scratch my skin open &amp; try to bleed out the dirty.

I told D &amp; D told me it was all my fault, that I made myself the victim. She said that I always make myself the victim &amp; that soon people are going to stop caring about me &amp; turn away when I need help &amp; that I'm going to be on my own. She said she wanted to hit me or strangle me for putting myself in that situation. She said I needed to start standing up for myself. Then she said if she ever saw M ever again, she was going to punch her &amp; probably kill her. I don't see how that is going to do anything, it's been 4 years.

I don't know. Am I overreacting about everything? Am I getting mad at my teachers &amp; the dean for no reason? I just don't know how to make of the whole situation.",16Apr2020,1

My S/O(F), that we'll call Mandy hasn't been in the best terms of mental health. She's very prone to breaking down and I've always been the one there for her. Just recently, I introduced her to one of my close friends because partly, I would love for her to meet my friends and because she told me she doesn't have much friends. She is very co-dependent on others and some times can be very manipulative, so I'm afraid that she'll hurt my friend. I don't want to put my friend through unhealthy situations anymore because he just recently recovered. It feels like I'm messing with somebody's sobriety as I do this. I'm afraid that if I tell him, she'll cry about being disappointed or if she finds out, she may accuse me of dividing her from people. I don't know if I should give him a warning?

I'm having a relationship with a woman who is deeply insecure and anxious of herself. She's a lovely woman, able to give me the best any 9 month relationship has to offer, and it's safe to say that I am in love with her.

However, I still get attracted to a particular girl who gets or piques my interest. Although I don't do anything to get the message across or reach out to her, nor that I plan to in the first place. It's just that she's always around (she's my blockmate in the same college program), and I feel self-conscious around her. And I feel like I want to make her at least recognize me.

I've been keeping it to myself for almost the duration of my relationship and somehow, my girlfriend found out about it. Now she's upset, blaming herself for not being ideal and someone like the girl I get attracted with, and her self-esteem is slowly but surely crumbling. Quarantine is also not helping.

I couldn't watch my cousin do that to herself. 

I tried to talk to her and be the 'cool cousin' (I have an elder sister, and she has another cousin on her mum's side). But I am not sure that approach worked very well. Her parents have me stalking her instagram because they (self admittedly) struggle to control her. How can I explain to her that I was an exception to the rule, and I only got out of that lifestyle by four years of working my arse off to make it out of the mess I'd made of my life. I don't want her to have to go through the stress of what I had to do, I just want her to see that what she is doing to herself may not be reversible. Her grades are a complete mess, and I tried to help her, I said I'd tutor her for free in subjects that I can help with but she refused my help basically.   


I love my cousin to bits, I think she's a great girl and she's super bright, but how do I talk to her about the damage she's doing to her future and herself without encouraging her?",16Apr2020,1

588,"This question has bothered me most of my life, and the quarantine has been an eye-opener to me. I've always thought that what I'd regret spending time on was video games, youtube and these hobbies that are traditionally regarded as a waste of time. Even though I get a lot of enjoyment out of them, I've been limiting myself, trying to spend time trying out different activites and spending time with friends. Although a lot of it was enjoyable and I have a rich variety of experiences, some of the things I forced myself to try was a real pain to commit to and not enjoyable at all (like Dungeons and Dragons, when I tried to socialize more). What I've discovered when the quarantine hit and I started to think about what I'd regret not doing more of if society colapsed tomorrow, it would probably be the video games, and what I'd regret most is all the hours I forced myself to be social when I didn't want to. 

I've always forced myself to do stuff under the assumption that it is a form of self improvement, and I have undoubtebly made some vauable experiences along the way. But lately I've been conflicted on the importance of self improvement, leaning more towards self acceptance as the more important priority. My conclusion is that self improvement is important to the degree that it is facilitating the actualization of your life goals, but that self improvement just for the sake of self improvement does not have any intrinsic value. 

But I'd like other peoples thoughts on this. I still have trouble just spending my free time on video games, mainly because of my upbringing (by free time I mean time not spent on studies or volunteering). My question is this: How do you judge what activites are worth spending time on, and what activites are a waste of time?",16Apr2020,1
589,"Hi everyone, 

This is a very subject related post, but other related subreddits wouldn‚Äôt let me post there, hence my post here. 

I am currently a Masters student trying to get a degree in counseling, which requires me to participate in a practicum.

However, my university has been inflexible with new policies surrounding practicum because of Coronavirus.

My university is requiring students be onsite (at the counseling center), with a supervisor, despite social distancing recommendations. Their explanation is that practicum would be a difficult learning curve for students when performed via distance supervision.

However, the accrediting body that my university reports to states on their website that distance supervision is a perfectly acceptable alternative. Further, this policy does not accommodate students who may have an existing condition that puts them at higher risk if they were to contract COVID19. Plus, research shows that distance supervision and onsite supervision is equally as effective. 

I have written a proposal to the faculty to revise this policy and have asked my current supervisor (who can only offer distance supervision) to advocate for me as well. Is there anything else I can do to fight this policy and allow me to graduate on time?

Any advice or support is appreciated, I‚Äôm an emotional mess over the thought of not being able to graduate with my class.",16Apr2020,0

I fell in love with someone who has a boyfriend, I‚Äòve made huge progress in axcepting that fact and her boyfriend is also a good friend. I‚Äòve also agreed with myself not to make a big fuzz, just treat her normally and respectfully like a normal class mate would. So that went well, it‚Äòs all calm and dandy.

Well there is these situations where I feel there is still some unhealthy connection between me and her. That most likely has something to do with me being really close friends with her even if she had a boyfriend. Well she quietly pushed that friendship away from her. So what happens is: When I text her for normal things like to say Happy Easter, it makes me really sort of dizzy inside... I also don‚Äòt know what to say to her about it, she doesnt owe me anything. 

Well so basically she never said shit about how she had a problem with my behaviour snd now I‚Äòm torn between emotional state nr 1 (ah, what do I care, I was just being myself) and nr 2 (Maybe I can make it ok, maybe I should do A and B)

If I had come out before that point, we would have bought those pairs of leggings. When we got home and while I was in bed I cried myself to sleep. I can't take it not being myself anymore. The only person I could really come out to would be my dads girlfriend (parents are divorced) or my dads girlfriends daughter.

I was on a holiday when I met this guy who was a local. We quickly fell in love with the 10 days we had with each other and as those 10 days grew little by little he asked to go on a long distance relationship with me. I agreed and I was smitten with him.

After a month I think he said to me that sometimes when he sees an attractive woman he wishes he was single so he can get with them. The conversation escalated and it turned out he didnt want to be in a long distance relationship, he just wanted to make me ""happy"". I broke up with him over this.

Somehow we got back together again, after begging me, still long distance. One day he was very tired from work so while we were doing his grocery lists he yelled at me, frustrated. We broke up again.

It‚Äôs an ugly reddish-brown color, and she got a matching chair with puke green cushions. She also got me a lime green bookshelf. All the furniture I already have it red and black, so they‚Äôll look like Christmas next to each other.

I told her nicely I really want my room to match and she should either return them to the lady she bought them from, or use them in the living room. She knows I need my room to match or it‚Äôll drive me crazy, yet she keeps buying me stuff that looks awful together. And it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs buying whatever she can afford, because instead of buying a regular desk for my computer, which I‚Äôd be happy with, she‚Äôs instead buying super expensive vintage art desks. 

She also keeps buying stuff I won‚Äôt ever use. She got me a super expensive painters easel, when I don‚Äôt do painting, I do comic art, do idk what she expects me to do with that. She just keeps buying me stuff I won‚Äôt use, like the easel and art desk, or just ugly stuff in general, like all that vintage crap, and when I tell her I don‚Äôt want it, she makes me feel ungrateful. Idk what to do about he getting all this stuff I don‚Äôt want

Also I‚Äôm not an adult mooching off my mom, I‚Äôm still in high school.

Edit: To all the people saying ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like what she buys you, get a job.‚Äù I‚Äôm 1. Still in high school and 2. Literally can‚Äôt get a job because no one wants to hire a high schooler who can barely walk",16Apr2020,45
639,"I‚Äôll try to keep this short and sweet. Basically, since I‚Äôve started dating people there have always been things that happen that end up ending the relationship whether it be them cheating or lying about major details that I just can‚Äôt forgive. And this, mixed with a semi-rough portion of childhood, has left me feeling sometimes as always a ‚Äòsecond-best‚Äô or along those lines.

So I‚Äôm seeing someone at the minute who tends to make a lot of remarks about other people, be that people on social media or in TV and movie. I‚Äôd be silly to assume that just because we‚Äôre going out that he would never find other people good-looking. But there‚Äôs something about when he remarks on them with such eager language sometimes that irks me. I don‚Äôt even get irritated at him or anything but I feel upset when he does it because the situation isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm used to. I never heard my parents or other relatives make remarks like those to their partner, not has anyone I‚Äôve dated in the past made such remarks to me (they just did worse things behind my back).

I know it‚Äôs an insecurity (along with a lack of having witnessed things like that) that has stemmed from my past but even acknowledging that I can‚Äôt seem to get over it and bury it. Maybe this sounds extreme but I would never make such remarks to him out of a sort of respect, even though I know it wouldn‚Äôt bother him in the slightest. I‚Äôm afraid of self-sabotaging and this is the first person in a long time that I‚Äôve felt anything strong with so I don‚Äôt want to mess it up with my own issue. Does anyone have any advice as to how to get over this? I know these people aren‚Äôt ‚Äòattainable‚Äô but I still feel like I‚Äôm just what he‚Äôs settled on since he can‚Äôt get something more in-line with the people he talks about.",16Apr2020,1
641,"I think my dad hates me or I‚Äôm just the least favourite child. What should I do.

For context I‚Äôm a college student. 

I didn‚Äôt know if this was the right place to post. Let me know if this should go to another subreddit. 

Long story short. Throughout my childhood and now I think my dad just doesn‚Äôt like me.

Whenever I‚Äôve had a significant achievement, he‚Äôs always said ‚Äúcan your brother and sister do that‚Äù. No well done or great job. It was depressing in my internship when all these parents would come round and be so proud of their child and ask them to buy company swag etc. My dad didn‚Äôt even really say congrats. Throughout my internship he kept saying ‚Äúhave you had a look at these properties‚Äù because he wanted to move. It hurt because he‚Äôs not rooting for me to get a return offer and focus on that. I repeatedly told him it‚Äôs not possible as the properties he wanted were way above our price range. He didn‚Äôt ask my brother or sister to do it, just me even though my brother and sister (same age) had nothing to do whilst I‚Äôm working.

He sometimes comes and checks on us at night. He sometimes would go to my sister and then my brother and then just not go to mine. 

I recently discovered that my sister got $1000 from him. Yet she doesn‚Äôt even speak to him unless she needs money or some shit and doesn‚Äôt care about anyone, but herself. I always help where I can even make coffee for people when I‚Äôm making it. The only reason she got that was because she‚Äôd spent all her money on clothes. However when I was earning for the first time, he wanted me to pay for some hotel accommodation. Bare in mind my brother and sister both are the same age and don‚Äôt have jobs. They both have spending habits meaning they have little money in their accounts. Yet I save and invest and my father wants me to pay. He can afford it himself. How is that fair.

I remember one time we were children and my brother got angry for no real reason and threw a remote at my head. My father nor mother never punished him. They just continued whilst I cried in my bed. This isn‚Äôt the only episode, but the most traumatic that comes to mind where my mother and father did nothing to tell my brother off. 

Even when it comes to buying stuff. My brother asked for a nice laptop and he got it no questions asked. When I asked, I got some lewd comment about saving money. To give context, I‚Äôm a CS major and I needed the extra power and I know my father could easily afford it. My brothers grades were a lot worse than mine. Eventually I persuaded him, but given my brother got one going to a much worse college and no questions asked is heart breaking as it just shows who my father prefers.

I remember I also struggled to make friends as a young child. My dad told me he would help me and then never did. That really hurt as I was excited. I‚Äôm pretty sure I have social anxiety.

Frankly I‚Äôm just sick of getting the short end of the stick for the last few years. The reason this all got triggered again is because my dad said ‚Äúcan your sister do this‚Äù after I mentioned I got into some startup program. Now I‚Äôm just sat in my room feeling low and tired and just don‚Äôt want to do anything. Last night I thought why bother with life anymore. I can move out after the virus, but is that moral to just turn my back on them?

644," I‚Äôm still in school, this may sound childish, but I don‚Äôt care, I really need to talk about this. ANYWHERE.
  The gist is that I had a crush on this guy, I kept teasing him lots, ya know, being a /male genitalia/ I still really want to be this guys friend though, and that‚Äôs the weird part. I don‚Äôt know why I am so desperate for him to be my friend.
  I live in a growing country let‚Äôs say. People really don‚Äôt speak much English here, there are exceptions though. I have a thick, annoying accent that people either notice or make fun of it, every time they mention it. I was always shy and quiet because of this, even though I‚Äôm very loud normally. 
   I now go to a new school that has a very good English program. Lots of kids are like me there. Because I‚Äôm stupid I get infatuated quickly, normally I get used to getting a crush every month or so, but I‚Äôll always get over it quickly. This guy was no exception. I got a crush on him. At this time we were friendish. He rejected my feelings and said that he had a gf (he was lying) I tell him, like an idiot, that lying isn‚Äôt cool. While we were friendish I always teased him for being short (and cute?) i apologised to him about the teasings and confronting him about something that didn‚Äôt matter. I asked him how I can be his friend and he said ‚Äújust be quiet, that‚Äôs it I guess‚Äù 
   He is actually a pretty cool guy, but the exact opposite of me. Because I was too scared of being made fun of i never talked much in my old school. I now go to a new one filled to the brim with kids like me, I‚Äôm a stereotypical extrovert, loud, many friends (most are introverts) and annoying. I never want to go back to being quieter, it brings back weird memories that are best forgotten. 
  Now, it‚Äôs been months since I‚Äôve seen him. But he is always on my mind. Frankly, it‚Äôs annoying how badly I handled everything, even worse is that I remember it every time I try to sleep, eat and even take a shower but he probably doesn‚Äôt even remember what I look like. I always think I should apologise again and again it‚Äôs driving me nuts!
   I want to reset everything that happened between us, I want us to be friends only. All I want most of all is to reset his point of view on me. I just want to be normal with him. I just don‚Äôt know how or where to start. Please people of reddit, give me advice.",16Apr2020,1
645,"So I work for a local politician. I am his assistant and his only full-time assistant. There's one part-time assistant, and he can do absolutely no wrong. I, on the other hand, being held accountable for absolutely everything. He hired me and insisted after the fact I donate 10% of my annual income to the party, which is a lot given I'm a university student in a lot of debt already, and he's just become INSANE. I thought he was a really nice, reasonable guy, but he's not. I can do everything right, I do half of his job for him. I go above and beyond and do things outside of my pay scale and job description and essentially act as a social worker for community members, an assistant and a bookkeeper. Essentially, its The Devil Wear's Prada, and he's Meryl Streep. 

He completely overlooked government legislation stating I needed to work from home and kept me in the office until just last week, and I have direct family members in my household who are high-risk. 

If I mess up, it's the end of the world. Last night, I forgot to reply to a text and he's scheduled a whole meeting now for tomorrow to discuss this ""failure in responsibility"". I don't know what to do. I have anxiety and depression. They're being treated. But this just makes it so much worse and I'm not coping well. I can't take time off right now because I have two weeks a year and I need them when exams happen, and there are too many seniors in the community and vulnerable people who have been calling who really need help. 

Are there any suggestions? Just on how to approach him or how to talk to him about this? Like I can't go to HR, because it's pretty obvious who complained!

Im a 25 year old male if it helps.

It all went down the drain when she told shes moving to another country to pursue her dream career.
I supported her and told her to go after it.
And she did.
We broke up the night before on a mutual decision.
The problem is since that relationship; i didnt feel the same thing i've felt for her, to anyone else, ive dated other girls, and ive been in diffrent relationships after the breakup,
But i cant stop thinking about the girl that left, and i feel really guilty dating other girls, knowing that i simply wont feel the same thing to them as i felt for the girl that moved.

Today as I was video calling a female friend of mine (which I haven't seen or spoken to in quite some time) my call ended due to my battery being low . I then messaged her saying that I would call her back but she replied saying that she is not feeling good anymore . I have no idea what happened between the minutes of no contact but it's really getting to her.  

Despite this , she said she will call tomorrow. I urged her not to and offered my support saying that we (her friends)  are here for her if she needs anything or needs someone to talk to . She then said that she isn't ready to talk about it . I haven't replied since .

Please help me in trying to be supportive here , have I done enough or should I do more ? It gets to me seeing people down especially friends as I sometimes feel as if I'm not helping enough .",16Apr2020,1

I know that your teenage years aren't that hyped up to be, but gosh, I wish I experienced those cool things, you know? Going to dances, parties, dates, etc. I missed out on all of that because my parents either said no or it was against their rules.

I haven't been able to get into a relationship in high school because I always think in the back of my head that it's going to make my parents upset and they'll ground me. :( I'm going to be real here: I don't know how I'm going to succeed with dating life in college if I can't even figure it out during HS. My parents don't show any sign of changing their minds either.

This extends even further than dating, it goes into driving, going to friends' houses, getting a job, etc. My parents told me to not even expect to be driving during my HS years. :((((( Which sucks for me, because I want to get a job so I can save up to move out...which might be why my parents are saying no to jobs too.

I feel stuck. There is so much that I want to do and experience, but I don't know if I can. I feel like they think they're doing the best for me, but they're putting me in a place that I have no idea how to grow out of. My guess is because they're scared of me growing up, but I don't know.

So I‚Äôm on my 2nd year of uni but my parents think I‚Äôm on my 3rd! However they know what year I graduate since they know I had a gap year!

The just don‚Äôt really know about my repeat year! 
I ended up telling them my course goes for an extra year! 
I just told a half truth to them that I had to retake some units and that my course goes on for an extra year due to certain majors!! So that made up for the ‚Äúrepeat year‚Äù
And they already knew I took a gap year. 

Telling them the actual truth would cause allot of stress in the family since I have ethnic parents!! And I‚Äôll feel more pressure! Also My fees are Government funded! They just help out here and there when needed or little bit of pocket money here and there but most of the time I do my own extra funds!!  
We also get government benefits for 3 years  which is signed by our parents during high school and they put a bit into to it however I told the truth about that and delayed my payments until I finish this year off because I don‚Äôt want any situations with that so for now I‚Äôve been working and paying any major fees I need! And I dont want to lie when it comes to government stuff especially when my parents have put a bit into! I rather just get that when I‚Äôm supposed than lie !! 
My parents just don‚Äôt know I‚Äôll be getting that part money next year instead and nor do I want to tell them as I don‚Äôt want them to spend extra for me! 
But I‚Äôve been well financially! 

And ofcourse if I do face any troubles now which effect my studies I will definitely tell them and fess up since I don‚Äôt want this to Turn into a bigger problem! But for now I seem to be getting my grades on point ! 

So basically they know when I graduate!! Like by then even if it shows up in my graduation certificate I don‚Äôt think they will care by then! Or I‚Äôll just let them know and won‚Äôt really be fussed since I already graduated!! 

So idk I feel guilty cause they do support me allot and trust me. I will admit during the repeat year I had major anxiety to attend uni so I did spend time just mucking around and stress drinking, getting high but I‚Äôve changed that ! And I‚Äôve set my priorities straight ! I‚Äôm also seeing a professional and a counsellor at my uni

A little background info me and bri are both high school juniors. Sophomore year she moved in next door to me because her parents were getting a divorce. Prior to her moving next door, i had already seen her in school and had no idea who she was. 

The moment i saw her she already had me in the palm of her hand, she was the most beautiful woman i had ever laid my eyes on. I swore i would eventually make her mine. So bri moves in next door and is living with my life long best friend and given the fact I‚Äôm already always hanging out next door with my friend, i see this as god giving me the perfect opportunity to make her mine. 

Sophomore year ends and bri has been living next door for five months and still has yet to say a word to me. Her mom on the other hand became my best friend, i would spend almost every summer night outside drinking alone with her mom (it‚Äôs a lot less weird then it seems i promise)her mom knew i was head over heels for her daughter and one night when i was out side building a fire for bri‚Äôs little brother and my best friends little sister, my friend threw gasoline into the fire while i was next to it causing a big explosion. Bri saw the fire and came outside to see what was going on and this was the first time she ever said a word to me. I told bri that it‚Äôs a beautiful night out and it would be a waist to stay inside so i built the kids a fire to hang outside. Bri went back inside the house and i thought ‚Äúdamn i thought that was my chance‚Äù five minutes later she came out with marshmallows and came outside to hang with us. All the kids went inside and it was just me and Bri outside alone under the stars with the fire slowly dying. Me and her talked till the fire eventually died and i found out not only is she the most beautiful person I‚Äôve ever met she‚Äôs also the nicest most kind hearted human being I‚Äôve ever met and i could have listened to her talk for hours if i could. 

When the night ended i walked across the street back home feeling happier than I‚Äôve ever been. That was the first time me and her have talked and at that point she had been living next door for five months. Me and her would continue to talk from time to time for the next 4 months after that night under the stars. One night i was hanging out with her mom watching movies and drinking, and Bri came upstairs for some water. Bri rarely would ever drink but this night she decided to join us and drink and watch movies. It got pretty late so Bris mom said she was gonna go up to bed and asked if she should turn off the tv. Surprisingly Bri said she was gonna watch one more movie and asked if i wanted to watch with her. I of course said yes and when the movie ended i decided I‚Äôm going to ask her out. I asked her if she wanted to get a slice of pizza at a new restaurant that just opened up and she surprisingly said yes. I couldn‚Äôt believe that i got a girl i had been chasing for over a year to say yes to a date. 

Me and Bri end up dating shortly after finding out we had feelings for one another and i would stay next door till 2 in the morning, go home, go to bed, wake up at 5 in the morning, go back to her house and join her in bed. It was really nice for the short time it lasted but we moved way too fast and it rightfully scared her because i was her first boyfriend. So now fast forward to present day i found out she‚Äôs been single for the past 2 months because her and her boyfriend broke up. I haven‚Äôt said a word to her since we broke up. She moved away but still lives relatively close. I want nothing more then to be given another chance and do things right this time and not take things so fast. I just have no idea how to even text her or what i should text her. Reddit Please Help Me!

tl;dr Short version: i just found out an ex of mine has been single for the past month and the reason mine and her relationship ended was because we took things way too fast and as sophomores in high school i was her first boyfriend. We didn‚Äôt end on bad terms i just scared her with how quickly we were moving. It‚Äôs now a year later and the end of our junior year and i want nothing more than to right my wrongs and make her mine again",16Apr2020,4

  hi, for context, i'm 15F, with some acne, acne scars and really oily skin. i wasn't very self conscious about it until my mum started pointing it out every time she saw me. when i talk to her she doesn't even look me in the eyes, she looks at my acne instead. it also has kind of become annoying for me, as my skin is so oily that my glasses keep slipping down my nose.

  in true asian parent fashion, she does not believe that using any skincare products will do me any good, and insists that i just wash my face without using moisturizer etc and that eating spicy food will clear my skin (what??) 
 
  i did quite a bit of research, and i don't think this will aid my skin at all. however, my mum is not convinced and will not allow me to use any products. can anyone site a reliable source on teenage skincare that i can share to her? or maybe give me a few tips on what i can do? thank you :)",16Apr2020,1

693,"Hi, so let me start with some backstory. 

My father hasn't exactly been the best person and that has caused quite a few problems between him and members of my family, specifically my mother and my brothers. 

Over the years with a few vague worrying memories and things I've found out about him doing, he's definitely been quite an asshole and a heavy alcoholic, but he could very well still be both of those things since I haven't seen or heard from him ( neither has anyone in my family, none of us were sure whether he was alive or not) in about 3 years. 

He and my mother split up when I was about 6/7, then when I was 10 my mother, my brother and I moved to the other side of the country and from then on I would only see him over the Christmas holidays until the end of 9th grade when I went to visit him and experience the intensely toxic relationship with his new wife, due to what I can only imagine are the same habits that ended his last two marriages. The constant fights and me having to hide in my room most of the time I was by him caused me to want to stay with my brothers most of the time I was there, but things looked like they were going to get better when I heard that he was going to AA the following year and that definitely seemed like a very good step in the right direction. 

Over the years the communication between my father and I has died down quite a bit to just about none, until about February of my 10th grade YEAR when he cut communication with everyone ( meaning mainly the people mentioned in the beginning, but a few other people too) and we had no idea what he was doing or where he was, since even when my brother did go to his house (which was quite a few times) it didn't even look like he was home. This did hurt me, but I understand that everyone lives a different life and I don't know what he's going through so I didn't take it too much to heart, and I definitely still thought that even if he didn't contact me again, once I had the money or means to, I would go to see him and build a good relationship. 

So fastforward to a few days ago which was about 10 days after my 18th birthday and out of the blue he calls me and says hi, asked how things were going and said that for the past two years or so he has been busy with his own business, but it's been going wrong since day one ; he also said that he was in my area a little while ago, but didn't visit me, because he wasn't ready to see me and ""catch up"" yet and again, I didn't take this too much to heart, because I completely get it. 

He also asked how my brothers were doing and as he asked he got one of there names wrong ( I don't know why, but that seems relevant) and he said that he was going to message me and send me some pictures or something. 

So now I am looking for advice as I'm not concerned with what he's done in the past, all I care about is that he is or is trying to become a better person and that we build a good relationship now; so I would like help as to how I should approach the situation because talking to him is quite awkward seeing as there's quite a bit of tension. 

Thank you for your time and help.",16Apr2020,1
694,"Before I begin, I am on phone and have never posted on Reddit before, so bare with me here please!

To begin, I‚Äôm at an awkward point with a couple that I‚Äôve been good friends with the boyfriend for years.  I met the girlfriend when they first started dating in 2016, and to be honest we never really talked to begin with or even through their first 2 years of dating. For reference we are all currently aged early 20‚Äôs.

 So, bf has attempted to become more professional looking and stern, and as of late I‚Äôve had no interest in hanging out with him anymore because I just don‚Äôt enjoy his personality anymore. Given that he‚Äôs always doing what‚Äôs best for himself and his future, it leaves me and gf by ourselves, beginning about 8-9 months ago.

You can probably already guess where I‚Äôm going.

Over the course of so long, girlfriend and I just kinda slid into each other like snug gloves.  All laughs and playing and even when it is serious I don‚Äôt feel any kind of tension that things could go awry at any moment.  

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there has never been any direct intent for sexual activity.  By that, I just mean with all the playfighting that we do, accidentally nudging each other‚Äôs downstairs just kinda happens- with no problem!

Well, this all built to a breaking point one night out drinking.  We finally confessed to each other that we enjoy more than just each other‚Äôs company, although she still loves BF and wants to stay with him.

Genuinely, I am/was fine with that as I left that night as I considered it ‚Äúclosure‚Äù of the sort.  We sort of had a completely unspoken plan after that night, and it was to try and not touch each other as much, to hangout at my house alone anymore, or basically anything that could be lead to more of a mess.

Finally to the present.  After talking that night I felt confident that we could remain friends and I could smother my crush for her, and I was decent for the time.

Well, She came over early this week and it was like a dam had been set wide open.  Tickles, giggles, hugs, laying on each other, whispering a bit too close to ears, and to top it all off, she decided she was gonna sleep on my couch and stay the night. (as compared to NEVER having stayed the night before)Its worth noting this first night I gave her my bed so I slept on the couch. 
I feel this could be a dead giveaway if someone I know is reading this, but last night she stayed again, but this time she slept with me. In my bed. 

So here i am. In love with an ex best friends gf even after having decided we shouldn‚Äôt pursue each other.

I feel like this entire post is useless anymore.  I think there‚Äôs a part of me that just thinks that this is her way of being friends and another part that doubts myself.

701,"Hey guys, so I'm going to try to keep this short and to the point. But there's a lot to cover

Sorry about the formatting I'm on mobile.


So this started the other day although I knew that he was always flirting with me a little bit, we worked the same shift because the person I usually work with was off sick.



And it just started as regular joking around and then he started making suggestive comments about the fact that we should date, then later on in the shift he actually asked me, ""if I were to ask you out, would you say yes?""



I just told him that first off, I don't know him very well, and the 13 year age gap is a bit much for me, especially right now being 20. And basically told him that while I appreciate it, I wasn't interested.



he kind of backed off for a little bit but throughout the day here persisted with little comments, I kept telling him that I wasn't interested and that it just wasn't going to work out, although I was sorry.



Then I told him that my best friend is single, she's 27, and that if he was interested I could give him her contact info and he could hit her up since I know she's been looking for people to talk to.



She's not a lot like me in the way that she loves having people like him talking to her, especially right now seeing as she got out of her long-term relationship recently, I know she's trying to get out and meet new people often. Although I know we can't meet up with anybody during the pandemic, she still likes to text them.



She's even told me multiple times, if I have a guy hmu or talk to me, that I should send them her way.



I checked with her first before giving him anything to contact her with. And she was happy to have a chance to talk to him, since she's been having quite a few conversations with guys lately.



He appreciated it and took her contact info, then he was all excited about being able to talk to her for the rest of the night so I thought it ended there.



Then come the next few days and he was persistently texting me on Facebook, asking me all kinds of question about her to try and surprise her with and just being friendly, I'm a very easy going person so I just thought he was trying to be friends and that his romantic interest head gone off on to her.



Although I was naive to think that, because he soon started talking about how we would be perfect together again, that I have such a great personality and I'm gorgeous and would continuously give me compliments and try to persuade me to date him.



I kept trying to tell him that I wasn't interested and then would mention her again thinking that maybe, that might help to encourage him to talk to her and not me.



And then I stopped texting him pretty much completely, and would only answer to work-related conversations, trying to keep everything very platonic. but I didn't want to outright block him or something since we worked together and that would make it awkward, and I just want to be able to run our shift smoothly.



Flashback to last night when we're working, he was talking to me and would continuously say again, we're perfect together, I'm amazing, beautiful, and all of this other stuff and that he would have really really like a chance with me. I would have just tell him I'm sorry, but like I said I am not interested at all.



Then he would laugh it off, act like he was just joking and then he would move on with conversation. I would just try to do my work and not give him the time of day.



Then he talks to me a bit more throughout the night, continuously making those types of comments, although I kept it purely professional and platonic. He even has mentioned that he is in love with me.



He even mentioned to a friend that he was currently talking to the girl he wanted to be with, meaning me and showed me this texting conversation. I just kind of looked at it, and went back to work, giving him the cold shoulder.



So then this morning, I wake up to a text from him telling me that he dreamt of me.



I don't know, he's just taking this all very far and it's making me uncomfortable. I don't want to go to my manager and cause that type of issue, especially something so sensitive as this type of topic.



I feel like if I ignore him he'll eventually move on, especially if he's talking to her because she is gorgeous, and has a great personality and I'm hoping he'll see that. I try to cut contact unless it is in a professional manner.



I don't know, I feel like I didn't handle the situation properly, but I thought it was in good humor when he started it, that maybe he was just making a joke. Then he just kind of took it farther than I thought, because working where I have previously, I've always had issues with men flirting with me since it's customer service, and even other co-workers at the job I'm working now flirting with me.



But usually they test the waters, I let them know I'm not interested, then we go our separate ways and have no issues working together.



It also sucks, that when we close down the store we walk the same road to go to our separate homes, so he lives two houses away from me. He always watches me walk home, and will continuously make parting comments.



But I am a very docile person, and I don't really have that much courage to be rude to anybody until he really started about it, and working in customer service I always have a habit of being friendly at work.



Especially given the fact that I have severe anxiety, very prominent in social situations or talking to people.



I want to make that very clear, for anyone at who will just say oh well just ignore him, or you should have been ignoring him sooner, I understand that now.



I just struggle with talking to people in general, and I am a very shy and anxiety ridden person, so social situations are very difficult for me usually.



I am especially meek when it comes to talking to men, I don't know if it's just intimidation because they are usually bigger than me, I'm 5'2, but they kind of give me anxiety as is and being rude or cold to them right off the bat feels very daunting and makes me uneasy, so I try to be friendly. I think that's just my upbringing.

704,"Long story short, my partner has an eye condition where his sight is extremely sensible to light, so he avoids all kinds of light like the plague. On the contrary, I need every possible light source turned on or else I can't see jackshit and will surely start to stumble everywhere. When we're in a dark room, he calls it ""dimly lit"", I call it ""poorly illuminated"". When I open the curtains, I call it ""letting the sun in"", he calls it ""burning his eyes off"". So we had our altercations about it here, and there, but we still haven't managed to find some middle term. 

This had led to this particularly irritating habit of his where every time he uses any electronic device that belongs to me, he turns EVERYTHING to dark mode. And I mean EVERYTHING.

706,"So, I‚Äôve recently come to the conclusion that it‚Äôs time to break up with my boyfriend of a year and a half. It took me a lot to come to this decision, but in the end for the sake of
My own mental health I have to do what‚Äôs right. After a bit of a breakdown recently where I was signed off work, and a few counselling sessions it became apparent that our relationship has been far from healthy. For starters, I had very low self esteem and self confidence when we met- I was so desperate to have someone love me I overlooked a lot of red flags or ignored them because the fear of being alone was greater than being mistreated. Plus, how bad could it be right? He loved me sometimes. Anyways, for the first 3-4 months he was messaging other guys behind my back, arranging to meet for spooning and movie nights, or sometimes while I was lying right there in bed next to him. He‚Äôd turn his screen away, making me suspicious (another red flag) and lie saying it was his family. He also cheated on me on a works night out- brought another guy home and slept with him in the bed we shared when I stayed over. It still makes me feel sick when I think about it. But me and my low self-esteem stayed with it. In hindsight I wish I‚Äôd got up and ran there and then. He has a lot of medical conditions which are complex and I understand can have an effect on his he‚Äôs feeling e.g more often than not he has some underlying pain, how bad it is varies on any given day. But I am the emotional punchbag which he directs this anger towards and takes it out verbally. He‚Äôs never physically hurt me and I don‚Äôt think he ever would, however he can be very cruel with what he says and how he treats me. He also isn‚Äôt big on apologising, he likes to turn it around and tell me what I also do wrong and that he‚Äôs not the bad guy here, we both have flaws etc. Anyways I‚Äôve left crying in the car home more times than I‚Äôve left smiling, or we go to sleep back to back after he‚Äôs had a go at me. Recently I tried to get a bit romantic with him he told me to put my clothes back on. Ouch. This has been constant, he yells, he gets angry, rolls his eyes tells me to get off, told me to stop saying I loved him as it had no meaning. I found myself constantly walking on eggshells because saying or doing the wrong thing results in a shouting match where he‚Äôd tear strips from me and leave me feeling awful. So I‚Äôm done now, I‚Äôve realised that while I may not be the most attractive or most skinny person on this earth I have a big heart and a lot of love to give to someone who wants to receive it and give it back. I tried to break it off through text and he was having none of it, begged me to stay, sent pictures and videos of himself crying saying he‚Äôd change and he was going to fight for us. But in my heart I know I‚Äôve fallen out of love and realised I deserve so much more than how I‚Äôve been treated. Can I end things through text? Or is that horrible? Should I do the decent thing and wait until lockdown ends to do it in person? I feel like by dragging it out I‚Äôm being a bar person when I‚Äôm reality I‚Äôm trying to do the honourable thing and see him in person.",16Apr2020,2
708,"I've always had issues with my family, mainly with my mom but the older I get it gets worse and worse. my mom has been emotionally abusive towards me ever since I was 9 (I'm 18 now) but I learned to just tolerate it as it didn't happen as often. but lately the problem hasn't been my mom it's my dad, I don't know who he is anymore I've seen him get mad before and start yelling which is normal I guess but recently he's gotten physical with me (I'm a girl 120 pounds and my dad is 200 pounds) it started off small with just arm grabbing and hair pulling when I would yell over the games I would play (I have a little brother who does the same and they never say anything to him) but last night completely crossed the line. yesterday was my 18th birthday all was well until night came around, my boyfriend and I have been pretty rocky lately due to stress and anxiety from online school and the virus, so we've been arguing for a while but we always get over it and resolve it within 5 minutes. my boyfriend likes to call me when we argue to talk things out but I have a pretty loud voice when I get mad and I tend to swear. so last night we argued he called me I ""yelled"" at him my dad walked in and asked me what was wrong me being a teenager obviously I was like ""its nothing"" ""go away"" ""please stop asking"" and my dad didn't like that one bit he threatened to take my phone away so I just responded with ""okay"" and I thought that was it. boy was I wrong, I was laying down when this happened my dad decided to grab me flip me over and yell in my face about how disrespectful I was. I had my hands up to block myself from him he then hit my face and moved my arms and got even closer to my face and yelled some more (so close he literally spat on me when he yelled) so I started screaming ""you're hitting me"" and he didn't let go of my arm and kept yelling that I can do whatever I want when I'm 40 and that I don't need this bullshit from a guy he then forced me to say who I was talking to I told him my bf and he screamed that he never wanted to see him again and that I'm never allowed to talk to him ever again. He then started yelling about the house and that if I live here I have to follow their rules which then I screamed ""I'll leave"" he finally let go of me and told me I was nothing but a little girl, he then told me I was never allowed back in my room and was only allowed to be in the living room, he then said I was to sleep on the couch in the living room or the couch in my moms room. I'm typing all of this on my computer as it's the only way I could communicate with my bf about the incident. Last night was the first time on the couch it sucked I do not know how long this will go on for but I really don't wanna stay in this house anymore. Reddit pls help.   ps. sorry for any misspelling or rambling I do not have my glasses on because I couldn't go into my room and get them.

713,"could someone answer me without jokes pleas?

I had an issue with my relationship and i really need someone professional to help me. I know its too much to ask. But i would really appreciate it.

Also when I tell this story I don‚Äôt mean to show how great i was or make her the worst. Even if you don‚Äôt believe me, just pretend and judge as the story tells you.

I‚Äôve been in a relationship for half a year. And our relationship started at really hard time. First we met and after my grandpa and grandma died at once, then i had a car crash, then we lost our generator ‚ÄúIt was our secondary power source now we don‚Äôt have it‚Äù.(All those problems happen in 2 months).
and after all those problems i always tired to stay positive in front of her.

We had a couple of small fights and rules to make. With everything i said it was negative for her, i said i like you to quit ‚ÄúMake ups‚Äù and some other childish stuff. But i never, NEVER forced her to do what i want i jut advised her. But with whatever i said she was yelling ‚ÄúOkay as you wish‚Äù.


One of her rules was to never talk to another girl only her. only if it‚Äôs urgent and important thing or a job. I was okay with that. 

Until someday she told me that she will focus on her study for her big exam and we will never see each until 1 week. But the problem is i saw her online and she was on my profile (Im thinking that she was spying on me if I‚Äôm cheating or not) but I don‚Äôt think i will cheat if i give her my profile don‚Äôt you think? But yes i talked to a girl but i swear it was urgent and important because that girl asked me for help. She came back after and she told me that i cheated on her but she didn‚Äôt let me even explain why i talked to some girl, she just immediately said ‚ÄúBreak up‚Äù.

I even said that I don‚Äôt want you to be my GF again if you don‚Äôt desire it, just give me a chance to proof myself.

 Basically she left me because i ALWAYS told the truth. (Pardon my language) Once i told her I‚Äôve quit (P**n) she said no you‚Äôre a liar and she left me. I literally did everything to gain her trust back LIKE EVERYTHING. I said I‚Äôll do it with proof and will change to the man you want me to be, like just ask and I‚Äôll do it. She said ‚ÄúNo, You‚Äôre a liar and i will never listen to you again‚Äù.

I swear it‚Äôs hard for me to quit (P**n) and i did it alone with no ones help. I really did my best to satisfy her, at least i think i did!

Pleas I want you to be honest with me. I know that I wasn‚Äôt perfect in the story or right. But I think she doesn‚Äôt had any right to leave me like that easily.

I wish and hope that no one could experience my pain. NO ONE.",16Apr2020,1

721,"For the past three months my (F29) partner (M36) has been working overseas (USA) following a promotion at his company. ¬†I had encouraged him to apply for this role and the intention was for us to live overseas at some stage. ¬†Prior to this job move we were living together in the UK and had been since 3 months into our relationship. ¬†A source of tension for me had been the fact we were living in a flat outside London in an area where I felt isolated. I also had a lengthy commute ¬†and we didn't make friends in the area- something I found hard as a social butterfly. I posted about it one here one time. I digress.

Since his promotion, I've been living in London (a city I have lived in before) and have kept myself as busy as possible. I have twice been out to see him in the US which is where I started to have reservations as to whether I would be happy joining him out there. ¬†I'm currently in an enjoyable job within the charity sector in London and feel a real sense of sadness at the thought of leaving this role. I am mindful, however, that I could work in the same industry in the US. ¬†We also recognised that in order for me to join him, we would need to get married. This is something we were both concerned about rushing/doing for the right reasons but it seemed like our only option.

During the last trip to my partner's new city we discovered his holiday allowance was much lower than we had thought and a work trip cut our time together in half. ¬†The stress of this situation took its toll on us and we argued a lot during my stay. ¬†I felt annoyed that the job had come in-between us due to bad planning and didn't hesitate to let him know!¬†

Fast forward one month before lockdown and we got engaged during a holiday. ¬†Our intention was to have a quick wedding this summer so I could get my paperwork in order and join him. ¬†However, Covid19 has had other ideas! He's been on lockdown in a small apartment for four weeks and I'm very aware that he is working long hours and feeling under a lot of pressure. He is really struggling with the isolation and sheer workload and it has been really difficult for me to know how best to support him. We have fallen into a trap (which he recognises) of talking only about work-related things and him having rushed/limited conversations. ¬†It was during this time that I noticed that he was being distant and reluctant to talk about a wedding ceremony. ¬†His idea was for the ceremony to be just the two of us but this really jarred with me as I wanted family there.¬†

During an exchange on Saturday night, out of frustration, I provoked him. In particular I spelled out how much I was prepared to give up to support his career and was guilty of churning up the same old arguments about petty things- ¬†layout of the apartment, how we pay bills etc. He revealed that he's worried about getting married for a second time, especially in view of how much we argue and that he knows that I don't want to move to his new city. Our joint fear is that I will arrive and end up resenting and blaming him if things don't work out for me. ¬†I recognise this as a real issue. I felt very resentful living outside of London, even going so far as to look for alternative accommodation. ¬†I'm deeply worried about giving up my job and my lifestyle to go to a new city when it feels like I might have an uphill struggle. My challenge is how to deal with this.

We both said things that were really hurtful over the weekend. I culminated in telling him that he wouldn't have a successful relationship unless he learned how to deal with conflict and that I felt it was best that I didn't move to his city. ¬†He responded by shutting down and not being able to respond. ¬†He's now feeling deeply concerned that we argue and 'clash' too much and that he's not confident in the strength of our relationship. He thinks he has been overlooking some of our problems and now we're both really worried that we might be heading for a double whammy: a marriage (second for him) doomed to fail due to me being in a city I don't want to be in.¬†

We both love each other but we're worried that our fundamental differences and outlooks will make us destined to fail. I would love some help in dealing with the feelings this has churned up.¬†

723,"I am a young office worker. I was very good academically, and have an economics degree from a major Souther university. Not to overestimate myself, but I think I could get into good law programs, do an after degree easily, etc.

The past two years, I have been working for a small oil and gas services company. Keeping it as vague as possible, my place basically does physical logistics and trading. Like, a very small scale version of Vitol ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitol)). I currently do what we call ""scheduling"" - coordinating how we pick up the oil, move between suppliers and facilities, etc Primarily I deal with railroads and truckers - it is gritty work. Up to this point, the job pays *very* well (unsustainably so, I'd say), and I had options to move up.

However, without getting into specifics, my situation has been turned very upside down. Without getting into private business stuff, these two things are my problems

1. At a company level, the work environment is fairly terrible. Our official ""culture"" is good, decent leadership, fair pay, etc. But the actual day-to-day management sucks. It is basically complete chaos every day. Plus, I feel like there is constant shifting of blame, etc. I feel like it's not the type of thing that can go on for years and years. Most before me have quit after a year or so. Not sure if this is specific to my small company - seems better at the major companies.

Due to some internal and external stuff, I think my company is likely to hit pretty hard times soon. I don't think I would get laid off, but it definitely has a very downward hit on career trajectory, so on.

2) Long term prospects in oil and gas. My specific part of the industry is more resilient to oil prices. But seriously, is this the right path for a &lt;25 year old to do as a career? The skillset is very specific, the culture is pretty conservative, and working in a contracting industry sucks.

Just a few months ago, I was super gung ho about this all. But everything has turned on its head since then - not just related to COVID.

I do feel like, maybe, I need a bit of resiliency in my current job. I can't just keep on switching industries/careers every time something gets tough. Plus, I am paid very well.

At the same time, I feel like ""the writing is on the wall"" - both about my company, and the industry. It may be a good time to think about ripping the bandaid off.

There would be so many options out there, and I'd be afraid of 'picking wrong.' I feel like computer science is the big industry/career now, but I'm not sure how interested in that I am.

I skipped a year so I could get into med school

But still,I wasted 4.5 years of my life learning things half baked,and not even utilizing my talents or enjoying college life to the fullest or participating in events because of my technology addiction.I made 2 good friends and we had a small vlose group,though they aren't on great terms with each other always,a sore point which has always bothered me since Ive been at college. We are all introverts except one of my two friends, who I think regrets being in this group and had,in final year,found people more like her.I know she values me,but I think she feels she hasn't enjoyed college life as she should have,and mainly coz of us two(my third friend more than me,since she is more narrow minded and unwilling to try new things)

Unknowingly or knowingly, we had held ourselves and each other back from growing and trying new things.Atleast my friends learnt their med stuff better.I was distracted in all aspects. I feel more disappointed that I couldn't personally hone my knowledge,skills, or my hobbies( I did not touch my piano the time I was there.I could have done so much)

Now I'm at home with family.But, I feel so much regret for having spent that time in college when everyone enjoys or does their best either at academics or atleast,have experiences while I'm left midway.

I also feel extremely guilty that my friend would feel that I was partly responsible for her not having a good time/holding her back during college.It wasn't me much of the time, it was mostly the third friend, but I fear she wouldn't have pleasant memories of us three.
Since it is gonna get more busy for us docs,I feel because of us three different people becoming friends, none of us(I would deal somehow-I try to think I have more time later to catch up with hobbies or knowledge) really enjoyed our college life and I feel my extrovert friend might be regretting this later in life.

Its not like we didnt have good times,but..we never weny out of our comfort zones

How do I deal with this regret,and guilt?

I feel really low.

Also,the thing I dont give priority to-my competence as a doctor- I would surely make up for it and wouldn't put people at risk id I were incompetent but I still feel inadequate.

So here‚Äôs the whole gist- my dads not taking the virus seriously at all-stereotypical 54 yo man ‚Äúit‚Äôs just like the flu, young people can‚Äôt get it blah blah‚Äù..to the extent that he‚Äôs throwing himself a birthday party today and my two brothers and ones girlfriend is coming over. 
His girlfriend is nurse who works in a COVID hospital and she recently came into contact and has only been isolating for one week. When I voiced this concern to my father he said ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not showing any symptoms so it‚Äôs not a big deal‚Äù well, we all know why that is a big deal..
Anyways, he‚Äôs a type one diabetic and he‚Äôs still working and not sheltering in place (we live in Ohio for context of how serious the virus is where we are) and he‚Äôs upset with me for not wanting to go to his birthday party and the whole family is acting like I‚Äôm being over dramatic or over reacting or just making excuses not to go. While I can‚Äôt get through to how he conducts his own life and puts himself at risk I‚Äôm having a really hard time telling him I don‚Äôt want him to come over. While he can understand that I don‚Äôt want to expose myself to large groups - to him I am being mean/uncaring.. to not want him to come to see just me with my partner and I in our home (my partner is also uncomfortable with him coming considering his lack of care to isolate himself while we are )
i already have somewhat of a strained relationship so it already feels to him like I don‚Äôt love him or I avoid that part of the family (which the avoidance part is pretty true this is a pretty good example for how my parents and siblings have severely different viewpoints on the word) 
Anyways, if you got this far- I really don‚Äôt know how to get the point across to him that I care (even though I won‚Äôt celebrate his birthday with him- which birthdays have never been a big deal to me but I understand he gets excited about his own- and all my siblings and family are celebrating with him so they think I‚Äôm irrational or just bitchy for not wanting to support him while they all are) - I care but I don‚Äôt want him to come over and I still support him when he thinks this is all an elaborate excuse not to see him or that I‚Äôm being overly cautious.

733,"First things first. I don‚Äôt really want any advice like about life or myself or anything. I just want advice on this situation? Pretty straight forward....just wanted to know what his intentions are most likely to be? Ego-boost? Jealousy? Things like that. Thank you!

This is a lot to explain and I can‚Äôt really get into detail about our past or anything like that. We dated in high school. I had some awful stuff going on with abuse and CPS. So....to say the least, it wasn‚Äôt the best time for me. And I was struggling, hard. And also there‚Äôs a lot I don‚Äôt remember due to trauma.

We were mad at eachother for a couple of years. Then we grew out of it. I always felt a lot of guilt for what happened between us and what he went through with me since we dated at such a hard time in my life. And of course I‚Äôve always had deep love for him. We were each-other‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst‚Äù everything if you get what I mean. And our relationship was honestly really intense for our age both physically and mentally. Especially with outside sources.

We hung out yesterday and talked yesterday for the first time in like 5 years or so.

It went really well for the most part. There were just a few things that concerned me.

Us hanging out, we weren‚Äôt really sure where it was going to lead to. We aren‚Äôt sure if we wanna try something in the future like getting back together etc. we‚Äôre just kinda chit chatting rn.

One thing to keep in mind about Ex is that he was always considered a D-bag in school. I remember hearing that a lot of people didn‚Äôt like him cause he always had a (idgaf, f*** you) attitude. This isn‚Äôt new to me. I‚Äôve heard this before. He never was awful to me in our relationship. He treated me like a queen and had me on a pedistal and was my knight essentially. And not in a toxic way. I‚Äôve been in abusive relationships before. His was protective...but respectful. And he was always very kind to me and nothing abusive ever happened during our relationship.

BUT, he did some crazy things for me in our relationship that showed he trulllly loved me. Like we definitely had true love. We were really happy together. And when I went to the mental hospital for a bit during high school to be put in foster care. He was coming every single day and waiting to see me. Sitting outside the hospital for hours after school, during the family sessions where we could visit eachother at the hospital. (At this point I wasn‚Äôt even allowed to see him because he wasn‚Äôt on the list. And my abusive mom made sure to keep any family/friends contact limited while I was in there) I didn‚Äôt even know this. How he knew I was there was someone else from school was in the hospital (lmfao small world right?) and was able to tell their siblings to tell my ex that I was in the hospital. At this point all the workers knew him by name. He was with me every step of the way with what I was going through mentally. Even going into my first foster home. 

Anyways this is what went on yesterday. I‚Äôve been in my fair share of relationships since we broke off and I expected him to do the same. But when we hung out yesterday...he talked quite a bit about all the girls he‚Äôs banged or hooked up with all the partying he‚Äôs done and stuff and how much he goes out (and this isn‚Äôt really unusual for him. He‚Äôs always been the party type of dude. I became more of a homebody and kinda always was that way) even talked about his exes and how basically madly in love he was with them and how great they were and stuff and basically that they just ended due to minor consequences? This didn‚Äôt bother me for the fact that I was jealous. I wasn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just I found it to be a bit disrespectful to blurt stuff out like that. I mean he randomly brought up a bj he got 2 weeks before graduation. Like lol? Cool flex? But if I said anything he seemed to like be taken back about it or seem kinda down? I only spoke about one relationship (because we both mutually know the person from school and he‚Äôs kinda involved in the issue of our relationship from years ago.) and I didn‚Äôt even go into detail I just simply said. Well, I have a lot of debts and small things to clean up after being with him, it was abusive and basically got the shit beaten out of me everyday, but that‚Äôs life it happens. And then I continued from there with my life story.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if this was some tactic from him to boost his ego or make me jealous or plain just get revenge type thing? Like tug on my heart strings a bit. I‚Äôm only worrying about this cause I genuinely wanted to be friends with him again he was a very close person in my life and meant a lot to me. And he has a expressed that he feels the same way and that we will always both have deep love for eachother even if we‚Äôre not with eachother. He says mostly things of the sort that he‚Äôs wanting to see how things roll along and will see what may happen with us in the future. Which I get, and I agree. Cause I also don‚Äôt know. I just wanna see where it goes. But I‚Äôve been in a pretty toxic relationship before. And I‚Äôm trying to figure out if that was a toxic red flag or him just trying to get a reaction out of me.

He was still the same person overall though. He bought me gummy bears which he remembered are my favorite. Bought me a soda. We just walked around the neighborhood smoking and he‚Äôd kinda protected me. Make sure I was in the center of the sidewalk or help guide me which his hand on my back. Things like that. Stuff that he used to do before. But it could have different intentions now...

Lol clearly I‚Äôm very nervous about stuff at this point in my life with what I‚Äôve been through and kinda always walk on eggshells but please bare with me guys lol. My life is going well rn for once despite what‚Äôs happening in the world. And I want to keep it that way.

Some Backstory:
My father basically used to live abroad for work. He stayed 3- a month away and came for 1-2 weeks. The time he stayed here I would never look forward to, as he is a nightmare to live with, especially when he isn't working (which is all the time when he is here).

let me give a few examples of why:
Anything that is considered fun for a zoomer like me is bad.
Videogames? bad. YouTube videos? bad. Chess? bad. Using your Phone for literally anything? bad. Why? because they are a waste of time.

Due to that most of things I considered ""fun"" were banned during his time with us. It was bearable as he usually stayed for a week or two maximum.

Now that quarantine came upon us, he now has been with us for more than one month 24-22 hours a day. He never listens to anything. He is always right, and privacy isn't a concept. The door always, ALWAYS, has to be open and he enters the room randomly, because ""He can take a stroll in *HIS* house whenever he wants. ""

We live in a pretty conservative country, so the man is always right.

I really need your help/advice.
What do I do?

Edit: Im a 16 YO male if that helps.",16Apr2020,1

In the begining, all was consentual, including a lot of nervousness of course. But once i was almost in agony and begging him to stop, he wouldn't and kept saying that ""this is for your own good"" and ""you have to get through this"". For some time before that day i thought i was physically ready, but that day i learned that in fact i was not and simply wanted to stop. Afterwards, he kept trying to persuade me to try again and he didn't stop untill i agreed. I know i shouldn't've said yes, but it was the only way to shut him up. It haunts me every time I think about that day and the thought of that guy makes me feel incredibly powerless and infuriated. So, my question is: in Europe, does this classify as rape?

I gave everything I am to my ex and I for sure thought we were end game because I thought it you loved and cared for each other that much, and if you're both willing to keep working on the relationship then that's everything you need. Now he's gone and that kinda tore my beliefs about relationships.

Sometimes I'd think of how I'm gonna meet the next guy and already I'm exhausted because I'd have to go through all of it again and now that I know the things I thought were enough to make a relationship last aren't enough after all, what's the point in trying? Sure you go through the get to know phase, you tell them your secrets, family troubles, MH issues, etc. Then you'd have to work on the relationship again, adjust to each others wants and needs, work out the kinks and keep doing better-- all of that effort without the certainty that they're going to stay for real this time.

Its just, I gave so much to that relationship--as much as I could and more. If THAT wasn't enough to make him stay, what's stopping the next guy from hurting me again?

754,"I was in tenth grade and the school year was barely starting at that time when I got into a relationship with a guy from my class. We talked a lot and sent messages to each other but there was this one time where I was wondering why the message he sent was 'seen' when I was purposely ignoring that message and the last time I checked, I didn't open our chat.

Then I found out that my sister was able to open my iPad (I don't know how) and read my messages and even took photos of our conversation. She passed it off as a funny joke but I was really mad but I didn't want to take it out on her because I didn't want her telling our parents about it and have them interrogate me and put me on the spot.

I also have a friend that is acquaintances with my sister. My friend told me that my sister had asked her to take screenshots of my tweets on my private Twitter account. She also asked my friend to inform her if I was in another relationship which only made me a whole lot angrier.

And halfway through tenth grade, I got into another relationship with a girl who was also from my class. I knew my parents wouldn't take it lightly if they find out I'm into girls, so I kept it from them.

And I don't even know how, but my sister found out about all of this and decided to tell my parents. The second I found out my sister knew, I was terrified to go home. I knew I'd be a subject to an endless amount of scoldings. And of course, they talked for hours about homosexuality and how it's a sin. The only good thing was that they didn't force me to break up with her.

I sent my mom the electromagnetic spectrum chart and a couple detailed explanations from experts here on reddit that work in the field, but she just didn't want to listen. Another thing \[mainly my parents\] believe is that this is all a plan by the government to take our rights away. 

I admit I'm not tech savvy of computers. I know some basics. But I realize that 5g isn't the source of this. Now I'm afraid and I'm feeling guilty that if I don't continue to try and find a different way to make them realize the legitimacy of the virus, that it's going to be my fault. Now they don't think they have to wear masks and participate in social distancing. And they're going to help spread the virus around unless I find another way to explain to them.

764,"My father owns a four bedroom home. He moved about 2 hours away in order to live with my step mom and her family, but he wanted to keep my childhood home under his supervision for as long as possible, so he rented it out to me. I am ""technically"" the landlord of this house, considering I handle most if not all \*in-person\* issues that need to be dealt with by somebody in the house. I am only 22 and I am a college student. 

I had 5 people move in, including my boyfriend who shares a room with me.  My roommates include my best friend (haven't had any issues with her), a relative of my boyfriend (we're very close), and a childhood friend. This childhood friend has caused slight issues in the past concerning her hygiene and cleanliness, but that was the only issue we had with her for a while. Then, almost like a shift in character, everything went terribly wrong over the course of a month. 

When our state was first put under lock down, my roommate (childhood friend, we'll call her Lynn) was out of state, visiting a friend. We were already not very happy with her leaving state to see friend with the status of the World at that point, but things weren't serious enough or understandable enough to take a stand against her yet. She was with 5 people while she was out there. When she came back, I let her know that we all agreed on no outside visitors until the pandemic blows over. I was under the impression we were on the same page about staying home, but I was mistaken.

We found out pretty quickly that she was having boys over to spend the night and then she lied straight to our faces about it. This is when things started getting tense. I recall going onto a social media page of hers and seeing a post showing her in a very populated area of our city. Then she posted again, 3 hours later, at some random guys house. I texted her the next day and basically said this : Hey!  I just wanted to tell you that I have asthma and I am at risk of obtaining the virus that is going around right now. I would really appreciate it If you could be super careful when going out and honestly only go out when necessary, we've been making a lot of efforts to make sure the house is safe and sanitized. She responded with pure passive aggressiveness, claiming there were double standards. I'm a very oblivious nice person, so if your being a straight up disrespectful piece of shit, most times it flies right over my head. It wasn't until I showed my MOM was when I realized how hostile and defensive her response was, even though I was as kind as I could be. 

She ended up leaving that day, taking pieces of our community paint supplies (that she contributed nothing to) and left. We had no idea where she went, until I realized something. Her location was public on a certain social media app, she had set it to be public. She had been to 3 different places that night. I was furious. She practically responded to me by saying ""fuck you, I do what I want"". Not the best way to treat someone, especially your landlord and childhood friend. We had also found out at that point that she brought the paint to a party and they were painting on walls. 

I texted her the next day , Saturday, and said ""sorry, you've gotta make a decision. You either come back home and quarantine away from all other roommates for 14 days or you find somewhere else to stay. I'm not telling you what to do, the CDC is. "" considering my asthma was not enough to convince her to stay home. She tried veering my attention off the ultimatum by bringing up the party she went to and the people that were there and how they were being ""sketch"". I responded by saying ""I'm sorry but you still need to give me a decision by tomorrow."" She never responded. 

My patience was completely gone at this point and I knew that if I spoke one more word to her, it wouldn't go well. I have been as profession as I can possibly be and she has not only disrespected me the entire time, but accused me of double standards and LIED multiple times. I had my boyfriend text her and tell her to not come home. He said that it was probably better she didn't come back . She lied again and said ""I told \*my name\* I was coming home tonight at 10"" I had receipts to prove the lie. And she never came home at 10. Monday morning rolls around and she has been at some random guys house she met last week off bumble for 4 days straight. We even told her to stay with the guy she was with for the next month and she said it was ""too soon"" LOLOLOL. I decided enough was enough. I changed the lock on the door and I texted her.

 I told her that she had one more chance to make an option, stay home or find somewhere else, and that I wouldn't let her disrespect the people she lives with like this. Her response? ""Idk why you're giving me an option. Idk where things went wrong but why would I want to go back to a house where nobody likes me? Looks like you have more of a personal problem with me than the virus."" That was when I revoked her option, told her she no longer had the option to come get her things and that I would be packing her stuff and leaving it on the porch. She also tried throwing my other roommate (boys relative) under the bus by saying ""are you gonna tell \*roommate\* to leave too? I told her she didn't know shit. Our roommate went on a nature walk( which Lynn also did with 5 other people) with her boyfriend who is very at risk, has been under quarantine since before the pandemic even started due to a surgery and hasn't even been able to see most of his family bc of that. She said ""well, you have to understand I didn't know that before you told me. I just want to know I still have a room after all this. I don't want to move out."" Conversation was over. She made it clear all she cared about was her room, overall, not the safety of her roommates. She wasn't sorry, she was sorry she got caught. 

Thanks to social media, I could see that she stayed home Monday-Thursday. I got a text from her Thursday night that read ""hey, can I come back after 14 days of quarantining at my moms? If I have to spend one more second here I'm going to kms"". Although from a safety point a view, that should be alright, I let her know that she still needed to talk to all of the roommates before considering coming back. She made it clear she was coming back no matter what, but she would talk to them. She also told me that she signed up for postmates and something was coming in the mail for her. 

Two days later, she tells her mom she postmating and to not stay up late waiting for her. Instead, she stays the night with the guys she spent the whole weekend with. Two days after telling me she was self quarantining. My roommate wanted to catch her in a lie, so she texted her asking for the paint supplies she took. Unsurprisingly, she lied and made it seem like she was home but busy, so we couldn't come by. Her birthday was also yesterday (Wednesday) and I am 95% positive she got together with a bunch of friends but instructed nobody to post about it. 

She thinks she's coming back this weekend. What should I do? I can't just go up to her and be like ""hey we tracked your location and we see you haven't been home even though you lied and said you were so we're kicking you out.""",16Apr2020,1
765,"Me and my partner live together now and I've noticed his hygiene is really weak. He doesn't always brush his teeth, he doesn't take consistent showers.. shit like that. 

His breath is really fucking bad now, like you can smell it from a distance, it's to the point where I don't want to kiss him. I've politely told him like ""babe your breath isn't so fresh rn, do you need gum or anything"" then he gets like so defeated, and annoyed with me. Even when he does brush his teeth the smell will come back within the hour. 

The kicker of this whole situation which is causing me to really be fed up is his body odor. We actually got into a huge fight. We were in the car, he got out of his seat to run into the store. A breeze blew in and all of a sudden this nasty sour dirty ass smell hits my nostrils. I'm like wtf, but thought maybe it was an outside smell or something. We get home later, we're in our room and he's sitting on the edge of the bed playing a game. He gets up to use the restroom and again I smell that smell. His ass smell is literally seeping through his clothing onto surfaces that he sits on. He comes back in, I say to him ""babe did you take a shower today"" he's like ""why do you care""... this exchange then turns into a huge fucking argument, and he tries to make the situation out like he's in the right. I know I'm not wrong and I shouldn't even be on top of him to take care of HIS hygiene. This is affecting our sex life, and relationship.

The girl is so mother fucking persistent in getting him to get back with her but he obviously doesn‚Äôt want to since he‚Äôs been talking to me for the past nearly 10 months. I can‚Äôt help but feel like he isn‚Äôt ready to move on because of her. They were together for three years and she was his first love. I feel nauseous thinking about her as a priority in his life and the reason behind his unwillingness to give me the damn label that I want. 

His reasons for why he won‚Äôt date me sound like hulk shit to me but ultimately I have to respect them and be considerate since I care for him. 1. His first reason is that he just ‚Äúisn‚Äôt ready.‚Äù A classic excuse! How many times have I said that to get out of seriousness with someone?? Plenty! I‚Äôm not stupid! 2. He wants to focus on his goals with music (he makes music and he has a lot of potential) I really believe in him and I know he will be successful but it seems like a shitty lame excuse considering he‚Äôs been working on his goals the entire time we‚Äôve been talking and I‚Äôve never disrupted him. As a matter of fact, I have been some kind of inspiration to him (or so he claimed at one point). Finally, 3. His last really weird reason is that he is afraid he might taint the relationship once we get into something serious. What he means is that he is a jealous person and once we‚Äôre in something serious he would ask some stuff from me that i would probably see as controlling and odd. He doesn‚Äôt want me to see him as a controlling freak. Like all relationships, boundaries are set. I would respect his boundaries just as I would ask from him to accept mine. For instance, we have a lot of mutual friends and he doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable with me giving them the attention that i give him. It‚Äôs silly to me because I‚Äôm loyal but if he asked me to respect him by not being super friendly with our friends, I would. 

I think relationships are about negotiating but I feel like my feelings are being completely ignored and aren‚Äôt being considered through this entire thing. 

The other night I was going to cut him off because he told me those 3 reasons and I‚Äôm not going to beg anyone to date me. But THEN HE TELLS ME ‚ÄúITS NOT LIKE IM NOT WORKING MY WAY TOWARDS MAKING YOU MY GIRL. ITS JUST NOT A GOOD TIME‚Äù SO THIS LEAVES ME REALLY CONFUSED. I ASK HIM IF HE SUGGESTS I STICK AROUND UNTIL HES READY AND he says he knows it‚Äôs selfish but yes that is what he wants.. 

Y‚Äôall... so then I asked him if I hypothetically did that instead of cutting ties completely, where would our commitment stand. And he says it‚Äôs 100% but just no label? WHAT?

I considered myself above average financially with this job because everyone else i know in my area was making about 12-14 a hour at restaurants and stuff..

But with recent COVID19 stuff goin on... those people lost their jobs, and everyone on my timeline basically just got a pay-grade raise by filing for unemployment
 640$ a WEEK for unemployment

And these are kids, young 20‚Äôs who are in their words ‚Äúbig chillen‚Äù because they just got a raise and get paid for being unemployed, they are not out looking for replacement jobs...

Makes me wonder if it working right now is just honestly for the chumps.

I just want somebody who knows economics or taxes or life lessons to just give me some kinda reassurance that being employed is the right thing to do right now...cuz at a quick glance right now being unemployed sounds just like a paid vacation.

775,"Hi guys I am a guy in his twenties thinking of moving out in the fall when hopefully this whole event dies down. However I am in a cross road that is kind of a messed up situation. You see I help out my mom with rent. My mom is single and has to take care of me and my younger siblings. However it feels like I am sometimes treated ""poorly""

Both my siblings fave anger issues and very seldom do chores around the house. So not only do I have to pay rent. I also have to do chores around the house and clean up after my siblings and sometimes after my mom. Sometimes I would forget to do a chore due to laziness or due to me forgetting. As I also work a pretty stressful job nowadays.

However the worst things is that unlike my to YOUNGER siblings. I feel like I am treated like a child. Both of my siblings have more independence than me. They can pretty much go or do anything they want without my mom questioning them. However for me. Well if I go outside to buy groceries, she questions why I did so. If I decide to buy something for myself, she acts like I spent HER money and not mines. She always has to control what I do. Whenever I wear something she doesn't like I can't go outside. My hair is too long, she forces me to get a haircut. etc. It's now even getting to the point where I can't even play video games or use my computer. As today she told me to not use my computer and clean up my room. (Which wile my room isn't clean, it's free of clutter.)

My siblings are also another problem. Both get into arguments with my mom about doing chores. Which may be the reason why my mom seldom gets in their face about anything. But in the rare exception where she has enough. It mostly comes down to them breaking things around the house. Not only this but sadly they constantly tease me. Of course I choose to ignore them. But damn. Unfortunately I am not athletic like my two siblings so their is nothing I can do.

I am in a pretty shitty situation that I don't know if I am blowing out of porportions sometimes. But I just want to ask if any of you may have advice on this. I don't have anyone I can trust sadly and I don't want to rub my family the wrong way or do something that might ""harm"" them. Like I said I help with rent, While I think my mom can take care of herelf. She does rely on my rent to sometimes get by. And then after all they are my family.

And on another topic, rent is pretty high and getting roommates is hard where I live. Most the apartments are filled with criminals so their is that.

A few days ago she told me that she loves her bf but she really loves me to and wants me and her to become friends with benefits. I'm lenient with this because of her age. She is only 16 and not an adult yet so I might could get in legal trouble if her parents find out. 

After saying she loved me she started sending me full on porn of her and videos of her playing with herself. I didnt save none of it to my phone due to reasons but I did start complementing her on how she looked. She wanted me to send her pics but I didnt know if it would be safe for me to rn. Then we started talking about sex and what all we would do to each other and how bad we wanted to have fun with each other. 

It was just a lot that me and her talked about and sent and she admitted that this was her first time cheating but she was ok with it. I wouldn't mind having sex with her aslong as she gave me the consent and she will keep this a secret with her bf who is only 15 üòÇ. Would I get in trouble if me and her did have sex though?

786,"Hi, I posted this on the wrong sub a few days ago, and I was told this where I should go for advice. 

I (17f) broke up with my boyfriend a few months ago. We're not mad at each other and we both moved on, but we don't talk anymore. Now, my twin (17m) has always been pretty close friends with my ex. This didn't bother me at all, i'm not the type to make someone pick sides. However, recently my ex had been telling my brother lies about me. One of them was that I was spreading rumours that my brother was in love with my best friend, which is not true and never happened.

My brother and I have always been pretty close, because I don't have any other siblings, and we're the same age so we have a lot of similar interests.

Lately, however, he has started acting demeaning towards me. He would come up to me unprovoked and tell me that he heard someone say something bad about me. I would suspect that it was my ex, because of what I previously mentioned, but when i would ask him what it was, he would go on about how he was so disappointed in me and such. This has happened several times. It started getting on my nerves and honestly made me quite paranoid, i was constantly worrying about it, but I eventually held strong and just told him to leave me alone.

One day at school, I was in my online class, so I was just using my phone. I get a text from my brother. That was odd because we don't usually text each other unless it's something serious. I go to check the text and it reads ""F**k you, i'm so ashamed to have you as my sister"". This was so out of the blue and random because we were on good terms that morning. So, normally, i respond ""What?"". The rest of the convo went a bit like this: 

Him : Shut the f**k up

Me : No, you shut the f**k up, how are you texting me first and telling me that?

Him : F**k you

-He blocks me-

Ok, no worries i'll text him on his socials. I go to text him and he's blocked me there too!

The bell rings for lunch and i go to my locker. I'm furious at this point and i'm ready to scream at my brother for being a manipulative piece of shit. Our lockers are right next to each other (by last name) so this works out well.

He shows up and I immediately confront him.

Me : What the hell is wrong with you? What was that?

-He acts confused so I start to wonder if someone swiped his phone-

Him : What?

Me : Why did you text me like that? And why did you block me?

Him : I'll tell you when we get home

At this point I was quite mad because this wasn't the first time he's done this.

Me : No, you're going to tell me right now, or else I don't want to hear it. I'm done with your manipulative act.

Him : I'm not telling you now

Me : You know what, f**k you, you're not living in my head rent-free. Either you tell me now or don't ever speak to me again.

He leaves, and we haven't talked since. This happened around the end of February. We avoid each other around the house and he still has me blocked. I won't lie, I was an ass to him during the confrontation, but I don't think he was a saint either.

Honestly, I really miss talking to him, but I don't have the guts to. He‚Äôs my twin and I miss doing even the simplest things. We're both stubborn as hell and this could go on for a long time. 

What do you guys think? Any and all advice is welcome. I really want to make up with him",16Apr2020,1

788,"I (16f) have loved music since I was born.

When I was younger I played the cello but when I was 14 my parents got me an acoustic guitar. I was really excited &amp; have weekly guitar lessons in school. The lessons are fine and I really enjoy them but when I get home I am unable to practice. I panic and cannot move. So in the 2 years I've been playing I think I've only properly practised about 10 times due to fear.

I live in a pretty small house with my parents and sister so the only place I can practice is in the living room where my sister is always watching TV. I fall into sensory overload really easily so the only way I can be in this room is if I'm wearing my ear defenders or I will have a meltdown. This makes practising even harder because I can't hear what I'm playing or how loud it is/if others could hear it.

This year for Christmas I was given an electric guitar (an expensive one at that) by my father. I love it but again I find it impossible to play it because I get way too scared. 

I feel really guilty because my parents spend so much money on guitar stuff for me but I don't use it. I'm not ungrateful by any means but I worry that I come across that way because I never practice. When I think of how much money has been wasted on me I fall deeper into this feeling.

I have certain techniques down from my lessons but nothing I play ever sounds alright which stresses me out so much that I can't play.

794,"Me and my friends have an online group chat. We generally post a lot of dumb shit there, mostly jokes and planning when we want to go out.

We also talk about politics there. All of us have different political opinions. We are still friends. (yes reddit it's possible) 


Yeah we fight from time to time, but most of the time we don't since we talk about politics through memes and jokes. Jokes are jokes. You can't be mad with someone when making  jokes. We personally appreciate dark humor and as friends we don't get offended easily, even if it mocks our ideology, so there is that.

But one of my friends there, posts a lot of nazi dark humor meme shit. I mean it's bark humor, I might post one or two from time to time too. Not big deal. Right?

But lately he is just spamming this shit. Ok dude we get it. Burn the Jews funny haha. Now can you stop I want to watch a movie.

But nope. He won't stop spamming. 

Recently I found out that he is a member in an Instagram alt-right group from another friend who was like ""not big deal he is doing it for the laughs"" after explaining him my concerns.

I joined that group because I was curious. At first, I found nothing. Bunch of nationalists circle jerking the same dark humor over and over again. Big deal. Maybe my friend was right.

But there is a difference from appreciating dark humor because it's dark and appreciating dark humor because you genuinely believe in this shit. 

And that's the main difference with that group. I was 100% sure they weren't joking and what I considered dark humor is just ""humor"" to them. After looking at some  of the member's profiles (most of them were private, no shit)  I realized that they're definitely not joking.

I texted my friend (the one who told me about the Instagram group) and I said these plp are definitely not joking, and he said he knows


""Wtf does this mean?"" I told him

""It means that although there are real Nazis in this group, I've talked with (spammer friend) and he said he is definitely in the group for the laughs and nothing else."" He said.

""Yeah sure, just wait and see how that'll turn out"" I  told him.


Today the spammer told us in the group chat that he is thinking of becoming a national socialist. Yeah that's right, not a nazi,  but a *national socialist* 


My another kinda  liberal friend (he is like blue lifes matter, but he also holds very liberal ideas so I don't really know what the fuck)  tried to joke about it by posting 4 nazi outfits and asking him which one of them is gonna wear to his wedding.

And he didn't reply. He just posted "" I'm thinking of becoming a national socialist"" nothing else. No context no nothing.

This can't just be a joke. You can't even call it dark humor. It's just a statement. Wtf. 

So. I don't know what the fuck. 

1) Either he is just joking. Or he wanted to write a joke. Posted it half way through, got bored. Didn't posted, didn't give a fuck if it  made sense because who cares, and just went on his day. I have personally done this some times.

2) He is a nazi supporter and he just announced he is in fact, a nazi.

3) The friend who I told him Im concerned, talked with the spammer and now they're just pranking me into believing that the spammer friend is a nazi.


We are 5 people. I know my friends for a long time. The spammer friend is a really nice, interesting and good kid in real life. I don't want him to turn into an alt right fanatic  . 


What am I supposed to do. Am I supposed to do anything in the first place? Should I wait? Should I talk with the spammer friend and tell him about my concerns?

799,"I need help with something that keeps bothering me. I'm 18 and next year is my last year at High School which I'm happy I'll finally get to, because then I can finally stop seeing this person that annoys the shit out of me! It's a girl that I went to middle school with, and she hasn't stopped bothering me ever since then. 

A couple of years ago, we were in the same class. Not now, luckily, but I keep seeing her around the school, because that is where she goes to also. She always looks at me like if I'm something disgusting. Our history isn't really that great and I think we can both agree for each other that we don't really like each other at all! But still, she doesn't leave me alone.

She started to look at me weirdly, like she does now and one time she called CRAZY. I'm not even exaggerating. But she kept saying really mean things to me, and was just a really disrespectful person. She kept digging herself into my private life, which I know now is not ok at all. I'm a really shy person and was also that back then, so I didn't really have any confidence to tell anyone, and I know now that, that is a weak spot on my side. But yeah, I didn't really have a lot of friends back then, and plus it didn't seem like they cared at all of how much she was bothering me, because they wouldn't say anything, like ask me if I was ok, or something like that no matter what she did to me! NO, I HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS ALL ON MY OWN! Even the teachers didn't do a shit! So I got mad of course! Firstly I tried to ignore it as much as I could, because I thought that maybe one day she would back the fuck off, but she didn't. 

Then I tried to be friends with her along with some of my other friends (stupid idea I know, but I didn't know any better). And in order to do that, I had to change everything about myself, because if I didn't she would comment on that, or stare at me again. Even those things that you can't really change. Like if u sweat a lot! I did! And it was so embarrassing. Like: WHAT DID SHE REALLY EXPECT? DID SHE THINK I WAS AN ALIEN OR SOMETHING?!! Anyway, she and my friends, which was her friends also knew each other very well from the start, and she didn't behave like that to them. It was just this really strange vibe I got from her. Each time I talked to her, she would act as if I had just yelled at her or something like that, because she would scream back at me, and I would just go home from school and ball my eyes out. Like, I don't know if that was her way of trying to make me talk more...? I highly doubt it. Or trying to be ""friendly"" but who does that? Especially with someone u don't know very well. 

So yeah, It kind of worked, but still I had a feeling that she hated me. Everything about that time period was just really messy. I didn't act like myself at all, and I did all of that just so I could make someone that HATED me to like me. But I'm never going to do that again. NOPE! I'M SO DONE WITH HER!

Maybe you can call me weak, and stupid for not getting to know a lot of people, and finding this frustrating. Go ahead. Call me a dramaqueen as much as u want!! :( 

So now I have no idea what to do. I've tried of course to tell her to back the fuck off if she doesn't like me, but she doesn't seem to understand, and it's so frustrating. She just keeps looking at me angrily. Almost like I've done something terrible to her, but I don't know what her problem is. And I've tried to make her tell me what her issue is, but she never does! But yeah, she is the only one that has done this to me. I've also told my parents about this chick and they are just as annoyed as I am. I haven't told my friends how I feel about her, but they don't seem to care either it seems like. They probably look at her and sees her as this beautiful girl with a singing voice.

800,"Any suggestions for hand pain when writing, breaks are not an option well they are but in school, they are not. we literally write the whole 45m non-stop and my hand starts hurting at like 30m and I start forcing myself to write with pain which I think is probably bad. Also, one time I had an injury on the hand I write with. A cut that gone straight to the bones cutting a lot of important stuff. After that my hand started to like literally start fainting but after some months it stopped which I am really lucky for.

So do you have any suggestions to reduce the pain. I will try switching to my left hand. I did it once when my writing hand was healing so I had to write with my other hand but that was +8 years ago so so I will do it twice but might take time. Any suggestions.",16Apr2020,1

804,"I live in an apartment with my fiancee, and it has extremely thin walls. It's easy to hear things through them. 

One of our neighbors we share a wall with is a Chinese family, who do not speak much English. This is fine normally, but does make it intimidating to talk about issues with them as there is a lot of potential for misinterpretation and confusion.

They have an adult son who has some form of mental disability. He occasionally, for whatever reason, bursts into screaming fits, just yelling at the top of his lungs in Chinese, which is very loud through our thin walls. When we discovered this problem early on, all the father did when we asked if everything was okay, was point to his head and say ""Not right there."" We don't understand anything about the disability, what the effects are, or how he's treated beyond the fact that he used to get in a van to go to a special school. We're assuming the best in absence of evidence otherwise.

Normally, this is not a huge issue, but since quarantine, these yelling fits have become much more common, and both he and we are home more. He screams during the night, with no pattern, so we can't sleep around it. The fits last up to an hour at a time, and multiple can happen in one night, and often do. Earplugs do not help very much.

We want to be understanding and certainly don't want to get these people thrown out, but it is seriously affecting our sleep and our mood. Can you think of anything we can do that would help our situation?",16Apr2020,1

I‚Äôve been working since I was 16 years old and starting at 17, my mom didn‚Äôt buy me clothes, shoes, and food. (Grandparents use their food stamps to buy the food) 

I‚Äôve been paying my expenses such as my dogs vet bills and food, car, water bill, phone, and my own clothes and shoes since 17.  I‚Äôm currently working and a student. 

This year with the stimulus checks, I begged my mom not to claim me and explained to her why. (My car is over 20 years old, I need a new car, my job is on furlough and my dog is sick. I‚Äôve racked up debt.) 

Two weeks ago, she finally did our taxes. I asked her again not to claim me and to tell the person doing them to mark me independent. I was sitting right next to her as she did this via phone. 

Right in front of me, she claimed me, didn‚Äôt bother to correct the lady in saying not to. I attempted to speak and she would mute the phone and yell at me And I left the room furious. 

When I came back, she took the woman off speaker phone, however I was able to overhear and found out the reason she claimed me was because she would‚Äôve had to pay the IRS. 


I was furious but let it go. 

This week, my mom comes up to me saying she received her stimulus check and I haven‚Äôt so she will call the lady who did our taxes to correct this. I was LIVID I told her because she claimed me I won‚Äôt get a cent. (My income tax was spent on paying my credit card and the vet) 

She told me I was wrong because she never got the extra $ 500 per dependent. 

During this argument, my grandma sat me down and said I should ignore it and leave it alone. That I helped my mom with her debt. But what about my debt? 

My mom claims she knew nothing about the way the stimulus checks worked but the woman literally said via phone before all this, said I won‚Äôt get anything since she‚Äôs claiming me.

823,"Hey,

Just to give some background, my girlfriend and I live in an apartment building in Ottawa. The first time I saw our neighbour it was when he knocked on our door months and months ago asking for a few eggs and saying that he would pay me back. I gave him the eggs and he was very grateful and went about his business. Seemed like a normal enough guy and whenever I saw him when I was going to work or whatever he would say hi. One day on my way back from a night shift, I was passing by his apartment and there was an absolutely cracked out white guy standing in front of his door and knocking and saying he needed his shit. I wrote it off as a random nutcase which isn‚Äôt really out of the ordinary for the area we are in so I just kept it moving and went home.

The problems really started showing when the coronavirus stuff really picked up speed and all the non-essential workplaces closed. I have seen (and heard) that crackhead by his door numerous times. At this point I assume that he‚Äôs dealing drugs from his apartment (although that seems like a terrible idea) and don‚Äôt want to have any contact with the neighbour anymore. We have just kept to ourselves and only really left for essential stuff like groceries and the occasional LCBO run.

The last time we were on one of our booze runs, we heard screaming as soon as we stepped out of the LCBO. It was our neighbour. He‚Äôs crouched there barefoot and laughing and yelling and before we could even react, he saw us and ran over and started babbling and then took off still talking to himself and laughing. At this point we said to ourselves that either he‚Äôs got some kind of mental break going on or he‚Äôs cracked out too.

Last night we heard him screaming and yelling angrily in the hallway so we jumped up and locked the door. He was marching up and down the hall and stopped in front of our door and said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI know the guy who lives here‚Äù and then started knocking but then kept going down the hall. We shut off all the lights and my girlfriend went to sit down away from the door, I stood near the door just to make sure nothing crazy happened. I heard him coming back slowly and he knocked again, didn‚Äôt say anything, and then our doorknob turned 3 or 4 times. He tried to open our door. 

I wanted to call the cops but we would have had to go downstairs to let them in (we don‚Äôt have a buzzer set up) and not only was it not exactly an enticing idea to stroll past this guy who just tried to get into our apartment, he would know that it was us that called and it‚Äôs scary to think about someone who‚Äôs not in their right mind knowing that we called the cops on him. Im not sure if this is a post more suited for r/legaladvice or if it‚Äôs fine here but I‚Äôm just wondering what our options are because it was quite scary.

825,"Some background (I'm sorry if it's a little convoluted, I'm exhausted)

I grew up in a home with a mother with Borderline Personality Disorder, BiPolar Type 1, PTSD and dissociation, who was emotionally very abusive. My mother was on some medication when we were younger and apparently she exhibited ALL the side-effects and instead of being taken off the medication, she had her dosage increased. This increased the frequency of incidents surrounding emotional and physical abuse (to the point where concerned neighbors called the police to check on us and we were told to deny everything). She's off that medication now, but I will address this in a moment. My father is clinically depressed and tends to avoid conflict so behaviorally, the culture of my home was ""her way or the highway."" Being the oldest I basically took all the heat for anything that could possibly set her off and had to act like an adult and make sure their homework was done, laundry was done, dishes were done, they went to bed on time, woke up on time... etc. and when I got married that burden shifted to sister #1, then when sister #1 moved abroad to school, sister #2 started taking the heat. Sister #3 also lives at home. Sisters #1 and #2 are also vegan so they have separate food purchases that my mother fixates on and uses to justify anger and aggression towards them. 

My grandfather (who I was very close to) was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia and ALS last June and died Sunday at 1:30 am. Before this, my grandparents moved in with my family so that they could be taken care of instead of being put in a home. Before this, my grandparents would take the kids to school (I didn't have a car) and they would purchase our textbooks and provided some semblance of stability in our lives.. We're very close to them. My grandfather was my biggest fan and encouraged me to go to school for music and was just the sweetest man, so when my husband and I  received a call on Wednesday that my grandfather was transitioning, we arranged plans to drive out and see him before he died. Thank GOD I was able to make it, I don't think I could have lived with myself if I didn't have a chance to hold his hand and say goodbye before he went. 

This ties together I swear, I'm just having a difficult time processing.

With all of this happening, we're staying with my folks in their new home and it seems that my mother is reverting to her older habits with dumping the responsibility on to my shoulders while also finding any reason to lash out at my sister. Example, my husband and I are very religious so I asked him if we could read scriptures and say our prayers before he went to bed early and my mother got upset because she and my dad apparently don't do that... but then that's somehow my sister #2's fault and she started scream/crying at sister #2. So I tried to help. I have a fear of confrontation, but I hate seeing my sisters flinch more. I very politely told my mother that it wasn't sister #2's fault and that I was sorry if I offended her, but then my mother launched into a tirade about how she does so much for sister #2 and sister #2 is ungrateful, and then lashed out at me and accused me of talking back to her and went on about how ""\[she'd\] never dream of talking to her mother that way."" Then she stormed out. Then an hour later she came back in sobbing and started ranting about how everything was MY fault. And I'm forced (by my father) to apologize (????) and I try to diffuse the situation. She immediately stops sobbing and walks out.

With my dad, he's a wreck. We have a very good relationship and I'm trying to support him in every way I can. It's his father who passed away and they were also very close. There was a shelf in their shower that broke so I took him to get some loctite so we can fix the shelf, I went and bought stuff for s'mores so we could do something he loved in their backyard, we worked on fixing a door together... I've been trying to spend time with him and support him through this and I'm worried that my mother is getting in the way of my dad grieving. 

This is one of countless examples of my mother's behavior in the past few days. There's always something. 

Oh and this morning, 6:00am, she was yelling at my dad and crying about how everyone is treating her like she's still on that medication that she's no longer on. We don't! But we DO constantly have to walk on eggshells when we're around her.

The whole point of us coming out here was to see my grandfather and start the grieving process and I'm so angry because I feel like I'm not able to grieve because all of my emotional energy is going into dealing with my mother and keeping my sisters out of the line of fire and in supporting my dad. What do I do? Thankfully we leave tomorrow afternoon, but I'm exhausted. I have a research presentation to prepare and a separate research paper to finish by tomorrow evening (which means tonight) and I'm having a hell of a time focusing and I can't access my feelings.

827,"Here is the situation I am in: I am very close with the victim of a sex offender. This victim is now an adult, but the offense occurred when they were a teenager. The sex offender was their teacher. She raped 3 students, served 4 years in prison, and was released in September on parole.

In my state, sex offenders can have social media profiles but must report each one and give their log-ins or it is a registry violation. This offender has a Facebook &amp; TikTok. Facebook does not allow sex offenders to use it--I reported the Facebook to the registry a few months ago and nothing was done.

I saw they have a TikTok about a month ago and was really like--what the fuck? That's definitely mainly used by teens and not something I could justify as being used to keep in touch with family or whatever. It looks like she follows minors on there. I reported that too through the sex offender registry tip line. Nothing was done. No response from registry. No confirming that it'd be looked into. Her friends list is private so I can't confirm she's befriending minors on Facebook but I can confirm from likes on photos that she's befriending former students.

I was reporting this for one of two reasons:

1. Making sure parole officer knew of her accounts if she wasn't reporting them.
2. Making sure someone investigated to see if she was already back at it befriending and grooming minors.

I'm not sure what to do since I don't have any evidence of wrongdoing, but I also don't have any confirmation that someone looked into it.

The victim I know submitted a victim impact statement at her last parole hearing and I worked with him on it, so the parole board knows my name. For this reason I don't feel super comfortable contacting them directly--I want to stay anonymous as much as possible. I have an anonymous email I've used to submit the registry tips. Should I contact the parole board directly if it seems like the people at the registry aren't doing anything, or just let it be? I don't want to be overdramatic. Since I am so close to this victim (my best friend since childhood) I don't know if my hatred for her is making me overreact, or if I'm taking proper actions to make sure some other kid doesn't have to go through what my best friend did.",16Apr2020,1

839,"I [17M] had been looking for a first job in the past few months to make some extra spending money. I didn't want to work too many hours and have it interfere with my hobbies, school, and my girlfriend. I just wanted something to do on the side and maybe save up for a new guitar.

I put in applications at a few local grocery stores and movie theatres and I didn't have much luck. I didn't get a call back from anyone. Then a good friend of mine who works at Arby's said they needed tons of people because they're short on workers. I didn't want to work in fast food at all, but I decided to give it a try.

I put in an application and they called back. I did great at the interview and they hired me soon after.

The first two days were orientation days. But I later started working the fry station.

The first few times I worked were slow days and everything went pretty smoothly.

Then yesterday, I started realizing that this job is not what I thought it would be. 

Yesterday was super busy, I'm talking orders every 5 seconds. I'm the only one working the fry station. I have to do 10 things at once, by that I mean fill 5 fry orders, make the fish, make the chicken, mozzarella sticks, stock the freezer, bag the food, make milkshakes, run it to drive thru and clean the floors all at once.

I never even took a second to breathe during my shift and worked full pace the whole time. And the few minutes of free time we had I spent cleaning the fryer or mopping the floor. 

Then my friend texts me today saying the manager was kinda mad because I was ""just standing around doing nothing."" Which is far from the truth. There wouldn't have been a wait if we had someone else working the fry station with me, but they're too cheap and under-staff all the time. The workers work 25 more hours than they're supposed to on average due to a lack of employees.

Now I'm mad because I bust my ass and they want to talk shit even though they spend 15 mins on their phones while I stay past my shift to stock the freezer.

I'm gonna call and say I'm quitting because fast food is terrible to work; I smell terrible and it's hot. I don't work many hours so it's no big loss. They also said they pay bi-weekly and it's been three and a half weeks and there is no paycheck money in my account yet. And I'd rather stay away from that right now because of the pandemic; I don't wanna risk anything and get my family and girlfriend sick.

I'll just wait until the virus thing ends and maybe find something better and cleaner like a grocery store or retail because this is a waste of time and energy.

I just want to know what to tell my friend because I think he seems mad even though it's not my fault. He referred me to work there. I don't wanna look like a douche, but at the same time, I'm done with Arby's.",16Apr2020,1

About 11 years have passed, I still haven't forgotten her. I think she has a boyfriend now. Is it still possible for me to be her romantic partner or get back to her?

843,"I have a $99 monthly mobile phone bill with AT&amp;T for my small business. I am unable to operate at this time, bleeding money. I want to hang on to the number just in case, for when things hopefully go back to normal. 

I still owe $466 on the phone itself, which my business has the cash to pay off. I could then hopefully sell the phone (iPhone XS) online. My goal is to add the business number as a second line on my personal phone via a more affordable app.

There seem to be a lot of options, but I'm looking for the best, most affordable, and smallest chance that there will be any technical difficulties during the process that may lead to losing the phone number.

844,"Don't know if there is a better place for this, but couldn't think of the specific subreddit so here we are. First post in this sub, please be kind. Also yes, another coronavirus-related post, sorry not sorry. 

I'm moving in to a new apartment soon, and basically every apartment building/complex in my area has amenities (pool, fitness center, conference rooms, etc.), and these amenities are currently closed to residents due to COVID-19 precautions. I think I'm within reason to try ro negotiate the advertised rent down since access to those amenities are part of the reason why rent is what it is. But so far a lot of places I've asked this question straight up just said no (saw in other post on some online forum that these amenities are *technically included for free to residents, and the rent is just for the room, which is BS but that's the argument). 

Obviously these closures are not the properties' fault, but access to these features are reasons to lease a certain apartment that are not being fulfilled. And yes, I realize these real estate companies have to make their money too, but I would also be moving in sight unseen (virtual tours are not the same) and assuming all of the risk in what is likely going to be a long term economic downturn. 

I was wondering if I actually have a leg to stand on in this issue/if there is a better way to ask for reduced rent due to lack of access to amenities.

845,"Just wanted to say that I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but frankly I just kind of need to get my thoughts out.

My sort of girlfriend who is 18 now and has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder among other things learned this morning that she failed her senior year mostly due to her missing so much of it. She was really sad and she called me and she invited me on a walk. At this point she had already mentioned wanting to kill herself through text but I didn‚Äôt pay too close attention.

I get there and I see she has been crying and she is writing something in her car. She writes a letter and seals it in an envelope and then puts in my passenger side door and tells me to come out the car. I figure I would read the letter later. She brought with her pens and paper. We sat down after walking for a bit.

She was going to kill herself today had I not been there. She told me to walk back and she would catch up because she needed a moment alone. I said I would wait for her but then she said no it‚Äôs fine. She changed her mind last minute and began sobbing in front of me and revealed she was going to kill herself and she wrote me a suicide note. She was going to write the other one for her best friend. Anyway time passes and I‚Äôve been put in a weird situation, and on top of that, we had also been smoking weed so I was trying to get my thoughts straight. My mistake was that I revealed to her that I was going to tell someone because I now realize that might push her to do it faster. 

But anyway I called her mother and told her. Now she has blocked me on every form of media and has sent some messages like ‚Äúgo to hell‚Äù and all that. My rationale is that had she died our relationship would be over and worse so I think I did the right thing.

Idk I‚Äôd appreciate some thoughts on what I did wrong and all that",16Apr2020,10
846,"So my mother in-law moved in with us again....let me start from.the beginning when she first moved in.
She moved to our city to be closer to her grandkids cause we just had our first child, so we offered our house to her until she built up enough money with her new job to be able to move out. We were kind enough to pay all utilities aslong as she helped with groceries and other necessities. 
In the end she never paid for anything üòë. She brought home groceries maybe once, she did buy us lunch now and again which was nice but that was it. 
I have a 9 month old son and here I am still doing everything around the house she rarely chipped in. 
Eventually she got her own place, what a relief.....
But sadly it wasn't over we eventually found out the place we were renting was a pile of shit so we sadly had to move in with her until we could find another place, it was fine in the beginning I did everything again to show her I appreciate her allowing us to stay in her home. It was fine for a while I didn't complain I just thought of it as playing my part in this living situation. Soon my husbands step father came into town and she turned into a total bitch, he only was around two days and in that time she was horrible cause we spent time with him and I couldn't cook for her. We moved out the end of that month we couldn't do it I was pregnant with our second and didn't need to have that stress for me. A month before we moved out she had lost her job and we had given her 12,000 in total of funds to help her(we will never see it again, that was from us saving our child's tax benefits so it's not even money for us it's for our boys) 
It didn't effect us financially luckily but I would like to see at least some of it back.
But anyway we moved out and found a nice little co-op with a two bedroom town house. It was perfect for the four of us then his mother came along...again.
She moved in end of October 2019 and let's just say I don't know how much more I can take, we said we might try a year but honestly I don't think we will survive hahaha.
She moved in and never appreciated anything my husband or I did, we moved all her stuff in her storage unit and whatever she brought here and still no thank you.

Quick note: my husband is in his first year of school and he took it from home so his office space was in the basement.

Now that my mother in law's room is in the basement she can't go down when my husband does his school cause it'll disrupt him and he doesn't want his mother over his shoulder during school, so she inevitably has to stay with me in the living room with the boys(the boys don't go upto their room often to play). She just sits on her phone all day doesn't play with the kids doesn't ever help with supper unless it Involves grating the cheese she can snack on, she is supposed to be looking for work and she maybe looked a total of a couple days if that. 
So she never cooks she never cleans anything nor does she even fold her own fucking clothes, she just sleeps with them in her bed. 
She constantly tries to parent my children and I fucking don't appreciate it those are my boys. 
I am missing alot of things right now I am just so angry with it I can't get it all to fit properly while writing it down. 

But today was the last straw for our patience with her, she watched a series we only watch together...she watched it alone last night and has been supper bitchy at us today cause last night I was angrily sweeping and she knows it's cause I was mad she didn't sweep after dishes, the jobs go hand in hand. 

I just don't know how to handle this anymore I want her gone I have depression as it is and I feel I can't even emit my feelings to her without judgement.

The problem is that he is in a more advantageous position for various reasons. He is like this with everyone, his character is very difficult, he always responds badly, he is always sulking etc, but apart from that our company works by departments and in the end nobody has to endure it all day, so time That coincides with the others, the treatment is cordial, and if someone takes a border, they will run away. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I am more in direct contact with him and I spend a lot of time with him, the rest of the department have been lucky enough to go unnoticed or that I know. But the case is that I entered very excited in the company and very good vibes, following the jokes and the good atmosphere, but soon the jokes stopped being reciprocal and only came towards me. To give an example, I've screwed up the typical fuck, or look how bad I have done this hee hee ha ha has gone directly to blame me for everything that goes wrong or directly **to search conscientiously in my work for things to throw at me**. **And tell the boss (that is the worst)**. Apart from jokes that end up wearing me out, in addition to damaging my image within the company, since for example their jokes and contempt at the end are the feedback that colleagues from other departments receive, who have even begun to think that I am a calamity or a ""package"". 

After eight or nine months there was nothing left of the illusion that I had on the first day of work, and already the following months I am unmotivated and reluctant, to the point of affecting my health and obviously my performance at work. In fact I have even thought about leaving the job on several occasions, but I can't because it is a good job apart from that, but I am looking for other jobs to see if I find an alternative.  So I can't argue with him, because I'm the only one who lives it, and others would think I'm crazy or something. In addition to the fact that he has a little more experience than me, and due to certain decisions within the company, he entered into a project that served as a ""shuttle"" and was quite successful, so in the eyes of the boss and other department heads the is more valuable than me.

854,"I made a post the other day and this is a bit of an update. Basically my Mom knows someone who knows the CEO of a company(I will call #1). The CEO said he could take on another intern and I ended up interviewing and they said they would be in touch with a start date.

Well a month went by and I asked them if there was any info on what was happening. I took the initiative to contact them and they said they would let me know in the summer when it would start. I still haven't even heard anything and I am realizing that this place is bad at even keeping in touch. I get that people are busy during COVID and stuff but at least update me.

I also don't think there is reason for me to even ask again since I got my answer and was told they will contact me. So I decided to apply for a different company(I will call #2) and they got back to me within 2 days. These people called me and were super responsive and good about everything.

They offered me basically the same type of internship and seem to be more organized. They also didn't take forever to get in touch with me and communicate what was going on with me. I haven't signed anything with #1 and there is no proof/evidence that I am even starting there which has me wanting to go to #2 more than anything since there has yet to even be an intern process with #1.

\#2 also seems to be more organized with their internship program and seems to show initiative and interest in me as a person. #1 feels more like they are just having me be an intern because of connections I got, not because they would have originally chosen me.

856,"So I‚Äôve been wanting to get a dog for a LONG time now. I‚Äôve discussed it with my bf several times. 
With the whole stay at home thing happening now I thought it would be a good time and I‚Äôve been looking into it more seriously. 

I made it clear to my bf that I want to adopt and I want a pit bull. He always says he‚Äôs okay w that. 

I show him the dog I‚Äôm interested in on the shelter page. She‚Äôs a 5 yr old pit bull, about 60lbs. He says okay. 
I asked him over and over and over again before I go. He says he is sure. 
I call him while I‚Äôm at the shelter. I explain to him that she has heart worms and that I can only foster to adopt right now and she will be officially adopted when she is medically all clear. He says yes, okay. Get the dog. 

I bring the dog home. He seems okay. 
I go to the store w her to get pet supplies and then come back. He‚Äôs all sad.

After denying that anything is wrong he tells me that she is bigger than he thought she would be and that he is scared of her.  He explained that he thought I would be going to foster a dog, not adopt. He is upset that she is not a puppy (he knew she was about 5 yrs old) and that we wont see her growing up to train her. He is afraid of her being a pit, and tells me that he‚Äôs been scared of my family dog (also a pittie) when we have visited my mom even though he‚Äôs played w him and he is a sweet, sweet dog.

864,"Hello beautiful people of Reddit,
I‚Äôm hoping someone will take pity on me and maybe help. This is going to sound more ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù than I intend so thank you in advance for bearing with me.

I‚Äôm a college student in IL, US, and just got out of toxic relationship with an emotionally abusive ex who raped me. Over a decade ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, couple years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD, and several days ago I was diagnosed with PTSD. That backstory will make more sense in a bit. 

I‚Äôve been going to therapy and it‚Äôs only helping a bit but I got thinking about an emotional support animal. I have no means of earning money and don‚Äôt know what my future looks like (with me graduating) so I thought fostering would be the perfect idea. I have all this love in my heart and all this time and will to take care of a cat (I love all animals but my cat‚Äîshe was part of my family for 15 years‚Äîdied a few months ago). The place I‚Äôm fostering from would pay for the food and litter and everything.

Thing is, my apartment building isn‚Äôt pet friendly. In order to have any pet, I need to pay hundreds of dollars. But, there would be no charge for an emotional support animal. My lease says, ‚Äúlandlord will authorize a therapy animal or emotional support animal after first receiving a written affidavit from a qualified healthcare professional verifying the tenant‚Äôs disability under Section 504 of the Fair Housing Act or relevant provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act and the need for a therapy animal or emotional support animal.‚Äù So basically a letter from a licensed healthcare professional with an official letterhead and signature stating I have a disability and that an emotional support animal is recommended. 

I realise that requires work and I wouldn‚Äôt be asking if I weren‚Äôt desperate. My psychiatrist is at the university‚Äôs healthcare Center and they have a policy against writing letters for an emotional support animal. My therapist charges $70 for a letter. And rightly so, being a qualified professional requires years of experience and a shit ton of money for tuition. That and it takes time and effort to write a letter. At the moment, I can‚Äôt afford it. I can‚Äôt even afford therapy or doctor appointments (to figure out why I‚Äôm in pain). I talked to my university‚Äôs counselling Center and women‚Äôs resource Center and no one can write that letter for me. I also checked the official site for registering for an emotional support animal and that also costs money I don‚Äôt have.

To clarify, there‚Äôs this particular cat I want to foster, Molly, and just reading about her filled my heart up with this joy and love that I haven‚Äôt felt for a while. While I‚Äôd be requesting Molly as an emotional support animal for myself, I am in a place to provide her with a warm and nurturing home until someone adopts her or I move.

TL;DR
I am a broke college student in need of a letter from a licensed healthcare professional documentation that I have a disability and an emotional support animal (not a service animal) is recommended. If you, or if you know anyone who, would be willing to write that letter for me, please PM me. I can even provide prior documentation. I‚Äôve exhausted all options and I‚Äôm hoping this is legal üòÖ thank you for reading and hearing me out!",16Apr2020,1

So now she wrote again and she responds poorly and all this situation pisses me off,i assume htat if she writes to me she propably is interested at least in holding some conversation,i asked her if she wants come to talk and chill with my dog and my parents,she said yes and then no and now i dont know if she plays some game,or just want my attention ,it makes me feel bad

867,"Hi. I made a new account for this. 

I'm really nervous about direct communication. It's something I am improving my awareness of and beginning to work on. But I mention that because I need to have a difficult conversation with my roommate and I need some advice.

I moved in to her NYC apartment in November. I never signed the lease, but I did pay 1 month's rent as a security deposit. So in NYC, I'm what is called a month to month tenant. I can be asked to leave with 30 days notice, but I can *basically* leave any time. I don't want to be an asshole, though, especially because she lost her job as a bartender. She has indicated to me that she is making a lot of money through unemployment insurance, but no one likes to be stuck with full rent.

Sheltering at home with my roommate has been an unexpected stress. We never used to spend this much time together, and I really just want to get my own apartment (one I've been saving up to rent)--I want to move out by June 1. One of the things that scares me about having this conversation is our mutual inexperience with conflict. We had a minor conflict over, I don't know, how to wash the coffee dripper, and it turned into a stressful, defensive conversation. 

I am anticipating pushback, I'm anticipating my roommate getting very upset with me, and I just don't know how to bring the topic up without making it seem like I am sabotaging her. I just want privacy, especially because I'm a teacher. I want to move out sooner so that I can teach my last month of school in private, but we're here now.

868,"I (39m) met this guy (35m) almost 15 years ago - we worked as bartenders at a chain restaurant, and had a lot of fun. We always knew that we had different beliefs, but it was never an issue; we always respected each other. We often talked about bigger-ticket items, not trying to change the other‚Äôs minds, but just to discuss: atheism/religion, having kids/not, business ethics, guns, same sex marriage, abortion... you know, the good stuff!!

He was raised in a Christian family, and still holds onto a lot of those views - he thinks being gay is ‚Äòun-natural‚Äô and one time told me that he really believed Noah had an arc that carried 2 of each animals. Anyway, I‚Äôm getting side-tracked!

A couple weeks back we got into an argument about politics. He‚Äôs a tRump fan, and I think the guy represents everything that is evil and wrong with this country. We both own our own businesses, and we were discussing how these COVID-19 disaster loans/grants would work. Eventually, it turned into him explaining how great Donald tRump has handled this, and how Obama or Hillary would have destroyed the country. I disagreed, and said that I thought they had some political experience, and would probably do alright... also, I thought tRump had done an embarrassingly horrible job, AND I was also upset that he was putting his kids in charge of stuff that should be left to scientists. He went on to ask if I‚Äôd seen the Apprentice, and how the Donald always made the right calls, even the difficult ones... then he asked what experience Obama had, other than being president... or what experience HRC had, other than being married to a president. 

Those questions just ripped me up. 

This friend of mine is smart... I mean, he was being serious here, but I swear, I know him as a very savvy and smart guy!! Anyway, he gave me the common bs that the GOP stands for - he hates Bernie, socialism is evil, the stockmarket is up, people making minimum wage should try working harder... all that noise. We went back and forth for a bit, until I got so frustrated we had to stop. 

I punched back with counter points to everything, but I could tell that we were both just saying words, and thinking that the other person was an idiot.

I love him and his little family - he has a wife and 2 kids who I adore. We‚Äôve been there for each other for lots of stuff - family crisis, business issues, girl problems, double-dates, weddings, good, bad, and the ugly. Other than people I went to elementary school with, he is my longest-running friendship. Probably the best friendship that I‚Äôve had since after school.

Anyway, the question - I was scheduled to get married this summer, and this friend was going to be in my wedding party. I had to reschedule the wedding because of COVID-19, and am really just wondering... should I still have him be part of it?? We‚Äôve rescheduled for the same weekend in 2021, so I‚Äôve got plenty of time. Is this a friendship even worth hanging on to at all??",16Apr2020,2

874,"I love skating and I am serious about that although I only skate for one year after 31 but I‚Äôve already got some major accomplishment. And in last June 2019 I was going to L.A. Fitness in Stoneham MA to work out and improve my mussels of core and lower body. The first day I went to that gym I can feel some weird atmosphere like people are smirking at me which give me a thrill so I wear a baggy white tee the next day instead of the workout tank on the first day. And on the second day when I was in the locker room I can hear a white girl with a pony tail who‚Äôs not faraway from me with her friend talking very loudly said ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt look too easy so that guys won‚Äôt...(the rest are inaudible and I feel weird about that but I didn‚Äôt think a lot at that time)‚Äù. And the third day the same girl who‚Äôs skinny and with dark circles under her eyes, around 5‚Äô3‚Äù, blonde hair with dark roots standing beside me when I was changing in the locker room whispering beside me said ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs here for sex‚Äù and I was like ‚Äú What‚Äôs wrong with you, and I am really not in the mood of talking‚Äù and just put the ipods in my ear and go. And the rest of the week are peaceful, I work out a lot and determined to shape my body into a standard skater‚Äôs shape which involves a lot of lower body workouts. 

And then the disaster begins at that Sunday afternoon, I rush into the gym to get some last-2-hour workout and I wear a ‚Äúre:re:re party in the gym‚Äù graphic white tee for fun. When I start working out abs I saw a huge bald white or Hispanic guy passing in front of me and walking around slowly in Jeans which is weird because everyone else wears workout outfit and he‚Äôs staring at every one in the gym when he‚Äôs walking around and somehow it makes me feel that he‚Äôs looking for someone to fight with or showing his existence or something. And he saw me and looking at me and then walk around for a while and then went to a half bald guy with long hair and long nails and said loudly:‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to have sex with some chic if she‚Äôs looking at me‚Äù and then looking at me and I was like too shock to make any respond. My mom always told me that don‚Äôt talk to weird people so I just try not to get involved in anything so I didn‚Äôt say anything. And that half bald nasty guy which is his friend smile in a very gross way and that makes me a little bit scared too because I don‚Äôt know what kind of people they are. And I am a mother of a 4 year old and married for 5 years and I never, never expect people talk to me like that. Usually people are respectful so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with his brain. And the staff that works in the gym just laughed and seems very amused and he didn‚Äôt help me when the huge guy is still talking about me with his friends in the weightlifting area. To be honest why he just shut up and let me concentrate on working out and we all mind our own business? I was very annoyed because no one disturb me working out for skating! But I just remembered what my parents taught me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to weird people‚Äù and I even didn‚Äôt looking at his face because I really want to keep a distance with any troubles like that. 

And I just went home and then come back the next Monday but the disturbs didn‚Äôt stop. Apparently someone said something to the people in the gym and they are all laughing at me and showing their abs in front of me and I didn‚Äôt expect that unwanted attention so I was confused and a little bit scared because I feel that they wanted to eat me alive! So What I did is that I write a complaint letter to the front desk to express my anger and demand them to let that huge guy to apologize to me. They checked the surveillance camera and they‚Äôre like ‚ÄúOh that Reed(or Red I didn‚Äôt hear it clear) we know them let‚Äôs just ‚Äòtalk‚Äô and see‚Äù and just let it go, and those guys continues to disturb me when I was doing late night workout as if I don‚Äôt have the right to be there past 8pm. I have to go to the ice rink in the afternoon and the summer course for architecture soon begins at that time so I was trying to figure out a way to work out at night but they just assumed that I staying late is because I want something and that skinny girl who bullied me in the locker room went behind me and call me slut and all I wanted to do is go home and cry‚ÄîI really confused because I was polite and avoiding talk to weird strangers and totally don‚Äôt deserve that humiliation. Of course I was angry and let it out on Facebook by posting something(then deleted) but they insult me Frist and that makes me confused very much because I was just minding my own business. And then I just quit the gym and ask for a full refund of the initial fee and the front desk girl refused to give my money back. 

I really don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt let me go even I always avoiding any form of contact with them. I am a perfect victim in this case because all my life I‚Äôve only been with 2 men one is my ex boyfriend and one is my husband and I am a very conservative person and totally the most opposite of slut. And why they blame me instead of blame that bald guy? I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. They‚Äôre like ‚Äúit must be your fault, it must be you did something wrong‚Äù. No, I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, and I dress probably, and I trained with concentration and determination, and I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone. I am a perfect victim. Even I am a perfect victim they still blame me. What happens if those who are not that perfect being a victim? Do they deserve that humiliation?

And why there are people feel so good about themselves? My husband is a MIT graduate, handsome when he was young and tall always, and I didn‚Äôt see him feel so good about himself that any women on the street looking at him and he‚Äôs yelling to his friend ‚ÄúI am not having sex with her!‚Äù And those who are cultured and polite and good looking, I didn‚Äôt see them feel so good about themselves too so I was really confused. Really. And I am starting to feel that it is because I am Asian. 

Thanks for reading theses annoying trifles.

I checked online and most English versions advice ppl to react immediately and seeking for alliances fast while most Chinese versions of advices suggest ppl to ignore that person because anyway the rumor will go away in front of the truth.

882,"**TLDR: Met a girl who liked me, we hang out and I ask her to a date. She says no for reasons I feel aren't genuine and for that I never really got closure. I have been thinking about her the past year and it is affecting a relationship I have with a girl right now. I have no idea what to do to get over her.**

I've been feeling depressed and just lacking emotional control the past year over a girl I met last Spring in college. 

Up until this January, I had never been in a relationship and was a virgin so when a mutual friend told me this girl liked me, I got really excited. We talked for a portion of last Spring semester and I felt she was losing interest because her texts got shorter and would reply hours (sometimes days) later. I gave up and got over it for the most part. 

Then last Summer she texts me out of the blue asking to go to a mall to hang out. I thought she was still interested so I took the chance and we hung out. She asked what kind of girl I was looking for, whether or not I would want a long-distance relationship (at the time I was thinking of doing military), etc. I thought these were questions gauged for her and were signs she wanted to keep talking. I thought we had a nice time and a couple of days later I couldn't help but feel like I should finally ask her out. I did and she said no, saying that she was too busy and that she liked me but we were better as friends. According to our mutual friend, the girl said that she said no because we were giving each other reasons not to pursue anything, which came as a surprise because I answered the questions with her in mind. I've been feeling horrible since because I have seen her with this guy on campus, and saw her on Tinder sometime in February, so I'm convinced she has time but just wasn't interested.

I downloaded Bumble in March and met this girl I have been FaceTiming a lot because of the quarantine. It has been going well up until this past week. The girl from school has been plaguing my mind and now it's affecting the relationship with the girl from Bumble. Last night, the latter asked to see what the girl from school looked like, so I mentioned her name and she sent a picture to confirm. I got nauseous and started to get a headache seeing the picture, and I confessed to the Bumble girl that I have been obssessing over the girl from school for the past year. It was extremely rude of me to do that but we're still talking thankfully. 

I have been pretty good about not going to the girl's social media to avoid thinking about her, but last night's conversation broke my self-control and I went on her Instagram this morning. I saw pictures from December of her with that guy from campus who is apparently her best friend. She was travelling as well during the holidays.

We drifted apart and now I feel like I don't have closure because of her reasons for the rejection but at the same time I don't see a point in reaching out to her to revive a friendship or to ask why she said no. I just want to get over her. I have been speaking to a school counselor since September but the sessions haven't helped. I thought I would ask for advice here.

886,"Long story short, like my friend, told her, she didn't feel the same way but has sent me very mixed signals before and even after I confessed. Fast forward to recently, she told me that she's having a guy she's interested in come over and has been confessing how she's anxious about meeting him and how she wants to get intimate with him and also wants to me give her some condoms ""just in case.""

So, obviously I'm her friend so I've been giving her advice and trying to help her get over her anxiety, but also, I'm absolutely not her only or best friend. Compared to the other people she talks to or has mentioned I'm like at a 5/10 friendship level w/ her. I don't see why she has to bring up who she's anticipating having sex with, asking for advice and for condoms, with me, the guy who confessed to liking her and was turned down, as opposed to her other plethora of friends who she knows and trusts way more and has even talked in depth to them about sex related things.

I want her to find someone she's happy with and I fully understand she doesn't like me back nor do I expect her to change her mind. I just don't wanna hear about it when she knows how I feel.

Tldr; how do I tell her that I don't feel comfortable giving her sex advice or supplying her with condoms for her potential boyfriends/hookups without coming off as an asshole friend?",16Apr2020,1

889,"Using a throwaway account to make sure they can't trace this back to me (they have 2 reddit accounts that I know of).

So, the essential details:

An internet personality I know (not as a friend, but someone I've butted heads with in the past over stuff), has been going around and trying to get YouTube videos that were made that involve them taken down, threatening to self-harm if these people don't comply.

This isn't the first time they've done this, I actually ended up being one of their targets back in 2018 over a video on made on them I made a year prior that was the result of a squabble they and I had over social media about them making shaky claims that all the videos made about them were slander.

This is what led me to go straight to them about what they had been doing recently, the moment I got tipped off from one of their more recent targets (a friend of mine).

We then proceeded to go in circles about their motives behind continuing to do this, and during this discussion they made the following claims:

\-That they've gone out of their way to ""ruin"" people they didn't like

\-That they've knowingly abused YouTube's flagging system to try and get videos about them taken down

\-That they've knowing broken the law (they had said the only 'crime' they committed was smoking weed when it was still illegal in their state, but I later found out through a bit of digging through their social medias that they regularly shop lift as well)

\-The rules/laws don't apply to them if it means they get what they want (I wish I was joking)

Now what made this a difficult situation is that I told them that I had enough evidence to try and stop what they were doing, and they threatened to dox another person I knew (who said internet personality had butted heads with several years ago, and apparently had doxxed on a separate occasion), if I did anything that looked like retaliation towards them.

The most I've been able to do is talk to friends about it over DMs, and encouraged everyone affected by what they've been doing to report their YouTube channel, but for the moment I'm stuck as to what to do, as I do not have enough personal information of this internet personality to work off of to give a tip to the police about (the only reason I didn't put this is r/legaladvice is that I've been getting conflicting answers on whether or not doxing is actually illegal) , and DO NOT want to stoop to their level and do/get someone to dox them.",16Apr2020,1
890,"Hey just need some general advice from people who've worked in the private sector. I'm recently transitioning from the military into a private company that will be contracting for the defence. During my time in service, I got a hand tattoo because I honestly saw the navy being my life career at that point. 

The tattoo isn't large at all, it's just on my finger and could easily be covered with a bandaid or some makeup. Also I'll be working in IT, so it's not like I'm going to be the face of the company. 

Usually this wouldn't be an issue because this would've been discussed during the interview. However, with the covid situation I was hired from a phone interview.

So yeah, I was thinking of covering them up but telling my manager about them on the first day. I'm just worried if by covering them up it looks like I'm trying to be deceitful. I want a good first impression.

So I was on tumblr and got a notification from a guy telling me he wants to be my sugar daddy he seems real, I checked and I wanted just some extra money so that don't have to asks my parents for money anymore. Anw  we started talking on Google hangouts and anw he told me I need to make a small payment of 100 and I was like well let's see. He also send me screenshot that showed me it looks real.

And since I am in the Netherlands it's kind of hard for me to find some guy in the states. 

Anw he asked for more and I was a bit suspicious and I asked if I could pay less and he was fine with it and anw he told me a odd story that his clerk is taking more time to respond or send me money and I have been waiting for a day or so.

I emailed PayPal  incase it is a scam and asked if they can get my money back, but I don't know what to do if it is and I can't get my money back, I don't want to tell my parents about put this  they will be ashamed of me.

I thought of some plans like :
1. Asking my landlord if he can pay the rent with my deposit for May and in June I will start my job and then I will have enough to pay June without much of my parents help.

2. I can tell my parents I have been scammed because my credit card was stolen  and someone took money off my account and that way its partially true and false.

3. Worst option asking my brother for money. 

This is all if its a scam but idk that why I need your advise or someone  who isn't gonna think of me as dumb for believing this.

So, a little bit of backstory. I live with three other roommates (MMF, 20s) (one being my husband, we have roommates for financial reasons). My one roommate (19F) has a ferret and had a gecko. She took care of both of them pretty well for not being around often (she spends most of her time at her boyfriend‚Äôs but I wasn‚Äôt complaining because she still paid rent and utilities). Well, a few weeks ago, we had an issue. It turns out her gecko died because it was neglected and it ended up giving us fly problems which is how we found out. We found her room covered with shit from the ferret throwing it out of the cage (I guess?) and her gecko was dead in its cage with a dry water bowl and maggots on its body. We thought she had been taking care of them because she had come home at least once a week and just a few days prior to this she had been home and in her room so we were super shocked.

She said that she was going to give the ferret to someone who could take care of it but we found out her boyfriend (who doesn‚Äôt help with the ferret care at all) convinced her otherwise. 

It‚Äôs been over a week since we last saw her at home. My husband and I and other roommate are at a loss of what to do. We don‚Äôt know how to care for the ferret and also feel it‚Äôs not our place to do so.

So basicly my brother is just like a normal person but when he get mad or sad, he is stubborn, if he decided to not eat a week, like literally hi is not going to do it, if he mad at something, he would stuck at that position, frozed, ""no matter what, i wont stop"" that kind of person, if he want something and he's not getting it he will get mad and cry. He is person that get easly mad or sad, like fragile thing. My parrent know his behaviour and manage to make a different treatment with him, not like me and my little sister. My parrent are treat my brother softly just to make sure his bad behaviour wont come again, and it works, until we (i and my brother) moved to get in a better school (my brother) and college (me).

Problem
At first he was fine, we life together just two of us and never had any problem before, and then when he hit 2nd grade it's all start. my mother got a call from school telling that my brother wont move from his sit, like freaking froze, o decided to take him home and man it's really hard to make him move, fells like a statue, and he wont speak any word, im so confused, i dont know what to do, my mother buy a ticket and leave my sister and my dad alone to take care of my brother, he wont go to school, i dont know how but a couple week later he going to school again, and about 1 week after that my mom got a call from school.. again!. Guys i try to talk to him but he wont listen, he play game a lot and watch youtube all day until late night and when i speak to him he just keep staring at his phone. This pattern keep happening. until the break poin where my father come to visit and he make a disrespefull thing to my dad (i dont know what is it) and my dad got so furious, he so mad the entier house is silent, my dad never get so mad like this before, my was literally dad crying. My brother just forzed and he sit silently.

After my parents back to my hometown he is normal again, but then right before corona pandemi get started he start doing it again, he shut his mouth, wont talk to me, literally like a dead man, eat and sleep, my mom got a call from school telling he had a lot of homework and he wont do it. He doing his routline again games, youtube, sleep, eat, he is watching youtube game channel until 4 am !, like wtf,  he sleep in the morning and when he wake up he just stay at his bed and start opening his phone. Personaly think this device is a toxic to him so takeways all of his devices, ""you can have it back in the morning"", hoping he's going to change his routline,, phone and laptop i put in in a box,  and then i took a couple book with a good story, force  tohim read all the book and novel i put in his desk. Its just...never happen.

Belive me guy, i do talk to him, i trying my best to get him motivated. I can feel his sadness and i think he dont trust anyone to tell about it, i think he had problem with school and he dont have enought social interactions, i understand that he just had a few close friends one or two.  i talk to him softly that if he had problem he should talk to me, i ask him whats going on?, every, single, day, but he keep staring at his phone or cover his face with bed cover.

 until this night 2 am in the morning i was done my program assigment, im so tired, i just wanna to sleep, i heard i sound i the living room, i see him streaming in living room tv watching people playing minecraft, he shouldn't be able to do it since his phone is in the box, i stand infront of him "" hey, you need to sleep, maybe you can continue this at the morning""

""Fin are you listening to me?, its late night, people are sleeping""

I keep talk to him. He keep staring on the tv screen, he wont hear me, at this poin im cant stop it, i furious, "" hey, do you listen to me?"" I've never been so mad before, he keep staring at the tv ""can you hear me?"" and in second i slap his face hard to the floor, "" what the fuck is wrong with you !""  Im so mad i scream and the neighboor can hear literally me screaming, ""what do you want from me!"" my eyes is full of tears and he froze like a statue..

I cant sleep, it is 5.00 am and im scared my brother would do a suicide attempt since it's happened before, he said to me when in his normal stage. I keep checking his bedroom looking at him sit silently with red eyes, red face and tears and then back again.

912,"This might be a little long but here goes:

Background:

So maybe around over 2 years ago, I dated a guy who had really bad anger issues and overall couldn't keep his emotions together in certain situations. After a couple of moments of abuse (physical and verbal), I decided to dump him. During the relationship, my ex had introduced me to another guy who I became very close, best friends with. I mean we basically shared everything together and we were always hanging out. A long time after breaking up with my ex, I started dating my best friend, who now is my long term boyfriend. We have been dating for about a year now. My ex and my current boyfriend had a lot of history together and used to be pretty close. After I dumped my abusive ex, my boyfriend was the one who helped me with all the backlash and bullying I received from my ex as a result. I thought my ex was now apart of the past and gone from my life for good. My boyfriend didn't want to be friends with him or talk to him and we overall never really saw him again.

Now to the real problem:

Recently, my ex came back and apologized to both me and my boyfriend about the trauma he had caused. I accepted his apologize but I was definitely not excited to see him again. He obviously has caused a lot of pain to me and I remembered all the horrible times we had. My boyfriend, on the other hand, seemed thrilled. They obviously were good friends before and now my boyfriend is trying to mend this friendship. Clearly, this is making me upset and I don't know what to do. I have voiced my concerns to my boyfriend and told him I don't believe my ex is a good influence. My ex is into some pretty bad, hardcore drugs and people overall know him as being an emotionally unstable, desperate douchebag. I have cried to my boyfriend about how upset it makes me when he hangs out with my ex and that I don't appreciate that he's bringing someone toxic back into my life. My boyfriend, on the other hand, says that my ex is ""a changed man"" because he goes to therapy now and he seems nicer. I know that my ex likes to put on these fake disguises to seem one way but he will always end up revealing his toxic side in the end. I am really scared that my ex is going to get between my relationship with my boyfriend. My boyfriend talks about how much it hurts him when I'm upset or when I cry, but obviously it wasn't enough to change his mind about hanging out with my ex. Maybe I sound crazy? Maybe I'm being over the top? I don't know. But I just hate the thought of my ex being back in my life. I want breaking up to be the absolutely last resort as obviously I believe my boyfriend and I have a seriously good connection. Please let me know if you have any ideas on how I can handle this.

914,"I (22F) posted something on my instagram stories about not finishing a book due to the main character being too unlikeable for me (a sexist man with rape/murder fantasies) and a friend responded with basically, ""yeah, but i still kept reading it because it was so disturbing you just couldn't look away! the whole thing is so dark and fucked up. you really couldn't look away. like that time i saw a dead body on the street and couldn't look away."" And I immediately had a panic attack.

I asked him what happened and he explained the situation, he was walking down the street one day with his friends and then he saw a guy on the ground, bleeding from his wounds, getting cpr. He also mentioned singing stayin' alive because it was a song it's used to do cpr but his friends didn't get it. ""so iconic i know. i'm so terrible"" Panic attack rising again.

Wrote back that ""youre not. people have different reactions to seeing dead bodies. some people actually laugh. it's a weird self-defense mechanism for seeing traumatic things."" I then wrote some other personal things about similar situations, which he ignored and wrote small senteces with a quick, ""Anyway!""

This was a while ago. But the panic attack won't go away... I want to cry right now and I don't know why? There's something in my gut which is making me nauseous and anxious. I don't even want to go to bed I just want to cry and go away. Has something like this happened to you before? Can somebody help? It's not that I'm naive to disturbing subjects. I love horror!

925,"I'm new to reddit, only having made this account to ask this here, as I want a unbiased opinion. I'm sorry for such a long post. I'm also not sure if this is the right sub but I dont know anywhere else to post this. 

I dont think its super important, but just incase it is, I'm F17. 

Theres alot of backstory but I feel its important to know the full extent of just how much happened and how bad it got. Or maybe this is also a vent in a way. But I'll include a TLDR at the bottom for you guys. 

When I was really young, my dad was a wonderful father. Maybe we got into a bit more trouble than the usual father and daughter would, but I have good memories of setting off stink bombs in stores and catching turtles in ponds. 

But starting when I was about 6, hes been in and out of jail for the rest of my childhood. Going away for 6 months, being released, then going back a couple months later. It's always been dumb things like theft. But he was never abusive or anything. At least not that I saw. 

He's been on and off drugs for most of my childhood, though I didnt know that until recently. My mother told me a story about how he didnt get me off the school bus because he took some drug that made him forget I existed. She said he didnt know who I was. But that was years and years ago. 

Well. Starting about 4 years ago, he got into meth. 4 years ago was the first time hes ever cursed at me. And it got worse from there. He started stealing alot from places. Big things like crossbows and knife sets from big chain retail stores. He started throwing stuff in the house. He argued with my mom every day. Usually it was the kind of screaming that makes your voice start to go hoarse becuase you're yelling so loudly. He broke things during those arguments. 

I had alot of pet rats that all stayed in my bedroom because I bred them for pets and for show. I had people come from other states becuase my rats were high quality pets and worth a bit of money. But my mom would always have to warn me to lock my door because my dad always wanted to poison them. He hated my rats. And he hated that I made money from them. 

My dad would also always 'joke' that he would kill our outdoor cat if he left footprints on his truck again. Our cat dissapeared without a trace a day or two later. You can see where there were cat prints on his truck that just suddenly stopped. But I can't prove he did anything.

This was also the time my dad started telling me stories about how he killed cats as a kid, shot my aunts kitten, put cats in boxes and lit them on fire when he was a kid. He laughed about this. 

My mom came home hysterically crying after going for a drive with my dad. Upon her calming down slightly, she told me she was arguing with my dad while he was driving and a kitten started to cross the road. She told me he purposely sped up and swerved to hit that kitten because he was mad at my mom. 

Once my mom stopped feeding into his arguments he turned to me. He started using me to get her to bow to him. ""If you dont do ___ then I'll take her phone away"" and things like that. This went on for a long time. He threw a glass of milk above my moms head, hacked all her media accounts, sent my moms nudes to everyone she knew, including MY friends and our church pastor as a revenge thing. 

Hes broke countless of our phones over arguments. Hes tore apart my room to see if I was hiding anything. (And I really mean tore it part. It took 4 days to clean up the mess he made in my room.) He broke 4 TVs within 2 weeks by punching them. I was scared of him. 

There was a time where I flinched and cowered away when he was yelling at me, and he got mad that I was scared. He put his fist in my face and started yelling ""daddies gonna hit you! Daddies gonna hit you!""

He never did hit me, and he didnt hit my mom that I know of and she said he didn't, but it was still traumatizing. 

I was having a awful time during this. I gave up on pretty much everything. I was struggling with severe depression, I still do even. One day I was talking to my mom, crying. I told her I was having suicidal thoughts and that I wanted to die. My dad heard that. He stormed out of the room and came back with a big bottle of pills. I'm not sure what they were but they were in a giant orange prescription bottle. He threw them at me and told me to commit suicide. I cried harder and my mom took the bottle back to her and my dads room. It hurt me so much that I went back the next morning looking for that bottle to do what he said but it was gone. Another time, I asked him to play a mobile game with me and he got so angry about ""being hooked on that phone so fucking much"" that he slammed my phone into the ground, picked it up, and slammed it into the mop bucket. My mom tried to fix the situation later that night and convinced him to try the game with me but I could tell he just didnt care. I was the only one playing and i just gave up about 10 minutes in. 

There was another time where my mom and dad were arguing over text. He broke her phone so she was using  mine. My mom forgot to delete the texts becuase when I unlocked my phone, I saw where my dad was calling me useless and a disappointment. I've always been a daddies girl. I wanted nothing more than my dad to be proud of me. That broke me. I still to this day break down upon someone saying they're disappointed in me.

By this point hes been cooking meth in the house, not even hiding it. And everything I owned smelled like ammonia. There was a time I walked out and questioned the smoke and smell in the house and he told me I was imagining things. I'm certain I was not. 

There was glass pipes everywhere. Outside, around the house, in the trash bins, the bathroom, in drawers. They were everywhere. Usually stained a yellowish and black color on the round part. Those disposable pipes come with a tiny fabric flower. I didnt know that's where they came from, so I always collected those little flowers when I found them. I actually made a tiny flower crown for my pet rat out of them. I had at least 80 tiny flowers. I wouldn't have kept them if i knew where they came from though. 

Hes been cooking meth in the house for months at this point, and one night he snapped on my mom. He was convinced she alerted the cops and they were surrounded in the woods. He woke me up in the middle of the night and made me help wash his meth making tools. Glass bowls, a herb grinder, measuring cups, things of that sort. 

This is when he started taking more long drives to other states, and staying in a different town for sometimes days at a time. 

I found out through some family members and some friends who dabbled in the drug world that he was transporting barrels of meth, which he called Ice (I'm guessing that's a type of meth) on his truck for some big dealers or something of that sort he got involved with. I'm kinda scared to talk about this part much becuase I dont know what kind of origination he was involved with, but I know to have that much product it cant be a small time dealer. He was doing this in exchange for some of their product. 

My dad also had this bag he always took with him. And with some snooping I'm 99% sure it was a B&amp;E bag. It had knives, a crowbar, and all kinds of stolen things that you wouldn't just have in a back pack unless it was made for breaking into stuff. 

One day the police showed up at our door. They arrested both of my parents. My dad had stole while he was with my mom, and they were convinced my mom was in on it. My mom was so tired and emotionally drained that she wasnt watching him. She didnt see it. 

I actually didn't realize the police were here until I heard  their voices inside. I assumed the flashlight shining outside my window was my dad, as he had a weird obsession with flashlights. 

About a week later my mom got arrested for petty theft and got a DUI. Though the charge shouldn't have stuck. I was present when she was arrested. She blew a 0.0 and passed a blood test after being arrested. They thought she was drunk because shes disabled and cant walk into a straight line as one leg is shorter than the other, and the charge stuck because she had attitude. The petty theft though, was justified. She told me we were going out for milkshakes, but before then she drove through the neighborhoods and was stealing plants. I told her not to but she didnt listen to me. My mom isnt the best either I suppose.

So my mom went to jail for 6 months and my dad kept postponing his court date. You'd be surprised how many times you can do that. Before my mom went to jail she gave him $1000 from her tax money to pay the electric bill as it was overdue by months. It was my dads job to pay it, but he wasnt paying it for whatever drug related reasons. He took that money and did who knows what with it. He didnt pay the bill. And the electricity was shut off in the middle of summer with 100 degree weather. I struggle with heat and dont do well in it. 

I rehomed all my pet rats during this time becuase I knew I just couldn't take care of them while all this happend. I had no support from anyone, and there was no way I could continue breeding them. I only kept my 2 favourite boys and gave the rest away to a breeder a few states away. 

A week into having no electricity, my dad handed me $20 and told me not to tell anyone I had it and it was for food or emergency just in case. He would be back in  the morning. He took the EBT with him, which my grandparents and I needed that for food. (it's their house. My parents lived with my moms parents.) He didnt come back for 3 and a half weeks. We had nothing but that $20, and no electricity. 

He eventually came back though. During this time becuase we had no running water for a shower and no ac, I was using the swimming pool as a way too cool and clean off. I came down with swimmers ear. It was mild, and I asked my dad if he could pick up some ear drops to cure it before it got worse. He said he would, but never did. I had no way of doing it myself. 

Before I continue, I would like to let you know I have a extremely high pain tolerance. When I broke my toe I popped the bone back in place myself and only shed a handful of tears. I'm also the kind to never want any kind of medicine, and I despise hospitals and I would never willingly want to go to the hospital unless it was truly a emergency. Both my parents know that if I ask to see a doctor, its serious and borderline emergency  

The days went on and the ear pain got worse and worse. It was to the point I could no longer get out of bed becuase it was throbbing and felt like my ear had a kitchen knife through it. I toughed it out that entire time. It was about a week and a half in and I finally caved. I was crying elephant tears and I woke my dad up around 3 am and asked to go to the hospital. I couldn't hear out of the ear, and at this point I was doubting it was swimmers ear and it had to be something broken in there. It was the worst pain I've ever felt. Before the whole drug thing, he would've taken me to the hospital before I had to ask. But he told me he was tired and to wait until morning. He saw me crying. He KNEW it was serious and still didnt want to take me to the hospital.

The next morning my grandparents were able to get the electricity back on after selling some valuables they had and I begged my dad to take me to the hospital. I was considering begging a friend's parents or something to pretend to be my guardian just so I can get this pain to stop. He finally relented, and with a attitude took me to the doctor. The receptionist directed us to a machine, but I didnt know my social security number and couldn't log in with it. My dad at that point said for us to just leave and was angry about me wasting his time. 

The receptionist (bless her), saw the situation and told us it's okay and that she could pull my records up manually and get my insurance information that way. I dont really think she was supposed to do that, but I finally was able to get seen by a medical professional. 

The doctor took one look in my ear and said it's the worse case of swimmers ear he's ever seen, and it's so bad it was now a infection. He looked directly at my dad and said I should've been seen long before it got to this point. The doctor left to get my ear drops and antibiotic prescription together and my dad started yelling at me about how pointless going to the hospital was and that he could've just gotten ear drops over the counter. I reminded him that I asked, more than once, and it just made him angrier. 

When we got home I had to use a microwaved rice sock to soothe my ear, as well as many many doses of ibuprofen to keep the swelling and pain down. I was bedridden for over a week becuase of it, and I was still struggling heavy with depression and finding a reason to get out of bed. 

After a day or two of being back I was still in a ton of pain and having trouble finding a will to get up. It was over 90 degrees in the house becuase the ac was broke so I couldn't do much anyway even if I had the energy. My friend stopped by knowing how I get when I give up like that, and helped me clean the house. I helped where I could, but I was so exhausted, overheating, and mentally tired that I couldn't do much aside from pick up some trash. My dad came out of his room while we were finishing up, and said ""let me guess. You did fucking nothing"" and started berating me and calling me useless. That hurt me so much. 

It was also sometime around this time where he left to see family in a town 2 hours away. He left with that B&amp;E bag, dressed in completely black, with a black ski mask on. He returned in a few hours and in a article a family member shared a little while later it talked about a jewelry store break in, that perfectly lined up when my dad left, and returned. I have no proof it was him. But I do know he had a bunch of stolen jewelry he kept in a bag that he later pawned. 

He also returned one night after a trip out of town with a sword and giant display axe. Both had scuffs and scratches so they weren't from a store. These belonged to someone. When my dad came back he joked that he beat some 'Mexican fuck' to death and took it from him and laughed about it. But tbh..I'm not so sure I believe that is just a joke. 

Missing my pet rats from a couple months ago, but knowing I no longer had the space for rats, I bought about 15 show mice from a breeder with intentions on breeding them. They all died within a week, one after another, all with bloody noses and yellow-green belly skin. I suspect they were poisoned. 

In the next few weeks he was finally arrested and sent to prison for 2 years. I ignored all his calls. My mom was released a month later for her DUI, her charges with my dad were dropped, and stuff slowly became ok. It was unfortunate he was only arrested for theft, and wasn't caught with anything else but I wasnt gonna rat him out. That's my dad y'know?

Its been over a year and my dad has less than a year left in his sentence. With the Corona virus being an issue, they are wanting to release criminals with non violent crimes. (my dad was only caught with stealing. Not the other stuff.) My dad will probably be one of the few released. 

I picked up his call the other night. I dont know why I did. But we talked. He said he was sober and was gonna be drug free. He said he wanted to be a better father to me and said we wanted my forgiveness and he wanted to reconnect with me. I told him I forgive him, but I'm not sure I want to see him. He sounded genuine. 

So my question is..would I be dumb for trying to reconnect? Is it stupid of me to give him another chance? What should I do about this?

TLDR: My dad got hooked on meth, did a bunch of borderline abusive things to my mom and I for years, and got arrested for stealing from a chain store. Corona virus is causing the prisons to release some prisoners and my dad may be one. Am I dumb for considering reconnecting with him?",16Apr2020,1

These are several reasons that are making me fall apart:

1. I was wrong choosing my studies. I feel that I wasted 7 years of my life studying something that I'm not good at it at all (I did English studies in despite of being socially awkward, shy and super bad at speaking, and it took me more years than usual to finish them).


2. My passion is art, but I didn't study anything related. I don't have any money to study now (I want to study something related with art in videogames or animation but is too expensive). I barely draw at home, I have a terrible mental block for several years ago. I love seing other artists works but at the same time I get SO frustrated because I'm not good enough as they are.

3. I feel trapped. I'm very insecure and my English is shit + super awkward and shy = cannot find a job. No progress in life. No money.


4. I cannot see my boyfriend (ldr). He is extroverted,  talkative, intelligent and he easily gets any good job. In fact, He was going abroad to work and gain a lot of money before the coronavirus happened. He is everything I would like to be. I love him but I also envy him too much. I'm getting super insecure and I sometimes I feel that I'm spoiling the relationship. Anyways I don't find any comfort.

Im currently 21 (female) and there's no getting around it but I was raped when I was about 4-6. My mom used to work long hours as did my step-dad so they had his family member (I don't remember how he was related) watch me when they weren't home. He was about 16 when he lived with us.

""if you tell your mom she will get very mad at you."" That‚Äôs what he said every time.

I didn't want to upset my mom, so I went along with it. he used to play with me at first, an innocent game: crouching down, pulling the back of his shirt over his head and tilting his glasses. It used to make me laugh a lot. that soon led to everything else. I have never told my mom. out of fear at first that she would be angry with me, but now I'm afraid to tell her cause I think it will break her heart. she has confessed to me in the past that she felt like a shitty mom and that she hasn't done the best that she could for me.

about a month ago, before all this corona shit. we were finishing up an AA meeting. at the end we always lay out snacks on the table. i of course, took advantage of it and began picking. a girl walks over and comments on my jacket, i look at her, say thank you and think thats it. she then begins commenting on my appearance and doesnt stop. i realize what she was doing and told her that 1. i was too old for her and 2. i was gay and already in a relationship. 

she took it as me being a dickhead and started putting words in my mouth. ‚Äúyou just think im ugly. we arent that far apart in age. so what you think im a slut?‚Äù just bullshit like that. i decided to remove myself from the situation and i went home.

now on the couch with my boyfriend. i get a message on instsgram from someone i didnt know. the user was a name and then a series of numbers. they had sent a video and i opened it and can you guess what i see? the underage red head girl from the center i had just talked to hours ago. i excused myself and began freaking. i admit that i said some pretty harsh things in the moment. i told her to fuck off. that thay was disgusting and my boyfriend could have seen that. i told her that i am not attracted to her and that she needs to stop. 

she doesnt reply and the conversation ended there.

two days later i receive three new messages. two photos and a video of her butt fucking naked asking if i like what i see.

the next few days follow on like this and i find myself showing my boyfriend the chat and he messages her from my phone. no threats. only that he would be calling the cops if she didnt stop. she comes back with bullshit on how she isnt doing anything despite the fact that my boyfriend could literally read the messages. she began saying that i was probably cheating on him with multiple other girls her age. claiming that im a disgusting pedophile who demanded these pics for money. she called me a rapist, she even tried to claim that i tried to get with her at the center that day we met. 

my boyfriend tells me hes had enough and hes going to the cops. i beg him not to. and he doesnt. the next day i get a knock at me door. and its this girls fucking father, absolutely enraged. he starts demanding that i let him in. that hes going to bash my skull in for what i did to his daughter. he tells me that hes going to call the cops and get my ass thrown in jail.

at this point im fucking terrified and so is my boyfriend. 

before you call me a dumbass for not calling the police. ive had a bad run with the cops. i havent done anything bad but i got into some shit as a teenager which landed my spending the night in jail, forcibly removed from places i was crashing in after my parents kicked me out, drug use and shit like that. so i was scared this would make me look really bad.

with her dad still banging on my door i try and tell him that his daughter has been harassing me for a week. he refuses to let down and after a full fucking hour he finally stops. he says that hes going to come back here with the police.

that was a day ago and im freaking. yes i have proof that i am in the right if things do get bad. but im terrified.

It wasn‚Äôt a large amount of money I took but enough to keep me comfortable for the rest of my life (I live a simple but happy life). Because of various legal technicalities I have managed to avoid extradition (and I have kept my nose clean in my new domicile).

I struck up a rather nice friendship with one of the police officers on my case (I say ‚Äúcase‚Äù I am aware I was always charring away on the back burner) .

1. I could take a gap year and continue to live at home. I would try to work on my social anxiety and get a job. But I realise that after the gap year I'll still hav eto move on with my life, and I'm afraid I'll be in the same position as I am now. I'm also terrified that my depression will worsen.

It sounds crazy, but I really do mean my ENTIRE street attends these gatherings. It's clear that they aren't distancing as they're sharing food and sitting in clusters on the road and the pavements. There's easily thirty people on our street from the late afternoon to early morning every weekend drinking together. Worse, I recently found out that one of them is a nurse(!)

Some neighbours have decided to call the police, but this has been ignored, and we've tried directly confronting the gatherers to no avail. I'm worried about the spread of the virus as I already know that it's infected a family friend who lives on our street. These parties are therefore definitely risking lives.

I'm especially worried about my mother because she suffers from a compromised immune system so she likely wouldn't survive an infection.

965,"tl;dr: A really good friend of mine stopped any form of contact a few years ago, now trying to reconnect with her has no leads and have been told indirectly to stop searching for her. Now I don't know what to do.

Details:


I'm a guy in my late 20s. Back in my teenage years, I met a girl from a different city on the internet. We became very good friends, spoke over the phone a lot, met up a couple of times and kind of fell for eachother. We then spoke on/off for a couple of years, up until our uni days when I was studying abroad. We were planning to meet when I got back, when we last spoke. Then all of a sudden, she stopped replying and writing to me (this was 6 yrs ago btw). I figured she was just busy with her new business, and didn't want to be too pushy, so I stopped writing to her.

I tried reaching out a couple more times, without any luck, and just went on with my life. Over the years I'd occasionally check if she'd wrote anything, but...nope. I just brushed it off, that's the internet. She's probably moved on, I had my own life anyway.

A couple of days ago I bumped into some old pictures of us and decided to see what she's been up to. I was so eager to show her some of the old memories. I then noticed that her facebook profile no longer exists. Her IG hasn't had any activity since we last spoke, and other profiles of hers show the same pattern. I couldn't find any trace of her on the internet.

Now that prompted me to think that obviously she might have died. I felt horrible. It was weird scouring the internet for her like some sort of stalker, but I just had to know. The only clue I had was her old company she was so proud about. So, I reached out to them and asked if she still works there and explained the situation. I was expecting two possible outcomes, either they tell me ""she passed away"" or they just say ""we'll pass your contact to her"". At least I'll know she's fine. Instead, they replied telling me that they spoke to her and she asked them to tell me I shouldn't make any more attempts at contacting her.

Now, I absolutely did not expect that. Given that the last few messages were all fun and nothing was weird between us, more so, we were planning on meeting again. So..what the hell? I obviously stopped any attempt at contacting her...

But now I'm just left with questions. It's driving me crazy.

Any advice on what you think happened, or what I should do? I'm just bugged that we had a great connection and she just disappeared into thin air without any explanation.

Or... am I the crazy one, or too desperate for trying to reach out to her? I really need someone else's perspective on this.

Thank you and sorry for the long story.",16Apr2020,2

For the past two summers, I started selling soap (that I make from scratch) as a way to stay occupied during the summers when I used to teach. It brought in extra income but I didn't spend a whole lot of time in it because my job took care of the bills.

My business kind of took off and I've never been able to make enough to keep in stock, even now. Yes, even now when people are quarantined in their homes, I make an essential item that people still want to buy.

I want to make more, I want to sell online and ship from home. I have thought about this very thoroughly. I have a business license and all that, but it's always been just a side business.

My 9-5 job is in administration, and I thought it was going to be my dream job because it's for a media company that I've always admired, but at this point I feel overwhelmed by the workload and lack of benefits and pay. Locals tell me all the time that I should just open up a shop or go full into my business but I'm scared of failing and being without a job. I don't know man, this quarantine giving me all sorts of reasons to quit. My loving boyfriend encourages me and supports me leaving my job, but I am just so scared of going into something like this with the economic climate so doom and gloom.

The company had a zero tolerance for workplace violence... I was working in a hospital as a pharmacy technician(certified), and the guy that I got into a fight with we had tension somewhat building up after 6 months. 6 months ago we went to a concert together, there was a shooting at the concert, and the way I reacted to it was to flee the scene, and I guess he hasn‚Äôt liked me since, either have I liked him since. He purposely would try to challenge my intelligence/make smart remarks or gestures at me on &amp; off as well. 

To make a long story short, he tested me to no end by eventually threatening myself and my family, so I punched him in the face/arm. I clocked out for the night as told to, told my side of the story, then after further investigation, I was ultimately fired..

People liked my work I did, even had a pharmacist say to me that if I ever needed for the further a letter for reference, they would give one to me, etc. 

Why I feel hopeless other than the fact that I have a history of depression/anxiety with a couple of chronic illnesses, is that I‚Äôm currently not in my opinion healthy physically or mentally for that matter. My chronic illnesses have flared up which triggers my emotions a lot. I am now afraid to tell my mother that I live with that I lost my job due to my temper and afraid of what she‚Äôll do/say.

I already reached out to my mental therapist since I know I‚Äôm going to be in a bad state of mind at least until I figure out what to say to my mother. Right now I‚Äôm going to fake going to work tomorrow for 9 hours until the weekend starts as I have off weekends.. 

Any advice here would be really appreciated!...",16Apr2020,1

974,"I always get really stressed when I text people, even close friends. I'm always worried that it's the wrong time, that what I'm talking about is boring them, that they secretly dislike me, that I'm talking too much/little and that I'm just in general socializing wrong. These all apply irl as well, but for some reason it's so much harder to deal with when texting, I think mostly because I can't read the person's tone, body language or facial expressions when texting. Since it's now essentially the only way I can communicate with my friends for the next few months, coping with these fears has only become more difficult.

975,"Things have been rough for the past few years. I‚Äôve been overwhelmed with so many emotions which derive from my excessive overthinking and constant worry. 

I‚Äôve been thinking too much about my upcoming career because I‚Äôll be graduating a year from now from college and for some reason I just don‚Äôt think I truly have the passion for working in the construction industry. At the moment I‚Äôm double majoring; studying both construction management and business finance.

Recently, I‚Äôve noticed that my anger issues have been more prevalent especially when playing games. I feel guilty for lashing out in the heat of myself making stupid mistakes. For example I‚Äôll get really pissed at myself for making a bad chess move or losing a gulag match in Call of Duty. I‚Äôm getting a feeling that my friends don‚Äôt like playing games with me because of my extremely competitive nature and excessive anger. I‚Äôm not sure if all these emotions are being temporary heightened by being in quarantine in addition to being overwhelmed by schoolwork. 

To take my mind off things, I‚Äôve been proactive in developing some self-confidence by working out and staying focused in school. However my mind wonders off and I worry too much about trivial things.

Just been feeling lost, any advice or guidance is welcome. Thanks everyone :)",16Apr2020,3
976,"I have an old but still wonderful Schwinn. Cost a few hundred dollars new, about 40 years ago. A quick google search shows used ones still going for $200+ now. Because of its age and looks, and it being given to me by my mother who cherished it greatly, I‚Äôd prefer only the minimal necessary changes be done to it, not to mention avoiding excess costs.

I had to get a shift cable changed as it was rusted stiff, so I took it to a bike shop and asked for only that wire to be replaced, they agree. When I come to pick it up, I find that they have replaced both wires, the shifter handles, and ‚Äúadjusted the bottom bracket‚Äù, which was not even related to what I asked to be done.

I had already paid before finding out about the extra work. Is there anything I can/should do now to get compensation for the extra work done, which was specifically asked not to happen?

977,"Question:

Caught a fraudulent charge on my credit card 2 days ago. For $1,075 - called and disputed right away and was refunded immediately by my credit card company. Yesterday. Got a text alert saying my Apple product was en route. Tracking number was traced to being delivered 30 minutes North of me to a FedEx.

Called FedEx. Told them the tracking # and said it was fraud and to not let the person pick it up if they tried. The person did end up showing up and tried obtaining the phone, in which FedEx refused since I notified them. 

I went and picked up the phone. Package had my address on it but somehow the offender rerouted it to that FedEx location.

982,"GF of 4 years has really bad halitosis. I suspect that it's related to chronic anemia, and most definitely not related to poor dental hygiene. I've only started noticing it a few months into us moving in together, but it's been an issue since then. For medical reasons she cannot treat her iron deficiency like most people suffering from anemia, and has to get somewhat regular blood transfusions. Last one is long overdue, which is why (I think) her breath has been so bad lately. 

I tried addressing the matter as tactfully and nicely as possbile, but she definitely was hurt and seemed reluctant to take my concerns seriously. I find myself subconsciously beginning to distance however, as it's very hard to be intimate when someones breath is really really but they've also made a huge deal out of you pointing it out and trying to get them to do something about it.

It's an awful situation to be in, I really don't know what to do. I'm hoping once this whole 'pandemic' blows over I can get her to take transfusions and the issue will be resolved for a while... but if not I fear we will become 'that distant couple that definitely doesn't fuck anymore and has turned to what are basically just flatmate buddies' because of it. Attraction is fading and I don't deal well with the perceived emotional blackmail of it. 

Please help.

Also I need to add that her bad breath has a distinct irony or bloodlike smell to it. It's not at all like coffee breath or bad morning breath. Which is why I'm so certain it's anemia related.

Any advice helps.",16Apr2020,1
983,"I suppose the first place to start Is when I was about 12, I started liking this girl. I liked her for a while but then when I was just turning 16 we began speaking to each other more and spending more time with each other. We'd often go out to the cinema or theme parks or round to her house. I went to a party, which wasn't really my thing, I got drunk for the first time. I don't remember much except from the fact that I told everyone about this girl. Saying how she was the most amazing person that I'd met and I really liked her. I ended up sending her some drunk messages but deleted them before she read them. She stopped speaking to me as much after that until we just didn't speak at all. I'm not too sure what really happened. I don't know if she wanted to stop speaking to me or she thought I didn't want to speak to her. The last time I saw her was about July of last year but I still think about her. Especially at work where I don't have much else to think about. This usually leads to me crying about it and then when I can't cry anymore I just make myself throw up. I've spoken to my friends about it and they said I should just message her but I can't bring myself to it. I wouldn't know what to say, it's been that long that I feel like a barely know her.

988,"I am a 22 year old woman. About 3.5 years ago I met a guy (now 26) online via an online game. Lets call him Peter. After some time of chatting ingame we swapped and used skype. Both of us where listed in the same area and we discovered, that we were almost neighbors. It was the start of a cool friendship between two introverts. Mostly we talked, chatted and played online but sometimes we went to the cinema together or met at starbucks or subway. Nothing romantical every happened and we even talked about this in the beginning. Both of us never wanted the other one in that way.
One of the men I fell for was a narcissist and since I broke up (almost a year ago) I start realising that Peter treaded me... weird from the start. I dont really know, what it is. I will list some examples.

1.)When I talk about games or online stuff (shared interests) Peter listens carefully and adds/ask things that keep the conversation going but when I get personal, like talking about that I got a dog recently (my own interests) he always responds with a short ""Mhm."" that make me feel really insecure and creates this awkward silence. 

2.)When I ask him stuff, Peter often just gives silly questions back. Like ""Wanna see the new movie?"" ""Oh, is that something to eat?"" and I never know how to respond. Then I ask ""No, really, wanna see it?"" ""Haha can I eat it?"" ... then he half-apologizes by telling me its just humor and I shouldnt get rude. 

3.)Then once we skyped and I wanted to discuss a tactic for an online game event later that evening. We talked and then it was time for dinner and I told him ""ok see you later!"" and Peter responded in his normal voice ""yeah, I wont be home!"" and left the call. He didn't tell me he was going anywhere early that day. I ate dinner and then waited 2 hours (while texting him) ... he then responded ""I told you, I wouldnt be there! I felt SOOO insecure about that. I answered ""but you're always making sarcasric comments! Why didnt you tell me you wouldnt be home in the first place?"" After another hour I missed the whole event and he just texted ""Think whatever you want, I'm not in the mood for any discussions. Night.""

4.)And the last (and in my opinion) worst part. About two weeks ago he invited me to a Whatsapp group with about 100 members. The group was dedicated for trading stuff in a specific game. We were active the first days and played the game together. Then some people complained about the mass of messages in the group. One asked to open a server on discord (a more structured app where you can build own servers with multiple channels for more structure, basically) He immediatelly got backlash from the group admins. Peter then texted me privat and got all hyped by the idea of having a discord server with these people. He got me and I started building a very simple but structured server. I showed it to the admins of the Whatsapp group and got kicked out without any warning or talk. Peter joined the server (with about 70 others) In most games or community servers he is the admin or helps me however he can when I get to be the leader or admin. Then he is loyal and nice. But when he arrived on my new server that got flooded by people he just texted ""mh nah I dont really have time to help these people right now, you can do it!"" and just went offline. I got a hold of the server, added some rules and overall its a nice and cool thing now. But since Peter just left me there two weeks ago we didn't text privately. I was busy with the server and we also dont text every single day. 
I sent some messages to him ingame but got no response. Then it was easter and I decided to text him again. I wrote ""Happy Easter! Havent heard from you in a while, thats sad. Wanna play?"" and he just responded with ""Uhm... havent heard from you in a while as well? Whatever, Happy Easter!"" 

I am very active on this server constantly inviting people to join fun games or just voice chats. Currently we only have some groups between 3 and 6 people who talk. He sees what I'm doing. He HAS heard from me, right? I really need a reality check here... am i overreacting? Or is there something wrong with him? How do I deal with this? :(",16Apr2020,1

We had previous sexual conversations and they kinda died down a bit. I messaged her and we talked about sex a little bit, then told her that I bought some new toys to play with and was excited for them to come in the mail. She then took a screenshot of our conversation and told me to have some respect and that I shouldn't talk to her that way. Which I thought was very confusing and I got very flustered and I'm ashamed of the conversation to be posted in my community or on her Facebook page or any of her social media.

1005,"Get your popcorn, this will take a while. 

When I lived with my parents I always dreamt of the day I‚Äôd be able to talk to my parents about what I had gone through without bursting out in tears. That day is finally here and it‚Äôs a shitstorm 

I grew up being severely abused by my parents/siblings but especially by my mother. I can recall the day this started like it were yesterday. I woke up about my brother bullying me in school to my mom. She turned around and slapped me told me I was just jealous. 

Over the years she did so much bullshit to me. She specially fucking loved humiliating me. You know those teacher parent conferences from elementary? She would NEVER miss out on that opportunity to practice her drama/acting skills. The teacher would be talking about how amazing of a student I was and at some point, it would turn from ‚Äúyour kid is very talented‚Äù to my moms full on theater mode. ‚ÄúOh my son hit me daily, I‚Äôm being held against my will‚Äù so much bullshit. And yes, I would always hit my mother. I was TRYING to defend myself against her. And teacher would always be like ‚Äúoh from little Johnny? No that can‚Äôt be possible.., he‚Äôs amazing‚Äù slowly, you‚Äôd see the teachers reaction change from delight to utter horror. She did the exact same thing with family members. 

Teacher started noticing a pattern of abuse signs on me and called CPS on me so many times yet, every single time it was the same thing. Mother would manipulate the CPS person into thinking I had an ‚Äúoveractive imagination‚Äù and everything would go back to the way it was but worse because ‚ÄúI told them to call CPS‚Äù 

Growing up I never had a voice, I fucking mean it in every way. I had developed social anxiety, selective mutism and severe depression. When the school wouldn‚Äôt shut up to my parents to do something (they thought I was on the verge of being suicidal) they took me to a psychologist. I could‚Äôve never said anything because I always knew what would follow but every single time I setepped into that office it was horrifying. Doc would be like ‚Äúwhy are you like this?‚Äù (Mon did her show on him as well) why are you so reserved? Why are you sad? Why this? Why that? and just like that every single session was the exact same. I would burst out in tears without saying a peep. No one knew it but in my head I had monsters torturing me. It was my parents, every single thing they had done to me up tot bag point kept replaying and replaying time after time in my fucking head. No one understood why I cried. After the every session we would go home, we‚Äôd be alone and mom would be like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fucking crazy, why the fuck are you always crying? Lunatic ‚Äú 

I started slightly defending myself during sophomore year HS. I‚Äôd stand up to her and she‚Äôd always get my brother to either hold me while the other hit me or vice versa. One time in particular they knocked me out completely. I did not remember anything from that point (around 6:50am) until 4pm that same day when my teacher asked ‚Äúwhy do you have dry blood rubbing down your forehead?‚Äù 

2 years later I have epilepsy due to a ‚Äútraumatic brain injury‚Äù I kept asking around and that day was the textbook example of a TBI. I kept asking and the portion of the brain that would‚Äôve absorbed most of the impact of the blow to the head would‚Äôve been the frontal lobe, the exact portion of the brain that‚Äôs producing the seizures. 

I had enough of my parents I talked to them and my brother. My brothers reaction was, hung up, blocked me and we haven‚Äôt talked for a month. He knows I exist he just doesn‚Äôt have the balls to look me in the eyes. Ok I‚Äôm satisfied with that reaction. 

My mother on the other hand she refuses to accept ANY of the blame. She will literally put more blame (in her crazy head) to the grass outside the house rather than admit it was her. That day she broke down and burst into tears when I was talking to them. Since then it‚Äôs the exact same shit. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre supposing, you‚Äôre not sure‚Äù ‚Äúcome back come, we can get a second opinion‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôll take care of you‚Äù ‚ÄúI spoke to my mom and there‚Äôs a kid with the same thing you have, you don‚Äôt know it was me‚Äù 

My eye is twitching literally all through this. Dude holy fuck lmfao.. trust me, I‚Äôve already talked to them countless times and it‚Äôs always the same shit. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre supposing‚Äù ‚Äúcome home, we can take you to a doctor and ‚Äúfix‚Äù it‚Äù 

Lmfao dude do you fucking get it? I‚Äôm going to live my entire life with this, this CANNOT be fixed. And fuck no I ain‚Äôt guessing jack shit. This is coming from a neurologist. But what absolutely fucks me up the most by far is that in my mother‚Äôs book she‚Äôs the victim in all of this ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just trying to hurt me‚Äù ‚Äúpretend tears‚Äù bruh do you fucking know how much I suffered under your house? skfjekkfkfkf

I have zero interest in keeping them around. All I want now to have closure is, 

1. Do the exact same shit she did to me. She had everyone thinking I was the abusive one. I want to tell from the rooftop that it was HER who caused this. I want to make her feel like she did to me, hopeless and immense immense emotional pain. I want everyone to know the type of person she is. Behind closed doors she‚Äôs one person, once family is over she‚Äôs ‚Äúhahaha‚Äù with that stupid fake laugh and all friendly 

2. I want my father to accept the roll he had in all of this.

Did you ducking do anything about it other than use your mouth to take yourself out of the equation??

So we came up with this idea of making slides to assure her parents that this will be a safe trip. A break down of what we are going to do, emphasising that we won't have sex, stating how safe Japan is, etc etc really just to assure them that this is going to be a wholesome trip and that we will try our best to stay safe in Japan and stuff. I think that's their main concern, they don't want dangerous things to happen and premarital sex. Also, I don't think the virus will be a concern by then, but if it is, the airline will allow for refunds.

Current situation is we are in a lockdown, so I had the idea of presenting through video call while my girl and her parents will be on the side. Also, she will be doing the presentation with me. But is this even a good idea? Is it too soon to ask again? Should I be there in person instead of video call? One reason I actually prefer video is that I don't wanna come off too strong to her dad. I want him to feel safe that he can trust me and his daughter.

But if presenting in person is the better way to do it, when should I do it? Going to her house now is technically illegal but nobody will catch us really. I don't really wanna wait till the lockdown is over because of personal preferences, I just like to know the answer as fast as possible I Guess. But honestly, if you guys think waiting a few more weeks to a few more months will increase my chances drastically, I'll do it.

Please advice on what to do, thank you!",16Apr2020,5
1007,"21/f I applied to 2 schools to transfer from my community College to a university but I didn't get in 1 of them and the other I got waitlisted. I have a really bad feeling I'm not going to get in. 
I haven't told my family about anything yet. I feel like I'll break down crying before even getting a word in. Even writing this now I cant hold in my tears.
How do go about this? And what am I supposed to do now?",16Apr2020,1
1008,"hi,

so i don‚Äôt know what to do, but my younger brother keeps on waking up in the middle of the night with a mouth full of blood. 

the internet says it could be from blisters, cuts, teeth or trauma, but i checked his mouth and he has no cuts in his mouth and the source of the blood was not from a tooth or his nose and he hasn‚Äôt undergone any trauma to the mouth, obviously. 

i have no idea where it came from and why it keeps happening. does anyone have any idea what it could be  and what i should do?",16Apr2020,2
1009,"I live in a house with multiple people. One of the people in the house has problems with her mentally unstable ex, she was going away to self isolate. 
It was around midday when I was waiting for the postman, as soon as I was visible through the doors window the doorbell started ringing. Normal. Then the person behind the door started banging on the door and pressing the doorbell more aggressively, I went back to my room thinking it was one of the friends of the people living in the house. Now, this mad lad went and opened the door telling the guy to fuck off and went back inside.
I was looking at the scene through my window and the man was so drunk he could barely walk. 
I saw him going towards my car, naturally I thought he was going to break it with his stick, but insted he broke the windows of the house. I wasent able to see the window being smashed but I could hear it and it was horrifying. We called the police and they managed to get him.
He was the ex of the person I mentioned (that went to self isolate). No, he was not the postman.
I have experience with people like that.
Once when I was 4-7 a friend of a person living in the house got arrested and he broke out of the car and came back to the house olny me and my friend were in, naturally I'm worried he'll break out and come back while everyone is asleep.

Its olny been a couple hours after that incident and I'm in my bed rn at 1am scared. Help, what can I do to overcome my fear of people breaking into my house?",16Apr2020,1
1010,"All of my friends have been mean/backstabbers to me. One dated my bully, and they still include him in our activities. One is REALLY homophobic and yells slurs at me, and said friend started dating one of our friends. They‚Äôve been real bad friends, but I like the memories we made together. But I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that since they took sides with the bully, maybe they don‚Äôt like me that much. I don‚Äôt feel appreciated. I love them, but sometimes I think I‚Äôm a burden to them. I once talked to them about how this is bothering me, but it didn‚Äôt do anything. I‚Äôm afraid if I bring it again, they might think I‚Äôm annoying. I honestly don‚Äôt know how to get the feeling of being friends back. Is there even a solution to all of this? Besides, being over quarantine doesn‚Äôt help.

1012,"Hello.

Due to COVID-19 we are separated. Fair enough, everyone else is too!

We are fine with this. We met at University and spent every day together, we slept together often (never had sex, surprisingly!) But she is Muslim. She has very strict parents who don't let her date ""white men"" and ""non-Muslim men"". Both of which apply in my situation.

Me and her couldn't care less about each others religious preferences. In fact, we are both quite spiritual and engage in a lot of interesting conversations about religion and life...

It's nice to have someone with whom you connect in such a deep level.

Nonetheless, we keep talking about how to meet after COVID-19. We live on opposite ends of the country, 350 miles away, and she lives in the capital (London). Now here is where the problems arise.

At University it was easy, since parents had little control...

Now it's harder. She will have to justify going away. She says meeting me during the day is fine, but she won't be able to sleep over. She cries every day and night cause she wants to be able to come visit me and sleep with me but she can't. 

I'm trying to figure out different solutions...

She's very afraid of lying, of going through different excuses, etc.

What I'm asking is for advice on: how to meet (London is very expensive!) And how to successfully get her to lie and stress out less. I want her to not be nervous about our relationship and be able to cope, I hate seeing her upset.

When I say ""well, what can we do? Do you want some time apart, do you want to give our relationship some thought, do you want to break up maybe?"" She cries and says no. And I understand that. I've been with multiple girls and I don't think I've ever loved someone this much...

And she loves me too. And it's absolutely wonderful, but she constantly has to hide her phone, we can only facetime when she goes on walks, we can only facetime late at night, her parents are always curious about why she's on her phone and stuff, and she always gets questioned about things. It's really damaging for our relationship. So the relationship is quite troublesome, even though we have a lot of love, we never argue, it's just a hard situation with a lot of sacrifice and obstacles on the way.

So yeah, any advice on how to cope, for both parties, including stressing out less and all would be deeply appreciated.

No breakup or therapy advice please. If we had the money for that we would.",16Apr2020,1
